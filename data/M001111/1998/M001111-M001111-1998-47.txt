 President, I rise today to mention a few topics vital to the educational success and safety of American children.  Mr. President, last week we saw some real success for American families and students. The Higher Education Reauthorization Act made several improvements that can benefit from more attention; this bill is a major victory for students and teachers across America. My daughter enters college this fall. I now get to experience first-hand the challenges of entering higher education that millions of families each year, and our actions last week were helpful.  Throughout the Labor Committee's efforts on this bill, I worked to strengthen our Nation's commitment to providing the strongest training possible for K-12 school teachers. I am most pleased with the bill's focus on teacher training, and in particular its emphasis on technology training.  The bill's provisions concerning student loans will make the dream of higher education that much closer to reality for many potential American college students. The campus safety and child care provisions will make a difference in all our communities.  I specifically thank Senator Wellstone for his work on the TANF amendment, so important for literacy instruction and lifelong learning. Since our debate on the welfare reform bill in 1996, I have worked with former Senator Simon, Senator Wellstone, and other Senators to point out the vital importance of education and literacy to a person's success in getting off of welfare. The passage of the Wellstone amendment is the right thing to do for low-income working Americans.  Under the Higher Education Reauthorization Act, I believe that the first generation of the new millennium will benefit immensely from the efforts put forth over this past year. From increases in financial aid, to campus security improvements, to technology instruction, S. 1882 will stand as a proud hallmark of this Congress.  Mr. President, on other education topics, we still have some large challenges ahead. The House Appropriations Committee is set to have full Committee mark-up of education appropriations this week. The Labor Subcommittee has cut education funding from the President's proposed levels by $2 billion in discretionary spending, and ignored his proposals to improve school construction and class size reduction. This would be the week for House members to eliminate these egregious cuts.  Let me list a few things the House has put at risk through cuts or eliminations: improving children's literacy; opening school buildings up after hours to make them the hub of the community; getting extra help in reading and math to poor-achieving students; improving education technology, including technology teacher training; getting first-generation students ready for college; and many others. The House has ignored the priorities of the American people.  The American people care deeply about education. They are frustrated when their schools do not succeed, and they bristle at those who would make it harder for the schools to succeed. This is not about just bricks and mortar, or about throwing good money after bad. This is about priorities, common-sense solutions, and improving quality.  Do not try to fool the parents. The parents know that school improvement has a cost--in hard decisions, and in hard cash. They know that when Congress offers vouchers and expanded charter schools and bonuses for private schools and private businesses--theCongress is turning its back on the public school.  They know that a cut is a cut, and that a block grant leads to a cut. They know that nearly the entire discussion this year on education from the other side of the aisle--and a time or two on this side of the aisle--amounts to the empty words of a snake-oil salesman.  Well, now we have a chance to turn this all around, like the public has forced the Congress to do in years past. Congress cuts the funding for schools, the public groans in disbelief, and the Congress wises up. Let us not wait until September to do it. The House has a chance this week to put back the money they've taken. The Senate will have its chance soon.  In America, you turn your back on the public school at your peril. What we need to do instead is meet the hard challenges head on.  The schools, in the inner cities, and in the rural areas, are crumbling. The Congress can do something about it.  The classes are overcrowded, which adds to the school construction problem. The Congress can take action.  The budgets have been cut and cut, and failing a local levy can mean disaster for a school. The Congress can keep its hands off the school budget, and restore these House cuts.  The Congress can increase national expenditures to more than the meager 2 percent of the national budget it now sets aside for schools. And the Congress can set the right tone.  Rather than generating empty air that has the effect of chipping away at support for the local public school--the very foundation of democracy, citizenship, and community in this nation--the Congress can speak the words that need to be said.  The responsibility of serving as a member of Congress, as a member of the United States Senate, is weighty indeed. By our words, our signature, and our actions, we can take steps to improve our nation's schools and our student's futures.  We can set an important tone, and say the hard things that the students, families, teachers, school officials, community leaders and others need to hear. We can also talk of success.  But if we act and speak only to tear the fabric of support for the public school--if the tone we set is only to chip, chip, chip at public confidence in an institution they know personally to have value--then we are abdicating part of our great responsibility as Senators.  Americans know that members of Congress can work together, and achieve results. They know we could take actions to improve their public schools. And that is why it is so disheartening to me when Republicans or Democrats put ideology or politics or mean-spiritedness in the way of success for our students. We must act together to do what is in the best interest of all children.  It is also important Mr. President that we conduct background checks and adequately screen our teachers to make sure they are qualified, competent and capable of providing our children with the quality education they deserve.                          ____________________
