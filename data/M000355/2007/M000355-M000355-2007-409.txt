 President, I said earlier this week that Republicans would not allow themselves to be stuffed on this bill. The Senate isn't a factory. We don't push things down the line. But one has to wonder whether the Democratic majority has been told otherwise based on the number of times it has moved to stifle debate on important legislation over the last 5 months.  Let's look at the last Congress. On this date in the 109th Congress, Republicans had sought to limit debate only nine times. On this date in the Congress before that, Republicans had filed for cloture nine times. On this date in the Congress before that, Republicans had filed for cloture only two times.  Contrast that with the current regime. To date in this Congress, the Democratic leadership has sought to cut off debate not two times, not nine times, but 32 times.  This is what is called a power grab. But the result won't be power, it will be failure. At this rate, the Democratic leadership will have achieved at least one impressive thing--just one--in the 110th Congress: an all-time record for cloture filings because it is well on pace to shatter the existing record.  There is a saying about courtship: Shoot for two, end up with zero. So far, this would be a fitting epitaph for a Congress that has sought to do much but has accomplished little.  Republican patience was wearing thin before we took up this bill, and we said so, repeatedly. The Democratic leadership knew on a bill of this magnitude, Republicans would do more than complain about it. We would insist that minority rights be honored. They weren't. For this reason I will oppose cloture on the bill and encourage my colleagues to do the same.  Democrats and Republicans have said from the outset that this bill would only pass if it was a bipartisan effort. Once it hit the floor, that meant minority Members would have the chance to be heard through a fair and full amendment process. That is the way to fix this bill.
