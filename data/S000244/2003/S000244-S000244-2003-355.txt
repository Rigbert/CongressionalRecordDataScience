Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion.  Mr. Speaker, the motion to recommit guts the entire bill by preventing the dismissal of pending lawsuits. Much of the harm this bill addresses is caused by pending lawsuits.  The Supreme Court has held that Congress can require that pending lawsuits can be dismissed if it is pursuant to a national economic policy. A bill that aims to save the national firearms industry from bankruptcy due to pending lawsuits is an enactment pursuant to a national economic policy. Certainly saving an industry from bankruptcy that is essential to preserving a constitutionally protected right to bear arms under Congress's Commerce Clause authority is constitutional. If this motion to recommit passes, all that would happen is that hundreds of additional cases would be filed right before the date of enactment. This motion to recommit would therefore make the current situation much worse and further endanger all of our fundamental rights to bear arms. I urge a ``no'' vote on the motion to recommit.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the motion.  The previous question was ordered.
