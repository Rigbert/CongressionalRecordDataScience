 I don't disagree with anything the majority leader said, but I would like to bring these facts out about judicial vacancies.  There are 83 judicial vacancies, and some of those are emergencies. And in the case of the total of 83 vacancies, the President has only sent up 44 nominees for those 83 vacancies. So I want to make it very clear--and it is something that is quite obvious--that the U.S. Senate or any of its leaders can't be expected to act upon vacancies where the President hasn't submitted nominees.  I think it is intended to make Republicans look bad when they use those vacancies as a statistic without making it clear that the President of the United States is the one who is dragging his feet as far as filling those vacancies.  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 25 minutes as if in morning business.
