Con. Res. 2       Whereas the Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia      are undergoing an historic process of democratic and free      market transformation after emerging from decades of brutal      Soviet occupation;       Whereas each of the Baltic states has conducted peaceful      transfers of political power--in Lithuania since 1990 and in      Latvia and Estonia since 1991;       Whereas each of the Baltic states has been exemplary and      consistent in its respect for human rights and civil      liberties;       Whereas the governments of the Baltic states have made      consistent progress toward establishing civilian control of      their militaries through active participation in the      Partnership for Peace program and North Atlantic Treaty      Organization (NATO) peace support operations;       Whereas Lithuania is participating in the NATO-led      multinational military force in the Republic of Bosnia and      Herzegovina (commonly referred to as ``SFOR'') and is      consistently increasing its defense budget allocations with      the goal of allocating at least 2 percent of its GDP for      defense by 2001;       Whereas each of the Baltic states has clearly demonstrated      its ability to operate with the military forces of NATO      nations and under NATO standards;       Whereas former Secretary of Defense Perry stipulated five      generalized standards for entrance into NATO: support for      democracy, including toleration of ethnic diversity and      respect for human rights; building a free market economy;      civilian control of the military; promotion of good      neighborly relations; and development of military      interoperability with NATO; and       Whereas each of the Baltic states has satisfied these      standards for entrance into NATO: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives      concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--       (1) Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia are to be commended for      their progress toward political and economic liberty and      meeting the guidelines for prospective members of the North      Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) set out in chapter 5 of      the September 1995 Study on NATO Enlargement;       (2) Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia would make an      outstanding contribution toward furthering the goals of NATO      should they become members;       (3) extension of full NATO membership to the Baltic states      would contribute to stability, freedom, and peace in the      Baltic region and Europe as a whole; and       (4) with complete satisfaction of NATO guidelines and      criteria for membership, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia      should be invited to become full members of NATO.
