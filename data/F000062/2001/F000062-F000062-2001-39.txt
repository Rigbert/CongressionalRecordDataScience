 President, I rise today to introduce legislation regarding the testing, development, and possible deployment of a National Missile Defense system. This legislation is cosponsored by Senators Wyden, Feingold, Corzine, Harkin, and Leahy.  I share the concern of many of my colleagues that, in the aftermath of the horrific events of September 11, this is not the appropriate time or place for a divisive debate on the Senate floor on missile defense.  That is why I did not offer this legislation as an amendment on the Defense authorization bill, do not intend to offer it as an amendment on other legislation before the Senate at this time, and do not intend to push this legislation for a vote at this point in time. This is not the time for Senate consideration of this legislation or for a divisive debate on this issue.  But I also believe that it is critical that at the appropriate time, and in the appropriate way, a full public and congressional debate on missile defense must occur. It is simply too an important a decision, and too important an issue, to be treated in any other way.  Indeed, National Missile Defense is one of the most serious foreign policy and national security issue that we will face in the coming decades. The administration's decisions on this issue should be made deliberately, in consultation with our allies, and, most importantly, in consultation with the United States Congress.  As one Senator, I myself have spent considerable time over the past several years in meetings, briefings, and discussions on this issue. Earlier this year I had the opportunity to discuss missile defense issues at length with former Secretary Perry.  He suggested to me that the proliferation of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons of mass destruction, and the increasing availability to other nations as well as transnational groups such as terrorist organizations, of the technology and material necessary to develop and deliver WMD is perhaps the most serious threat to U.S. national security today.  Secretary Perry went on to argue, however, that National Missile Defense is not and should not be seen as a one-size-fits-all substitute for an effective non-proliferation strategy, and that the United States must have a balanced program to effectively safeguard our interests. This includes effective strategies for the prevention of proliferation, deterrence, homeland defense, and counter-proliferation, and clearly calibrating and allocating resources to meet the real challenges that face U.S. national security interests.  I believe that the approach suggested by Secretary Perry makes a good deal of sense.  Based on this approach, I believe that it is therefore important for Congress to ask a number of questions with regard to NMD. Questions such as:  Would missile defense have helped to prevent the events of September 11?  Are there more immediate security needs, such as homeland defense, which demand priority on our scarce national defense and national security resources?  Is NMD an appropriate to serve as the central axle around which U.S. national security rotates, given the nature of the threats we now face?  Would unilateral U.S. withdrawal from the ABM Treaty hurt U.S. efforts to get international cooperation in the battle against terrorism?  Will acquiring NMD make the United States, and the world, safer and more secure? Or will unilateral U.S. development and deployment of NMD, and unilateral violation, abrogation, or withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, make us less safe and secure?  I am also concerned that with what appears to be a rush toward construction at Fort Greely, AK, the administration has already made a decision on deployment, without having yet answered these bottom line questions.  The legislation that I and my colleagues introduce today seeks to address these questions, and to suggest that the balanced approach suggested by Secretary Perry to safeguarding the United States from the threat of WMD attack might be a wiser policy for Congress to consider, rather than merely rubber-stamping the administration's missile defense policy.  This legislation would: express the Sense of the Senate that U.S. research and development of missile defense remain consistent with the ABM treaty, that the U.S. should pursue good faith negotiations with Russia to make such modifications to the ABM as may be necessary, but that the U.S. should not unilaterally opt-out of the treaty and not deploy a missile defense system that has not met the basic research, testing, and evaluation standards to prove its operational effectiveness.  Place a limitation on funding available for missile defense testing, evaluation, or deployment that would unilaterally abrogate or violate the ABM treaty.  Call on the Secretary of State to report to Congress, if a decision on deployment is made, regarding the nature of the threat that triggered the deployment decision and the likely impact that the deployment decision will have on U.S. national security interests.  Call on the Secretary of Defense to report to Congress, if a decision on deployment is made, on the operational effectiveness of the missile defense system.  Call on the President to make an annual report to Congress on the nature of the WMD threat faced by the U.S. and its allies, evaluate the threat posed by different means of delivery, ranging from ballistic missiles to suitcase bombs, provide an estimation for the total cost of development and deployment of missile defense, and make a determination whether missile defense spending adversely impacts other priority national security programs of the Department of Defense.  I have previously stated that my concerns about NMD revolve largely around four issues: The nature of the threat; the implications for arms control and the international security environment; the feasibility of the technology; and the cost. I would like to address each of these in turn.  The bottom line of these concerns is simply this: Will a unilateralist missile defense deployment decision become the basis for a new arms race, leading to a world with more ballistic missiles and WMD pointed at the United States, not less? Would the United States be more secure, or less?  We also must ask where does the long range missile threat to the U.S. stand?  Russia for all its problems, remains the only nation possessing enough Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles, ICBMs, and submarine launched ballistic missiles, SLBMs, to overwhelm the proposed U.S. defensive umbrella. China has only a small number of ICBMs. No other nation has operational ICBMs and only two, France and the United Kingdom, have SLBMs.  Other countries, such as North Korea, Iran, Iraq, do not today have ballistic missile capabilities that are a threat to the United States. We should not act in ways to encourage them to develop these capabilities or, just as troubling, to develop alternate means to attack the United States which NMD is powerless to counter.  Looking ahead, however, George Tenet, Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, testified before Congress last year that ``over the next 15 years, our cities will face ballistic missile threats from a variety of actors.'' He pointed to North Korea which, he said, could further develop its Taepo Dong 2 missile, noting that it ``might be capable of delivering a nuclear payload to the United States.''  Other nations which have or are pursuing ballistic missile programs include Iran and Iraq. Neither of these countries have succeeded in developing ballistic missile capabilities, however, and unless they make a concerted effort to do so, neither appears likely to develop capabilities within the next 10 years.  As we consider U.S. missile defense policy, I believe it is a fair question to ask what sort of developments in the international security environment might lead them, or others, to make that sort of concerted effort?  As the past two weeks have too well illustrated, the world is not a static place. International security relationships are fluid and dynamic. The United States today is the world's sole superpower, and although that gives us great strategic flexibility and maneuverability, it would be naive for us to believe that other nations and transnational groups do not and will not react to the strategic choices the United States makes, and how they perceive those choices affecting their own interests.  In other words, how might the rest of the world react to a unilateral U.S. decision to deploy NMD? What would other countries do to protect what they perceive as their national security interests in the face of a U.S. NMD?  The National Intelligence Estimate prepared last year, ``Foreign Responses to U.S. National Missile Deployment,'' suggests that in reaction to U.S. NMD deployment:  Russia could opt to deploy shorter-range missiles along its borders and resume adding multiple warheads to its ballistic missiles.  China would most likely seek to deploy additional missiles with MIRVed warheads if the U.S. went ahead with NMD. This would mean that China may attempt a strategy of ``breaking out,'' giving them the capability to ``overwhelm'' a U.S. NMD system.  North Korea could resume its missile flight test program and cooperate with other countries, such as Iran or Iraq, in helping them develop missile capabilities.  Iran and Iraq might well redouble their efforts to develop their own missile programs, including decoys and countermeasures that would allow them to bypass a U.S. missile shield.  The NIE report also concluded that if China sought to deploy additional missiles and warheads in response to NMD, this might prompt India to respond by building up its own nuclear arsenals and missile arsenal, which would in turn prompt Pakistan to seek to develop additional nuclear weapons and advanced missiles, unleashing a South Asian nuclear arms race.  I do not believe I need to comment further, given recent events, just how dangerous that would be.  Such a destabilized environment, with Russia, China, North Korea, India, Pakistan, Iran, Iraq, and possibly others adding to their nuclear arsenals or missile capabilities does not strike me as a more stable world, or one in which the U.S. is more secure from the threat of WMD or missile attack.  In addition, many analysts believe that if the United States were to go ahead with NMD, rogue states and terrorists groups would simply shift their focus from developing missile technology to delivering weapons of mass destruction by ship, plane, or cruise missile, methods that are both more reliable, provide no ``return address,'' and can't be countered by NMD.  I do not even want to contemplate what September 11 would have been like had one or more of those hijacked planes contained even a small, primitive, ``dirty'' nuclear device.  The second issue I would like to address today is the implication of a rush to deploy NMD for the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.  Today the ABM Treaty is the keystone of a number of interlinked nuclear arms control agreements, including the START I and START II treaties with Russia. Although the ABM Treaty may require some modifications to take into account the realities of the new security environment, and this legislation urges the Administration to pursue such negotiations, to just cast it aside risks undermining the very foundations of strategic stability and U.S. national security.  The United States has long been at the forefront of the international community in trying to inculcate respect for international law and treaty obligations.  In fact, one of the ways in which the United States identifies so-called rogue states is that these are states that do not respect their obligations to other members of the international community; states who walk away from, ignore, or cheat on their treaty obligations.  And so it is deeply troubling to me that the United States may now be telling the rest of the world, through its own actions, that it is accepted behavior to break your treaty obligations.  Indeed, with this approach I am particularly concerned that the United States may, in fact, be sending precisely the wrong message on international arms control to China: That only the weak must respect other nations and international law. If you are strong enough, you can do as you please.  If the United States seeks to unilaterally abrogate the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, and in general treat international treaty commitments as mere pieces of paper to be disregarded if they prove inconvenient, how can we expect to hold China accountable to live up to its international agreements, or to the commitment it has made to the Missile Technology Control Regime?  As reported in the press accounts earlier this summer, the Department of Defense ABM Compliance Review Group, the Pentagon lawyers tasked to identify potential ABM Treaty issues raised by the testing schedule, have determined that some elements of the administration's plan for developing missile defenses may conflict with the ABM Treaty by 2002.  Indeed, a July 30, 2001 letter from Undersecretary Paul Wolfowitz to me stated that the ``Department has neither designed the missile defense program to intentionally impact the ABM treaty sooner rather than later, nor have we designed it to avoid the treaty.'' That is good as far as it goes. But is also avoids the real question:  Has the Department of Defense made an effort to develop a missile defense testing program which is, by intent, consistent with the ABM? So long as the treaty is in force and is the supreme law of the land that seems to me to be a reasonable requirement.  Moreover, as Philip Coyle, the former director of Operational Test and Evaluation at the Pentagon, wrote in a recent issue of The Defense Monitor, the ABM treaty ``is not holding back the design and development of the technology needed for National Missile Defense, NMD, nor is the treaty slowing the tests of an NMD system. Development of NMD will take a decade ormore for technical and budgetary reasons, but not due to the impediments caused by the ABM treaty.''  In other words, the United States can continue with an aggressive NMD development and testing program for the foreseeable future, should the Administration and Congress choose to, without the need to abandon the ABM.  I do not believe that arms control treaties and agreements are a panacea that, by themselves, secure U.S. national security interests or those of our friends and allies.  But surely the constraints that these treaties and agreements impose can play a valuable role in constricting the development of weapons of mass destruction and their proliferation around the globe.  They are a useful tool in a fully articulated foreign policy and national security toolbox, and it is short-sighted, to say the least, to throw the tool out. Especially if one does not replace it with something of equal or greater value.  Although the technical challenges of developing missile defense technology are great, I believe that the United States, if we choose to pursue it, is equal to the task.  But that we can develop a missile defense system should not be confused by anyone to mean that we have the capabilities now, or will possess them, even with an aggressive testing and development program, anytime soon.  Effective missile defense is an enormous technical challenge. Commonly compared to ``hitting a bullet with a bullet,'' missile defense requires interceptors to find and hit the warheads of long-range missiles traveling at speeds of 15,000 mph or more. Although two of the four tests thus far have failed, and serious questions have been raised about the degree of success of the other two, these tests have indicated that it may indeed be possible to ``hit a bullet with a bullet.''  But it is still far from clear if it can be done reliably in a real-world setting, where decoys and countermeasures will complicate the system's ability to determine what targets need to be hit. A global system of satellites, radars, communications relays, booster rockets and interceptors all must work with each other almost perfectly for the defense to have a chance of success.  There are also concerns, first raised by the November 1999 Welch Report, that political pressure to deploy a system regardless of whether the science works or not may lead to a ``rush to failure.'' However, it must be a scientific determination, not a political determination, that decides how far and how fast we go forward with missile defense.  If the United States goes forward with development and deployment of a missile defense system, it must be one that is fully tested and deemed operationally effective in a real world setting. Anything less would be an invitation to disaster.  My final concern about missile defense relates to the potential costs of development and deployment.  As Congress considers this issue it is critical that it is able to clearly prioritize missile defense programs and spending, within the context of our larger national security needs. Funds that are spent on national missile defense are, in effect, funds that can not be spent on other priority programs, such as homeland defense. I do not propose that the United States spends all on one or the other. Rather, Congress must play a responsible role in making sure that sufficient funds are available to meet the threats to national security that exist today, while planning prudently for threats that will emerge tomorrow.  To allocate a disproportionate share of defense spending on a threat that does not exist at all, or which will not be real until much further off in the future creates a very real risk to those programs that need to be funded today. This means that immediate and concrete threats we face today may not be addressed with potentially disastrous results.  There has never been a consensus cost figure for deploying an NMD system. For several years, the Clinton administration estimated that a limited NMD system would cost $9 to $11 billion to develop, test, and deploy. In January 1999, the administration estimated that an initial system of 20 interceptors would cost about $10.6 billion. In February 2000, the administration provided a ``life-cycle'' cost estimate of $26.6 billion for an initial system of 100 ground-based interceptors in Alaska.  An April 2000 study by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), however, estimated that it would cost about $29.5 billion to develop, build, and operate an initial NMD system through 2015. CBO estimates it will cost another $19 billion through 2015 to expand the initial system of 100 interceptors and build what was called a Capability 2 and Capability 3 system designed for greater numbers of more sophisticated potential missile threats. According to CBO, additional space-based sensors would bring the total costs for NMD to around $60 billion through 2015.  Several reports issued by outside groups, however, suggest that the real costs of missile defense deployment could be much higher, perhaps as $300 billion if such elements as space-based and naval-based NMD interceptors are included.  Trying to put a price tag on missile defense costs is all the more difficult at present because the current administration has not yet determined what sort of missile defense architecture they want to develop. Put simply, they have asked for the credit card to go to the store, but have not told us if they will be buying jeans or a tuxedo, or anything in between.  The question of cost should not be a determining factor in and of itself. If the international security environment demands development and deployment of missile defenses, the U.S. must go forward regardless of the cost.  But as Congress considers the elements of U.S. national security strategy in the years ahead, it must do so mindful that devoting resources to one area likely means depriving them from another. We must be careful, therefore, to make sure that our national security needs are properly prioritized. To move forward with missile defense, if it is not at the top of the list or immediately needed, and in so doing place in jeopardy other higher and more immediate needs and priorities, such as homeland defense, risks creating an unbalanced and ineffective national security strategy.  The administration's current plans, of what we know about them, seem to suggest that the United States will abandon the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty before we even know if the deployment of NMD is even feasible. And that it would abandon the ABM in pursuit of what can only be considered ``unbalanced'' national security strategy, one that places too much weight on the development of missile defense, and too little on the other areas, such as prevention, intelligence, rollback, and management, that are equally, or more, important.  The United States must respond to new threats, and defenses can play an important role. But the question is not whether we deploy defenses, as missile defense advocates like to paint it, but what, when, and, most importantly, how.  As I stated earlier, the threat of the proliferation of WMD is real and growing, and how the United States manages this threat should be an overriding security priority. Management requires a comprehensive approach that strikes the right balance between prevention, deterrence, and defense, and the emphasis placed on missile defense must be balanced against other national security priorities. An effective WMD national security strategy must emphasize:  Prevention, through preventive defense and preventive diplomacy, including export controls, regional security commitments, on-going threat reduction programs, and arms control regimes;  Intelligence, including those efforts that show promise for penetrating transnational and terrorist groups that may be planning attacks against the United States or our allies and that illuminate the nature of the proliferation threat;  Rollback of WMD and missile programs that have been developed by other countries, such as the intense diplomacy such as has met with some success on the Korean Peninsula, and a mixture of economic and political incentives; and,  Management of the consequences of proliferation by better protecting our forces, holding open the possibility of pre-emption, and active defenses.  And our defensive programs must also recognize that as the horrific events of September 11 too well illustrated, missile defense is a response to but one of the WMD threats that the United States faces in today's world--and perhaps the least of these threats at that.  Indeed, a breakdown of the ``threat spectrum'' produced by the Joint Chiefs of Staff earlier this year lists a missile attack as having the lowest ``probability of occurrence'' in the threat spectrum.  In fact, as a member of the Senate Committee on Intelligence, I have had an opportunity to discuss WMD threat assessments with members of our intelligence community. Although the threat of a ballistic missile attack from a rogue nation is certainly a concern, they are far more concerned about the threat that a ``suitcase'' bomb or a bomb hidden on a ship may pose. Needless to say, NMD does nothing to address these threats.  A balanced approach to national security therefore suggests that it is only prudent for the United States to conduct a limited testing program to develop missile defense technology so that if, at some point in the future, it is necessary we will have appropriate options. And yes, the ABM Treaty may need to be modified or amended to enable us to respond to new threats.  But it would be folly to place too much of an emphasis on missile defense, to simply and unilaterally develop and deploy NMD, and to abandon the treaty, before we even know what defensive systems are feasible, which systems best meet our needs, and well before any sensible development or testing program needs to bump up to treaty limits.  The unilateral U.S. pursuit of NMD is likely to create a less stable world, with more nations pursuing weapons of mass destruction, and without the constraints of international arms control agreement.  It strikes me as a big gamble to develop a national security strategy on one hand which seems intent on cultivating a missile defense system of unknown effectiveness, and a less stable and less secure world on the other.  I look forward to the opportunity to debate these issues on the floor with my colleagues at an appropriate time.                                 ______                                       By
