President, let me preface my remarks by saying a word of tribute to the Senator from Utah. I hope he doesn't leave the floor because this may be historic, but I thank him personally for his support of this SCHIP bill through the years. I know it has not always been easy. Sometimes he has been a lone voice. And though we may disagree about one aspect or another, I greatly admire the fact that he has stood up and supported this. I hope at the end of the day he will continue to because bipartisan support for this program is very important. I salute him.
