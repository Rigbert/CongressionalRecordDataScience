I want to say to my friend who has just spoken, the ranking member of the committee who chaired the committee, who said they wanted to pay for things, what this bill does is put statutory PAYGO into law. He's right. But what he didn't say to you is when their side controlled the Presidency, the House, and the Senate, they jettisoned paying for things. They did away with statutory PAYGO, they did away with PAYGO generally, and what happened? We went from substantial surpluses under the Clinton administration to substantial deficits under the Bush administration.  Now we were told those substantial deficits and deficits that were being created would create economic growth in our country. In point of fact, however, after 8 years of that economic policy where they jettisoned PAYGO, a PAYGO which provided $5.6 trillion of surplus available in March 2001, according to President Bush; but they abandoned PAYGO, which is in this bill.  This is not a question of payoff to anybody. This was in the President's budget when he sent it down here earlier this year. It was in our budget that passed the House and the Senate. We said we were going to do this. Why? Because it's the right thing to do. Today, we have the chance to vote for health care our seniors can count on and a fiscal future for all Americans that they can have faith in.  Very frankly, my friend also said, We on the Republican side want to fix this. My question is simply: Why didn't you? Why do we still have this issue that confronts us year after year after year because we didn't have the courage to face it? I'm going to talk about the deficit, because this adds to the deficit. I will lament that, but there is not an option, as you added to the deficit every time you fixed it one year at a time. Doctors couldn't rely on it. More importantly, seniors couldn't rely on the fact that their doctors wouldn't have a big cut and push them out. I'm going to talk about that as well. We can do it by stopping a massive Medicare payment cut and by committing future policies to the tested principle of pay-as-you-go.  Now my friends on the other side of the aisle don't like pay-as-you-go because it constrained them in cutting revenues over a trillion dollars, which is one of the reasons we have such a large deficit, because they didn't pay for what they bought. Interestingly enough, my friends, they bought at a rate twice the growth in spending that occurred during the 1990s, in the 2000s, which was about 3\1/2\ percent per year. It was 7 percent a year when my friends on the other side of the aisle controlled all of the levers of power. So they decreased revenue and increased spending, and we had large deficits and the biggest recession we have faced since the 1930s were inherited by this administration and, frankly, by this Congress.  Now going back to the pay-as-you-go. First, the Medicare payment rate cut, if we do nothing, payments to doctors treating Medicare patients will drop by 21 percent in the new year with more cuts in the years to come. If we allow that to take place, many seniors will find their doctors no longer available to treat them.  So this is not only about compensating doctors for the services that are vitally important and we want them to give, but it is also protecting seniors' access to doctors. That will mean less access to health care, longer waiting lists, and serious conditions going untreated and.  In sum, if we do not act on this bill, it will mean sicker seniors. That's why it's essential that we stop these cuts before they're allowed to take effect. The cuts, of course, will occur on January 1 of this year, approximately 1 month from today.  It is important to remember that this bill would simply prevent cuts, not increase payments to doctors. But it is true that ensuring our seniors' access to their doctors will add to our deficit, just as extending any of the Bush tax cuts that are set to expire next year would do. Because seniors' health is at stake in this bill, I believe that stopping these payment cuts is worth the cost.  It's also worth pointing out that this bill represents a new honesty in budgeting. As far as Democrats are concerned, the days of pretending that the costs of the ``doctor fix'' will be made up by even deeper cuts next year are over. That, of course, is a policy we followed in the first 8 years of this decade. We pretended that somehow we'dfix it later, and we never did. Indeed, most of the costs associated with this bill are the result of stopping the gimmicks that were used for years and cleaning up the mess created by those gimmicks. The first step to getting out of debt is being honest about the debt we're in. It is too deep, it is dangerous, and we need to address it.  So let's be honest. Our country is in a deep fiscal hole for reasons that go far beyond Medicare payments. In fact, there's no one reason for our record national debt. It's bipartisan in nature, not exclusively Republican or Democrat.  The causes include the previous administration's debt financed tax cuts, which I've spoken of, for America's essentially wealthier citizens who got most of the tax cuts; the cost of two wars, which we did not pay for; our escalating entitlements programs, which all of us have supported; the recession that we have confronted and that started in the seventh year of the previous administration's term; and the deficit spending--and we need to clean up that economic mess; spending that economists tell us is necessary to stimulate demand and recession.  In other words, we needed to spend the money to preclude a depression, not just a deep recession that we're in, and almost every economist, including Marty Feldstein, said that that was necessary.  A recent New York Times analysis tells us that 90 percent of our deficit has been brought about by the policies of the previous administration and the extension of its policies and the economic crisis that it left behind.                              {time}  1400  No one step will get us out of our fiscal hole, but the most important immediate step we can take is to commit ourselves to the principle that in new policies of our country, we will pay for what we buy. That is the principle of pay-as-you-go, or PAYGO, which was in place in the 1990s as we went from deep debt into surplus and that $5.6 trillion surplus that President Bush inherited in 2001. In the 1990s, President Clinton used it to turn huge deficits into a record surplus, and when President Bush abandoned PAYGO, and my friends on the other side of the aisle abandoned PAYGO, record deficits returned.  When Democrats took back the House majority in 2006, we demonstrated our commitment to fiscal responsibility by making PAYGO a part of the House rules. It's sometimes been difficult. And now with the support from President Obama and both Chambers of Congress, we have a real chance to give PAYGO the force of law by passing this bill. Under PAYGO, Congress will be forced to offset all new policies reducing revenues or expanding entitlements, so that they add nothing to our deficit.  In essence, we will be forced to make the hard budgeting choices that are so tempting to avoid. We are avoiding them today. We ought to admit that very honestly. Why are we doing it? Because as a practical matter, in the deep recession that we're in, we cannot pay for it without depressing the economy further.  That is not an acceptable alternative. If we want to cut taxes, we'll have to explain which programs will suffer cuts. If we want to expand entitlements, we'll have to spell out how we are going to pay for it. And no matter which party is in power, we'll be forced to distinguish wasteful spending and subsidies from the long-term priorities that really matter to our country.  Some have explained that statutory PAYGO would not apply to extensions of some existing policies that have bipartisan support, one of which is the one we're talking about today. Policies on the alternative minimum tax, which we've already done. And by the way, I am one of those--wasn't in the majority--who voted against extending the alternative minimum tax if we did not pay for it. In addition to that, Medicare doctor payments, which we're talking about today, and the estate and middle-income tax cuts passed in 2001 and 2003.  I sympathize with their concerns. They are not specious concerns. I have said repeatedly that I would fight to pay for all of these policies. Hear me, if the Senate sends this back paid for, I will support it. I challenge all of you on that side of the aisle and all of you on this side of the aisle to do the same. That stands in contrast, frankly, to the first 8 years of this decade, when repeatedly it was stated that they do not believe that extensions of tax cuts need to be paid for.  Unfortunately, it's a political reality that the votes to pay for extensions of the Bush policies are most likely not there. A PAYGO law that ignored that fact would be waived for those policies and then again and again. I prefer a law that we can enforce consistently. And very frankly, that is supported by some of the most consistent voters for fiscal responsibility on this floor.  Mr. Speaker, in our country's economic meltdown last year, we all saw the damage that deep debt can do. It's time for our Federal Government to learn that lesson and act on it. If we fail to act, liberal and conservative, Democratic and Republican, priorities will suffer alike. We can still prevent that outcome, ladies and gentlemen of this House. We cannot get back to fiscal health in one afternoon's vote, and we will not, perhaps not in this President's term or the next, but we must start. We must take a step toward that end.  This bill does that. It supports not only ensuring our seniors access to quality medical services but also ensures that we, again, adopt the policy that brought us $5.6 trillion in surplus.
