 President, I thought we were ready for a finite list of amendments, but apparently we are not. The Senator from Oklahoma has been waiting patiently for a couple of hours. The Senator from New York also would like to make just a brief comment on the IMF provision. I know that the Senator from Idaho has brief comments to make as well. I wonder if it is all right with the Senator from Oklahoma, since his amendment is going to be a contentious amendment, if we dispose of comments of the Senator from New York and the Senator from Idaho, which I understand are going to be quite brief.
