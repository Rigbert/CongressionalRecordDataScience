 President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolutions be agreed to en bloc, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table en bloc, the preambles be agreed to en bloc, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table en bloc, and that the consideration of these items appear separately in the Record with no intervening action or debate.
