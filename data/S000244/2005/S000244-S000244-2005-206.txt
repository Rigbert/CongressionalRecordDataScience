Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1400, the Securing Aircraft Cockpits Against Lasers Act of 2005.  Over the past several years, there have been an increasing number of alarming reports to the Federal Aviation Administration concerning the aiming of lasers into airplane cockpits. Since 1990 the FAA reports there have been well over 400 incidents and more than 100 in the past year alone. It was not that long ago that there was a frenzy of media coverage surrounding these types of events. While the media coverage may have subsided, the threat has not.  Laser pointers, while readily obtainable and relatively inexpensive, are not toys. In 1997, the Food and Drug Administration issued a warning to parents and school officials concerning handheld laser pointers. The FDA warning stated that ``the light energy that laser pointers can aim into the eye can be more damaging than staring directly at the sun.'' Federal law requires a warning on laser pointers about this potential hazard to the eyes, and that is 21 Code of Federal Regulations 1040.  FAA research has shown that laser illuminations can temporarily disorient or disable a pilot, particularly during critical stages of flights such as landings and takeoffs. Direct laser exposure to the eye can even cause temporary blindness. In some cases these laser illuminations can cause permanent damage. In fact, just last year, a laser aimed into a Delta Airlines flight over Salt Lake City injured the eye of one of the plane's pilots. This type of interference, whether it is intentional effort to sabotage a plane or just a misguided prank, should not be tolerated because of the potential for catastrophe.                              {time}  1145  H.R. 1400 is a straightforward, commonsense measure aimed at deterring and prosecuting those who would willfully committ a senseless act of potential sabotage.  The bill would impose criminal penalties upon any individual who knowingly aims a laser pointer at an aircraft within the special aircraft jurisdiction of the United States.  These criminal penalties include fines of up to $250,000, and imprisonment of up to 5 years. The bill before us today includes an amendment proposed in mark-up offered by gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson-Lee).  During committee consideration of the bill, the gentlewoman suggested that the bill include a definition for the term ``laser pointer.'' That definition has been added to the bill, and I thank the gentlewoman for her important contribution.  Finally, I would like to thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Keller), the author and lead proponent of H.R. 1400, for his leadership on this issue. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
