Chairman, I make a point of order against the amendment because it proposes to change existing law and constitutes legislation in an appropriation bill and, therefore, violates clause 2 of rule XXI.  The rule states in pertinent part:  ``An amendment in a general appropriations bill shall not be in order if changing existing law.''  The amendment requires a determination.  I ask for a ruling from the Chair.  The Acting CHAIR. Does any other Member wish to be heard on the point of order?
