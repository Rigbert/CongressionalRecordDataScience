 Some folks are pitching this wild, misguided idea that one-size-fits-all government insurance is a cure-all for what ails the patients and the people of the United States of America. This conversation needs a strong dose of reality medicine.  Let's look at what is really being proposed--Medicare for None. Here is what it would do. It would dump 181 million Americans off their private health insurance plans, double your income taxes, and put patients with preexisting conditions and chronic diseases on long waiting lists for medical care. It would unravel the current health safety net for seniors and people with disabilities, make the government the gatekeeper between Americans and their doctors, and, finally, put every single American who works for private health insurance out of business and out of a job.  The politics behind the proposal is simple: free healthcare. Let me remind my fellow Americans that if it sounds too good to be true, it is too good to be true.  Medicare for All is a catchy slogan. When you hear it on the campaign trail, remember it really boils down to government-run healthcare.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
