This week we recognize and commend her for 20 years of distinguished service in the House of Representatives, where she has served both her constituents and this Nation proudly.  During her 20 years in the House, Nancy has been a true leader on important issues, including promoting human rights, protecting the environment, and expanding health care. She has remained focused on the needs of her district, including preserving the Presidio of San Francisco as the Nation's largest urban national park, fighting for increased funding for HIV/AIDS research, and improving the lives of children.  In the 110th Congress, Nancy has ushered in a new era as the first woman Speaker of the House, setting an agenda that promotes the priorities of the American people and addresses the key challenges present in today's world. Her drive and determination make her a strong leader and legislator, and she has worked tirelessly to represent her constituents and to move our Nation in a new, positive direction.  Nancy has been a devoted public servant, both in California and in the House. She is a devoted wife, mother, and grandmother. It is an honor to serve with her in the House, and I am proud to call her my friend.                          ____________________
