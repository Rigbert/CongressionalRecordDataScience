President, I think the other speakers are here. Later on, I will talk about the assets we have, and that we have to keep Guantanamo Bay--Gitmo, as it is referred to. It has performed well for us since 1903. I cannot think of one statement, other than political statements, as to why we have to get rid of that great asset.  With that, I thank the Chair for his tolerance and I yield the floor.                               Exhibit 1     To: CSIS J. Board of Trustees, Advisers, and Friends     From: John J. Hamre     Date: April 13, 2009 (Number 298. Two pages)     Re: Cancelling weapons systems       I was out of the country last week when Secretary of      Defense Gates announced his recommendation for wholesale      termination of a large number of weapon systems. This was      such a big deal that he skipped the 60th anniversary      celebrations of the founding of NATO in order to prepare for      the announcement.       Secretary Gates epitomizes what Americans want in public      service--fairness, decisiveness and decency. And he clearly      captured broad public support with his recommendations. In      dozens of conversations, I always heard some version of ``it      is about time we had a leader that did this.'' This is      usually followed up by a question ``do you think he will be      reversed by Congress?''
