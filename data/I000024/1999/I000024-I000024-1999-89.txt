 The Senator was reading from the report. I would like to read the next paragraph that he overlooked. It says they are recommending:       Action by Congress to remove the current 2% oxygen      requirement--  That is right before ethanol--     to ensure that adequate fuel supplies can be blended in a      cost-effective manner while quickly reducing usage of MTBE. .      . .  Exactly the opposite of what the Senator from California is trying to do with her amendment.
