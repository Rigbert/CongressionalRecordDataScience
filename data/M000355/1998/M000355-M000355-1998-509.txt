 Just last Thursday, February 19, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that laws banning ordinary citizens from spending money to promote or denigrate candidates in an election campaign was a breach of human rights. That was in response to a group in England that brought the suit with the argument that their voices were essentially quieted, eliminated, by British law that prohibited them from speaking, in effect, in proximity to the election. So the Europeans are heading in the direction of issue advocacy, which is something, I say to my friend from Washington--and I see my friend and colleague from Utah on his feet as well--that the Supreme Court anticipated in the Buckley case.
