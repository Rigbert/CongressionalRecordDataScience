 President, the Feingold amendment goes directly against one of the key pillars of this bipartisan tax bill now before the Senate.  This amendment rejects the principle that we should have rate reductions in all marginal rates and do it at all levels. I strongly urge my colleagues to vote against the amendment that goes against the bipartisan agreement.  In addition, we have higher marginal tax rates for businesses of the self-employed at 39 percent then for corporations at 35 percent. We believe there ought to be a closer relationship between the two.  Lastly, I plead with my colleagues, how many times do we have to vote on the same amendment--time after time after time--just offered in a little different way but by different Members? We have worked hard to put together a bipartisan budget agreement, and we also wanted to bring some civility to the process. What we did last night detracts from that.
