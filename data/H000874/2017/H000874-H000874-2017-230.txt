Speaker, I must hasten to add that the gentleman from California added a little comment that ``it is known.'' I don't share that view, Mr. Speaker, that it is known that the Affordable Care Act is failing.  In fact, we had a hearing yesterday when the former Director of the Congressional Budget Office appointed by Democrats testified on the Affordable Care Act and testified on the American Health Care Act. Lo and behold, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Elmendorf agreed with the present CBO Director. In other words--and everybody in America ought to be pleased on this because they all are asking for bipartisan--the former Director appointed by Democrats of the CBO agrees with the Republican Director of the CBO, who just came down with his advice and counsel to the Congress just a few days ago.  That ought to give pause to those who are pressing to pass a bill, which would result in the loss by 24 million Americans of their insurance and would result in the increased costs to almost every American of their insurance.  Now, yes, there are some Americans who would choose not to have health care. Then they would get sick or they would get in an automobile accident or something else would happen where they would require medical care, and they would not be able to pay for it. Guess what? We would all pay for it.  That is what was happening before the Affordable Care Act. It is still happening with some who choose either to pay their contribution toward health--some people call it a penalty; I call it a contribution--to meet their personal responsibility, as the Heritage Foundation suggested, of having provisions that, if they get sick, they will be able to pay for it.  Now, last week, Mr. Speaker, the majority leader had some quotes from people who did not like the Affordable Care Act. At this hearing that we had, we had a number of people, and I want to quote some of them:       I certainly never imagined I would have a child who would      rely so much on a government program like Medicaid.  This child, Mr. Speaker, suffers from Rett syndrome, which is a neurology disorder that strikes mostly young girls with normal development for the first 18 or 24 months of their life. Then their development is arrested and, in fact, in some respects, there is a retreat in their abilities.  She went on to say:       Medicaid provides skilled nursing care, which allows us to      raise our daughter, Caroline, in our home instead of a      hospital or institution.  Of course, a hospital or institution would be far more expensive, Mr. Speaker.  She went on to say:       This allows my husband and me to hold jobs and take care of      other family needs. The House Republican plan for Medicaid      would put my daughter's life at risk, and my family is      terrified.  That was Marta Conner, mother of a child with Rett syndrome covered under Medicaid.  I titled yesterday's hearing: The hearing that the Republicans refused to have on the American Health Care Act or the Affordable Care Act itself.  This quote is by a doctor:       In public debate in Congress, the actual people can be      obscured by graphs and numbers. But, ladies and gentlemen,      every day in clinic, I am one-on-one with the real people,      real Americans who could take steps closer to health or      suffer more with this Congress' decision. I urge you and your      colleagues to reject the American Health Care Act and,      instead, strengthen the Affordable Care Act.  To that extent, Mr. Speaker, as the majority leader knows, that testimony joined hundreds in the medical field: The American Medical Association, associations of physicians with particular skill sets, of hospitals, of insurance companies, of patients, of providers, of urban hospitals, suburban hospitals, rural hospitals, and literally hundreds of people intimately involved in the healthcare system who are urging us not to pass the American Health Care Act and to leave in place but improve the Affordable Care Act.  Mr. Speaker, I have indicated to many on this side of the aisle that we are prepared to work to improve any piece of legislation that has been passed and particularly a piece of legislation which affects so many Americans. Unfortunately, we have not had that opportunity since this bill, the Affordable Care Act, was first considered and passed.  This week, the Congressional Budget Office released their estimate and impacts of the House Republicans' bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act.  Mr. Speaker, as the majority leader knows, President Trump, in this body and at that rostrum, promised insurance for everybody that is much less expensive and much better. He has not offered such a bill. The American Health Care Act certainly does not provide that.  In fact, the CBO--both Republican and Democratic directors--opined at least 24 million people will lose their insurance and, by 2026, there will be 58 million people in America without health insurance.  Mr. Speaker, the majority leader has indicated this bill will be on the floor next week. I hope that everybody takes the opportunity to read the CBO report and the testimony given in yesterday's hearing on the bill. It was the first and only hearing that was held on the bill that will be on the floor. Previous hearings on the Affordable Care Act are not good, and previous hearings that there are alternatives out there don't deal with the bill that is going to be on the floor next Wednesday or Thursday.  Senator Susan Collins has said of the bill that is going to be on the floor:       It should prompt the House to slow down and reconsider      certain provisions of the bill.  She was referring, of course, to the CBO report.  Senator Bill Cassidy from that liberal leftwing bastion of Louisiana said:       Can't sugarcoat it. Doesn't look good. The CBO score was,      shall we say, an eyepopper. I also hope it was a thought      provoker.  And Senator Rob Portman, who served in this body for many years, said:       I am concerned about the Medicaid population. That is the      biggest part of coverage for Ohio.  That is why their Governor, a Republican, and Rob Portman, a Republican who served on the Ways and Means Committee, is urging caution and has great reservations about the bill that has been announced to come to the floor.                              {time}  1200  Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask the majority leader whether or not he can confirm whether changes will be made to the repeal bill, that is the American Health Care Act, that was reported out of the Budget Committee, whether he can confirm whether or not the repeal bill will be changed before it comes to the floor.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  And his question, based upon scheduling, and I know there were a lot of questions in there, so please let me work through and try to answer all of his questions.  The last question was in regard to the bill itself, and we are working through the process. It will be in the Rules Committee. As the legislative process works, there are always ways that you refine the bill, and I expect that there will be some elements that get refined inside the Rules Committee before it comes to the floor.  You had about five different questions there if I may follow all the way through. First, you talked about, and I was happy to hear--I wrote it down--you are glad to work to help to improve the bill--because when we were in the more than 26 hours of Energy and Commerce, the amendments the Democrats offered, we spent a couple of hours on just the one amendment about a hashtag of renaming the bill. So there is a change in attitude. I appreciate that from the other side of the aisle because we are always willing to work with you.
