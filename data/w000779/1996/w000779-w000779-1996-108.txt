I said the other day that I thought some of what was going on in this town was like a hot-fudge-sundae approach to dieting. You can have tax cuts, you can have new weapons systems and then somehow say the books are going to balance. It is like having six or seven hot fudge sundaes a day and still lose weight.  I think what you offer in your important remarks is, this is about budget discipline, and you are going to suggest a variety of ways to do it.
