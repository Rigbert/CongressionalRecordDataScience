Speaker, on April 22, Bowie State University celebrated the leadership and career of its ninth president, Dr. Mickey Burnim, at its annual Founders Gala. The annual Founders Gala marks the anniversary of the founding of the school in 1865 that would later become Bowie State University. While I was, unfortunately, unable to join the celebration in person, I want to express my great thanks to Dr. Burnim for all he has achieved during his tenure and congratulate him on being honored at this year's gala. I also join in wishing him well on his upcoming retirement.  When Dr. Burnim steps down as President of Bowie State University, he will complete eleven very successful years leading one of Maryland's great institutions of higher education and one of our nation's oldest and most illustrious historically black universities. Having come to Bowie State after serving as Chancellor of Elizabeth City State University in North Carolina and as Provost and Vice Chancellor of North Carolina Central University, Dr. Burnim brought to his presidency an already long and distinguished career in university administration. At a time when higher education costs are rising, Bowie State has been recognized for its outstanding value, including being ranked by The Economist for having the best higher education value in Maryland. An economist by training, Dr. Burnim has recognized the criticality of securing a sound fiscal future for the University, and during his time in office he took steps to put Bowie State on a solid footing for long-term expansion. With new resources secured, one of the focuses of his tenure has been the construction of new campus buildings, including a new student center, a performing arts center, and a new $107 million facility for the study and practice of Science, Mathematics, and Nursing. Recognizing how important it is to connect graduates with career opportunities and to foster young entrepreneurs, Dr. Burnim worked with the City of Bowie to launch the Bowie Business Innovation Center on campus. Under his leadership, Bowie State has continued to expand the programs it offers and to conduct groundbreaking research across a number of disciplines. I am very proud to represent Bowie State University in Congress.  Since its founding as the Baltimore Normal School after the Civil War, Bowie State University has served as an important nexus of education and opportunity for African Americans, and after 152 years it has grown to become one of our country's great universities and educates students from all backgrounds. Bowie State joined the University System of Maryland in 1988 and, along with the other institutions of higher education across our state, helps make Maryland one of the best places to pursue study in the country and, indeed, the world. Within the University System of Maryland, Bowie State has earned a reputation for leading in the fields of science, technology, engineering, the arts, and mathematics--or `STEAM'--and creating innovative interdisciplinary programs that bring them all together to prepare students for success in emerging industries of the twenty-first century economy. It was Dr. Burnim who led Bowie State's effort to adopt the Education Innovation Initiative (EI\2\), a STEAM-enrichment program that makes early career pathway exposure accessible to under-represented students throughout Prince George's County.  Dr. Mickey Burnim has been instrumental to the University's achievements and its strong trajectory for growth in the years ahead. I have been honored to work with him to ensure that Bowie State has had a partner in the federal government, and I thank him for all his hard work over the past eleven years as President and throughout his four decades in higher education. I wish him all the best, and I join in celebrating his very successful tenure that has made a real difference in the lives of tens of thousands of students across Maryland and the United States.                          ____________________
