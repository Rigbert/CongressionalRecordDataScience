President, based on the debate that occurred earlier, I believe the distinguished chairman of the Commerce Committee has decided to accept this amendment and was willing to do it without a rollcall vote. However, the distinguished Senator from New Jersey wants a rollcall vote, so we are going to have a rollcall vote.  I do not know whether the Senator from New Jersey is on his way. I see that he is in the Chamber, so I yield the floor to the Senator from New Jersey.
