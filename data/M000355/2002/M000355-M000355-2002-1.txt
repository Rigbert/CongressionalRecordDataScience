 President, the situation with Ms. White and Ms. Lewis is obviously quite different from the situation of Mr. Jeffrey Sutton and Justice Deborah Cook, whom President Bush has nominated to fill two of the six remaining vacancies on the Sixth Circuit. Both Mr. Sutton and Justice Cook have strong home-state support. Furthermore, they are part of the President's first group of judicial nominees that he submitted to the Senate in May of last year. Nevertheless, neither has been able to obtain a hearing. I am confident that in the next Congress the Judiciary Committee will promptly act on their nominations.  Far from treating President Clinton poorly with respect to his judicial nominees, the Republican Senate treated him quite well, particularly on nominations to the Sixth Circuit. President Clinton got three hundred and seventy-seven of his judicial nominees confirmed, only five shy of President Reagan's all-time record. This is quite impressive in and of itself. It is even more impressive when one considers that President Clinton got these nominees confirmed when Republicans controlled the Senate for seventy-five percent of his term. By contrast, President Reagan got his judicial nominations confirmed when his own party controlled the Senate for seventy-five percent of his term. Thus, a Republican Senate treated Presidents Reagan and Clinton equally well.  As part of his near-record total, President Clinton got five Sixth Circuit nominees confirmed. Judges Martha Craig Daughtery, R. Guy Cole, Jr., Karen Nelson Moore, Ronald Lee Gilman, and Eric L. Clay were all Clinton nominees who were confirmed to the Sixth Circuit. This is also a fairly impressive statistic, particularly when compared to President Bush, who has only gotten two of his Sixth Circuit nominees confirmed, including Professor Rogers. But President Clinton's Sixth Circuit accomplishment is even more impressive when one considers that a Republican Senate confirmed four out of the five, or eighty percent, of those nominations. Only Judge Daughtery was confirmed by a Democrat Senate.  Indeed, because the Republican Senate confirmed so many nominees to the Sixth Circuit, Democrat appointees outnumbered Republican appointees by a ratio of three to one at the beginning of this year: there were six Democrat-appointed judges on the Sixth Circuit and only two Republican-appointed judges. President Clinton might have had even more judicial nominees confirmed to the Sixth Circuit if his administration had consulted properly on the White and Lewis nominations.  With respect to the Rogers' nomination, Professor Rogers has not been a judicial activist, as the Chairman claims. The law review article on which my friend from Vermont relies for this sweeping assertion was a theoretical piece discussing an esoteric subject that scholars have debated since the great Learned Hand. It was Professor Rogers' lone foray into the topic.  Far from arguing that inferior courts should somehow try to overrule higher court precedent--if that were even possible--Professor Rogers argues just the opposite: that lower courts have a duty to follow all precedent, including precedents with which they disagree. My friend from Vermont may want to read page 185 of the article where Professor Rogers writes that our legal system ``would not work well if lower courts persisted in their own sincere legal analyses regardless of the decisions of higher courts.'' Professor Rogers goes on to write that it ``follows that judges may, indeed should, follow the law as appellate courts determine it, in order to apply--per their oaths--the law of the system that set up their courts.''  Over the course of his long and distinguished career, Professor Rogers has consistently demonstrated a strong and abiding fidelity to precedent. A judicial activist, by contrast, would be a label more appropriately applied to someone like Clinton appointee William Sessions, a district court judge from Vermont, who recently declared that the federal death penalty statute is unconstitutional in all its applications, which would preclude using it against mass murderers and serial killers. Or it could apply to Clinton appointee Jed Rakoff, a district court judge who also ruled the federal death penalty unconstitutional, which prompted even the Washington Post to complain about such judicial activism in a piece entitled ``Right Answer, Wrong Branch.''  Or that label might apply to Clinton appointee Shira Scheindlin. According to the Wall Street Journal, in an article entitled ``Osama's Favorite Judge,'' a Jordanian named Osama Awadallah knew two of the 9/11 hijackers and met with one at least forty times. His namewas found in the car parked at Dulles Airport by one of the hijackers of American Airlines Flight 77. Photos of his better-known namesake--Osama bin Laden--were found in Mr. Awadallah's apartment. Under the law, a material witness may be detained if he has relevant information and is a flight risk.  Federal prosecutors thought that Osama Awadallah easily met both parts of that test and therefore detained him. While detained Mr. Awadallah was indicted for perjury. But Judge Scheindlin dismissed the perjury charges and released Mr. Awadallah. She reasoned that the convening of a federal grand jury investigating a crime was not a ``criminal proceeding'' and therefore it was unconstitutional to detain Mr. Awadallah. This was quite a surprise to federal prosecutors who for decades had used the material witness law in the context of grand jury proceedings for everyone from mobsters to mass murderer Timothy McVeigh.  Or that label might apply to Clinton appointees Tashima, Hawkins, Paez, and Berzon, all of whom discovered in the Constitution the right of prisoners serving life sentences to procreate via artificial insemination. Fortunately, there were enough judges on the Ninth Circuit to conclude that the Constitution does not include a ``right to procreate from prison via FedEx.''  There are other Clinton nominees to whom one could apply the label ``judicial activist.'' That label cannot, however, fairly be applied to Professor Rogers.  The Chairman also implies that Professor Rogers is an activist because of his views on the Supreme Court's opinion in Roe v. Wade. But Professor Rogers has never ruled on that subject. In fact, he has never even written on it, except for his one assignment as a line attorney in the Justice Department in helping draft an amicus brief. If daring to note some of the flawed analytical underpinnings of Roe makes one a judicial activist, then Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg must be one. In a 1985 article, she noted that ``Roe sparked public opposition and academic criticism, in part, I believe, because the Court ventured too far in the change it ordered and presented an incomplete justification for its action.'' She also recognized that in Roe ``heavy-handed judicial intervention was difficult to justify and appears to have provoked, not resolved, conflict.'' Other liberal scholars have also recognized serious flaws in Roe's analysis.  In conclusion, Professor Rogers possesses the intellect, integrity, and commitment to public service that will make him a fine addition to the Sixth Circuit. His confirmation will provide some badly-needed relief to my constituents and other citizens in the Sixth Circuit, and I am confident that he will make Kentucky and his country proud. And while I believe my friend from Vermont misapprehends the cause of the vacancy crisis on the Sixth Circuit and Professor Rogers' judicial philosophy and record, I appreciate him moving the Rogers' nomination and other Kentucky nominees through the process. He correctly notes that there are now no judicial vacancies in Kentucky, and I thank him again for helping the Commonwealth in that respect.                               Exhibit 1              [From the Wall Street Journal, Dec. 4, 2001]                           Judges and Grudges              Michigan's Democratic senators seek payback                          (By Thomas J. Bray)       On Thursday, the Sixth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which      handles federal appeals from Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and      Tennessee, will meet en banc to hear oral arguments on      whether the University of Michigan's use of racial      preferences in administrations is constitutional. Such a      hearing, in which all of the court's active judges, rather      than the usual three-judge panel, hear the case, is highly      unusual.       But then the number of judges on the Sixth Circuit is bit      unusual, too. Though there are normally 16 active judges      assigned to the appeals court, only nine of the seats are      currently filled. Moreover, the number will fall to eight at      the end of the year when one judge retires.       Nominations to fill seats in the Sixth Circuit have are      being stymied by bitter partisan wangling in the Senate. And      there appears to be little prospect of breaking the deadlock.      Michigan's two Democratic senators, Carl Levin and Deborah      Stabenow, have put a hold on three of President Bush's      nominees from that state. (Mr. Bush hasn't yet named a      candidate for a fourth seat traditionally held by a      Michiganian.) Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy has      refused even to hold hearings on the nominations.       Echoing their party's rationale for foot-dragging on      judicial nominations from all across the country, Sens. Levin      and Stabenow complain that when Republicans controlled the      Judiciary Committee in the warning days of the Clinton      administration, they arbitrarily refused to act on the      nominations of state appellate judge Helen White and Detroit      lawyer Kathleen McCree Lewis. ``This was despite the fact      that no concerns were raised about either woman's      qualifications,'' the two senators wrote in a letter last      weekend to the Detroit News.       That leaves the implication that the White and Lewis      nominations were stalled because of sheer partisanship, thus      justifying retaliation now that the Senate is in Democratic      hands. But the story is a bit more complicated.       Helene White happens to be the wife of Carl Legion's cousin      Charles Levin, a former member of the Michigan Supreme Court.      In 1996, Judge White was threatening to run as an independent      for the state Supreme Court. This horrified Michigan      Democrats, who feared that she might draw off a big chunk of      the liberal vote. The White House, according to state      political sources, was persuaded to forestall that      possibility by nominating her for a seat on the Sixth      Circuit. (The Democratic candidate went on the lose anyway.)       But her nomination outraged then-Sen. Spencer Abraham, a      Michigan Republican who is now secretary of energy. Mr.      Abraham traded his help for getting three Michigan nominees      to the federal courts approved by the GOP Senate in exchange      for Clinton-judge pickers holding off on further nominations.       When the White House was ahead with the White nomination      anyway, sen. Abraham made no secret of his feeling that he      had been double-crossed. He then placed his hold on the White      nomination and later the Lewis nomination.       All of this came well into the Clinton tenure. Newly      elected presidents, including Mr. Clinton, have generally      received speedy accommodation for their initial nominees.      Blocking nominees so early makes it appear the Democrats are      motivated by little more than partisanship stemming from      disappointment at the outcome of the 2000 election and the      desire to impose an ideological litmus test on judicial      nominees.       Sen. Charles Schumer of New York, a member of the Judiciary      Committee, let the cat out of the bag shortly after the      Democrats took over the Senate. The committee, he announced,      would be justified in opposing nominees ``whose views fall      outside the mainstream''--in other words, anybody with whom      he and his Democratic colleagues disagreed.       The three blocked Bush nominees to the Sixth Circuit      include a highly qualified federal district judged from      western Michigan, a female state trial judge and a state      appeals-court judge of Arab descent. At a time when Democrats      are loudly complaining about insensitivity toward Arab and      Muslim visa-holders, the last nomination might seem      particularly timely. A federal district judge in Detroit is      now hearing charges against three Arab aliens charged with      visa violations who authorities say may have connections to      al Qaeda.       There currently are 110 vacancies among the nation's 862      district and appeals courts judgeships. The gap has so far      been filled by semiretired senior judges, through they aren't      allowed to join in en banc court proceedings.       An indignant Sen. Leahy is hauling Attorney General John      Ashcroft before his committee this week to answer questions      about the constitutionality of his investigative techniques      as well as the use of military commissions to conduct speedy      trials of captured foreign terrorists. If Mr. Leahy and his      colleagues are so keen on having the regular courts do this      job, maybe they should be asked why they are still sitting on      so many of the president's nominations.                          ____________________
