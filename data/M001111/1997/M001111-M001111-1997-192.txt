 President, I rise today to thank Senator Daschle and all of my colleagues for the opportunity to discuss a topic frequently inthe thoughts of most Americans, and that is education. There have been other opportunities in the past, and they will come again I know, but on this day, at the beginning of the 105th Congress of the United States, I want the Members of the Senate to recognize that education is one of those topics that is a day-to-day concern of most Americans.  We spend a lot of our time here talking about many things that are far less important to the American people than education. When Americans vote, education is important to them. When they answer polls, education is always a top concern. When they face obstacles in their lives, they see education as a way around those obstacles. And when they search for ways to make life for their children better than they have had it themselves, education is often the single best answer they will find.  Before us today a bill was introduced, the Education for the 21st Century Act. For much of my career in education and policymaking, I have seen bills and acts and programs with ``21st century'' in the title. Well, President Clinton was inaugurated this week, and 4 years from now there will be another inaugural ceremony and a new President will be sworn in, and he or she will become the first President who has a term in the 21st century. I trust that he or she will be gazing into a new millennium of American progress.  The bill that was introduced today makes several concrete investments in the new American century beginning some 4 years from now. The first investment is in helping people pay for their education, and the bill does it in three ways. The Hope scholarship allows people a $1,500-per-year refundable tax credit for the first 2 years of college, and allows half-time students a $750-per-year tax credit.  Students can instead choose to take advantage of the tax deduction for school expenses, which allows them to deduct up to $10,000 a year for higher education expenses. No matter which option students choose, they can also take advantage of the restored deduction for interest paid on their student loans.  These three opportunities aim to help good students of modest means attend that first day of class in their local community college. Based on everything we know about our economy, and with a look at where employment trends are heading, investing and getting people started in school is a prudent move on the part of our Nation. These incentives will help Americans take advantage of the connection between level of education and their employability in the next century.  The second part of the investment found in this bill is designed to jump-start efforts to repair some of our Nation's worst crumbling schools. For an investment of $5 billion in school construction incentive funds, we expect to drive about $20 billion in renovation and construction across this Nation.  This is important because of the actual bricks and roofing and wiring that it will provide, but it is also an important symbol. It says to all of us that American children deserve to go to school in buildings that are safe, healthy, well-lighted places where learning happens and community spirit abounds.  I especially thank Senator Carol Moseley-Braun for her tireless efforts on this issue. People talk all the time about the role of Federal Government in local school policy. By championing this issue, Senator Moseley-Braun has pointed out that the Federal Government does have a role in K-12 education in this country. That role is not passing down curriculum or trying to tell teachers how to teach. The role is guaranteeing certain minimum standards for health and safety and equality, and that is what this proposal is all about.  I also want to remind all of my colleagues that it is important to retain flexibility in this proposal so it helps both urban and rural schools. There are schools in places like the small town of Raymond, WA, which the General Accounting Office has previously identified as needing help with school construction funding due to local economic factors. We should not rule out rural schools as we fine-tune this proposal.  The third investment in this bill is the reading ability of young children. America Reads will fund 30,000 reading specialists and volunteer coordinators, with the goal of getting children reading on their own by the third grade. It will establish a parents as first teachers challenge grant fund and will work with existing programs like AmeriCorps to maximize efforts.  Efforts to build literacy, whether aimed at helping young children read or helping adults read to their children or find a job, acts like yeast in bread dough. They allow people's aspirations to rise, and they will pull this country up to meet the challenges we face. It does not matter what adversity our children face or what they are presented with in life. If they can read, they have a chance to overcome it. The ability to read, write, communicate, and function in the work world--these things are a precious gift all children and all adults should have.  But literacy problems are complicated, so we must make sure our solutions are designed to reflect the most effective techniques we can find. As we move ahead with America Reads, we must allow local flexibility. We must honor the knowledge of those Americans who have been teaching literacy in our communities--in colleges, in schools, in social agencies and in local community-based organizations. We have to recognize that the best indicator of success in reading for a child is the education level of the child's primary caregiver. We must allow the tutor programs under America Reads to work with families to get the best results for children.  The act of reading is complicated, and I can tell you that as a former teacher. Reading is a multistep process. A reader has to recognize and decode parts of words, whole words and sentences of words, both through sight and sound, and figure out how the assembled parts relate to meaning.  Dynamic research is underway right now by Dr. Reid Lyon at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and by other researchers around the country in places like the University of Washington in Seattle. This research is unveiling just how complicated learning disabilities are. It is showing how the brain processes certain kinds of information in the reading process, and it is pointing to effective techniques for mitigating disabilities.  America Reads has to capitalize on the current research and build as many connections as possible between reading tutors, a student's primary reading teacher and the work of literacy researchers.  America Reads must also be seen as an unprecedented lens through which we can see literacy and education in general as seamless. Your age, your geographic location, your socio-economic status cannot be barriers to your ability to learn.  We have to get K-12 education, higher education, community education, employment training, local family literacy projects and other organizations all working together. We have to look at education, and at literacy specifically, as the tools Americans need to help themselves and to help this country achieve progress.  The fourth investment in this bill is technological literacy. This investment is ongoing, and it has already achieved some success. The bill will continue our efforts to improve learning across the country by increasing funds for the technology literacy challenge grants.  Over the next 5 years, this bill puts $1.8 billion into these grants to our local school districts so that they can help train teachers to integrate technology into their methods and curriculum to create new resources and to work with leaders in their communities to get students access to computers, the Internet and other high technology resources.  I want to especially thank Senator Bingaman for his vision on education technology and thank all who have supported this important issue.  One key component of the technology section of this bill picks up on the work that I started last Congress, taking advantage of surplus technology where it is appropriate in schools' technology plans.  In the last Congress, if you will remember, we passed the Murray amendment to the fiscal year 1997 Treasury Postal appropriations bill, which said that all Government agencies have to inventory their excess computer equipment and peripherals and then makethem available to educational institutions through the GSA.  We also passed the Murray amendment to the fiscal year 1997 legislative branch appropriations bill which set up the same process for the Congress itself.  I want you to know that progress so far is very good. The letters I sent to heads of Federal agencies have brought in some very good responses, and Government computers are now going to schools.  The bill before us does, in a systemic fashion, what I have been setting up at the grassroots level in my State--education technology clearinghouses--a place where people can donate equipment and software, a place where schools can get this technology, and a place where a third party can reject technology that does not meet minimum requirements so it does not enter into our schools or libraries.  Several issues have come up in recent months regarding surplus technology. Many are addressed in this bill. If we are using surplus equipment side by side with new equipment, we have to assure that the surplus equipment meets the needs of the school or library that is receiving it. To send them our castoffs with no value sends the wrong message, and we should not be doing it.  Schools in my State are using surplus computers as file servers for networks of new computers, and they are using them for word processing and data processing. They have students doing the upgrades in some of our schools, and when the technology is still current generation, these uses are appropriate. When the technology is too old to be useful, we must recycle the components in other ways and not burden our schools and libraries with a gift that is going to cost much more than it is worth. Equity is another concern, and this bill addresses it. It requires clearinghouses to ensure equitable distribution of surplus technology.  Technology, a concentrated effort to build reading skills, school construction funding, and tuition assistance--our investments are prudent. The goals are very clear. People from both parties will support these kinds of efforts. With this sort of plan in place, Americans can feel proud of their Government's efforts to help them improve education across the Nation.  Let's look out ahead. In just 4 short years, people will be finishing up in the community college programs that they just picked up a brochure for today. They will be finishing the 4-year degree programs they started this fall. They will be graduating from high schools they are just entering this fall or next, depending on their grade, and they will be third graders in the elementary schools that they started on the first day of kindergarten this September.  How will their lives be better off thanks to this bill? What will their parents say, hope or dream? What will they think to tell us, if they still remember our names 4 years from now? Will they hail this bill as a success, like the Pell grant or GI bill? Will they thank us for working together across party lines to show support for teaching and learning in this country? We simply have to do the work ahead of us, and we will deserve any praise for our efforts, and we will all be thankful that we took steps today to assure a brighter future for our country.                          ____________________
