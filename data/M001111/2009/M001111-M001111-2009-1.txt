 President, I would like to engage my friends, the Senator from Iowa and Chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, and the Senator from Montana and Chairman of the Finance Committee, in a conversation about how ``full time'' is defined in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and clarify any misunderstandings about how the legislation resolves the potential for exclusion of certain work group such as flight crews and rail workers due to the definition of ``full time'' work and the unique way their work hours are calculated.  Is it the Senators' understanding that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act resolves a potentialproblem of excluding from employer incentives to provide coverage for employees who work in professions that use unique calculations for hours worked, such as flight crews and rail workers? And that it does this by indicating that the Secretary of HHS, in consultation with the Secretary of Labor, shall prescribe such regulations, rules, and guidance as may be necessary to determine the hours of service of an employee, including rules for employees who are not compensated on an hourly basis?
