I would simply say that clearly this is a critical issue which I do not think is a partisan issue. I think there is not a Member on the House floor of either side of the aisle or our two Independents who do not believe that citizens ought to be encouraged to vote, facilitated in casting their vote and to having the technology available that will make sure that they count their votes. We focused on Florida, but as we have learned, this problem exists in many jurisdictions. It is not a partisan problem, it is in some respects a technological problem and in some respects election officials are not trained as well as they ought to be, not through any fault of their own but just we have not had the mechanisms to do that, to reach out and to make sure that citizens have access to the polling places.  I know the Speaker is focused on it. I know the minority leader is focused on it. I hope that we could accomplish this in the short term so that we might effect reforms prior to the next election. That is our concern about timing.  I would be glad to yield to the gentleman for any comments he might want to make.
