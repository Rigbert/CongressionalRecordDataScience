 REID. Of course.  Mr. McCONNELL. Would the majority leader agree with me that it would be at least desirable to prevent there being a further proliferation of amendments? It strikes me the longer we are out here, the more the amendments would multiply. Why would it not be a good idea to enter into a consent agreement now to limit the universe of amendments, as I was prepared to do yesterday, at least to give us a first step toward preventing the multiplicity of amendments that have a way of coming out of the woodwork around here, so at whatever point we go back to the farm bill we have at least defined the universe? That is the way we almost always start on a bill of that magnitude. It is the way we started on past farm bills. At the end we, of course, will pass a farm bill. We have in the past and we will this year.  I ask my friend from Nevada, what would be wrong with locking in the master, the universe--the list that we both produced yesterday? I was happy to enter into a consent agreement to limit the amendments to that 24 hours ago.
