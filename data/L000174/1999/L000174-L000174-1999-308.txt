President, I commend the distinguished senior Senator from Kentucky for the alacrity with which he moved this bill. Those who have reached that level of knowledge know we Senators are constitutional impediments to our staffs.  I compliment Robin Cleveland, who has worked so hard at trying to balance the competing interests of so many Senators on both sides of the aisle, as well as Billy Piper and Jennifer Chartrand; and on my side, the indefatigable Tim Rieser, a man who has not slept since it was announced we might go to this bill a month or so ago. He has, again, maintained the remarkable Rieser filing cabinet, which is primarily in his head, knowing all the ins and outs of this bill and handling it so well.  He was ably assisted by Cara Thanassi. Ms. Thanassi began a few years ago on our staff. She has grown enormously in talent and ability and was absolutely essential in this work.  In working with the Senator from Kentucky, we have tried to accommodate each other on issues, even though on some issues we obviously have a different philosophy. We have respected each other and accommodated each other and tried to make sure a bipartisan piece of legislation came through. I think the resulting vote today shows that bipartisanship on foreign policy was maintained.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
