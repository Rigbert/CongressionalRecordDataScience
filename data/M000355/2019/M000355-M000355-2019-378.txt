 Out of devotion to this country and our values, these brave servicemembers made the world a safer place. It is a sincere privilege to extend my gratitude to each and every one of them.  I am especially proud to recognize the nearly 300,000 American veterans who call Kentucky home. After their military service, many of these Kentuckians came home and continued selflessly giving to their communities and our Nation. In particular, I would like to pay tribute to a special Kentucky veteran today, Dan McDaniel of Kenton County. Six days after he graduated from the University of Kentucky in 1972, Dan became one of the final draftees his community sent into the Army during the Vietnam war. Following his basic training, Dan was sent with his wife, Linda, to Augsburg, Germany, as a field artillery crewman. Heserved there until he received an honorable discharge that brought the couple home to Kenton County.  Using his degree in social studies, Dan taught history for a short time in Northern Kentucky. Then, a few years later, Dan and his brother Mike started a small concrete company out of their basements. For nearly four decades, Mike and Dan grew their business and earned respect in Northern Kentucky and the greater region as full service concrete contractors. In 2008, the brothers sold their business to Dan's son, Chris, who runs the company to this day.  The family business isn't the only way Chris has followed his father's footsteps, however. After graduating from The Citadel, Chris served 4 years in the Army as an infantry officer. Today, he is continuing to serve the Bluegrass State as a prominent member of the Kentucky State Senate. Like so many veterans, both Dan and Chris continue to make lasting contributions to their community, our Commonwealth, and this great Nation.  So, on this Veterans Day, I am grateful to all those who served our country in uniform. Our Commonwealth is made safer because of their service and stronger because of their example. To Dan and Chris McDaniel, all Kentucky veterans, and their families, it is an honor to say thank you.                          ____________________
