 President, I would like to say a few words this morning about President Obama's proposed Executive action on immigration. I will begin with a quote from the President himself. ``Democracy is hard,'' he said during a commencement speech in Miami 3 years ago. ``But it's right. [And] changing our laws means doing the hard work of changing minds and changing votes, one by one.''  As somebody who well understands just how difficult the work of changing minds and votes can be, I could not agree more with the President's statement. Americans accept that democracy's blessings are only made possible by the constraints it imposes--both its legal contours and those imposed by popular elections.  We accept democracy's messiness. We accept that we may not always get all of what we want exactly when we want it. Based on more of what the President said in Miami, this is something he seemed to understand as well. He was talking about immigration that day.  Here is something else he said on that topic. ``I know [that] some . . . wish that I could just bypass Congress and change the law myself. But that's not how democracy works.'' Indeed, it is not--all of which makes the President's planned Executive action on immigration even more jarring.  If the President truly follows through on this attempt to impose his will unilaterally, he will have issued a rebuke to his own stated view of democracy. He will have contradicted his past statements on this very issue.
