 I think he is the only person I know who has actually been in the presence of Suu Kyi. I am sure the Senator shares my view that the mere act of letting her out is a long way from where the two of us hope they will end up.  What the junta needs to do is a lot more than simply end the house arrest, but give her and her duly elected party an opportunity to assume the power that they won 13 years ago in an honest election. So it is a step in the right direction. I am sure my friend from Arizona agrees that we have a long way to go.  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I was just going to wrap up. I see my friend from Alaska here. How long does the Senator expect to speak?
