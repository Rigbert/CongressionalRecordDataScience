 President, I stand today to recognize the achievements and progress of the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Paducah, KY. On October 20, 1997, Industry Week Magazine named the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant one of America's top 10 plants. This would be a greater honor for any manufacturer, but I feel that it is particularly remarkable for the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant. When producing a potentially dangerous material like enriched uranium, extensive safety precautions have to be their first priority. The uranium they produce is shipped not only throughout the United States, but worldwide as well, to be used in the nuclear fuel cycle.  The 275 plants nominated for this honor were judged in 14 areas including productivity, quality of product, employee involvement, cost reduction, and customer focus. The Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant is impressive in all of these areas, and their performance has improved immensely over the past 5 years. In 1993, analysts predicted that the plant would have to close in the early 21st century, but continuous improvements have put an end to this speculation. There has been a 65-percent reduction in injuries over the past 5 years, a reduction in environmental concerns, and an impressive 100-percent on-time production delivery rate.  The 1,800 workers of the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant, most of which are Kentuckians, are truly to be commended. These workers and their management team have visited other quality plants for innovative ideas about how to improve their own production. They have formed over 30 problem-solving teams, solicited and acted on advice from employees, and engaged in extensive and continual annual training. The positive labor-management relationship has successfully turned the750-acre facility into thriving, cost-controlled, internationally competitive business. They have worked remarkably well on a daily basis with inspectors from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, as well as with officials from the U.S. Enrichment Corp. The U.S. Enrichment Corp., which manages both the Paducah and the Pikeville, OH, plants, supplies 80 percent of the nuclear fuel for nuclear plants in the United States, and maintains 44 percent of the world enrichment market.  I would like to extend my sincere congratulations and thanks to the employees of the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant. The plant's appropriate slogan is ``Survive and Thrive,'' and they have done just that. The Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant not only provides jobs and benefits to western Kentuckians, but it helps the United States remain self-reliant for our nuclear fuel production.                          ____________________
