 President, I offer today private relief legislation to provide lawful permanent residence status to Carmen Shahrzad Kulcsar, a 15-year-old Australian national currently living with her aunt and uncle in San Marcos, CA.  I have decided to offer private relief legislation on Carmen's behalf because I believe that removal from the United States would not only be tragically unfair to her, but also to her aunt and uncle who have taken Carmen into their home and treated her like a daughter after the tragic events that brought her to America. Furthermore, Carmen's removal could put her aunt's, her uncle's, and her own life in grave danger.  Carmen's parents separated due to physical abuse, alcohol abuse, and allegations of affairs. In 1992, at the young age of two, Carmen witnessed her father shoot her mother point blank range in the head.  Her father--David Kulcsar--was convicted of murder and sentenced to 12 to 16 years in prison. Fortunately for Carmen, her American aunt Manieh Varner was granted sole guardianship and custody of her niece by an Australian court.  Carmen entered the United States on a temporary Visitor's Visa and has resided here for the past 13 years with her aunt and uncle.  Carmen is a model student at her high school. She takes honor classes and has worked hard to earn a cumulative grade point average of 3.5. Her report card has multiple comments regarding her outstanding citizenship and as being a pleasure to have in class.  Carmen is a member of the competitive Academic Decathlon Team. Her future can be a bright one and it is unlikely that she will become a burden on the State or Federal Government.  Carmen's aunt has always wanted to adopt her niece and begin the path to legal residency. However, there has always been one problem. Carmen's father never wanted Carmen to go with her aunt and made repeated threats for revenge against Mrs. Varner. Adopting Carmen requires notifying Mr. Kulcsar about the adoption and Mrs. Varner believed always, as she does now, that doing so would put her and Carmen's life in risk.  Mrs. Varner cannot pursue adoption now because time constraints prevent the process from being completed before Carmen's 16th birthday; thus, adoption would have no bearing for immigration purposes.  Mr. and Mrs. Varner have done their best to try and create a life for Carmen that would otherwise have been impossible for her in Australia.  Both U.S. citizens, Mr. Varner is a high school teacher while Mrs. Varner is employed by the State of California's Department of Transportation. Along with a daughter of their own, they have made the best possible situation of a horrible tragedy.  Unfortunately, if this private relief bill is not approved, the choices available to Carmen are grim. Clearly it would be impossible for her to go back to Australia.  The only memory she has of that country is the memory of her mother's murder at the hands of her father. The only family in Australia is that of her unstable, recently released from prison father. She would be forced to live illegally in the United States through no fault of her own. America is the only land she has ever known. It is her home.  Given these extraordinary and unique facts, I offer this private relief bill on behalf of Carmen Shahrzad Kulcsar. We have the opportunity to make a just and fitting solution for this wonderful family. Therefore, I ask my colleagues to support this private relief bill.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2241       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. PERMANENT RESIDENCE.       Notwithstanding any other provision of law or any order,      for purposes of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C.      1101 et seq.), Carmen Shahrzad Kulcsar shall be deemed to      have been lawfully admitted to the United States for      permanent residence as of the date of enactment of this Act      upon the payment of the required visa fees.     SEC. 2. REDUCTION OF NUMBER OF AVAILABLE VISAS.       Upon the granting of permanent residence to Carmen Shahrzad      Kulcsar under section 1, the Secretary of State shall      instruct the proper officer to reduce by 1 the total number      of immigrant visas available during the current fiscal year      to natives of the country of the alien's birth under section      203(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C.      1153(a)).                                 ______                                       By
