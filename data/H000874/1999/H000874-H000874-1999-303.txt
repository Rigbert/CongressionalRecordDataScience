Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his explanation.  As this technical amendment was explained to me, Mr. Speaker, current Postal Service reporting requirements are continued with a modification which conforms those reports to the way the House now administers Members' allowances. I understand that there are additional technical amendments to this section which need to be worked out but that this particular amendment is time-sensitive, and that staff will present additional amendments for committee consideration in the next few months.  Is that the gentleman's understanding?
