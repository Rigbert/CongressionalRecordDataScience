Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1954 is a bill that has almost universal support in this House because it is a compromise. The Committee on the Judiciary on legislation relating to the Immigration and Naturalization Act has deep divisions.  The reason this bill is so strongly supported is twofold. One is that there is a demonstrated need to provide a naturalization road and the immigration benefits to those who have served our country, their immediate families and their survivors. Everybody agrees that this is part of the immigration law that needs to be changed and updated, particularly in light of those who have paid the ultimate price in defending America's freedoms in Iraq.  But I would like to give a word of caution, because this bill is a compromise. Everybody with an oar in the water and a differing viewpoint gave up something to ease the passage of this bill. If we allow the bill to emphasize the divisions that we have in the Congress and in the Committee on the Judiciary on immigration law and in the conference, then it is not going to have an easy road from here. But what we have given up to make H.R. 1954 an agreed-upon bill that will get an overwhelming vote in a few minutes should continue to be given up in the conference so we can speedily turn this bill into law and give the benefits to the people that we want to give the benefits to. As we proceed in this, I urge all of my colleagues to keep that in mind.
