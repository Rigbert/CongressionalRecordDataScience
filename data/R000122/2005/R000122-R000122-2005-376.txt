My understanding is that the production cycle for the system, these interceptors, is 12 per year. Yet the budget is asking for more than that. So I don't think taking $50 million--as I understand the amendment, $30 million taken from long-lead, ground-based interceptors--taking $30 million away I do not think would upset the production line schedule.
