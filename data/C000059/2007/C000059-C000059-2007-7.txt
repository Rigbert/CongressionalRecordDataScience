During that same time, more than 7 million new jobs have been created. Simply put, free trade works.  I strongly urge Congress to move forward with passing the recently negotiated trade agreements with South Korea and Colombia. These agreements will bring down barriers in two of the fastest growing markets in Asia and South America. American business sectors such as automobiles, agriculture, textiles and services will be allowed unprecedented access. In addition, favorable trade environments will be created for intellectual property, telecommunications and workers.  As Congress continues to examine its trade policy, we should not forget to take a close look at what we can do here at home to maximize the benefits of free trade while minimizing its impacts.  Mr. Speaker, since 2000, southern California has seen a 40 percent increase in container traffic on road and rails. This is causing serious transportation problems for both businesses and constituents in my district. The Nation must address this concern so that businesses can receive their goods efficiently and Americans are not overwhelmed by increased freight traffic. Fortunately, free trade affords us the resources we need to address its infrastructure impacts so that the prosperity it creates is shared by all.                          ____________________
