 President, I appreciate our Democrat colleagues joining us and proceeding to the House-passed bill. I have spoken to the Democratic leader and my colleagues on the Republican side and commit to offering an amendment to the House bill to fully fund the Department of Homeland Security, while addressing the President's Executive actions on a separate adjacent track through consideration of the Collins bill.  When the Senate proceeds to H.R. 240, I will offer a clean substitute and work to expedite consideration of the bill, as amended, to get it back over to the House this week. I would welcome bipartisan cooperation to pass the DHS funding bill as well as the commonsense Collins bill.
