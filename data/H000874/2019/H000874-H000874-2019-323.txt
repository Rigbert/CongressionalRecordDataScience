 As the gentleman knows, Madam Speaker, the House voted on this bill during the last two Congresses. The most recent time it was brought to the floor, the gentleman and his party were in control of the House, the Senate, and the Presidency. That bill was not brought up in the Senate.  The gentleman mentioned, earlier, H.R. 1 and that Mr. McConnell has said that wouldn't be brought up. In fact, when it passed this House, it went to the Senate, and it was not brought up by Senator McConnell. So there are no plans at this point in time for us to bring this up.
