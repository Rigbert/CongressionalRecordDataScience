President, in light of the vote and the fact that cloture has been invoked on the motion to concur, I ask unanimous consent that the motion to concur in the House amendment to the Senate amendment with an amendment be withdrawn, all postcloture time be yielded back, and the motion to concur in the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 3326 be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.
