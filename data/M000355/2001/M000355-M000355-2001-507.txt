 BENNETT. Certainly.  Mr. McCONNELL. Is the understanding of the Senator from Kentucky correct that the principle involved in the amendment of the Senator from Utah is that if all Federal political parties, and State and local political parties in even numbered years have to operate in 100-percent hard dollars, then those organizing political action committees which are the possessors of 100 percent of the hard dollars must raise their money through 100 percent hard dollars as well? In other words, the administrative costs of the parties that engage in 100-percent hard dollars would also be applied to corporations and unions. Is that the principle established?
