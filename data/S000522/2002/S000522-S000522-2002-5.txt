Mr. Speaker, nationally, only about three in ten veterans seeking jobs through the Veterans Employment and Training Service (VETS), which is managed by the Department of Labor, are finding work. And the work they are finding isn't necessarily in career-type jobs.  This federally-funded program, which is carried out through a partnership with the States, must do a better job.  The Committee's bill, H.R. 4015, as amended, would revamp VETS to allow it to workbetter within the framework of the recent Workforce Investment Act.  One of the bill's most important provisions would require the Secretary of Labor to carry our a program of financial and non-financial performance incentive awards to states to encourage them to improve and modernize their employment, training and placement services for veterans. The bill would also require any poorly performing states to develop and implement corrective action plans.  Mr. Speaker, I don't want to imply that states are not doing a good job. In fact, many are. I am confident that with the enactment of this legislation, the states with poor records will be given the flexibility and incentives they need to improve. The result will be that many more veterans will find good jobs and taxpayers will get a much better return on their investment in this program for veterans.  I want to commend the Chairman of the Benefits Subcommittee, Mike Simpson, for the extraordinary effort that led to a bill commanding the broad support needed to make this bill happen. I also want to commend the previous Chairman, Jack Quinn, the current Ranking Member, Sylvestre Reyes, and the former Ranking Member, Bob Filner, for their bipartisan support of this important bill.  I also want to thank the leadership of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, Chairman John Rockefeller, and Ranking Republican Arlen Specter, for their consideration of the House bill and the many improvements they suggested.  The legislative process has produced a strong bill that we can be proud to send to the President. This is a significant step toward improving the employment services a grateful Nation offers those Americans who have served in military uniform.  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to revise and extend my remarks and that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks, and include extraneous material on H.R. 4015, as amended.  For the benefit of my colleagues, I include at this point in the Record a joint explanatory statement describing the compromise agreement we have reached with the other body:Joint Explanatory Statement on Senate Amendments To House Amendments to                                H.R. 4015       H.R. 4015, as amended, the Jobs for Veterans Act, reflects      a Compromise Agreement the House and Senate Committees on      Veterans' Affairs have reached on H.R. 4015, as amended,      (``House Bill''). H.R. 4015, as amended, passed the House of      Representatives on May 21, 2002. There is no comparable      Senate bill.       The House and Senate Committees on Veterans' Affairs have      prepared the following explanation of H.R. 4015, as amended,      (``Compromise Agreement''). Clerical corrections, conforming      changes, and minor drafting, technical, and clarifying      changes are not noted in this document. Priority of Service for Veterans in Department of Labor Job Training                                 Programs                              Current Law       Section 4212 of title 38, United States Code, requires that      for certain Federal contracts of $25,000 or more, contractors      and subcontractors take affirmative action to employ and      advance in employment ``special disabled veterans'' (veterans      with serious employment handicaps or disability ratings of 30      percent or higher), Vietnam-era veterans, recently-separated      veterans, and other veterans who are ``preference eligible.''      Preference eligible veterans generally are veterans who have      served during wartime or in a campaign or expedition for      which a campaign badge has been authorized.       Under section 4214 of title 38, United States Code, the      Office of Personnel Management administers the Veterans      Readjustment Appointment (``VRA'') authority program to      promote employment and job advancement opportunities within      the Federal government for disabled veterans, certain      veterans of the Vietnam era, and veterans of the post-Vietnam      era who are qualified for such employment and advancement. In      general: (1) such appointments may be made up to and      including the GS-11 level or its equivalent; (2) a veteran      shall be eligible for such an appointment without regard to      the veteran's number of years of education; (3) a veteran who      receives VA disability compensation shall be given preference      for a VRA appointment over other veterans; (4) upon receipt      of a VRA appointment, a veteran may receive training or      education if the veteran has less than 15 years of education;      and (5) upon successful completion of the prescribed      probation period, a veteran may acquire competitive status.      Except for a veteran who has a service-connected disability      rated at 30 percent or more, a veteran of the Vietnam era      may receive a VRA appointment only during the period      ending 10 years after the date of the veteran's last      separation from active duty or December 31, 1995,      whichever is later.                               house bill       Section 2 of H.R. 4015 would create a new section 4215      within chapter 42 of title 38, United States Code, to provide      priority of service (over non-veterans) to veterans and      spouses of certain veterans for the receipt of employment,      training, and placement services in any qualified job      training program directly funded, in whole or in part, by the      Department of Labor, notwithstanding any other provision of      law. The Secretary of Labor would be authorized to establish      priorities among such covered persons to take into account      the needs of disabled veterans and such other factors as the      Secretary determines appropriate.       With respect to Federal contracts and subcontracts in the      amount of $100,000 or more, section 2 would provide that a      contractor and any subcontractor take affirmative action to      employ and advance in employment qualified veterans. This      would include immediate listing of employment openings for      such contracts through the appropriate employment delivery      system.       Section 2 would also change the Veterans Readjustment      Appointment (``VRA'') to the ``Veterans Recruitment      Appointment'' authority and change eligibility for these      appointments from Vietnam era and post-Vietnam era veterans      to qualified covered veterans (see below) within the 10-year      period that begins on the date of the veteran's last      discharge; the 10-year period would not apply to a veteran      with a service-connected disability of 30 percent or more.       Finally, section 2 would make eligible as ``covered      veterans'' for Federal contracts and subcontracts and the      Veterans Recruitment Appointment authority: disabled      veterans; veterans who served on active duty during a war or      in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge has      been authorized; veterans who, while serving on active duty      in the Armed Forces, participated in a United States military      operation for which an Armed Forces service medal was      awarded; or veterans discharged or released from military      service within the past three years.                          compromise agreement       Section 2 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House      language with amendments.       The agreement would delete the 10-year eligibility period      for a VRA appointment, in light of the broader Veterans      Recruitment (not ``Readjustment'') Appointment authority      embodied in the Compromise Agreement.       The Committees note that the definition of the term      ``covered person'' for priority of service in Department of      Labor veterans job training programs includes both veterans      and certain spouses and surviving spouses of deceased      veterans. Specifically, the provision would include a      surviving spouse of a veteran who died as a result of a      service-connected disability, including the surviving spouse      of a veteran who died in the active military, naval or air      service, and the surviving spouse of a veteran who was      totally disabled at the time of death. The provision would      also apply to spouses of active duty servicemembers who have      for a period of at least 90 days been missing in action,      captured by a hostile force or forcibly detained or interned      in line of duty by a foreign government and the spouses of      veterans who are totally disabled due to a service-connected      disability. Financial and Non-Financial Performance Incentive Awards for Quality          Veterans Employment, Training, and Placement Services                              current law       No provision.                               House bill       Section 3 of H.R. 4015 would create a new section 4112      within chapter 41 of title 38, United States Code, to require      the Secretary to carry out a program of performance incentive      awards to States to encourage improvement and modernization      of employment, training and placement services to veterans.      The Secretary would provide greater amounts to States that      furnish the highest quality of services, but also would      provide awards to States that have made significant      improvements in services. States could use such awards to      hire additional State veterans' employment and training staff      or for such other purposes relating to these services that      the Secretary may approve. Awards would be obligated by the      State during the program year in which the award was received      and the subsequent program year.       Section 3 also would authorize additional funds to be      appropriated for the Secretary to carry out the program of      performance incentive awards in the following amounts: $10      million for the program year beginning in fiscal year 2004;      $25 million for the program year beginning in fiscal year      2005; $50 million for the program year beginning in fiscal      year 2006; $75 million for the program year beginning in      fiscal year 2007; and $100 million for the program year      beginning in fiscal year 2008.                          compromise agreement       Section 3 of the Compromise Agreement would establish a      system of financial and non-financial incentive awards to be      administered by the States, based on criteria established by      the Secretary in consultation with the States. Disabled      Veterans Outreach Program Specialists (``DVOP''), Local      Veterans Employment Representatives (``LVER''), Workforce      Investment Act (``WIA''), and Wagner-Peyser staffs would be      eligible for each award. Beginning in program years during or      after fiscal year 2004, the Secretary would be required to      identify and assign one percent of the annual grant to each      State for the State to use as a performance incentive      financial award (see section 4). Under this section, each      State would be     required to describe how it would administer this award in      its annual grant application to the Secretary (see section      4). States would also administer the non-financial      performance incentive award program based on criteria      established by the Secretary.       The Committees intend that the Secretary's criteria be      broad in order to give States maximum flexibility in the      manner chosen to recognize employees for excellence in      service delivery to veterans or improvements thereto. The      Committees also intend that States use Salary and Expense      (S) funds to pay for such items as employee recognition      plaques and other modest forms of recognition, as part of the      non-financial performance incentive awards program.  Refinement of Job Training and Placement Functions of the Department                              current law       Chapter 41 of title 38, United States Code, establishes      policies governing the administration of veterans' employment      and training services by the States, as funded by Department      of Labor funds.       Section 4101 of title 38, United States Code, defines terms      used in the chapter, such as ``disabled veteran,'' ``eligible      person,'' and ``local employment service office.''       In section 4102, Congress declares as its intent and      purpose that there shall be an effective: (1) job and      training counseling service program; (2) employment placement      service program; and (3) job training placement service      program for eligible veterans and eligible persons.       Section 4102A specifies the job duties of the Assistant      Secretary of Labor for Veterans' Employment and Training      (``ASVET'') and Regional Administrators for Veterans'      Employment and Training (``RAVET''). The RAVET is required to      be a veteran. The Deputy Assistant Secretary for Veterans      Employment and Training (``DASVET'') is also required to be a      veteran. The ASVET need not be a veteran.       Section 4103 prescribes in detail the 15 job duties of      Directors (``DVET'') and Assistant Directors (``ADVET'') of      Veterans' Employment and Training. It also requires that the      Secretary of Labor assign to each State one ADVET for every      250,000 veterans and eligible persons in the State veteran's      population.       Section 4103A prescribes the appointment of one DVOP for      every 7,400 veterans who are between the ages of 20 and 64      residing in each State. This section also requires that each      DVOP be a veteran and specifies that preference be given to      qualified disabled veterans in filling these positions. It      prescribes where a DVOP is to be stationed in furnishing      services and the specific functions that DVOP perform.       Section 4104 requires that in any fiscal year funding be      available to the States to employ 1,600 full-time LVERs. This      section prescribes that funding furnished to the States for      LVERs shall be assigned in each State on January 1, 1987,      plus one additional LVER per State. This section also      specifies in detail the manner in which the 1,600 LVERs shall      be allocated to the States, and the manner in which the      States shall assign LVERs to local employment service offices      based on the number of veterans and eligible persons who      register for assistance. This section also requires that in      appointing LVERs, preference shall be given to qualified      eligible veterans or eligible persons. Preference is accorded      first to qualified eligible veterans, and then to qualified      eligible persons. Lastly, this section prescribes the      specific functions that LVERs shall perform.       Section 4104A requires that each State employment agency      develop and apply DVOP and LVER programs. It requires the      Secretary to furnish prototype standards to the States. This      section also requires DVETs and ADVETs to furnish appropriate      assistance to States in developing and implementing such      standards.       Section 4106 requires the Secretary to estimate the funds      necessary for the proper and efficient administration of      chapters 41, 42, and 43 of title 38, United States Code. This      section authorizes such sums as may be necessary for      administration of chapter 41 services, including the National      Veterans' Employment and Training Services Institute      (``NVETSI'').       In general, section 4107 of title 38, United States Code,      requires the Secretary of Labor to establish and carry out      various administrative controls to ensure veterans and      eligible persons receive job placement, job training, or some      other form of assistance such as individual job development      or employment counseling services. This section also requires      the Secretary to submit to the Committees on Veterans'      Affairs of the House and Senate not later than February 1 of      each year, a report on the success during the previous      program year of the Department of Labor (``DOL'') and State      employment service agencies in furnishing veterans'      employment and training services.       Section 4109 requires that the Secretary make available      such funds as may be necessary to operate a NVETSI for      training DVOP, LVER, DVET, ADVET, and RAVET personnel.                               house bill       Section 4 of H.R. 4015 would amend sections 4102A, 4103,      4103A, 4104, and 4109 of title 38, United States Code.       Section 4 of H.R. 4015 would amend current law section      4102A, of title 38, United States Code. The ASVET would be      required to be a veteran. It also would impose new      qualifications for the position of DASVET. In doing so, it      would make this position a career federal civil service      position. The individual appointed to this position would be      required to have at least five years of continuous Federal      service in the executive branch immediately preceding      appointment as Deputy Assistant Secretary, and to be a      veteran.       This section would set forth conditions for receipt of      funding by States to include a requirement that a State      submit an application for a grant or contract describing the      manner in which the State would furnish employment, training,      and placement services. A service delivery plan would include      a description of the DVOP and LVER duties assigned by the      State and other matters.       Section 4 would revise the methods by which the Secretary      furnishes funds to a State. It would require the Secretary to      make funds available for a fiscal year to each State in      proportion to the number of veterans seeking employment using      such criteria as the Secretary may establish in regulations.      Under this section, the proportion of funding would reflect      the ratio of the total number of veterans residing in the      State who are seeking employment to the total number of      veterans seeking employment in all States.       Section 4 also would require:       1. A State to annually submit to the Secretary of Labor an      application for a grant or contract that includes a plan      describing the manner in which the State would furnish      employment, training, and placement services, with a      description of DVOP and LVER duties assigned by the State.      The plan would also be required to describe the manner in      which DVOPs and LVERs would be integrated into the employment      service delivery systems in the State, the veteran population      to be served, and additional information the Secretary might      require;       2. The Secretary to make available to each State based on      an application approved by the Secretary, an amount of      funding in proportion to the number of veterans seeking      employment using such criteria as the Secretary might      establish in regulation, including civilian labor force and      unemployment data;       3. The Secretary to phase-in such annual funding over the      three fiscal year-periods that begin on October 1, 2002;       4. The Secretary to establish minimum funding levels and      hold-harmless criteria in administering funding to the      States;       5. The State to develop and implement a corrective action      plan to be submitted to the Secretary when a State has an      entered-employment rate that the Secretary determines is      deficient for the preceding year;       6. The Secretary to establish by regulation a uniform      national threshold entered-employment rate for a program year      by which determinations of deficiency might be made. The      Secretary would be required to take into account the      applicable annual unemployment data for the State and      consider other factors, such as prevailing economic      conditions, that affect performance of individuals providing      employment, training, and placement services in the State;       7. The State to notify the Secretary on an annual basis of,      and provide a supporting rationale for, each non-veteran who      is employed as a DVOP and LVER for a period in excess of six      months;       8. The Secretary to assign to each region a representative      of the Veterans' Employment and Training Service (``VETS'')      to serve as RAVET. The RAVET would be required to be a      veteran; and       9. The ASVET to establish and implement a comprehensive      accountability system to measure the performance of delivery      systems in a State. The accountability system would be      required to be (1) consistent with State performance measures      applicable under section 136(b) of the Workforce Investment      Act of 1998, and (2) appropriately weighted to provide      special consideration for veterans requiring intensive      services and for veterans who enroll in readjustment      counseling services furnished by the Department of Veterans      Affairs.       Supervisory Personnel. Section 4 would also amend current      section 4103 of title 38, United States Code, to authorize      the Secretary to assign as supervisory personnel such      representatives of VETS as the Secretary determines      appropriate. It would also replace the specific requirements      for appointment of ADVET with a more flexible authority to      appoint supervisory personnel.       Disabled Veterans Outreach Program Specialists. This      section would amend current section 4103A of title 38, United      States Code, to require, subject to approval by the      Secretary, that States employ a sufficient number of full or      part-time DVOPs to carry out intensive services to meet the      employment needs of special disabled veterans, other disabled      veterans and other eligible veterans. It would require to the      maximum extent practicable, that such employees be qualified      veterans. Preference would be given to qualified disabled      veterans.       Local Veterans Employment Specialists. Section 4 would      amend current law section 4104 of title 38, United States      Code, by requiring, subject to approval by the Secretary,      that a State employ such full and part-time LVERs as the      State determines appropriate and efficient to carry out      employment, training and placement services. It would      require, to the maximum extent practicable, that such      employees be qualified veterans.       This section would require that each LVER be      administratively responsible to the manager of the employment      service delivery system. Under this section, the LVER would     provide reports, not less frequently than quarterly, to the      manager of such office and to the DVET for the State      regarding compliance with Federal law and regulations with      respect to special services and priorities for eligible      veterans and eligible persons.       National Veterans' Employment and Training Services      Institute. Additionally, section 4 would amend current      section 4109 of title 38, United States Code, to clarify the      authority of the NVETSI to enter into contracts or agreements      with departments or agencies of the United States or of a      State, or with other organizations, to carry out training in      providing veterans' employment, training, and placement      services. Further, it would require that each annual budget      submission include a separate listing of the amount of      funding proposed for NVETSI.       Finally, section 4 would require that the Secretary, within      18 months of enactment, enhance the delivery of services by      providing ``one-stop'' services and assistance to covered      persons by way of the Internet and by other electronic means.                          Compromise Agreement       Section 4 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House      language with amendments.       Under this section, the individual appointed as DASVET      would be required to have at least five years of service in a      management position as a Federal civil service employee or      comparable service in a management position in the Armed      Forces preceding appointment as DASVET.       The annual grant application plan submitted by the States      would have an additional requirement to describe the manner      in which the respective States would administer the      performance incentives established in section 3. The      Committees note that other aspects of the State plan and      grant application requirements contained in the House-passed      bill, such as describing DVOP and LVER duties, are retained.       The Compromise Agreement clarifies that State corrective      action plans would be submitted to the Secretary for      approval, and if approved, would be expeditiously      implemented. If the Secretary disapproved a corrective action      plan, the Secretary would be required to take such steps as      would be necessary for the State to implement corrective      actions.       The Secretary would also be required to identify and assign      one percent of the funding grant to each State to establish      financial performance incentive awards. Further, the      Secretary would have on-going authority to furnish technical      assistance to any State that the Secretary determines has, or      may have, a deficient entered-employment rate, including      assistance in developing a corrective action plan.       The Committees intend that the Secretary should offer      technical assistance in an anticipatory way, so as to avoid      deficient performance.       The Compromise Agreement would require that the DVET be a      bona fide resident of the State for two years to qualify for      such a position.       Lastly, the Compromise Agreement does not require that the      ASVET, DASVET, RVET, DVET, or ADVET be veterans. The      Committees encourage the appointment of veterans to these      positions, but do not believe a statutory requirement is      necessary.       The amendments made by subsection (a) revising department      level senior officials and functions, and subsection (b)      revising statutorily-defined duties of DVOP and LVERs, would      take effect on the date of enactment of this Act, and apply      to program and fiscal years under chapter 41 of title 38,      United States Code, beginning on or after such date. Additional Improvements in Veterans' Employment and Training Services                              Current Law       Sections 4102, 4106(a), 4107(a), 4107(c)(1), and section      4109(a) of title 38, United States Code, refer to terms such      as ``job and job training counseling service program.''      ``proper counseling,'' ``employment counseling services,''      ``the number counseled,'' and ``counseling,'' respectively,      in describing services available to veterans and eligible      persons under this chapter.       Section 4101(7) of title 38, United States Code, defines      the term ``local employment service office'' as a service      delivery point which has an intrinsic management structure      and at which employment services are offered in accordance      with the Wagner-Peyser Act.       Section 4107(c)(1) of title 38, United States Code, defines      ``veterans of the Vietnam era'' as a group which the      Secretary must address with respect to various employment and      training services in the annual report to the Committees on      Veterans' Affairs. Section 4107(c)92) requires submission in      the report of data on the ``job placement rate'' for veterans      and eligible persons.                               House Bill       Section 5 of H.R. 4015 would substitute the words      ``intensive services'' for the word ``counseling'' throughout      chapter 41 of title 38, United States Code, so as to make the      chapter consistent with section 134(d)(3) of the Workforce      Investment Act of 1998, Public Law 105-220. This section      would also add programs carried out by the VETS to ease      transition of servicemembers to civilian careers as a new      program the Secretary would administer.       This section of the bill would make a definitional change      so as to replace ``local employment service office'' and its      current-law definition with ``employment service delivery      system,'' The latter term would be redefined as a service      delivery system at which or through which labor exchange      services, including employment, training, and placement      services, are offered in accordance with the Wagner-Peyser      Act.       This section also would replace ``job placement rate'' with      ``the rate of entered employment (as determined in a manner      consistent with State performance measure applicable under      section 136(b) of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998).''      Further, with respect to the Secretary's annual report, it      would replace ``veterans of the Vietnam era'' and ``eligible      persons registered for assistance'' with ''eligible persons,      recently separated veterans (as defined in section 4211(6) of      title 38), and servicemembers transitioning to civilian      careers who are registered for assistance,''Lastly, section 5      would add two additional requirements to the Secretary's      annual report submitted to the Committees on Veterans'      Affairs of the House and Senate. First, the report must      include information on the operation during the preceding      program year of the program of performance incentive awards      for quality employment services under section 4112 of this      title, including an analysis of the amount of incentives      distributed to each State and the rational for such      distribution. Second, a report would be required on the      ``performance of States and organizations and entities      carrying out employment, training, and placement services      under this chapter, as measured by revised performance      criteria. In the case of a State that the Secretary      determines has not met the minimum standard of performance      established by the Secretary, the Secretary would be required      to include an analysis of the extent and reasons for the      State's failure to meet that minimum standard, together with      the State's plan for corrective action during the succeeding      year.''                          Compromise Agreement       Section 5 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House      language with an amendment. The Secretary's annual report to      the Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the House and Senate      would be required to include information on the operation      during the preceding program year of performance incentive      awards for quality employment services administered through      the States. The report would not require an analysis of the      amount of incentives distributed to each State and the      rationale for such distribution because each State's DVOP/     LVER grant would identify and assign one percent of the grant      for use by the State for the financial incentive awards.    Committee To Raise Employer Awareness of Skills of Veterans and                       Benefits or Hiring Veterans                              Current Law       No provision.                               House Bill       Section 6 of H.R. 4015 would authorize $3 million to be      appropriated to the Secretary of labor from the Employment      Security Administration account in the Unemployment Trust      Fund for each of fiscal years 2003 through 2005 to establish      within the Department of Labor the President's National Hire      Veterans Committee. The Committee would furnish information      to employers with respect to the training and skills of      veterans and disabled veterans, and with respect to the      advantages afforded employers by hiring veterans. The      Secretary of Labor would provide staff and administrative      support to the Committee to assist it in carrying out its      duties under this section. Upon request of the Committee, the      head of any Federal department or agency would be authorized      to detail staff on a non-reimbursable basis. The Committee      would also have the authority to contract with government and      private agencies to furnish information to employers. The      Committee would terminate on December 31, 2005.                          Compromise agreement       Section 6 of the Compromise Agreement contains the House      language.      Sense of Congress Commending Veterans and Military Service                              Organizations                              current Law       No provision.                               House Bill       Section 7 of H.R. 4015 would express the sense of Congress      commending veterans and military service organizations, and      encouraging them to provide job placement assistance to      veterans who are job-ready by making personal computers      available to them with access to electronic job placement      services and programs.                          Compromise Agreement       The Compromise Agreement does not include this section.             Report on Implementation of Employment Reforms                              Current Law       No provision.                               House Bill       Section 8 of H.R. 4015 would authorize $1 million for the      Secretary of Labor to enter into a contract with an      appropriate organization or entity to conduct an 18-month      study to quantify the economic benefit to the United States      attributable to the provision of employment and training      services provided under chapter 41 of title 38, United States      Code, in helping veterans to attain long-term, sustained      employment.                          Compromise Agreement       Section 7 of the compromise Agreement would direct the      Comptroller General of the United States to conduct a study      on the implementation by the Secretary of Labor of the      provisions of this title during the program years that begin      during fiscal years 2003 and 2004. The study would include an      assessment of the effect of this title on employment,      training, and placement services furnished to veterans. Not      later than six months after the conclusion of the program      year that begins during fiscal year 2004, the Comptroller      General would submit to Congress a report on the conducted      study. Under this section, the report would include      recommendations for legislation or administrative action.       This is a bipartisan bill, and I urge Members to support      it. Concurred in Senate Amendment to House Amendment to Senate Amendments  H.R. 3253, to amend title 38, United States Code, to provide for the establishment within the Department of Veterans Affairs of improved emergency medical preparedness, research, and education programs to combat terrorism, and for other purposes.
