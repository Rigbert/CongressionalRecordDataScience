Speaker, so what do Congressional Republicans have as an alternative solution? Nothing.  The cost to roll this rule back is significant. It is not good for retirees or workers, and it maintains the growing burden on taxpayers who fund assistance programs.  I urge all of my colleagues to reject this shortsighted action. Stand up for the American working class and oppose both H.J. Res. 66 and H.J. Res. 67.
