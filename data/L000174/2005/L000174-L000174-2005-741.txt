President, I rise in support of amendment 395. There are many Members on both sides of the aisle with strong objections to the REAL ID Act. Those of us who value our Nation's historic commitment to asylum do not want to see severe restrictions placed on the ability of asylum seekers to obtain refuge here. Those of us who value states rights side with the National Governors Association, the National Conference of State Legislatures, and the Council of State Governments in opposing the imposition of unworkable Federal mandates on State drivers license policies. Those of us who value the environment and the rule of law object to requiring the DHS Secretary to waive all laws, environmental or otherwise, that may get in the way of the construction of border fences, and forbidding judicial review of the Secretary's actions.  To include the REAL ID Act in the conference report for this supplemental would also deprive the Judiciary Committee and the Senate as a whole of the opportunity to consider and review these wide-ranging provisions.  The majority leader has indicated in recent days that the Senate will be considering immigration reform this year. The provisions in the REAL ID Act should be considered at that time and in conjunction with a broader debate about immigration. They should not be forced upon the Senate by the leadership of the other body.  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this resolution, which I am proud to cosponsor with Senators Feinstein, Brownback, Alexander, and many others.
