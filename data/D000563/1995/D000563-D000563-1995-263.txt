His position as ranking member of the subcommittee which has jurisdiction over this issue certainly gives him a good view of the issues, and I appreciate the analysis which he has given us.  At this point I would like to make it clear and I hope I made it clear in my opening statement that that statement about worker safety, this special order, is a bipartisan effort, and I am happy to recognize one of my friends and one of my colleagues, the gentlewoman from Maryland [Mrs. Morella], a Republican Member, who is going to address the question of worker safety as it relates to Federal workers.
