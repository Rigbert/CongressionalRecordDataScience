Hart to be the Director of the National Institute of Justice, the research and development agency of the Department of Justice.  For the last 6 years, Ms. Hart has served as Chief Counsel of the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections, and before that as an Assistant District Attorney in Philadelphia for many years.  And it is not only her resume, but the strong support of former District Attorney from Philadelphia, my good friend Senator Specter, that makes it easy for me to vote to confirm Ms. Hart.  I hope that, once confirmed, Ms. Hart will take her stewardship of the National Institute of Justice seriously. The NIJ is tasked with undertaking objective, independent, non-partisan research on crime and justice issues. In order to do that it is crucial that NIJ remain independent from the political aims of the administration and the Justice Department, and remain committed to publishing its research no matter what the results.  Ms. Hart assured us, both at her hearing before the Judiciary Committee, and in answer to written questions submitted to her, that she understands this, and I look forward to seeing the results of the research conducted by NIJ under her supervision. In particular, I look forward to seeing the NIJ study on the role of racial bias in the federal death penalty carried out in a way that is true to its original intent, and not in a way that presumes before it even begins that racial bias is not a problem. And, again, at her hearing, and in writing afterwards, Ms. Hart assured us that would be the case.  Because of those answers, and, as I said, because of Senator Specter's support, I am pleased to be able to vote to confirm Sarah Hart.
