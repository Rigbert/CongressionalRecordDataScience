President, I just wanted to say a few words to the Senator from Pennsylvania.  I would like to congratulate my colleague on the occasion of his 10,000th vote in the Senate. He has been a colleague of mine now for the 13 years I have served in the Senate, and I have enjoyed working with him. Occasionally, we have been on opposite sides of an issue, and at times we have been on the same side. I much prefer the latter. He is an able attorney and a thoughtful and reflective Member of the Senate. I have enjoyed my service with him, and I congratulate him on his 10,000th vote.  I am particularly pleased that he cast that vote from this side of the Senate. I look forward to working with Senator Specter and thank the people of Pennsylvania for giving us an opportunity to work with him and to share his public service these many years. I congratulate the Senator.
