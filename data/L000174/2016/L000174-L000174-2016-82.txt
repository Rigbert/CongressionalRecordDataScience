President, I wanted to share with my friends in the Senate some news from across the pond. Sir Peter Westmacott, who served as British Ambassador to the United States from 2012 until January of this year, was recently bestowed the high honor of Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Saint Michael and Saint George for his services to British diplomacy. In other words, Sir Peter is now a ``super knight.''  Sir Peter has served British diplomatic interests at home and abroad for decades. His commitment and dedication to peaceful cooperation in the international community is unparalleled. Sir Peter first came to Washington, DC, as Counsellor for Political and Public Affairs in Washington, a position he held from 1993 to 1996, after which he returned home to serve as Director for the Americas at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.  From 2002 to 2006, Sir Peter Westmacott served as Her Majesty's Ambassador to Turkey. His experience and unwavering commitment to diplomacy were instrumental as he navigated difficult and tragic waters following the November 2003 terrorist attack on the British Embassy in Turkey. He also fostered diplomatic discussions surrounding Turkey's candidacy as a member of the European Union. Beginning in 2007, Sir Peter served as Her Majesty's ambassador to France, where he promoted diplomacy, trade, and investments between France and the U.K.  During his time as Her Majesty's Ambassador to the United States, Sir Peter worked tirelessly to maintain and strengthen U.K.-U.S. relations and to promote diverse and inclusive cultures. His long career illustrates his deep belief in unity and that we, as nations, can accomplish more together than we could dream of achieving alone.  Marcelle and I are lucky to count Peter Westmacott and his wife, Susie, among our friends and are proud of him for earning this prestigious honor. I wanted to share with the Senate the full citation from the Queen's 2016 Birthday Honours for Diplomatic Services: ``Peter Westmacott has successfully and relentlessly pursued British interests at the highest levels of international diplomacy, including over the last ten years through three important relationships for the UK--the USA, France and Turkey. He has used every aspect of modern diplomacy--political, prosperity, soft power and leadership--to deliver high impact outcomes for the UK. In each of these most recent roles he has faced difficult challenges to deliver for the UK whether it be deepening the bilateral relationship at the highest levels or persuading partners to work with the UK on difficult issues. He has been one of the UK's leading and most accomplished British Ambassadors of his generation.''  I thank Peter and Susie for their many achievements and dedication to strengthening the special relationship between the United States and United Kingdom.                          ____________________
