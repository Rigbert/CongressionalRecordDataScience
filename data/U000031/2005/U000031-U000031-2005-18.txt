Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 268) expressing the sense of the Congress regarding oversight of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers.  The Clerk read as follows:                            H. Con. Res. 268       Whereas the origins of the Internet can be found in United      States Government funding of research to develop packet-     switching technology and communications networks, starting      with the ``ARPANET'' network established by the Department of      Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency in the 1960s and      carried forward by the National Science Foundation's      ``NSFNET'';       Whereas in subsequent years the Internet evolved from a      United States Government research initiative to a global tool      for information exchange as in the 1990s it was      commercialized by private sector investment, technical      management and coordination;       Whereas since its inception the authoritative root zone      server--the file server system that contains the master list      of all top level domain names made available for routers      serving the Internet--has been physically located in the      United States;       Whereas today the Internet is a global communications      network of inestimable value;       Whereas the continued success and dynamism of the Internet      is dependent upon continued private sector leadership and the      ability for all users to participate in its continued      evolution;       Whereas in allowing people all around the world freely to      exchange information, communicate with one another, and      facilitate economic growth and democracy, the Internet has      enormous potential to enrich and transform human society;       Whereas existing structures have worked effectively to make      the Internet the highly robust medium that it is today;       Whereas the security and stability of the Internet's      underlying infrastructure, the domain name and addressing      system, must be maintained;       Whereas the United States has been committed to the      principles of freedom of expression and the free flow of      information, as expressed in Article 19 of the Universal      Declaration of Human Rights, and reaffirmed in the Geneva      Declaration of Principles adopted at the first phase of the      World Summit on the Information Society;       Whereas the U.S. Principles on the Internet's Domain Name      and Addressing System, issued on June 30, 2005, represent an      appropriate framework for the coordination of the system at      the present time;       Whereas the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and      Numbers popularly known as ICANN, is the proper organization      to coordinate the technical day-to-day operation of the      Internet's domain name and addressing system;       Whereas all stakeholders from around the world, including      governments, are encouraged to advise ICANN in its decision-     making;       Whereas ICANN makes significant efforts to ensure that the      views of governments and all Internet stakeholders are      reflected in its activities;       Whereas governments have legitimate concerns with respect      to the management of their country code top level domains;       Whereas the United States Government is committed to      working successfully with the international community to      address those concerns, bearing in mind the need for      stability and security of the Internet's domain name and      addressing system;       Whereas the topic of Internet governance, as currently      being discussed in the United Nations World Summit on the      Information Society is a broad and complex topic;       Whereas it is appropriate for governments and other      stakeholders to discuss Internet governance, given that the      Internet will likely be an increasingly important part of the      world economy and society in the 21st Century;       Whereas Internet governance discussions in the World Summit      should focus on the real threats to the Internet's growth and      stability, and not recommend changes to the current regime of      domain name and addressing system management and coordination      on political grounds unrelated to any technical need; and       Whereas market-based policies and private sector leadership      have allowed this medium the flexibility to innovate and      evolve: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate      concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--       (1) it is incumbent upon the United States and other      responsible governments to send clear signals to the      marketplace that the current structure of oversight and      management of the Internet's domain name and addressing      service works, and will continue to deliver tangible benefits      to Internet users worldwide in the future; and       (2) therefore the authoritative root zone server should      remain physically located in     the United States and the Secretary of Commerce should      maintain oversight of ICANN so that ICANN can continue to      manage the day-to-day operation of the Internet's domain name      and addressing system well, remain responsive to all Internet      stakeholders worldwide, and otherwise fulfill its core      technical mission.
