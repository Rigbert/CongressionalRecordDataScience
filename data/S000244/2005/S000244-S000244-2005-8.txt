Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the Speaker's table the Senate bill (S. 2167) to amend the USA PATRIOT ACT to extend the sunset of certain provisions of that Act and the lone wolf provision of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 to July 1, 2006, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.  The Clerk read the title of the Senate bill.
