 President, I rise to draw attention to FEMA's proposed Public Assistance Insurance Rule that is currently pending at the Office of Management and Budget. The rule is referenced in the report language of both the House and Senate VA/HUD Appropriations bills.  I support FEMA's efforts to reduce the costs of federal disasters. However, the proposed rule, in its current form, would require public institutions to purchase ``all hazard'' insurance for public buildings. This includes local school districts, cities, non-profit hospitals, universities and other non-profits.  California risk managers and insurance brokers have told me there currently is no insurance available to public institutions. They would be unable to obtain, at any price, the coverage required by the FEMA rule.  Even if insurance were to be available, it is highly unlikely that the individual insurers would be able to pay out in the event of a catastrophic earthquake. The financial implications for California are enormous and should be considered before implementing the proposed FEMA rule.  During Committee markup, I was told by Senator Bond that cities and counties that could not obtain hazard insurance would be exempt from the FEMA rule. FEMA says this is not the case. I believe the FEMA proposal is ambiguous in many areas and it needs to be more thoroughly examined. I am concerned that FEMA may be rushing to implement this regulation without a thorough understanding of its true impact.  The House VA-HUD bill requests a GAO study of this issue before moving forward with the proposed rule. The Senate bill makes no mention of a GAO study, and supports the proposed rule change. It is my sincere hope that we can work together to develop an approach similar to that of the House. I believe that we must have an independent analysis of this important and potentially costly issue before it is finalized.                             KYOTO PROTOCOL
