President, I thank the distinguished senior Senator from Connecticut for his kind words. Having served as attorney general of his State and in various other roles in our courts, he understands very much when he says justice delayed is justice denied. Whether you are a plaintiff or a defendant, that is true.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be recognized for 5 minutes and Senator Murphy of Connecticut be recognized for 5 minutes.
