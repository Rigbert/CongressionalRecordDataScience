Speaker, I recognize the serious difficulties that face our National Park System, including the deterioration of our public lands and the impact of likely budget cuts. Like many of my colleagues, I strongly believe that we must address these challenges. However, I do not believe that H.R. 260 is the best way to do so.  Two bills intended to reform the National Park Service have been introduced to the House of Representatives this year. Both of these measures, H.R. 260 and H.R. 2181, recognize the need for efforts to improve the management of our national parks, but they adopt very different approaches toward this important goal.  H.R. 2181 would generate the revenue that our National Park Service needs to improve its visitor services and repair roads and trails in parks across the country. This bill would require individuals who sell concessions in our national parks to provide a fair return to our Nation's citizens for the first time in decades. H.R. 2181 would also make modest modifications in the fees charged for the use of our national parks and would direct the added revenue toward the needs of the National Park System.  H.R. 260 would require the Interior Department to develop a comprehensive plan for the future of the National Park System. This bill, however, would also create a closure commission to recommend which of our nation's park units should be closed or privatized. Among the likely targets of such a commission would be hundreds of small, but important parks across the country.  One such park is the Roger Williams National Memorial in Providence, RI. This park is very small, both in its area and its demands on Federal funding, but it meets a large need of many Rhode Islanders. Each year, nearly 150,000 people visit the park, which, like its namesake, represents the best of our country. Roger Williams, who founded my home State, remains a proud example of our Nation's commitment to religious freedom. The park bearing his name honors his contribution to our Nation's history and provides Rhode Islanders with a needed recreational and environmentally preserved area in our State's capital city.  The status of the Roger Williams National Memorial and the hundreds of parks like it nationwide is a critical issue that deserves full and open debate. However, by bringing H.R. 260 to the floor under suspension of the rules, the Republican majority prevents open debate on this issue. Today, the House will not even consider H.R. 2181, despite the fact that this well-crafted measure is sponsored by distinguished members of both parties.  I urge my colleagues to stand for open debate on the future of our national parks. I urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 260.                          ____________________
