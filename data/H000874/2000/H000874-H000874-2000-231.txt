Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. McCarthy).  Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the Hoyer amendment.  Mr. Speaker, I only have a short amount of time, but I think there is something we should talk about very seriously.  After-school programs do work. Unfortunately, we are going to see cuts in New York State alone. I was in my schools this morning. And I know our schools want it, our parents want it, and certainly our children want it.  We are seeing more and more children being left alone after school. We can take that time, and we can use that time to make sure our children are enriched with academic programs, making sure they are in a safe environment, and certainly raising their intellect on everything else.  Why am I doing this? Why am I supporting this? Because I happen to thinkthat is one way of reducing crime, because I happen to think that is one way of making sure our young people do not go into drugs and alcohol and then violence.  This is a program that can work, it should work, and certainly we should be supporting this.
