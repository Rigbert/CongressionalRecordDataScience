Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, H.R. 858 is a good bill. It helps working people, it helps the environment, it saves the forest, and it helps wildlife. It certainly is not everything that I hoped for in terms of timber supply, and I will be the first one to say that again. But it is what the people in northern California want, and in northern California the people are directly affected, and I say all the people, and they deserve congressional help.                              {time}  1130  This is a pilot project. The bill is just as simple, just like the Quincy Library Group agreement. It directs the Forest Service to implement a science-based fire protection and forest health plan for three national forests in northern California. There are two cornerstones of the bill. Thinning, taking the volatility out of the forest, and fuelbreak work outside of roadless areas; and, second, a requirement to build fuelbreaks on 40,000 to 60,000 acres per year in roaded areas. This means thinning smaller trees, leaving larger trees, and generally improving the habitat and the condition of forests.  I want to stress again, everyone wins with this bill: Local environmental groups, timber workers, again the wildlife, school children, and communities throughout the region. That is why this bill has the support of heavy duty environmentalists like the Friends of Plumas Wilderness and the Plumas Audubon Society. These groups have sued to stop nearly every timber sale in northern California, but they support this bill.  Six labor organizations, like the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and the United Paperworkers, also support the bill. The California Farm Bureau, the Society of American Foresters, Governor Pete Wilson, State assembly members, California county education offices, county boards of supervisors all support the bill. I could go on and on with a list of those who support the legislation.  Frankly, Mr. Chairman, I did not think I would see the day when the staunchest people in the environmental movement, their timber company foes, the union work force, and government officials would actually agree on the timber issues in their own backyard.  That day came almost 1,500 days ago in the public library in Quincy, CA, when neighbors from all walks of life actually agreed on a forest health, land allocation, and economic stability plan. But the plan has not been implemented now for 4 years. People have tried. The Quincy Group is still trying. That is why we are here on the floor with this bill that directs the implementation of their plan.  It is a sad day, Mr. Chairman, that this Forest Service under this administration cannot do what we are directing them to do today in this plan. The management of our forests under this administration is deplorable. It is, in fact, a crime and a sin in what they have done to our forests, because there is no management.  I must say, Mr. Chairman, that the gentlewoman from Idaho [Mrs. Chenoweth], the gentleman from California [Mr. Herger], and I have been very, very reasonable in this bill, reasonable to the point that I am wondering whether we have made too many accommodations as I said when I spoke on the rule. It is really not what I would like. But again I want to stress it is up to the Congress to start listening to the people of America, especially those directly affected by actions of this Congress.  We have gone through 27 drafts of this bill between the 104th Congress and today. That bothers me to some extent because we are going to hear later on, ``We weren't told, we weren't notified, we weren't asked, we didn't participate.'' Twenty-seven different drafts were worked on.  No less than 50 modifications that the gentlewoman from Idaho [Mrs. Chenoweth] shepherded through her subcommittee and then through the full committee. My substitute has 16 changes plus 11 new subsections or paragraphs. Each address one or more of the concerns about the bill.  When national environmentalists complained that the bill might allow some timber harvesting in spotted owl habitat, the gentlewoman from Idaho [Mrs. Chenoweth] removed two entire pages of the bill that gave rise to the concern.  When some said the Quincy bill did not protect water and riparian areas, the gentlewoman from Idaho [Mrs. Chenoweth] offered an amendment that ensured that riparian areas would be protected with the same standards in the President's Northwest Forest Plan.  Recently, riparian restoration was raised. On page 4 of my substitute, the issue is addressed with an incentive-based, cost-effective way to restore riparian areas.  Some complained that the Quincy Library Group plan has never been the subject of an environmental impact statement. If Members would look on page 9 of my substitute, we require an environmental impact statement. The library group and I drafted it together. The same environmental leaders in northern California who have sued to block hundreds of timber sales sat with the gentleman from California [Mr. Herger] and myself to write language giving the Quincy plan an environmental impact statement.  A member of my committee said the Quincy plan would not even get a public hearing or other procedural safeguards. People are important. So in my substitute I included an assurance that there would be a 45-day public comment period.  Others said we were trying to exempt the bill from the National Environmental Policy Act. That was never true, but we included the environmental impact statement requirements and we included a subsection (m) which states, ``Nothing herein exempts this pilot project from any Federal environmental law.'' I do not think we could be any more clear than we want to follow the environmental laws.  Some said they were unsure whether the bill was consistent with the California Spotted Owl process. I am certain it is, but my substitute says that the California Owl Guidelines and any final owl guidelines will apply.  Frankly, this is an exercise in reasonableness on the part of the gentleman from California [Mr. Herger], the gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. Saxton], the gentleman from Maryland [Mr. Gilchrest], the other members of the Committee on Resources and Members off the committee that support the bill. The gentleman from California [Mr. Campbell] has been very helpful on the environmental impact statement portion.  With all these changes, it is no wonder so many groups support the Herger bill. Only the groups on the very fringe oppose the bill and they have no rational basis to do so. We tried to get them to the table, but they refused. There are groups that will never be satisfied. That is the way they make their living. Frankly I do not understand their thinking because I thought they were environmentalists.  I know from his past statements that the Secretary of Agriculture supports the Quincy plan. I asked him 6 weeks ago to assist us in crafting any changes to accommodate his concerns, but I have not heard back from him. We have been very bipartisan and bicameral in our approach. I also asked the junior Senator from California for her suggestions, and we have accommodated the concerns that she raised.  I urge Members to support my substitute and, by the way, reject the Miller substitute because as I mentioned in debate on the rule, his does not protect the riparian part of my bill. He in fact invades the roadless areas. As I said, I never thought I would see the day when I would be out-environmentaling the gentleman from California [Mr. Miller], but I am doing this in my substitute. Again, I say to those who might have some questions, listen to the people of America. Listen to those that are directly affected. Yes, this is a national forest, but there are people that live in, around, and with the national forest that every day they wake up, they are faced with a problem of mismanagement under this administration. It is time that this Congress listen to those people and let us try this pilot project. What is the fear of trying a pilot project when we are failing today? Let us see if this works. If it works, it will be an example and a molding of how we can for the first time in many, many years address theforest as a total entity, not as something far away, or from Roswell, NM. That is how they are managing it today, a bunch of aliens who have no concept about the potential of the fire damage, no concept of the homes that are lost, and the destruction not only of the forest but of the wildlife. If Members do not believe me, read the newspapers today, tomorrow, and the day after. What do they say about every Western State of the fires that are occurring? Because of the lack of management. This bill takes care of that problem and recognizes the need and necessity of cooperation.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
