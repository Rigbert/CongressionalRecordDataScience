 Madam Speaker, H.R. 4404 is a bill that would allow the payment of medical expenses incurred by the United States Park Police to be paid directly by the National Park Service. This bill would also allow the Park Service to enter into mutual aid agreements with adjacent law enforcement agencies in order that Park Police are indemnified from third party civil claims.  Currently, payments are made through the District of Columbia, a process which is very slow. As a result, reimbursement payments to the Park Police have been a hardship to the officers, staff, and their families. This bill would direct the NPS to make direct payments to the Park Police.  The bill would also allow the Park Service to enter into a mutual aid agreement with adjacent law enforcement agencies in order that the Park Police are indemnified from third party claims.  Madam Speaker, this legislation is ready to move forward. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4404, as amended.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
