 President, I want to make clear that it would be my intent, should the other two climate change amendments be called up, to object to them. However, this has nothing to do with the distinguished Senator, whom I respect enormously. It does have something to do with putting climate change on this bill.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
