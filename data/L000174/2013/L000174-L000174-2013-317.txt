For the last several months--even before our bill was drafted, people were saying we cannot proceed with immigration reform until we do more to secure our borders. Now that we have a bill--a bill that takes extraordinary steps to further secure an already strong border--we continue to hear we must wait. We are told that the immigration bill reported from the Senate Judiciary Committee last month, the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act, S. 744, does not do enough.  It is so easy to wait. Oh, let's wait until next year or the year after or the year after that, because then the 100 Members of the Senate don't have to vote. We can be on everybody's side. That is not why we were elected. We were elected to vote yes or to vote no. Let's start moving forward and stand up to vote, because when they say we have to wait for more security it ignores the facts.  We have been pouring billions of dollars into border security for years--billions. Keep this in mind: Sometimes we argue over $15, $20, $30 million to help educate our children and that becomes a big issue. We have put billions of dollars into border security. Since the Senate last considered immigration reform in 2006 and 2007, we have made enormous strides on border security. This bill takes even more steps to prevent and deter illegal immigration.  We can talk about philosophy and we can talk about things people have heard. I would like to talk about facts. It may be inconvenient to some of those who don't want to have immigration reform, but the facts speak for themselves. The Border Patrol has doubled in the past 10 years. It now has more than 21,000 agents. That is more than at any time in its history. The Obama administration has more than 21,000 Border Patrol agents, which is more than they have ever had under either Democratic or Republican administrations.  The Department of Homeland Security has deployed additional technology in aircraft and hundreds of miles of fencing along the southern border. The Department has built more than 650 miles of fencing along the southern border, including more than 350 miles of pedestrian fencing.  There has been talk about illegal crossing. Here is a fact: Illegal border crossing is at a near 40-year low under this administration because fewer people are trying to cross. In 2005, Border Patrol apprehended more than 1.1 million individuals who unlawfully crossed the border. In 2012, that number went down to one-third--roughly 365,000. At the same time, deportation, as we all know, is at a record high level.  Here is one of the things we should talk about: People ignore the fact that we spend more money on enforcing immigration and customs laws--$18 billion each year--than we do on all ofour other Federal law enforcement agencies put together. For those who care about law enforcement, that is kind of a striking number. So we have done ``enforcement first.''  This legislation goes even further to build on what has been a successful record. Chairman Carper of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and I wrote a letter to our colleagues yesterday.  In fact, I ask unanimous consent that our letter be printed in the Record at the end of my statement.  In the letter, we point out that the bill appropriates up to another $6.5 billion to secure the border. It authorizes another 3,500 Customs and Border Protection officers. It allows Governors to deploy the National Guard to the southwest border region. It expands border security and use of technology at the border. I mean, this is not a bill that ignores enforcement; it expands it.  It increases the already strict criminal penalties against those unlawfully crossing the border and provides additional resources for their criminal prosecution. It sets clear statutory goals: The prevention of 90 percent of illegal entries and persistent surveillance of the entire southern border. If DHS doesn't meet these goals within 5 years, the bill establishes a bipartisan commission to develop further concrete plans and provides an additional $2 billion to carry out those plans.  Some say: I have a better plan. Come on. The needs at the border change all the time, so we built in flexibility to meet those needs.  The bill sets tough border security triggers. In fact, before DHS can register any undocumented individuals for provisional status, it has to provide Congress with two detailed plans laying out exactly how it is going to meet statutory goals: a comprehensive strategy and another specific to fencing. This is one of the toughest pieces of legislation on the security of our borders that has ever been before the Senate.  The Department of Homeland Security cannot issue green cards to these individuals for 10 years--and even then only after four triggers are satisfied: Comprehensive border security strategy is substantially deployed; the fencing strategy is substantially completed; a mandatory electronic employment verification system is established for all employers; and an electronic exit system based on machine-readable travel documents is in place at airports and seaports. Even then we added more during the Judiciary Committee's markup of this bill. We adopted an amendment offered by Senator Grassley that expands the bill's 90 percent effectiveness rate to the entire southern border, not just high-risk sectors.  So those who say they want more security than what we have here--it is virtually impossible to have more security. I think we might ask: Are you saying you don't want any immigration bill? This is similar to debates we have had--and I use the example of the work we did to bring about peace in Northern Ireland during the Clinton administration.  The former majority leader of this body, Senator George Mitchell, did a heroic effort, along with others, on both the Protestant and Catholic side in Northern Ireland. There were some who said we cannot have a peace agreement until we do not have a single act of violence. I said, OK. Senator Mitchell and President Clinton said, so in other words, you are going to let one disgruntled person on either side veto any peace agreement?  Let us not say we will have no immigration bill until not one person crosses our border illegally. That is making the perfect the enemy of the good, and that means we will never have it.  I was pleased the committee also looked at two border-related amendments I offered with Senator Cornyn--the Leahy-Cornyn amendments. I mention this because there are a number of amendments offered which are bipartisan from Democrats and Republicans alike. One helps protect cross-border travel and tourism by prohibiting land border crossing fees. The other ensures that DHS has flexibility to spend the bill's fencing fund on the most effective infrastructure and technology available, while still requiring that $1 billion be allocated to fencing. It also requires consultation with relevant stake holders and respect for State and local laws when DHS implements fencing projects. Again, knowing that what we do or want today may be different from what we want a few years from now.  I might say, parenthetically, the amendment I offered with Senator Cornyn to stop border crossing fees on either the southern border or northern border--some say we are going to turn our customs agents into toll collectors. I live an hour's drive from the Canadian border. We go back and forth like it is another State.  The distinguished Presiding Officer lives in a State that borders Canada. She knows what it is like going back and forth, and she also knows how important that is to the economy of her State and my State, just as it is to Canada. We ought to luxuriate in the fact that Canada is such a friendly neighbor and the relationship we have with them is so good. Some of us are even related to people who have Canadian ancestry. I have been married to a woman whose parents came from Canada. She was born in the United States. We have been married for almost 51 years. I am delighted Canadians come across our border and settle in Vermont.  I am also working on another amendment for Senate consideration regarding the use of vehicle checkpoints in the 100-mile border zone.  I simply do not understand how some can argue that this bill does not do enough to secure the border. We do that in this bill. We massively increase the money, the agents, the technology used on the border, and this is in addition to the billions--yes, billions--of dollars we already spend each year to physically stop people from crossing.  Some of the same people who want more security are the same people who say we are spending too much money in the Federal government. Well, short of putting up a steel wall, it is hard to imagine what more we can physically do from stopping people from crossing. As Chairman Carper said, if we build a 25-foot wall, I will show you somebody with a 26-foot ladder. We know people will still come. Because--and let's be serious for a moment--a fence does not address the root causes of illegal immigration. People come here looking for jobs, and American businesses hire them because they will do the jobs nobody else will. Yes, some come here to join their families, as the current backlogs for family-sponsored green cards would otherwise force them to wait years.  If we are serious about stopping illegal immigration, we have to do more than build a bigger, longer, and higher fence. That won't work. We have to create legal ways for people to enter the country--people who want to come here for work and to join family members. Then we have to make it harder for people to find work if they do not use legal avenues, by requiring a nationwide employment verification system known as E-Verify--some have called this a virtual fence--and by increasing penalties on employers who hire undocumented workers. This bill does exactly that.  The distinguished senior Senator from New York, Senator Schumer, talks about riding his bicycle around Brooklyn and seeing people who are probably undocumented and contractors coming up to them and saying, I will hire you for $15 a day, and they have to take the job. If we have real teeth, as our bill does, real penalties on employers who hire undocumented workers, they would instead have to hire those who are legal and have to pay at least minimum wage and have to put money into Social Security and so on. It makes a big difference.  As Grover Norquist said in his testimony, our bill, if adopted, would improve the finances of our Nation. But more than that, this legislation provides workable, flexible, affordable, humane solutions. It is tough, it is fair, and it is practical. Yet, just as in 2006 and 2007, we are still hearing from some Senators who oppose comprehensive immigration reform that we must do more to secure the border and enforce our laws.  I welcome additional ideas on how to enhance border security and public safety. I want people to bring forth their amendments to be voted on up or down. Our goal must be to secure the border, not seal it.  As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I will oppose efforts thatimpose unrealistic, excessively costly, overly rigid, inhumane, or ineffective border security measures, and I will oppose efforts to modify the triggers in ways that could unduly delay or prevent the earned legalization path--such as efforts to require Congress to ratify the trigger certifications. We have waited too long already. That includes the amendment offered by my friend from Iowa, Senator Grassley, which would significantly delay even the initial registration process for the 11 million undocumented individuals in this country.  The bottom line is this: The pathway to citizenship must be earned, but it also must be attainable.  Let's not forget that bringing 11 million people out of the shadows is not only the moral thing to do, it helps keep this country safe so we know who is here and we can focus our resources on those who actually pose a threat.  I don't often quote the Wall Street Journal editorial board, but I will quote them here. They said:       [Those] who claim we must ``secure the border first''      ignore the progress already made, because their real goal      isn't border security, it is to use border security as an      excuse to kill immigration reform.  We need immigration reform. It is a moral issue. It speaks to the greatness of our country. But it is also a national security issue and a public safety issue. Attempts to undermine immigration reform may come in the guise of promoting border security, but let us not be fooled. As 76 former State attorneys general recently wrote: ``Put simply, practical, comprehensive reform to our Federal immigration laws will make us all safer.''  We must fix our broken immigration system once and for all. As I have said many times on this floor, I think of my maternal grandparents coming to Vermont from Italy and making Vermont a better State with the jobs they created, and their grandson became a Senator. I think of my wife's parents, coming from Quebec, bringing their French language but also bringing English, and my wife was born in Vermont as a result of that. But I think of her extended family--her father, uncle, and others--creating many jobs in Vermont and making Vermont better. Every one of us can tell stories such as that. Let's not forget those people.  Let's not say that what worked for our ancestors is no longer available. Let's speak as the conscience of the Nation. One hundred Senators can be the conscience of the Nation and sometimes are, as we were on the Violence Against Women Act. It can now be so now, on the immigration bill.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                      U.S. Senate,                                    Washington, DC, June 11, 2013.       Dear Colleague, As the Senate prepares to take up 5.744,      the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration      Modernization Act, as amended, we write to draw your      attention to the strong border security provisions in the      bill. As chairmen of the Judiciary Committee and the Homeland      Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, we have      conducted extensive oversight of the Department of Homeland      Security and its enforcement record. The United States has      made significant progress on border security and immigration      enforcement in recent years, and this bill reinforces and      advances that progress in many ways.       The Wall Street Journal editorial board recently explained      just how far we have come since the last time that the Senate      considered comprehensive immigration reform:       The number of border patrol agents has grown to a small      army of 21,370, or triple the personnel employed as recently      as the Clinton Presidency. There are an additional 21,000      Customs and Border Protection officers.       The feds have built some 300 radar and camera towers as      well as 650 miles of single, double and in some places triple      fencing. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) now has      the ability to detain 34,000 criminals and aliens at one      time. The Border Patrol deploys military-style vehicles, 276      aircraft, nearly 300 marine vessels, along with state-of-the-     art surveillance.       Meanwhile, illegal entries nationwide are at four-decade      lows. Apprehensions of illegal entrants exceeded 1.1 million      in 2005 but by 2012 had fallen by two-thirds to 365,000, the      lowest level since 1971 with the exception of 2011, the      previous 40-year low.       Last year the Government Accountability Office (GAO)      examined federal data on ``estimated known illegal entries''      across the Mexican border. The numbers were way down nearly      everywhere. In San Diego, illegal entries fell to about      55,000 in 2011 from more than 265,000 in 2006. In Tucson--the      gateway to Arizona--illegal entries fell to about 200,000      from 600,000 over those years. And in El Paso illegal      crossings tumbled to 30,000 a year from more than 350,000.       Even more dramatic is GAO's analysis of illegals who escape      through the enforcement net, a statistic called ``got      aways.'' In nine major Southern border crossing areas,      including the main gateways of Tucson, San Diego and the Rio      Grande, got aways fell to an estimated 86,000 in 2011 from      615,000 in 2006. That's an 86% decline in foreigners who      successfully snuck into the country from Mexico.       Border Security Reality Check, Wall Street Journal (May 2,      2013).       Let there be no mistake: We have poured billions of dollars      into border security over the past decade. In fact, according      to a recent Migration Policy Institute report, we spend more      money on enforcing our immigration and customs laws--$18      billion each year--than we do on all other federal law      enforcement agencies combined. The result of this      unprecedented investment of taxpayer money is that, as      Secretary Napolitano has told us, our borders are more secure      than they have ever been.       The bill, as amended, builds on these successes by      allocating substantial additional resources to border      security. As outlined in the Senate Judiciary Committee's      report on the bill, S. 744, as amended, appropriates up to      $6.5 billion to secure the border beyond current spending      levels; authorizes 3,500 additional Customs and Border      Protection officers for our ports of entry; permits the      deployment of the National Guard to the Southwest border      region; significantly expands border security infrastructure,      such as Border Patrol stations and forward operating bases;      calls for the further use of technology at the border,      including additional unarmed unmanned aerial vehicles;      provides additional resources for criminal prosecutions of      those unlawfully crossing the border; and authorizes      reimbursements to State, local and tribal governments for      their costs related to illegal immigration.       In addition to providing these new resources and      authorities to enhance our border security operations, the      bill also enhances the accountability of our border      officials. The bill, as amended, establishes a statutory      goal, known as the ``effectiveness rate,'' of preventing 90      percent of illegal entries at the border, and requires DHS to      report to Congress whether it is achieving this rate. It also      instructs DHS to achieve persistent surveillance over the      border, so that the American public and Congress can know      exactly how many people are trying to cross the border      illegally each year. If these statutory goals are not met      within 5 years, the bill establishes a bipartisan Southern      Border Security Commission, with members appointed by the      President, both Houses of Congress, and the Governors of our      border states. This Commission will be charged with      developing further concrete plans to meet the statutory goals      in the bill, and is provided with an additional $2 billion to      carry out its plan. During the Senate Judiciary Committee's      markup of the bill, the Committee adopted additional      provisions to strengthen border security, such as an      amendment offered by Senator Grassley to expand the bill's      90% effectiveness rate and persistent surveillance goals to      cover the. entire Southern border, not just its high-risk      sectors.       The bill, as amended, also establishes tough triggers that      will ensure additional border security steps are taken before      the earned path to legalization can begin. Specifically, DHS      must provide to Congress a Comprehensive Southern Border      Security Strategy and a Southern Border Fencing Strategy that      lay out exactly how it will meet the statutory goals outlined      above before it can begin to register undocumented      individuals for provisional status. These Registered      Provisional Immigrants, in turn, will be allowed to apply for      green cards after 10 years--but only after:       1. the Secretary certifies that the Comprehensive Southern      Border Security Strategy is substantially deployed and      substantially operational;       2. the Secretary certifies that the Southern Border Fencing      Strategy is implemented and substantially completed;       3. DHS has implemented a mandatory employment verification      system to be used by all employers; and       4. DHS is using an electronic exit system at air and      seaports based on machine-readable travel documents to better      identify individuals who overstay their visas by tracking the      departures of non-citizens.       The bill's comprehensive approach to immigration reform      will also enhance border security, by reducing the incentives      that lead people to come here illegally. We need to stop      focusing our attention on the symptoms, and start dealing      with the underlying root causes in a way that is tough,      practical, and fair. The Border Security, Economic      Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act, as amended,      accomplishes that goal. First, undocumented individuals will      find it much more difficult to work, because the bill      requires a nationwide electronic employment verification      system and enhances penalties for employers who hire      undocumented workers. Second, the bill, as amended, creates a      more rational immigration system that provides legal avenues      for eligible individuals to enter the country for work or to      join their family members. As former Homeland Security      Secretary Michael Chertoff wrote, ``without expanded legal      immigration     to address the needs of the labor market, border security      will be harder and more expensive to achieve'' (Obama 's      Immigration Agenda, The Washington Post, Feb. 14, 2013). By      making it more difficult for employers to hire undocumented      workers, creating legal ways to enter the country for      immigrants coming for legitimate reasons, and allowing      eligible undocumented individuals to earn a path to      citizenship, this bill will allow the Department of Homeland      Security to focus its efforts on addressing threats to our      national security and public safety.       In sum, S. 744, as amended, will dramatically reduce      illegal immigration and improve national security. We look      forward to considering additional ideas to improve border      security further during Senate floor consideration,      especially those that present solutions that are effective,      workable, affordable, and flexible enough to allow the      Department of Homeland Security to deploy the right resources      where they are needed, without creating undue delays to      prevent undocumented individuals from earning a path to      citizenship. As we continue to build on the unprecedented      investments that have been made to secure our borders, we      must ensure that extreme or unworkable proposals do not      become a barrier to moving forward on comprehensive reforms      that are also critical to securing our borders. These reforms      include a path to citizenship for the undocumented in the      United States who work, pay taxes, learn English, pass      criminal background checks, pay substantial fines, and get in      line behind those who applied to come here legally and have      been waiting for years.       The Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration      Modernization Act, as amended, makes important improvements      to our immigration system that will strengthen national      security and benefit our nation as a whole. We look forward      to working with you as the Senate considers this legislation      and, hopefully, improves it.           Sincerely,     Patrick Leahy,       Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee.     Tom Carper,       Chairman, Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs      Committee.
