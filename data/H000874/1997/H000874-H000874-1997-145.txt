Chairman, I thought the amendment might be offered and withdrawn, but in light of the chairman's action, I certainly am not going to object to this amendment. We will look at it and work with the gentleman between now and conference to see if it is workable, and, if it is workable, the gentleman has brought up a good idea. I understand also that Mr. Bilbray of California is in agreement with the gentleman.                              {time}  1515
