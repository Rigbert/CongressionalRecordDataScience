Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time.  I just want to say something, because I have served in this House for 15 years. I say to the gentleman from Washington [Mr. Hastings], I never would have done to you what you just did to me. You said to me that you would yield me time and then you did not do it, as a representative of your committee. It made me extremely angry that you said it to me twice. It is right in that record.  I am the ranking member on this committee. I have to say no to our Democrats that cannot bring amendments up because of the rule that you have filed. I have to say no to the gentlewoman from Oregon [Ms. Furse]. I have to say no to the gentleman from Maryland [Mr. Wynn]. I have to say no to the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Hall]. I have to say no to Members who are not going to be allowed to bring their amendments to the floor.  I have a responsibility to the Members on my side just like you have a responsibility to the Members on your side. And I am very angry. I am glad the gentleman from New York [Mr. Solomon] is here on the floor because I do not think you are calling the shots here. I think they are being called above your pay grade in this House by the leadership. And when I, as a ranking member, was denied the right to offer my WIC amendment and it was given to the gentleman from California [Mr. Riggs] on your side of the aisle, he is not even on our committee, and I have the experience, I thought, well maybe I am a woman, they kind of ignored me. Then you did it to the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Yates] ranking member on the Subcommittee on Interior and now it is being done to the gentlewoman from California [Ms. Pelosi], ranking member on the Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, Export Financing and Related Programs.                              {time}  1815  So it is a pattern. I can recognize a pattern. And I am embarrassed for the other side of the aisle as a party that they will not allow us to conduct decent debate on this floor. So I stand here today being sorry for them.  I have never said this, maybe three times on the floor in my 15 years have I really felt outraged, and I am sorry that I have to say this to the gentleman in public, but my feelings are hurt. I would never have done to the gentleman what he has just done to me. And it is in that Record.  So I want to say to my good friend the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Yates] and to my good friend the gentlewoman from California [Ms. Pelosi] and now to myself, we are all in the same boat. I do not know whether it is the Speaker, [Mr. Gingrich], I do not know if it is the gentleman from Texas [Mr. Armey], I do not know who is doing this, but we have always brought the Agriculture bill to the floor in a bipartisan way. We have agreed. It has been usually under an open rule. We have had a good debate.
