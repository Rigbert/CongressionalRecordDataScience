President, many people, including myself, were deeplydisappointed by the World Bank's June 24th decision to approve a $160,000,000 loan to fund the controversial Western Poverty Reduction Project.  We recognize the strong views about this issue and I have agreed to accept this amendment, but with some reluctance.  The Western Poverty Reduction Project has drawn criticism from Members of Congress, the Clinton administration, other governments and international human rights and non-governmental organizations. A $40,000,000 component of this project which would fund the resettlement of some 58,000 poor Chinese farmers into an historically and culturally distinct Tibetan and Mongolian area is the primary source of concern.  The $9 million cut in IDA funds which would result from the Helms amendment is the United States contribution to this portion of the project.  I share Senator Helms' concern that the project may put additional pressure on Tibetans and other ethnic minorities in the region who are already struggling to overcome economic and cultural marginalization under Chinese rule.  There are also serious questions about the project's impact on the environment. It is my understanding that the Bank did not follow its own procedures in considering the environmental impact of this loan.  The United States Executive Director at the Bank voted against the loan and I supported that vote.  While many of us are not happy with the June 24th decision, the fact is we voted on this loan just as we have on countless other loans over the years. We participated in the Board's democratic voting process, as established by the Bank's charter and agreed to by its shareholders, just as we always have. The United States was instrumental in establishing the Bank's voting rules.  What made this vote different, however, is that we lost.  With some 18 percent of the voting power on the Board, the overwhelming majority of the time the view of the United States prevails on the World Bank's Board and at other international financial institutions. We have become accustomed to getting our way.  However, in the rare instances when we do not, dismissing the process, reneging on our financial obligations and walking away from our responsibilities is not an appropriate response. This is what this amendment does.  By cutting our contribution to IDA, which provides critical assistance to the world's poorest countries, this amendment compromises the democratic procedures at the Bank and damages United States credibility. It also invites other shareholders to cut their contributions to the Bank whenever they do not get their way. Taken to its logical conclusion, the damage to the Bank's ability to carry out its mission would be immense.  We have see how we can influence this project by simply staying involved. United States intervention and persistent international pressure has already changed the way the Bank will proceed with this loan.  Under World Bank President James Wolfensohn's leadership, the Board made the highly unusual and commendable decision to delay disbursement of the $40,000,000 until the Bank's independent inspection panel conducts a thorough review and determines whether the project meets the Bank's environmental and resettlement standards.  In addition, the Chinese Government has pledged its support for the review and stated that the press and government officials will have access to the region. Concerns about whether the project area will be open to experts unaffiliated with the Bank or the Chinese Government still need to be addressed.  It is expected that the Western Poverty Reduction project will be completed in 2005. By approving this amendment today and reducing our contribution to IDA we forfeit our leverage to influence the project and ensure that the Bank's environmental and resettlement standards are met over the next six years.  Mr. President, the plight of the Tibetan people is a clear example of what occurs when the principles of democracy are consistently and blatantly violated. In an effort to support their struggle, this amendment also compromises those same principles. It will weaken the United States' ability to ensure that the rights of Tibetans and other ethnic minorities are protected as the Bank moves forward with the project.                           amendment no. 1137       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following      new section:     SEC.   . CONGRESSIONAL NOTIFICATION WITH RESPECT TO                    ACQUISITION OF USAID FACILITIES.

(b) As used in this section, the term ``acquisition'' shall      have the same meaning as in the Foreign Service Building Act      of 1926.                                  ____                           Amendment No. 1138               (Purpose: Regarding assistance for Haiti)       Beginning on page 92 delete Section 560 and insert in lieu      thereof the following:                          ASSISTANCE FOR HAITI       Sec. 560.
