 I would say to my friend from Utah, we will have an opportunity tomorrow, in the late morning, to handle the Priscilla Owen nomination the way our party, at your suggestion and Senator Lott's suggestion, toward the end of the Clinton years, handled the Berzon and Paez nominations. They had controversy about them, just as this nomination has controversy about it.  How did we deal with controversy? We invoked cloture. And I remember you and Senator Lott saying, to substantial grief from some, that these judge candidates had gotten out of committee, and they were entitled to an up-or-down vote on the floor. Senator Lott joined Senator Daschle and filed cloture on both of those nominations, not for the purpose of defeating them but for the purpose of advancing them. They both got an up-or-down vote. They both are now called judge.
