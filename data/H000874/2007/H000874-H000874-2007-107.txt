Speaker, it is Thursday and it is a getaway day. I know everybody is concerned, because you talk to me from both sides of the aisle all the time about it, so I am well aware that people want to get out.  I will be asking, and that is why I want to say this now, I will be asking the presiding officers to keep our votes to no more than 2 minutes after the votes are to close, whether it is a 15-minute vote or a 5-minute vote. I think that will facilitate, hopefully, getting our work done.  The reason I say it now, I want everybody to be on notice that we intend to do that so we don't catch you. What the pattern has been increasingly is that when we get to ``zero,'' there are almost invariably 175 Members who have not voted. I do it and I am sure everybody else does it. You look at the screen and you see 170 Members haven't voted, and you have plenty of time. I understand that. I understand it because that is what I do.  The only way for us to overcome that is that 2 minutes after the vote, 17 minutes, we will close the vote. That will mean some of you may miss the votes and you will be angry with me. I want you to know ahead of time that I understand you will be angry with me, but at least I am telling you that is what our intention is to do.
