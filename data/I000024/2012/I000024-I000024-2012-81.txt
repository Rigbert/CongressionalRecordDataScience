President, before the Senator from West Virginia leaves, I would like to publicly thank him for all his support in something that just happened a few minutes ago; that is, passage of the Pilot's Bill of Rights.  Several--certainly Senator Begich--have been working hard, including Senator Pryor and Senator Manchin, as well as many on the Republican side. But it is a reality now.  This is kind of a strange day for me because I have been working on two bills for 1\1/2\ years, and both will become a reality on the same day: the highway bill that everyone knows about and then the Pilot's Bill of Rights that only pilots know about.  I have been a pilot for 55 years, and I get the calls and complaints that come in. But pilots are really the only ones in our society who are denied access to justice like every other citizen has, and this corrects it. So I just want to say to my friend that I very much appreciate his support in making this a reality.
