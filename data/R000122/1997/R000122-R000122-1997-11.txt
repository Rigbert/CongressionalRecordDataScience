Let me add another point that I think is very important. We have talked about the inducements for capital investment because of low environmental quality around the world. We have talked about the effects on working men and women who are there in those factories in Ho Chi Minh City, Malaysia, throughout the East, and in Mexico. I suggest that this has a real impact in our own home communities, such as Baltimore, MD, and Providence, RI, where small business men and women are struggling to apply the environmental quality standards that we all passed and they agree with. We all see the benefits to our society and culture, but it is detrimental to their economic viability versus these countries across the sea.  There is another factor, too. Just a few weeks ago, Senator Hagel and Senator Byrd came before this Senate with a resolution, Senate Resolution 98. It essentially said that we are not going to tolerate an environmental regime internationally that puts the burden of remediation and cleanup on the United States to the detriment of our economy. We are going to demand that developing countries also stand up and share the burden of cleaning up the environment. It passed with overwhelming support.  It seems just common sense that, of course, we are not going to prejudice ourselves in an international regime by saying we will add further burdens to us, as the developing world keeps spewing out bad air, polluting the waters, et cetera.  But in trade agreements, which are the focal point of most of our strong, bilateral and multinational relationships, we have completely ignored that point. So, on one hand, we are saying we have to get tough with these countries down there and make them start cleaning up their environment. But when it comes to the point where the rubber meets the road, where we are negotiating, we have leverage, and we want them to change behavior, we say it is not important. We are talking out of both sides of our mouth.
