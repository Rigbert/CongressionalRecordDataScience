President, today I am pleased to join Senator Hatch, as well as Senators Kohl and DeWine, in sponsoring the Satellite Home Viewer Extension Act. The Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act, which we passed in 1999, established a statutory license for satellite carriers to make secondary transmission of ``distant'' network and superstation television programs. That license will expire this year, however, so today's bill will extend that license, found in section 119 of the Copyright Act, for 5 years in order to ensure that the laudable goals of the initial bill are fully realized.  The Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act was the result of much work in the Senate Judiciary Committee, and it enjoyed strong bipartisan support in both Houses of Congress. The license created in section 119 serves a very worthwhile purpose: it permits households that cannot receive local network programming over-the-air to receive those shows by satellite. For the many viewers who are not served by local networks or cable companies--which is the case for a great many people in the rural areas of my home State of Vermont--this is absolutely critical. Of special importance is the fact that the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act permits the satellite transmission of ``local-into-local'' programming, so that satellite companies can retransmit local broadcast signals to subscribers who actually live in the local market, but cannot receive the broadcast signal. Providing the news and local interest programming that is so vital to the creation and maintenance of a healthy and involved community has been the most gratifying result of the passage of that act. Furthermore, this license enhances competition by placing providers of satellite television programming on an equal footing with cable operators, which enjoy the benefits of their own statutory licenses.  Such important progress does take time, however, and the satellite carriers have not yet made these local signals available to all their subscribers. Although the provision of ``local-into-local'' programming is proceeding well, and although competition between cable and satellite companies has been strengthened, there is still more to be done before the goal of the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act is fully realized. If we fail to reauthorize the section 119 license, satellite programming may be unavailable as a real choice for many households, and many rural viewers will have little or no programming at all.  I look forward to working again with my colleagues on this important issue and to a speedy reauthorization of this important license.                                 ______                                       By
