 We certainly hope so. The Speaker and I have both indicated, with respect to the energy bill, which seeks to not only address the conservation of our energy and making us energy independent, but also seeks to address the global warming challenge that confronts our globe, to pass that legislation in a timely fashion. It passed out of committee, as the gentleman knows, the week when we left for the Memorial Day break, so it has been pending now for at least 3 weeks.  It is our hope that we can move forward on this as early, perhaps, as the last week in June, which would be immediately before the July 4 break. Time and circumstances will dictate whether or not that is possible, but we certainly do hope to consider that in the near term.  In addition, as the gentleman undoubtedly knows, we also have under consideration the health care bill, which the President has made a very high priority and which we have made a very high priority. So that bill will also, we hope, be considered prior to the August break.  So those two bills are major pieces of legislation that we hope to consider, but I don't want to give an exact date on those because they are complicated pieces of legislation. We hope that we can reach agreement on--and we would like to reach agreement across the aisle as well--if not all facets, at least some facets of that bill. I'm sure your side has considerations that will help us perfect a bill. I think we will probably have some agreements, but, nevertheless, we hope to move forward together on both bills.
