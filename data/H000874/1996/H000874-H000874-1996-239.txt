Speaker, I rise with a great deal of sadness and I know that every Member of the House joins me.  A little earlier our colleague, Jack Murtha, rose to announce the tragic news of the death of Adm. Jeremy Boorda, known to many of us as Mike Boorda. Mike Boorda is a historic figure. He is the only Chief of Naval Operations to have entered at the very lowest level of the Naval ranks and rise to a four-star admiral and Chief of Naval Operations.  At this time we do not know all the facts surrounding the untimely death at approximately noontime today. But what we do know is that the Nation has lost one of its finest men, one of its finest soldiers, one of its finest sailors, one of its finest leaders.  Mike Boorda was a sailor's sailor. Mike Boorda was an American's American. He was a success story. He was, in sum, an individual for whom all of us could have the greatest respect and deepest affection.  Mr. Speaker, it is with unrestrained sadness and grief that I rise to express to all of the men and women of the U.S. Navy and all of the men and women of our armed services an empathy of personal loss to each of us in this House and to our Nation.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend, the gentleman from Washington, Norman Dicks.
