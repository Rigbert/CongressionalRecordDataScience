 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a man from Keavy, KY, who bravely served his country in World War II.  Morris Black was drafted at age 19, and he proudly put on his uniform and left his friends and family behind. Among those left behind was his sweetheart and future wife, Ms. Pauline Cassidy. During the Battle of the Bulge, while serving in one of the most exposed roles within his company--a field medic--Black was injured in both his head and leg. In a subsequent battle, he rushed from one wounded soldier to the next, providing as much care as possible, while coming under heavy enemy fire. For his heroic service as a field medic, Mr. Black received several medals, awards, and decorations, including the Purple Heart and the Silver Star.  Unfortunately, field medic Black's well-deserved accolades would not be presented to him for another 60 years due to bureaucratic oversight. Mr. Black finally received these medals on March 7, 2010. Though he is appreciative, he is quick to point out that his service was not done for the purpose of winning medals; it was to help the soldiers that needed his assistance in those critical moments.  The Corbin Times-Tribune recently ran a story about Morris Black's service. As Mr. Black recalls his experience in the interview, he says, ``There were times when I didn't know whether I'd make it home or not, but I did. There is no greater honor than to fight for your country.''  Today, I know my colleagues will join me in paying tribute to his service and I ask unanimous consent that the full article from the Times-Tribune be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Corbin Times-Tribune, Mar. 20, 2010]                              A Quiet Hero                           (By Erica Bowlin)       Corbin, KY.--Morris Black received a very special delivery      in the mail on March 7, 2010. He finally received his Silver      Star--60 years after serving in World War II.       During the war, Morris, of Keavy, won several badges,      medals, and honors. For so many years he wondered why he      never received his Silver Star, and he was unsure if he ever      would.       Black was drafted into the Army when he was just a young      man of nineteen. He was concerned about what would await him,      and he was unsure about leaving behind his sweetheart, Miss      Pauline Cassidy. But, the young man knew he had a      responsibility to fight for his country, to fight for those      who couldn't fight. So, Morris Black proudly put on his      uniform and joined the Army. The year was 1943.       Black was first sent to Army basic training at Campground,      Illinois. After boot camp he received orders to England and      worked there as an orderly in a hospital. Then the call came      to go to combat, and off he went to Germany.       As a Field Medic, Technician Grade 5, Black saw many      strenuous battles. During the Battle of the Bulge, he      received injuries to his leg and head. In a separate battle,      Black's unit was taking heavy enemy fire. Black ran from one      fallen soldier to the next, doing his best to care for each      and every one.       ``They had us all penned down,'' said Morris, ``and I just      did the best I could to get them in as good a shape as I      could get them.''       Black won the Silver Star for his efforts that day in      Germany. He was also awarded     the Purple Heart after the battle in which he was injured. He      just never got to hold the actual awards in his hand. That      is, until earlier this month.       But Black did not do what he did for the medals. He did      what he did because he is a patriot, and he knew he was the      only hope his fallen brothers may have had at those critical      moments.       Black is quiet in demeanor, never boasting. But, his honor      and integrity shows--in the way he holds his head high and      the way he smiles. It is clear that he is a hero.       ``I was just doing my job,'' he said.       After two years and nine months in Germany, Black was the      only one in his unit who hadn't returned home for leave.      Finally, he was granted a leave of absence and got the chance      to come home to his beloved country and back to his      sweetheart, Pauline. The two had been exchanging letters      during the war. Pauline was anxiously awaiting the arrival of      her soldier.       Black received word that the war had ended, just as his      ship arrived in New York.       ``They were unloading at the station when they started to      say `the war is over,' and I was very happy that day,'' he      said.       Soon Black was back at home in Keavy, where he'd been      raised. He was back with his family, back to his life. He      returned to Pauline, and the two were married just a few days      later.       ``I had really missed him,'' said Pauline, ``and I had      really worried about him. It was good to have him home.''       The two began building their house shortly after they were      married. They still live in the home today. Black worked as a      carpenter, and Pauline worked for the United States Postal      Service. The couple had two children, Harold Gene and Sheila      Kay. The Blacks will celebrate their 65th anniversary on May      19, 2010.       Morris Black continued to serve his community and country      after returning home. He was one of the founding members of      The Disabled American Veterans Chapter 158 in Keavy. The      center now serves as a community gathering place.       ``They hold family reunions and play ball at the field,''      said Black.       Black also worked as a volunteer firefighter. Pauline      remembers her husband rushing off at all hours to fight      fires.       ``He would be working on something and when a call came in,      he was out the door,'' she said.       ``There was about three or four of us who got together and      decided we needed a fire department. So we started one,''      said Black.       The Keavy Volunteer Fire Department is thriving and      continues to serve the community. Black is proud of all he      has done, and very grateful that he has been able to serve.      He is most grateful, he said, for his family.       ``It feels good to have my wife and children, and      grandchildren and great-grandchildren. That's what really      makes me proud.''       Morris and Pauline live each day as it comes, and they      thank God for every day they have together.       ``There are times when I didn't know whether I'd make it      home or not, but I did. There is no greater honor than to      fight for your country. And there's nothing like the feeling      of having people who love you,'' said Black.       After a lifetime of service, Black has every right to brag,      but that is not his style. As he holds his Silver Star in his      hands, he looks at it with pride, and he does appreciate it.      But the real satisfaction for a soldier is much bigger than      an award. Black remembers each one of the soldiers he stopped      to help that day in Germany, and thinks of the ones who      didn't make it home. His gratitude is to those who fought      before and with him, and for those who continue to fight.                          ____________________
