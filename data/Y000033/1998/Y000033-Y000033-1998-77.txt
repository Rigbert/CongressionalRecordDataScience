Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4068 would make certain technical corrections in laws relating to Native Americans. This is an extensive bill, and I will be as brief as possible.  It corrects typographical errors in existing laws. It extends the leasing authority to 99 years for the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon and the Cabazon Indian Reservation. It adds 0.062 acres of land, the driveway to an Indian cemetery, to the Coos, Lower Umpqua and Siuslaw Tribal Reservation. It adjusts the bearings provided for the Hoopa Valley Reservation South Boundary Adjustment Act. It expands the service area of the Confederated Tribes of the Siletz Indians. It authorizes the Lower Sioux Indian Community to sell a 13.38 acre parcel of real property which the tribe owns in fee. It approves the transfer of certain water rights pursuant to the Jicarilla Apache Tribe Water Rights Settlement Act. It amends the Native Hawaiian Health Care Improvement Act to define primary health services covered under the scholarship assistance program.  Finally, there is a section in H.R. 4068 which authorizes the disbursement of certain interest income pursuant to the San Luis Rey Indian Water Rights Settlement Act. The Committee on Resources is concerned about the delay of the implementation of that act.  In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4068 is an important bill for numbers of Indian tribes. It does not pertain to many acres of land, but it does solve a lot of problems that have not been able to be solved, and I urge the passage of the legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
