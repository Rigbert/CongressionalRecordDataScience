Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I understand and appreciate the gentleman's position. As the gentleman knows, in fact, I share his position on this issue, and voted that way in committee before the bill was reported to the floor. As the gentleman well knows, I lost, and his position, as articulated now, lost as well. On a point of order it was struck, but the fact of the matter is the reality was that the majority of the conferees on the House side and the majority of the conferees on the Senate side were for doing what the Senate did.  I will tell my friend, who I believe serves on the Committee on Government Reform and Oversight, the real problem is the chairman of the Committee on Government Reform and Oversight did not demand that the jurisdiction of the committee be honored in this instance. Very frankly, this is an issue for the gentleman's committee. He is absolutely correct.  I regret that the initial recommendation of the gentleman from Arizona, Chairman Kolbe, which was, back when we did the supplemental in March, to defer this issue to the gentleman's committee for action, did not in fact happen. I appreciate the gentleman's point.
