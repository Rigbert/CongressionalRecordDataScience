 President, we have not had a chance to really study the Wyden amendment yet. We have just had a quick opportunity to review the Senator's amendment. We need to look at it more closely, and we have some other people doing it. There are some other committees this could have tremendous impact on. We do not know what CBO will say about this, if anything. It might need to be scored, what the cost is, if any. We just started into the bill. We have a little time, I believe. I was wondering if the Senator from Oregon would set it aside and let us look at it.
