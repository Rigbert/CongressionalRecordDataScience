President, this year is the 200th anniversary of one of the wisest decisions Congress ever made. In 1815, Congress acquired the entirety of Thomas Jefferson's personal library toreplace Congress's library, which was burnt by the British Army the previous year.  I would like to take a few moments to recognize this anniversary and to focus on the good work one small Library of Congress program does today.  Though the Library of Congress was established in 1800, for the first 15 years of its existence it was mainly a law library. It was not until the acquisition of Jefferson's personal library that the Library became the broad repository of knowledge that it is today. Some Members of Congress opposed the idea of buying Jefferson's entire library, which included books in many languages, and on a variety of topics, including science, math, philosophy, and religion. However, Thomas Jefferson famously replied, ``I do not know that it contains any branch of science which Congress would wish to exclude from their collection; there is, in fact, no subject to which a Member of Congress may not have occasion to refer.'' Fortunately, this view won the day, and today the Library contains an unparalleled number of items from every branch of knowledge, making it the largest library in the world.  Forever growing, the Library of Congress receives 20,000 new items every day. However, only about half are kept for the Library's permanent collection. It is the program designed to bridge that divide which has grown to touch so many Oregonians, as well as regular folks around the country.  The Library of Congress's Surplus Books Program takes the books not needed for the Library's collections and provides them to schools, libraries, and nonprofit institutions around the country. Each week, staff from my office are able to select books, box them up, and send them to Oregon.  One recipient in Oregon has been the new library in Halsey, OR. Halsey is a small town, but the community has come together to build a fantastic new library. I have been able to send them several hundred new books to help them grow and diversify their collection. I expect to be able to send them hundreds more, thanks to the Library of Congress's Surplus Books Program.  I would be remiss if I failed to recognize Joseph Maher, acquisitions specialist and librarian for the Surplus Books Program. Mr. Maher almost singlehandedly runs the program and often goes above and beyond to identify books for particular organizations. Mr. Maher works to find a good home for each of the books, while simultaneously balancing the needs of the many congressional offices, schools, universities, and Federal agencies that select books from the program. He works tirelessly knowing that the books they send around the country are going to make a positive impact on many lives.  Reading sparks creativity, learning, passion, and imagination, and the Library of Congress continues to help ignite it. I could not be more pleased to see communities in Oregon benefitting from this program.                          ____________________
