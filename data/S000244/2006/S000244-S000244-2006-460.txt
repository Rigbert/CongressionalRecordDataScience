Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1871) to provide liability protection to nonprofit volunteer pilot organizations flying for public benefit and to the pilots and staff of such organizations, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:                               H.R. 1871       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Volunteer Pilot Organization      Protection Act of 2006''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:       (1) Scores of public benefit nonprofit volunteer pilot      organizations provide valuable services to communities and      individuals.       (2) In calendar year 2001, nonprofit volunteer pilot      organizations provided long-distance, no-cost transportation      for over 30,000 people in times of special need.       (3) Such organizations are no longer able to reasonably      purchase non-owned aircraft liability insurance to provide      liability protection, and thus face a highly detrimental      liability risk.       (4) Such organizations have supported the interests of      homeland security by providing volunteer pilot services at      times of national emergency.       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to promote the      activities of nonprofit volunteer pilot organizations flying      for public benefit and to sustain the availability of the      services that such organizations provide, including      transportation at no cost to financially needy medical      patients for medical treatment, evaluation, and diagnosis, as      well as other flights of compassion and flights for      humanitarian and charitable purposes.     SEC. 3. LIABILITY PROTECTION FOR NONPROFIT VOLUNTEER PILOT                    ORGANIZATIONS FLYING FOR PUBLIC BENEFIT AND TO                    PILOTS AND STAFF OF SUCH ORGANIZATIONS.       Section 4 of the Volunteer Protection Act of 1997 (42      U.S.C. 14503) is amended--       (1) in subsection (a)(4)--       (A) by redesignating subparagraphs (A) and (B) as clauses      (i) and (ii), respectively;       (B) by inserting ``(A)'' after ``(4)'';       (C) by striking the period at the end and inserting ``;      or''; and       (D) by adding at the end the following:       ``(B) the harm was caused by a volunteer of a nonprofit      volunteer pilot organization that flies for public benefit,      while the volunteer was flying in furtherance of the purpose      of the organization and was operating an aircraft for which      the volunteer was properly licensed and insured, unless the      conduct constitutes a Federal crime of terrorism (as such      term is defined in section 2332b(g)(5) of title 18, United      States Code) or an act of domestic terrorism (as such term is      defined in section 2331 of such title), or unless the entity      has been convicted of an offense under section 2339A of such      title.'';       (2) in subsection (b)--       (A) by amending the heading to read as follows:      ``Concerning Responsibility of Volunteers'';       (B) by inserting ``(1)'' before ``Nothing''; and       (C) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:       ``(2) Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect      the liability for negligence of a volunteer of a nonprofit      volunteer pilot organization that flies for public benefit      with respect to amounts within the limits of liability      insurance coverage that such volunteer is required to obtain      pursuant to subsection (a)(4)(B) for liability protection      under this section.''; and       (3) in subsection (c)--       (A) by inserting ``(1)'' before ``Nothing''; and       (B) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:       ``(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), a nonprofit volunteer      pilot organization that flies for public benefit, and the      staff, mission coordinators, officers, and directors (whether      volunteer or otherwise) of such organization or a referring      agency of such organization, shall not be liable with respect      to harm caused to any person by a volunteer of such      organization, while the volunteer is flying in furtherance of      the purpose of the organization and is operating an aircraft      for which the volunteer is properly licensed and has      certified to such organization that such volunteer has in      force insurance for operating such aircraft. Such referring      agency shall include, among others, any nonprofit      organization that provides disaster relief services that      place staff, volunteers, evacuees, goods, supplies, or cargo      on aircraft flights being coordinated by volunteer pilot      organizations in circumstances of disaster response and      relief.''.     SEC. 4. REPORT BY ATTORNEY GENERAL.       (a) Study Required.--The Attorney General shall carry out a      study on the availability of insurance to nonprofit volunteer      pilot organizations that fly for public benefit. In carrying      out the study, the Attorney General shall make findings with      respect to--       (1) whether nonprofit volunteer pilot organizations are      able to obtain insurance;       (2) if no, then why;       (3) if yes, then on what terms such insurance is offered;      and       (4) if the inability of nonprofit volunteer pilot      organizations to obtain insurance has any impact on the      associations' ability to operate.       (b) Report.--After completing the study, the Attorney      General shall submit to Congress a report on the results of      the study. The report shall include the findings of the study      and any conclusions and recommendations that the Attorney      General considers appropriate.
