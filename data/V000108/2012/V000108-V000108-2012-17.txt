 I believe that there is a proper role for government where there is no private organization willing or able to fill an information need, and information is vital if we are going to improve our energy policy.  This program provides a venue at a very modest cost to the taxpayers to disseminate valuable information that supports the diversification of the Nation's energy supply.  While I do appreciate the gentleman from Arizona's efforts to search out sources of wasteful and inappropriate spending, I disagree that this program is one of those instances and join my colleague from Washington in opposition to the amendment.
