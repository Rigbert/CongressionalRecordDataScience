 President, for weeks now, almost daily, I have spoken about the need to get our appropriations process back on track and the need for bipartisan agreement to fund the Federal Government and, particularly, to provide our military commanders with the resources and stability they need.  That kind of smooth process was exactly what Congress was on track for just a few months ago. Leaders in both parties, in both Houses, and at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue signed onto a deal that set top-line funding levels and ruled out obstacles like poison pills. Alas, as I have discussed at length, policy riders crept back into the process, and our discussions stalled. As a result, here we are again--behind schedule.  We need to get results on appropriations before the end of the year. So, while the House and the Senate continue negotiations on setting the allocations, we need to buy more time. The House and the Senate need to pass a continuing resolution to fund the government through December 20 and allow these talks to continue. The Senate can't originate this funding bill, but we will wait to receive legislation from the House and then vote on it before we head back to our home States.  This is what we need: a CR, as clean as possible, through December 20 to enable more progress on appropriations before the end of this year. A clean CR through December 20 would pass the Senate, and the White House has indicated that President Trump would sign it. Let me say that again. The administration indicates the President is willing and ready to sign a clean CR through December 20 so that we can finish our work.  This is our opportunity to get a bipartisan process back on track. First, with bipartisan, bicameral cooperation, we can safely fund the Federal Government through mid-December so talks can continue. Then, with more cooperation, we can reach agreement on allocations and pass as many of the 12 appropriations bills as possible before the end of the year.                          ____________________
