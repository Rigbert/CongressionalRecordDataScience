 In my State of Alabama, Tuskeegee University's School of Veterinary Medicine also participates in the Association of Minority Health Professions Schools, by contributing materially toward helping to control the cost of human health care by preventing zoonotic diseases. This, in turn, helps prevent an overload on human primary health care systems. The value of this program is self-evident.
