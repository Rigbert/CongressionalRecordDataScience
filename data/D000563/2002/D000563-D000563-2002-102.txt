GRAMM. I will yield, but the point I want to make is we want an up-or-down vote on our amendment. This is the President's substitute, and the President's supporters should have a chance to speak on it. We have gone on for 4 weeks on this bill, not because of what supporters of the President have done, but because we have had amendments offered, probably 90 percent of that time taken up by people who do not support the President's position. That is where we are.  I will be happy to yield to the Senator.
