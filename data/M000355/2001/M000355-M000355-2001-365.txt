 President, we have had a great deal of comity duringthe course of this debate. The biggest problem Senator Dodd and I are going to have is accommodating amendments that Members haven't come over to offer. My concern is, the amendment of the Senator from Texas, having done what we asked her to do, which is come over and lay down her amendment, by withdrawing it, goes back into the herd that may or may not get dealt with at the end. By simply setting it aside, she is in line. It gives an opportunity for discussions to continue with the Senator from Arizona and others who, I gather, think there might be some way to work this out. She is still in line rather than sort of getting sent back to the back of the bus. That is my advice to the Senator from Texas.
