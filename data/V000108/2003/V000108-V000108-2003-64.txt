Speaker, it is with great pleasure and admiration that I rise today to honor Glen L. Eberly for his lifelong contribution to the residents of Northwest Indiana, especially the Town of Dyer. Glen is one of the most dedicated, distinguished and committed citizens I have had the pleasure of knowing.  On Thursday, May 8, 2003, the Dyer Chamber of Commerce will host a roast in recognition of Glen's honorable service and the uncompromising loyalty he has displayed to the residents of Dyer. The community could not have picked a more appropriate date to roast Glen, as May 8th was the birth date of one of this Nation's most highly regarded presidents, Harry S Truman. Like President Truman, Glen possesses the qualities of a strong work ethic, coupled with honesty and integrity. Additionally, May 8th will forever be a notable date in history for me personally, because on May 8, 1984, I won my first democratic primary for United States Congress.  Born January 13, 1930, Glen and his family moved to Dyer 8 years later. He graduated from Dyer High School and served his country for 2 years in the United States Air Force. He went on to attend Ball State University where he earned a bachelor's degree in education. Glen began his teaching career in 1953 at Dyer High School, where he taught history. In 1961, Glen received his master's degree in education from Purdue University and continued his career at Dyer High School as a guidance counselor. In 1968, Glen was named assistant principal at Lake Central High School and subsequently became principal.  In addition to his love for education, Glen has demonstrated a sincere affection for the community in which he lives. Thus, Glen has served as a member of the Dyer Town Council for three terms. While Glen has dedicated considerable time and energy to his work, he has always made an extra effort to give back to the community. He is a charter member of the Dyer Noon Lions Club and is a past member of the Dyer Evening Lions Club. Additionally, Glen is a charter member of the Dyer Jaycees and is a charter member of the Dyer Historical Society and currently serves as its president. Glen has served the communities of Dyer, St. John and Schererville in various administrative capacities since 1984 and has been the Town Council Coordinator for the Town of Dyer since 1992. Though Glen is dedicated to his career and the community of Dyer, he has never limited his time and love for his family. Glen and his wife, Charlotte, have been happily married for 50 years.  Mr. Speaker, Glen has truly dedicated his life to the Town of Dyer, as well as all of Northwest Indiana. He is one of the finest gentlemen I know. I respectfully ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating Mr. Glen Eberly for his outstanding devotion to Indiana's First Congressional District. His unselfish and lifelong dedication to those in need is worthy of the highest commendation, and I am proud to represent him in Congress.                          ____________________
