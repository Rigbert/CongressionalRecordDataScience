Speaker, I recently had the pleasure of introducing one of my constituents, Dr. Fred Mathews, at a hearing of the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations. Dr. Mathews had been invited to speak on behalf of the Neurofibromatosis Foundation in support of increased funding for this often devastating disease.  It is a privilege to know Dr. Mathews and count him as a friend. In addition to his 47 years of practicing optometry in Dowagiac, MI, he has devoted his talents and energy to improving the quality of life in his community and expanding education opportunities and excellence in our state. When he learned that his lovely young granddaughter, Allison, was afflicted with neruofibromatosis, he took on the most important fight of his life--the fight for a cure for this disease for Allison and for the at least 100,000 others who have this neurological disorder. His testimony before the subcommittee was eloquent, and I would like today to submit it to the Congressional Record so that others may see the urgency of the need to find a cure. Dr. Mathews' testimony follows:                         A Worried Grandfather       Thank you Congressman Upton and thank you Mr. Chairman and      members of the Committee for allowing me to testify. I am      Fred Mathews, a constituent of Congressman Upton from      Southwestern Michigan.       I am here today because my beautiful granddaughter Allison      has Neurofibromatosis, a not so rare and devastating genetic      disorder. In 1994 Allison was four years old when I first      asked her parents about some spots on her skin. I had assumed      these were simple birthmarks. This was the first time her      parents shared with me that she had Neurofibromatosis, or      abbreviated called NF. Up until then we had been shielded      from the terrible truth.       I am an optometrist in a small town in southwest Michigan.      I have practiced there for 47 years. Even though I am not a      medical doctor I have better than a layman's knowledge of      general medical problems. However, I had never heard of NF.       Immediately I began to research NF. I called research      centers. I called the National Institutes of Health. I linked      up with the National Neurofibromatosis Foundation. My      testimony today has the blessing of that fine organization.       There is no way to describe the despair and hopelessness      that families experience when faced with the fact that a      child or grandchild has an incurable disease. My research      left my wife and me panic-stricken. Here is a short version      of what my research revealed.       NF is the most common neurological disorder caused by a      single gene. At least 100,000 Americans have NF. This makes      NF more prevalent than Cystic Fibrosis, hereditary muscular      dystrophy, Huntington's Disease and Tay Sachs combined.       NF causes tumors to grow anywhere on or in the body. NF can      lead to disfigurement, blindness, deafness, skeletal      abnormalities, dermal, brain and spinal tumors, loss of      limbs, malignancies and learning disabilities. The terrible      disfigurement is why NF has erroneously been confused with      the so called ``elephant man'' disease.       NF affects both genders, all races and ethnic groups      equally. NF research in 1994 (when I first learned of my      granddaughter's problem) had begun about 9 years earlier by      the National NF Foundation. The gene causing NF had just been      discovered.       My personal research did reveal some good news for my      family and me. My granddaughter has the NF1 gene rather than      the NF2 gene. With the NF2 gene the tumors and other bizarre      disorders can start soon after birth. NF1 however, which my      granddaughter has, sometimes does not manifest serious      problems until puberty or beyond.       I also learned from Peter Bellermann, President of the      National NF Foundation, and the world's greatest crusader to      find a cure for NF, that researchers were hopeful of finding      a cure in 10-15 years. Simple mathematics told me that this      might be too late for my granddaughter and thousands of kids      like her who were living with this time bomb.       I also learned that researchers believed that the projected      time for a cure could possibly be cut in half if more      research dollars were available.       I am grateful that this Committee and the Congress did      respond to our plea and did appropriate significant new funds      for NF research. In 1995 Chairman Porter also added language      to the Appropriations Bill which expressed to NIH the      commitment of this Committee for accelerated NF research.       Because of this Committee, the Congress, the NIH, the      National NF Foundation and many dedicated researchers, our      Allison who is now 9 years old, has a chance to avoid the      ravages of NF. We are thankful and hopeful but still very      apprehensive. The time clock is still running rapidly.      Research has been extremely successful but has a long way to      go to find a cure.       The National NF Foundation and I urge that the language      which has been in the Appropriations Bill for the past four      years, expressing this Committee's commitment to NF research,      be in the FY 2000 bill.       I am grateful for the courtesy members of this committee      and other members of congress and their staffs have shown      Peter Bellermann and me these past few years. Some of you      have my granddaughter's picture in your office.       In my opinion, no expenditure by the Federal Government is      more rewarding, more needed, and more appropriate than      research for dread diseases including NF. As a grandfather of      a little girl with one of these dread diseases, I feel      anxiety, frustration but also hope knowing that the timetable      for a cure of NF and other diseases is almost solely      dependent on the willingness of the Congress to recognize      medical research as its #1 priority. That is why Mr. Chairman      we strongly support a significant increase in funding for the      National Institutes of Health medical research. With the NIH      as the quarterback, the greatest hope we have for finding a      cure for NF and all other dread diseases, lies with this      Committee and the NIH.       Since my allotted time is up Mr. Chairman, I respectfully      request permission to extend my remarks in the written      testimony I will leave with the Committee.       Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, on behalf of the      National Neurofibromatosis Foundation, as well as the      thousands of children and adults with NF, I thank you and my      Allison thanks you.                                  ____               Extended Testimony of Dr. Fred L. Mathews                             April 29, 1999       I am pleased and proud that NF research has been pointed      out to be a model for ``Managing Science.'' It represents an      effective partnership between public agencies, most notably      the U.S. Congress and the National Institutes of Health,      private organizations and the National Neurofibromatosis      Foundation and scientists and clinical researchers in the      field who have achieved their progress by consensus and by      collaborating to a remarkable degree. To use the vernacular,      NF research has given a ``good bang for the buck'' to all who      have invested in it.       NF research has significant potential for other very large      patient populations. Since the NF genes have been implicated      in the signaling process that determines cell growth and cell      differentiation, NF research also has great promise for the      tens of millions of Americans with malignancies.       NF also causes learning disabilities at about five to six      times the frequency found in the general population. Work in      that aspect of NF research therefore has considerable      potential for the estimated 30 million Americans who are      learning disabled.       Given the wide variety of symptoms of NF, I understand that      you Mr. Chairman and the     Committee have urged those involved in NF research to foster      collaborative efforts between and among the various      initiatives at the NIH under whose purview these      manifestations fall. Peter Bellermann, President of the      National NF Foundation has informed me that these efforts are      taking place and that ``Cross-Institute'' activities are a      reality.       NF has the attention at the highest level of the NIH      beginning with the Director Dr. Varmus. It extends to the      Institute heads, especially Dr. Gerald Fischbach at NINDS and      to Dr. Richard Klausner at the National Cancer Institute.      These progressive officers work at continuing the cross-     institute efforts, participate in scientific meetings of NF,      and advise other funding agencies to avoid duplication of      funding.       NF has been a success story for research for all who have      invested in it. True success will, however, come only when a      cure is found and real people like my granddaughter can look      forward to happy lives, free of NF's terrible consequences.      We now have to go the next hard miles. Researchers now stand      ready to translate basic scientific knowledge into clinical      application. The next agenda includes continued work in basic      research, starting comprehensive natural history studies for      NF and beginning the all important process of clinical trials      with innovative approaches. We all pray that this will lead      to an effective treatment for NF.       In closing, I would be remiss if I did not thank my      Congressman Fred Upton and his staff person Jane Williams for      their very special help and support. We are also very      appreciative of the longtime support Congressman Murtha has      given NF funding. And a special thanks to you, Chairman      Porter, who in 1995 took time from your busy schedule to meet      personally with Peter Bellermann and me so that we could tell      you of the urgent need for accelerated NF funding. Your      ongoing support since then has been tremendously helpful. To      the members of this Committee who have supported us in this      critical effort, we also offer another thank you.                               ____________________
