 President, I think the Senator from Kentucky makes a very valid point. I, for one, think there is justification for Kentucky having another judgeship.  Frankly, one of the things the Senator from Utah and I talked about earlier in the process--not today, but in the year--was this notion of whether or not we need an additional judgeship bill, period, nationwide. And the answer is we do.
