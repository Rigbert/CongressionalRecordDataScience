Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this rule which fails to make the Obey homeland security amendment in order. Just listen to the words of Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson who said, ``Am I satisfied with the food inspection we are doing? No, I am more fearful about this than anything else.''  The Obey amendment would provide the agency 10 percent of the resources that it needs to meet the food inspection requirements of this country. Right now we inspect less than 1 percent of what comes over our border. Our Nation's food safety needs are real and compelling, and the risks from imported food products are real and compelling. We must do the right thing to protect our food supply and to help ensure food safety for all of our people. This rule denies us the opportunity to vote on the Obey substitute. I urge a ``no'' vote on the rule.
