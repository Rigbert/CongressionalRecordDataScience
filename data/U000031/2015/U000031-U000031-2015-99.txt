Young and Dr. Harris, would authorize the NIH to conduct a prize program. The intent of the amendment is, in fact, to incentivize health innovation by offering competitors the chance to win a prize for developing breakthroughs. We ought to be encouraging that.  Importantly, individuals who win the prize competition would keep all of the intellectual property rights. I think that is very important.  So I would ask my colleagues to support the amendment. I look forward to working with both sides of the aisle to make sure that we can, in fact, perfect it as we get to the end of the cycle and, ultimately, to the President's desk.
