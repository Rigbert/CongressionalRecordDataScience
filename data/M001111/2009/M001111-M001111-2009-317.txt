 President, I thank the Senator from Arizona for offering this amendment. Indeed, Loran-C was established after World War II as a navigational tool for our mariners and aviators. The President has proposed to terminate Loran-C stations on October 1, 2009, with the justification that the federally supported civilian global positioning system is now the primary navigational tool and the Loran-C is no longer needed by the Armed Forces or by the transportation sector or by the Nation's security interests. The Office of Management and Budget has also told us that many agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Transportation, and the Department of Defense, do, as the Senator stated, already have backup systems for GPS.  I want to set the record straight about what this committee mark does have in it that is before us. It does provide for the orderly termination of Loran-C beginning January 4, 2010. So the underlying bill does terminate the Loran-C program, and it does so in a way that allows the Coast Guard the time to inform the public and provide for the orderly termination of that program. The committee bill continues operations of Loran-C until January 4, 2010. Then the program is terminated.  Contrary to the sponsor's statement yesterday, there is not $35 million in this bill for Loran-C. This bill does have $18 million. The President in his request did include no funding to pay for the cost to terminate these stations. According to the Coast Guard, which has provided us information, they do need this funding to remove the high-value equipment and electronics hazardous material. They need it to remediate the environmental concerns and to fund a variety of measures to secure the sites until they are fully decommissioned. This money is not to continue the operation of Loran-C. It is to terminate it in a way that is proper and makes sure that while we remove these stations, we are doing it in a responsible way.  What we do in the committee mark is to make sure that the Coast Guard doesn't have to take away money from critical missions--search and rescue or drug interdiction or marine safety or environmental compliance--to terminate this program. We did include funding so that the Loran-C stations could be shut down responsibly.  The administration has sent us a statement of administration policy. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                   Statement of Administration Policy  H.R. 2892--Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2010       (Senator Inouye, D-Hawaii, July 7, 2009)       The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of H.R.      2892, with the committee-reported text of S. 1298, making      appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security for      the fiscal year ending September 30, 2010.       As we face difficult economic and fiscal decisions, it is      important to make efficient and effective investments. The      Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2010, as      considered by the Senate Committee, makes important      investments in transportation systems, cyber security,      innovation and job creation, security for our borders, and      emergency response. This legislation serves as an important      piece of the Nation's economic recovery.       The Administration would like to take this opportunity to      share additional views regarding the Committee's version of      the bill.                    Federal Protection Service (FPS)       The Administration is pleased that the Committee supports      the transfer of FPS to the National Protection and Programs      Directorate (NPPD). This transfer will properly align the      activities of FPS and NPPD, while allowing Immigration and      Customs Enforcement to focus on its key immigration      enforcement mission. The Administration plans to provide      additional details to the Congress in support of the FPS      transition and realignment of these responsibilities in the      next few weeks.                           E-Verify Extension       The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for      E-Verify by fully funding the request and including a three-     year reauthorization to continue operations. This critical      program supports immigration enforcement and promotes      compliance with immigration laws.  Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA's) Disaster Relief Fund       The Committee significantly underfunds the Disaster Relief      Fund (DRF). In an effort to implement a more transparent      funding process for DRF, the Administration's $2 billion      request is based on a methodology that incorporates      historical costs associated with FEMA's response for non-     catastrophic incidents.                          Loran-C Termination       The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for      termination of the Loran-C radio navigation system. The      Administration supports the Committee's aim to achieve an      orderly termination through a phased decommissioning      beginning in January 2010, and the requirement that      certifications be provided to document that the Loran-C      termination will not impair maritime safety or the      development of possible GPS backup capabilities or needs.                          Immigration Services       The Congress is urged to provide the requested funding to      reform immigration fees. Eliminating the practice of passing      on costs for refugees and asylees to other applicants for      immigration benefits is an important first step to improve      the accuracy, transparency, and fairness of immigration fees.       The Administration strongly urges the Congress to provide      additional resources to support and expand successful      immigrant integration programs across the country.
