 President, I wish to speak to the war on women's health and Planned Parenthood.  To be clear, to end Federal funding for Planned Parenthood is to stop providing critical health care to millions of Americans, the majority of them who are poor and simply cannot afford services anywhere else.  This effort will strip the poor and middle classes of their right to preventive healthcare.  Through 800 nationwide locations, Planned Parenthood provides cancer screening, HIV and STD tests, contraceptives, education and empowerment.  Planned Parenthood estimates it prevents over 620,000 unintended pregnancies and 220,000 abortions each year.  Seventy-five percent of its clients are at or below the poverty line. Abortions account for just 3 percent of its overall activities.  What House Republicans seem to have forgotten is that by existing law, taxpayer funding cannot be used for abortions except in cases of rape, incest, or if the woman's life is in danger.  A ban on Federal spending for abortions has been in place since 1976. That is 35 years this ban has been in place.  Yet today House Republicans continue to try to strip Planned Parenthood of its Federal funding and continue to use this issue as a bargaining chip in a debate over the budget.  But the vote the Senate will have to take is clearly not about the budget, it is a war on women's health. This effort would essentially turn back the clock on women's health.  I said this last week, and I will say it again. This is simply an opportunity for the right wing in the House to really sock it to American women.  Let's talk about the facts.  Over 90 percent of care provided by Planned Parenthood is preventive. Planned Parenthood provides care to almost 3 million patients nationwide every year, many of whom have no other place to go.  Only 3 percent of Planned Parenthood's total services are abortion services. And that 3 percent is not made up of Federal funds.  Every year, Planned Parenthood provides affordable contraception for nearly 2.5 million patients, nearly 1 million cervical cancer screens, 830,000 breast exams, and 4 million tests and treatments for sexually transmitted infections, including half a million HIV tests.  These critical preventive services include annual exams, flu vaccines, smoking cessation, and well baby care.  Planned Parenthood helped to prevent 612,000 unintended pregnancies in 2009 alone. Every dollar invested in helping women avoid unintended pregnancies saves $4 in public funds.  And House Republicans want to eliminate Federal funding for this program?  These cuts are biased, politically motivated, and hurts women--particularly low-income women.  Seventy-five percent of Planned Parenthood's clients have incomes at or below 150 percent of the Federal poverty level.  In California alone, Planned Parenthood serves over 750,000 patients, over 680,000 of them through federal funds.  This program is necessary, effective, and oftentimes a last resort.  Let me share a story from one woman from my home State of California.  Mary couldn't afford annual visits to her regular OB/GYN office during college. So a friend suggested she visit Planned Parenthood for a free exam.  Mary said, ``After some hesitation I went. Thank god that I did. During my visit they found that I had the first signs of cervical cancer. I was 19 and terrified.  ``The staff at Planned Parenthood was so supportive and understanding. One doctor in particular was amazing, I wish I could find her and thank her personally. She went out of her way to call and check up on me once a week until I had recovered completely from the procedure that got rid of the cancerous cells.''  Six years later, Mary is still healthy and still so grateful for the excellent and compassionate care she received at Planned Parenthood.  There are thousands of other stories like Mary's. I have heard from these young women who went to Planned Parenthood for STD screening and birth control, when they had no other place to go.  I have heard from women pleading with me to preserve Federal funding to Planned Parenthood; telling me that the cancer screenings they received saved their lives.  The House Republicans also want to defund the Affordable Care Act, and block critical consumer protections in the law.  This too targets women. House Republicans want to go back to the days where women could be denied insurance coverage for the ``preexisting condition'' of being pregnant.  They want to reinstate gender rating, where insurance companies charge women higher premiums simply because of gender.  House Republicans want to remove maternity care as an essential health benefit. Currently only 12 percent of health plans in the individual market offer any maternity coverage.  So you see, defunding Planned Parenthood and the Affordable Care Act is not about reducing the deficit or balancing the budget. It is about harming women.  We need to look carefully at our spending and we need to make cuts, but not at the expense of the women in our country.  It is a shame that the budget debate has turned into an ideological war.  It is a shame that funding for health care and family planning is considered ``government waste'' by some Republicans.  When in reality, it is an ideological assault on women's health. I do not support any cuts that harm women and children.  I urge my colleagues return to the issue at hand so we can seriously discuss the Federal deficit, absent an ideological agenda.                          ____________________
