 I am happy to submit it for the Record and to assure our colleagues we are working for the safety of all Americans.  I have a number of points to which, if this debate continues, I will be speaking this afternoon. But I truly hope that now we can move on and put this bill into place so that we can move to conference, and to make sure we have done the right thing in terms of the infrastructure in our country that is so important to all of our constituents.  I thank the President and I reserve the remainder of my time.
