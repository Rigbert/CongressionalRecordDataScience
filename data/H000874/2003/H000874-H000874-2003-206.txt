Speaker, I would say to my friend, I know the differences that the chairman pointed to and you have pointed to in terms of making this either permanent or at least 10 years in authorization. I do not, frankly, think there would be opposition to making this permanent on our side. However, we are concerned that in the effort to make it permanent we will fail to make it at least temporary, which we could then follow up by making it permanent. I appreciate the gentleman's comments.  Drug reimportation is an issue. Which day does the gentleman expect to have the drug reimportation bill on the floor? Do you know when it will be on the floor?
