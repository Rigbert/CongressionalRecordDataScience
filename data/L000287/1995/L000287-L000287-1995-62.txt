Mr. Speaker, while I was in my district yesterday, I met senior citizens who are frightened. They don't have much money to spare, and they watch what they spend. They are worried that they will lose the security of Medicare.  They understand that cuts to Medicare are not reform. They understand that they will pay more.  I share their concern. The Republicans say they will give seniors more choice. But they do not mention that many seniors cannot afford the choice. Our elderly will pay more and get less.  Republicans say they must cut Medicare to save it. If my Republican colleagues are concerned about the Medicare Program, why do they cut Medicare to pay for tax cuts for the rich? This will not help Medicare.  Thirty years ago, Congress and the President signed a sacred trust with our seniors--Medicare. We must not stand by while that trust is broken.                          ____________________
