President, I rise today to inform my colleagues of legislation that I introduced on April 10 called the Child Care Expansion Act.  This legislation--the first legislation I have had the privilege of introducing in this body--does address one of the greatest challenges that faces families today, and that is finding dependable and affordable child care.  The demand for quality child care is rising. We have changes in family structure, more working mothers, and significant changes in social policy, which all have helped--all have helped--drive this increase. In fact, only 2 years ago 60 percent of children under the age of 5 were cared for by someone other than a parent while their mother or father was working.  We have had numerous studies that indicate the availability of child care has failed to keep up with this demand. Three out of four parents responding to a national poll indicate that there is an insufficient supply of child care, Mr. President, especially for infants.  Child care keeps America working.  In 1994, three out of five women with children under the age of 6 were in the work force. A lack of dependable child care causes these workers to lose time and to be less productive. Child care benefits provided by employers help to recruit and retain quality employees. It pays off with lower costs in regard to the businesses that have a good child-care program. And child-care providers are also small business owners who contribute to the economy while keeping our children safe.  Child care provides access to high-quality learning environments for children in their critical learning years.  Just last week--I think it was last Wednesday--in the Wall Street Journal there was an article entitled ``Good, Early Care Has a Huge Impact on Kids, Studies Say.'' And that article pointed out the monumental importance of quality child care in the first 3 years of the infant's life. And according to the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, a study cited in the article, high-quality child care provided by nurturing, stimulating care givers improves the cognitive learning and language skills. These are skills a child depends on for the rest of his or her life.  So child care is central to the implementation of successful welfare reform.  I might add, that the concept of this child-care bill, as far as I was concerned, became very evident as we went through welfare reform legislation in the past session of the Congress when I had the privilege of being the chairman of the House Agriculture Committee and we were approaching food stamp reform.  It became obvious to me, if we were going to provide self-reliance, independence, and the tools with which about 2,000 people in Kansas needed to get off the welfare rolls and become self-reliant--these people had been on welfare for over 5 years--they did two things, job training, that is obvious, and the second thing was child care.  Stringent new work requirements will move more welfare parents into the work force and create an even greater demand for quality child care. I think this legislation simply addresses these issues through a responsible four-pronged approach. There are no new entitlements, no new mandates on businesses. This legislation fills a pressing need without creating more bureaucracy or more government.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of S. 548 be printed in the Congressional Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 548       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
