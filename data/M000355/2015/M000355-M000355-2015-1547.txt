 President, on Monday at 12 noon, the Senate will proceed to consider the budget resolution. Senators should expect at least one vote on an amendment to the budget at 5:30 p.m. on Monday night.  For the information of all Senators, the budget resolution is privileged and therefore will not displace the pending trafficking legislation. Once the budget resolution has been adopted, the trafficking bill will be the pending business before the Senate.                          ____________________
