President, I oppose the proposed amendment. It is short-term rate relief, but it is long-term rate pain for thousands of students and families across the country. We can do much better than that. In a few moments, we will have an opportunity after the voice vote to have another small discussion prior to final passage.  Again, I believe this amendment is not--despite the best work and best intentions and great effort by my colleagues--the best work we can do with respect to students and families.
