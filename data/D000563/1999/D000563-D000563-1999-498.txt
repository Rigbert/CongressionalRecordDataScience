President, today I am introducing legislation that would replace the current fragmented federal food safety system with a single, independent agency responsible for all federal food safety activities--the Safe Food Act of 1999 (S. 1281). I am pleased to be joined by Senators Torricelli, Mikulski, and Cleland in this important effort.  Make no mistake, our country has been blessed with one of the safest and most abundant food supplies in the world. However, we can do better. Foodborne illness is a significant problem.  The safety of our nation's food supply is facing tremendous pressures with regard to emerging pathogens, an aging population with a growing number of people at high risk for foodborne illnesses, broader food distribution patterns, an increasing volume of food imports, and changing consumption patterns.  The General Accounting Office (GAO) estimates that as many as 81 million people will suffer food poisoning this year and more than 9,000 will die. Children and the elderly are especially vulnerable. In terms of medical costs and productivity losses, foodborne illness costs the nation up to $37 billion annually. The situation is not likely to improve without decisive action. The Department of Health and Human Services predicts that foodborne illnesses and deaths will increase 10-15 percent over the next decade.  In 1997, a Princeton Research survey found that 44 percent of Americans believe the food supply in this country is less safe than it was 10 years ago. American consumers spend more than $617 billion annually on food, of which about $511 billion is spent on foods grown on U.S. farms. Our ability to assure that the safety of our food and to react rapidly to potential threats to food safety is critical not only for public health, but also to the vitality of both domestic and rural economies and international trade.  Many of you are probably following the dioxin crisis in Belgium. Days before the national elections poultry, eggs, pork, beef, and dairy products were withdrawn from supermarket shelves. Butcher shops closed and livestock farms were quarantined. Since then countries, worldwide, have restricted imports of eggs, chickens, and pork from the European Union. Public outrage in Belgium over the dioxin scandal led to a disastrous showing by the ruling party in the national and European elections on June 14, and the government was forced to resign. Food safety concerns and fears are global.  Today, food moves through a global marketplace. This was not the case in the early 1900's when the first federal food safety agencies were created. Throughout this century, Congress responded by adding layer upon layer--agency upon agency--to answer the pressing food safety needs of the day. That's how the federal food safety system got to the point where it is today. And again as we face increasing pressures on food safety, the federal government must respond. But we must respond not only to these pressures but also to the very fragmented nature of the federal food safety structure.  Fragmentation of our food safety system is a burden that must be changed to protect the public health from these increasing pressures. Currently, there are at least 12 different federal agencies, 35 different laws governing food safety, and 28 House and Senate subcommittees with food safety oversight. With overlapping jurisdictions, federal agencies often lack accountability on food safety-related issues.  Last August, the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) released a report recommending the establishment of a ``unified and central framework'' for managing federal food safety programs, ``one that is headed by a single official and which has the responsibility and control of resources for all federal food safety activities.'' I agree with this conclusion.  The Administration has stepped forward on the issue of food safety--the President's Food Safety Initiatives and the President's Council on Food Safety have focused efforts to track and prevent microbial foodborne illnesses. I commend President Clinton and Secretaries Glickman and Shalala for their commitment to improving our nation's food safety and inspection systems. Earlier this year in response to the NAS report, the President's Council on Food Safety stated its support for the NAS recommendation calling for a new statute that establishes a unified framework for food safety programs with a single official with control over all federal food safety resources.  An independent single food safety agency is needed to replace the current, fragmented system. My proposed legislation would combine the functions of USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service, FDA's Center forFood Safety and Applied Nutrition and the Center for Veterinary Medicine, the Department of Commerce's Seafood Inspection Program, and the food safety functions of other federal agencies. This new, independent agency would be funded with the combined budgets from these consolidated agencies.  With overlapping jurisdictions, federal agencies many times lack accountability on food safety-related issues. There are simply too many cooks in the kitchen. A single, independent agency would help focus our policy and improve enforcement of food safety and inspection laws.  The General Accounting Office has been unequivocal in its recommendation for consolidation of federal food safety programs. GAO's April 1998 report states that ``since 1992, we have frequently reported on the fragmented and inconsistent organization of food safety responsibilities in the federal government.'' In a May 25, 1994 report, GAO cites that its ``testimony is based on over 60 reports and studies issued over the last 25 years by GAO, agency Inspectors General, and others.'' The Appendix to the 1994 GAO report lists: 49 reports since 1977, 9 USDA Office of Inspector General reports since 1986, 1 HHS Office of Inspector General report in 1991, and 15 reports and studies by Congress, scientific organizations, and others since 1981.  Again, earlier this year, GAO in its 21-volume report on government waste, pointed to the lack of coordination of the federal food safety efforts as an example. ``So many cooks are spoiling the broth,'' says the GAO while highlighting the absurdity of having one federal agency inspecting frozen meat pizza and another inspecting frozen cheese pizza.  Over 20 years ago, the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs advised that consolidation is essential to avoid conflicts of interest and overlapping jurisdictions. In a 1977 report the committee stated, ``While we support the recent efforts of FDA and USDA to improve coordination between the agencies, periodic meetings will not be enough to overcome [these] problems.'' This statement is just as true today as it was then.  It's time to move forward. Let us stop using multiple federal agencies to inspect pizza. Instead let us ``deliver'' what makes sense--a single, independent food safety agency.  A single, independent agency with uniform food safety standards and regulations based on food hazards would provide an easier framework for implementing U.S. standards in an international context. When our own agencies don't have uniform safety and inspection standards for all potentially hazardous foods, the establishment of uniform international standards will be next to impossible.  Research could be better coordinated within a single agency than among multiple programs. Currently, federal funding for food safety research is spread over at least 20 federal agencies, and coordination among those agencies is ad hoc at best.  New technologies to improve food safety could be approved more rapidly with one food safety agency. Currently, food safety technologies must go through multiple agencies for approval, often adding years of delay.  In this era of limited budgets, it is our responsibility to modernize and streamline the food safety system. The U.S. simply cannot afford to continue operating multiple systems. This is not about more regulation, a super agency, or increased bureaucracy, it's about common sense and more effective marshaling of our existing federal resources.  With the incidence of food recalls on the rise, it is important to move beyond short-term solutions to major food safety problems. A single, independent food safety and inspection agency could more easily work toward long-term solutions to the frustrating and potentially life-threatening issue of food safety.  Mr. President, together, we can bring the various agencies together to eliminate the overlap and confusion that have, unfortunately, at times characterized our food safety efforts. We need action, not simply reaction. I encourage my colleagues to join me in this effort to consolidate the food safety and inspection functions of numerous agencies and offices into a single, independent food safety agency.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1281       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
