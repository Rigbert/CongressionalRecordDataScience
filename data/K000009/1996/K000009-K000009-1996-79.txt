Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a man of rare vision who has devoted his life to the labor movement and to improving the lives and working conditions of America's working men and women. Eugene H. Kolkman joined the Retail Clerks International Union in 1953 in Fort Wayne, IN. This month he retires as secretary-treasurer of the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 911 after 35 years of outstanding leadership as a union official. His intelligence and persevering spirit carried Gene to higher and higher responsibilities. In fact, Gene Kolkman has done virtually every job a union man can do--from field organizer, business agent, and local union president. In 1970, Gene rose to the position of executive assistant to then-UFCW Vice President Bill Wynn, having responsibility for the union's Central Division covering Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, and Michigan.  Gene has also served the broader labor movement holding positions as recording secretary of the Toledo area AFL-CIO; executive secretary of the Toledo Port Council; and vice president of the Ohio State AFL-CIO. Gene's career representing his fellow workers is an inspiration to all concerned about the welfare of working families.  In 1956, Gene married Judy Fenstermacker, and they have raised two children, Jennifer and Christopher. On September 1, Judy and Gene will celebrate 39 years together, another source of inspiration.  Mr. Speaker, this Congress should celebrate the lives of labor leaders such as Gene Kolkman, who dedicate their careers to helping others help themselves. Let us wish Godspeed to Gene and Judy in their retirement and a resounding thank you from our entire community for a job done with excellence always.                          ____________________
