Speaker, Jerry Relmann is retiring after 36 years of service to the Berrien County Intermediate School District in Southwest Michigan. His commitment to kids and their education will not be forgotten. Jerry has been an invaluable colleague in helping craft education policy and ensuring that our kids receive a quality education.  Jerry began his career in 1966 as a school psychologist for the Berrien County Intermediate School District. Dedicated, principled, and hard-working, Jerry's love for education led him to embrace a career within Michigan's public school system. Jerry has held a number of posts within the Berrien County ISD, including Director of Special Education and his current position as Superintendent. Under his administration, students of Berrien County have thrived. We owe him a tremendous debt of gratitude.  I would like to personally extend my regards to Jerry for his counsel on the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act as well as his commitment to special education funding for Michigan's children. Jerry was able to bring to the table a local perspective during this debate over federal education initiatives. I will truly miss working with this great individual.  Good luck and God Bless.                          ____________________
