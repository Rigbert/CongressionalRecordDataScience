Speaker, in 1966, I was elected to the Maryland State Senate. I was a few months out of Georgetown Law School. And elected at the same time was an extraordinary representative of our State. He was elected to the House of Delegates.  In 1970, he was elected to the Congress of the United States and served in the Congress until 1976. In 1976, the citizens of our State elected him to the United States Senate. Paul Sarbanes retired 2 years ago as the longest-serving member of the United States Senate in the history of our State.  His partner in all of those efforts was an extraordinary woman. Her name was Christine. She was born in England. She was an extraordinary individual. Paul Sarbanes was a great intellect. Christine matched his intellect. Paul Sarbanes was a person of extraordinary integrity, and his partner, Christine, matched that integrity.  Paul Sarbanes was a person of great depth and great compassion, mirrored by his wife, Christine.  Christine Sarbanes, the mother of our colleague, John Sarbanes, who represents the district that his father once represented. Christine Sarbanes passed away this weekend. Christine was a loving friend and partner to her husband for nearly half a century, and those of us who were active with her husband in the public sphere and got to know her well and got to be her friend were blessed by that relationship.  She took the partnership with Paul very seriously. From the days when she and Paul knocked on hundreds of doors each afternoon to get him elected to the House of Delegates to the days when she acted as Senator Sarbanes's most trusted adviser. Like her husband, Christine possessed, as I have said, tremendous political savvy, deep intelligence and a love of learning.  In fact, she once said that she and Paul bought their house because it was within walking distance of a library. No one was surprised at that criteria for purchasing a home.  Christine passed that love of learning to generations of students as a teacher of Latin, Greek, and French.                              {time}  1715  Her son reflects that deep intellect as he serves the constituents of the Third Congressional District of Maryland.  As a tireless worker for UNICEF, Christine served the international community. Among the many other charities she served, Christine took up the fight for children around the world.  So today, Mr. Speaker, we mourn the loss of an honored teacher, wise counselor, passionate advocate, and her family mourns the loss of an irreplaceable mother and wife.  I lost my wife Judy 12 years ago. So I know something of the pain that Senator Sarbanes is experiencing. He's one of my closest friends. We've been involved in politics for over four decades together, but I also know that love outlasts grief. As Oscar Wilde said, ``Where there is sorrow, there is sacred ground.''  As long as her loved ones live--her grandchildren will survive for a long period of time--their memories of the wife, their mother, their grandmother, will be sacred to them. Something of her will live on, on the sacred ground of memory, as long as those memories last.  I know that all the Members of this House in which Paul Sarbanes and Christine, although not elected, served so ably for 6 years, and the colleagues of his in the United States Senate who grew to know Christine as well as they knew Paul and respected her and loved her as they loved Paul, I know they share in his grief, in John Sarbanes's grief, in his brother's grief, and their grandchildren's grief.  So, Mr. Speaker, I know that the House joins me in expressing our deep regrets and that our prayers and sympathy are with the Sarbanes family, a family of immigrants, that came to this country and have made it better, like so many others. Paul Sarbanes still lives, still serves. Christine is gone, but her memory is not. We honor her this evening.                          ____________________
