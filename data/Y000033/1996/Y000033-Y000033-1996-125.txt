Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 3557, the Marion National Fish Hatchery Conveyance Act, introduced by our colleague from Alabama, Earl Hilliard.  The legislation will transfer the 300 acres that comprise the Marion Hatchery to the State of Alabama. This facility has been effectively operated by the Alabama Game and Fish Division for over 20 years and during thattime it has produced thousands of bluegills, channel catfish, largemouth bass, striped bass, and hybrid striped bass fingerlings. These fish are used to stock over 500,000 acres of public waters in the State of Alabama and they are available to over 530,000 licensed sport anglers.  In addition, the Marion Fish Hatchery has provided over 1.3 million gulf striped bass fry to 3 Federal and 2 neighboring State hatcheries and over 270,000 gulf striped bass fingerlings to support Federal and State programs in the State of Florida.  Finally, the State of Alabama has spent over $2 million on facility improvements and renovations at the Marion National Fish Hatchery since it assumed operational control. The Alabama Game and Fish Division has stated that ``the Division will continue to utilize the facility for the production of fish to enhance the freshwaters of Alabama and the thousands of people who enjoy fishing these waters.''  I urge an ``aye'' vote on this legislation which has been endorsed by both the Clinton administration and the Governor of the State of Alabama, the Honorable Fob James, Jr.
