Mr. Speaker, I think it is very unfortunatethe House is voting today to extend permanently MFN for Romania. Just as a preface, let me remind Members that throughout the 1980's when the gentleman from Florida and others continually pushed for most-favored-nation status for Romania, the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Hall] the gentleman from Virginia [Mr. Wolf], and myself were in the vanguard and fought to withdraw MFN status.  I led three human rights missions to Romania. Under the Ceausescu regime, we fought to take MFN from Romania because of the brutal dictatorship that existed there. Therefore, I think I have some standing before this body on this issue.  I care deeply about the Romanian people. I think the question before us is a matter of when. This is the wrong time. There is an important national election that will be held in November. There have been very serious allegations of media abuse, especially access to the media, by members of the opposition parties who find it increasingly difficult to get their message out. We all know as politicians, and as candidates, that if the media is biased and if it is somewhat government-controlled, particularly the television outlets, you do not get your message out to the voters.  I respectfully submit that Members should be mindful that MFN is in place right now. Iliescu, the Romanian Government, the people of Romania have most-favored-nation status. The question is whether or not we make it permanent. I think that question should be settled after this very, very important national election that is scheduled for November.  There were recent local elections held. We heard from objective observers that there were problems, problems with the accuracy of the voter lists in particular, problems with inconsistent interpretation of the election law, and those kinds of irregularities raise the stakes for the upcoming elections.  If we now say, you have MFN, we are not going to review this anymore, I think we take away that pressure, that vigilance which that review, connected with most-favored-nation status will give us.  Finally, Mr. Speaker, there are laws on the books in Romania, and I think this is a very disturbing trend, that will put journalists into prison if they criticize or speak out against the government.  If we had these laws in this country, that would be a gross violation of First Amendment rights, of freedom of speech and freedom of the press. Yet, we see this disturbing trend occurring in Bucharest which will bring to bear the full weight of the law, with terms from 3-months to 3-years in prison for those tenacious, objective, and unbiased reporters who are willing to take on the government.                              {time}  1530  All of us get bad editorials. We all get frustrated at times with the way that our own media handles what we consider to be the truth or the accuracy of our opinions, but we do not criminalize their actions. But, in Romania there is this disturbing trend which we need to speak out against. Again, the annual review gives us that ability to say, Wait a minute, let's look at the record and then let's look whether or not we want to confer for another year most-favored-nation status on Romania.  Let us not remove that little bit of pressure which we have at this stage. I sincerely hope that Members will vote this down with the clear understanding when the 105th Congress meets, we will look again at this issue in light of the national elections that will have taken place in November 1996.  Also, we are hoping that there will be domestic observers on the ground observing the upcoming elections. Little notice has been given to the fact that in 1992 there were domestic observers, but that provision will not be made this November unless there is a change.  All of us know that, even in our own elections, if we do not have poll watchers standing by, checking those voter lists, fraud is a real potential. Provision for domestic observers is not available for this upcoming election. We know there will not be enough international observers to go around and the possibilities are ripe for election fraud.  Mr. Chairman, I urge that the issue before the House be deferred. Let us look at the full record of the 1996 national elections and then make an informed and hopefully prudent decision on Romania's permanent MFN status.
