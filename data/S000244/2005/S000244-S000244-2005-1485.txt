Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Speaker, the amendment in the nature of a substitute completely guts this bill. Every crippling amendment that was rejected either in this House or the other body in this Congress or the previous Congress is incorporated in this amendment. They do not have any new ideas over there. They just repackage and try to regurgitate the old ideas that have been found lacking.  The issue in this bill is very clear, and that is that we have to restore some sanity to the civil justice system by dealing with the abuses that a small group of lawyers have turned the class action system into.  When the framers of the Constitution wrote that inspired document, they gave Congress the power to regulate interstate Congress. What has happened as a result of the abuse of the class action system is that judges in small out-of-the-way counties, like Madison County, Illinois and Jefferson County, Texas end up being the ultimate arbiters of interstate commerce.  This bill puts some balance back into the system. The amendment perpetuates the existing system. Vote ``no'' on the amendments, vote ``no'' on the motion to recommit, and pass the bill.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
