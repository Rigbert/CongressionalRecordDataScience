Speaker, I think it behooves us as legislators, knowing there are many subtleties and words, to have before us the actual language, the laws that are being waived, the laws that are being superseded, the new standards that will be imposed, and the objectives before we vote. The gentleman derided me, the gentleman from Louisiana, for I have read the bill, and I voted against the original rescissions bill. I have read the language that was available an hour ago. I have talked to the chief of the Forest Service as recently as an hour ago. But there is language now that has come since that time that is not available in print.
