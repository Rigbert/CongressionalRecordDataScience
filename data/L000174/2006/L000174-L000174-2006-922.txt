President, I wish today to acknowledge the good work of Bill O'Neill, a document checker at the Burlington International Airport in Vermont.  I routinely fly between Burlington and Washington, and it is always a pleasure to see Bill at the ID checking stand. He and I have been friends for decades.  I was pleased to see an article about Bill in the December 27, 2005, Burlington Free Press. I ask that a copy of the article be printed in the Record. I know that once they read it, my colleagues will look forward to traveling through the Burlington airport as much as I do.  The article follows.            [From the Burlington Free Press, Dec. 27, 2005]Security With a Smile, Airport Screener Bill O'Neill Helps Take Stress                              Out of Flying                           (By Emily Guziak)       South Burlington.--Bill O'Neill's job does not require that      he fawn over babies.       Nor does it require that he greet everyone he meets by name      with a heartfelt good morning, put their various airline      receipts in order, hold cups of coffee, or provide tips on      how to switch planes at the next destination.       O'Neill, a document checker for PrimeFlight Aviation      Services at Burlington International Airport, is simply      required to check departing passengers' identification,      boarding passes and number and size of carry-on items.       For frequent travelers, the document checker is often the      nameless, faceless, overly efficient person hurrying      passengers into inevitable security lines. For bleary-eyed,      often-harried early morning travelers in Burlington,      O'Neill's station at Gate One is an oasis in the rush of      processing passengers through ticket check-in and      Transportation Security Administration security clearance.       ``He's brilliant; he's great,'' said business traveler J.P.      Tardy, of Charlotte, N.C., queuing up in the security line      for United Airline's 7:48 a.m. flight to Chicago on a recent      weekday morning. ``He absolutely makes this airport.''       O'Neill, 72, is the document checker for United Airlines      and US Airways passengers, from 4:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m.      Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays. His upbeat, helpful manner      never wavers, those working around him say.       ``He's very people-oriented; people like him,'' said Mark      Salisbury, supervisor, transportation security officer, for      TSA at Burlington International Airport. Salisbury supervises      the security checkpoint near     O'Neill's station. ``He's worked in the business for a long      time, so I'm sure he's seen it all. He's just a very nice      guy. And he's very helpful, especially for older folks.''       ``You feel like you're being greeted, rather than just      being moved into the line by a security person,'' said Deedee      O'Brien of Shelburne, en route to Los Angeles on the Chicago      flight. ``I think he was here when we traveled six months      ago. He's such a nice person.''       O'Neill's performance should be catching the attention of      all those marketing gurus out there trying to sell the      quintessential New England hometown atmosphere. At 6:30 a.m.,      as passengers went through O'Neill's station, the mood of      some travelers changed from tense to relaxed.       ``He provides the best service I've ever had,'' said Dan      Grant, of Seattle, a weekly business traveler. ``If you fly a      lot and go through the larger airports, you can get kind of      beaten down. You're lucky if you can get a word out of people      in his job.''       He is in command at his post. ``You can put that ID away;      you won't need it anymore today and your boarding pass to      Philly is right here,'' O'Neill quietly and calmly told one      of the people in the steady stream of departing passengers.      ``I thank you, and you have a good day.''       ``He takes the hassle out of what travel has become,'' said      Andy Tomlinson of South Burlington, on her way ``to go home      and do the Santa thing'' with family in California. ``He's      great.''       A United Airlines employee for 32 years, O'Neill retired in      1998 and returned to work in March for extra income. He is      employed by PrimeFlight Aviation of Nashville, Tenn. The      company has 4,000 employees in 50 airports in the United      States providing a variety of services. In Burlington, United      Airlines and US Airways contract with PrimeFlight to provide      five document checkers.       O'Neill also has the task of informing passengers when they      have been randomly selected by the airlines for an additional      search, and must proceed to the line to their right, rather      than left. ``People can resent it, especially if they're in a      hurry,'' O'Neill said.       ``I tell them, I `fly free because I have a golden pass,      and every time I fly the computer randomly selects me because      it reads my ticket as cash, one-way and automatically makes      me a selectee. I tell them their special search is no      different than mine and it often makes them feel better.;''       ``He is just fantastic,'' said Thane Butt, of Shelburne,      flying to Chicago with her husband, Peter. Butt jokingly      asked the bushy-eyebrowed O'Neill if he was Andy Rooney.       ``I've been asked that a few times,'' said the unflappable      O'Neill.       ``He makes you feel like you're not just another person,''      said Dr. Alan Segal of South Burlington. ``And he's got one      of those faces; he looks like everyone's      grandfather.''                          ____________________
