I think it is important that a Senator from a State where this mining is taking place has come to share this story. This is not just testimony presented by environmental groups. These are the real-life circumstances of people in Western States, where the mining is taking place, who are left with a mess when the mines go bankrupt.  This environmental rider stops us from revising and reforming the financial assurance language and requiring bonds of companies that literally will protect the communities and the taxpayers and families around these mining sites. That is what it is all about. That is the bottom line.  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues in the Senate. I have waited for a long time to offer this. I will not belabor it. I hope they will join me in passing this amendment, which will establish standards which I think are reasonable to make sure this industry can continue but only in a responsible way.  I yield the floor.
