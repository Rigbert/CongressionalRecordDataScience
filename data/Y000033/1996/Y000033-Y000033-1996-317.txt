Mr. Speaker, the issues of the Tongass National Forest have been before the Congress for some time. Many of us were here in 1990 for the Tongass Timber Reform Act, which set aside 1 million acres of wilderness and unilaterally modified the two long-term timber contracts. Some of us remember the Alaska Lands Act of 1980, which set aside about 5 million acres of Tongass wilderness. But no current member was here for the first act of Congress specific to the Tongass--the Tongass Timber Act of 1947, which authorized the sale of timber from the Tongass for the purpose of local employment. At a time when debate over the Tongass becomes every day more contentious and confused it may be worthwhile to look back to that act. This history is relevant because the problems the 1947 act worked to solve are being recreated today by a handful of extremists.  The 1947 act was the culmination of a quarter-century-long effort to develop a stable, year-round industry in southeast Alaska. Before Congress authorized the sale of timber, thereby inducing the pulp companies to invest in Alaska, there was not much of an economy in southeast. Fishing was poor, tourism was nonexistent and the gold mines had been closed during the war. The population was small and transient--it was a hard place to raise a family. Congress decided, and President Truman agreed, that the sale of timber through long-term contracts would improve the situation, stabilize the economy of southeast Alaska and serve the interests of Alaska and the United States.  The contracts were in the interest of Alaska because they fostered a prosperous and stable economy. They were in the interest of the United States because Tongass forest products helped supply the post-war housing boom in the United States and were instrumental in the reconstruction of Japan. The contracts were necessary for defense purposes as well--Alaska had proven vulnerable in World War II and needed a stable population to secure the territory. All of these benefits were recognized in the House report that accompanied the 1947 Tongass Timber Act:       A large-scale development of the timber resources in      southeastern Alaska, involving the establishment of important      business enterprises and the employment of many persons for      extensive operations on a year-round basis, is essential to      the maintenance of a prosperous and stable economy in the      Territory. Heretofore, Alaska has been handicapped by the      seasonal nature of the principal industrial activities      conducted within the area. A timber program of the sort      mentioned by the Secretary of the Interior would be of great      benefit in assisting the people of Alaska to progress from      the present dependence upon seasonal business operations.      Moreover, such a development within the Territory would be of      great value to the Nation as a whole, both from the      standpoint of making available to the National economy      valuable and sorely needed products from the great forests in      southeastern Alaska and from the standpoint of promoting      national defense through increasing the population and      industrial capacity of Alaska as our ``Northern Rampart.''      House Committee on Agriculture, Report No. 873, July 10,      1947.  The Tongass timber industry was essential to those ends in 1947 and it remains so today. We still need a year-round economy in southeast Alaska. We still need a domestic supply of forest products to meet national and international demand. We still need a stable population base in Alaska for our national security.What is more, the only viable domestic timber supply comes from the Federal Tongass forest. Please keep this history in mind the next time the Tongass issue comes before Congress.                          ____________________
