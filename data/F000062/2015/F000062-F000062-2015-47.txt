 President, I ask the Senate to vote no on this amendment, and I would like to explain why. This amendment would create an exemption to the bill's narrowly tailored liability protections for companies that take responsible actions to look for cyber threats and share information about them if a company ``breaks a user or privacy agreement with a customer, regardless of how trivial it may be.''  The underlying cyber bill has been carefully drafted to ensure that it is totally voluntary and that activities can only be conducted on a customer's behalf with express authorization.  Let me read the language in the bill. The bill reads:       Nothing in this title shall be construed--       (1) to amend, repeal, or supersede any current or future      contractual agreement, terms of service agreement, or other      contractual relationship between any entities, or between any      entity and a Federal entity.  There is tremendous objection to the Paul amendment that is coming in from the chamber of commerce, various companies, and the health industry. They understand what is in our bill. This amendment would actually fatally disturb what is in the bill, which is clear and concise.  I urge a ``no'' vote.
