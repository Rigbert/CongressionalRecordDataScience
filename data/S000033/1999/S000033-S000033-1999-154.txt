 Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, I want to applaud the gentleman from New York (Mr. Hinchey) on his amendment. It is no great secret that over the years, there have been many aspects of American foreign policy which have been wrong. It is no secret that the United States over the years has been involved in the overthrow of a number of democratic governments.  In the case of Chile in 1973, there was a democratic government elected by the people. The President of that government was Salvador Allende. His policies antagonized corporate interests in the United States. A great deal of pressure was brought to bear in seeing him overthrown.  I think it is a very positive step as we develop ideas for the future, as we try to develop a democratic foreign policy that we in fact know what we did in the past.  So I think the amendment of the gentleman from New York (Mr. Hinchey) is a very important one. I think we should let the truth come out, and I strongly support his efforts.
