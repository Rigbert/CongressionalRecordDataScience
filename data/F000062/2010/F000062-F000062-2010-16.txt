 President, I rise to support the Middle Class Tax Cuts Act of 2010, which gives permanent tax relief to struggling American families who need it most. By extending the current rates for 98 percent of taxpayers, this bill provides the certainty and security necessary to protect working Americans, while at the same time indicating that we need help and that we ask upper income Americans to help address our growing fiscal deficits.  Make no mistake; extending current tax rates for the middle class is crucial in order to encourage economic growth.
