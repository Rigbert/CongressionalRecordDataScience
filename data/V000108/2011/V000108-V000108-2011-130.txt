I happen to believe that we have climate change. Others will debate that, and I would set aside that debate for the moment and simply recognize the obvious, and that is we have had significant variations in weather patterns in the United States of America. We have had horrific flooding in the Midwest during this past year, and that flooding has huge impacts on the reservoirs that are managed by the Army Corps of Engineers. I think it is not correct public policy to not proceed with the study as to how climate and weather patterns affect those very important Corps projects and appreciate the chairman rising in objection.  The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman from Massachusetts has expired.  (On request of Mr. Dicks, and by unanimous consent, Mr. Markey was allowed to proceed for 1 additional minute.)
