Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, section 414 does allow an investment banker that previously represented a business to continue to represent the business after it files for bankruptcy. Under current law, that investment banker would be prohibited from representing the debtor on a per se basis.  Let me say that this issue was debated in the Committee on the Judiciary. There was an amendment that was offered, and it was rejected by a vote of 12 to 17 when H.R. 975 was marked up in the committee. This issue was not brought up during the conference committee on H.R. 333 in the previous Congress. And to my knowledge, there was no motion to instruct on this issue that was ever made by anyone.  Let me say I am as sensitive to conflicts of interest as anybody else. But if you have this absolute bar, an investment banker that knows something about the business would be disqualified and then the business if it was trying to reorganize under chapter 11 would have to hire a new investment banker, and the new investment banker would end up having to be paid for all the time to get himself or that institution's self up to speed on the issues of the business.  So section 414 was designed to provide the professional advice that investment bankers give in a way that would be able to reduce the cost to the estate of the bankrupt business. And that is why I think that at least section 414 should not be stricken in its entirety and would urge a ``no'' vote on the motion to instruct.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Weiner).
