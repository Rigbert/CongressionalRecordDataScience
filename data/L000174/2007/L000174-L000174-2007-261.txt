President, I would yield back time on this. Again, I will always protect any Senator to have the right to vote for whatever reason they want to hold up the Senate at this time of the night, but this one is something everybody is going to vote for, and it could have easily been a voice vote. But if we want to waste time at this time of the night and have a rollcall vote, of course that is a Senator's absolute right, to waste as much time as they may want.
