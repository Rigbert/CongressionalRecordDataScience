Very frankly, I tell my friend from Wisconsin the premise on your side, in my view, has been consistently for the 30 years that I have been here, if you simply reduce revenues somehow magically the economy will recover.  When we adopted the Clinton program in 1993, not a single Republican voted for it, unanimous in your conviction that it would have an adverse effect because we raised revenues, as you will recall, on the upper 1 percent. In fact, of course, what happened is exactly the opposite of what you argued in 1993.  So in that context, as we have this budget debate, I hope the American public understands that if you repeat the same mistakes of the past you will be condemned to live in the same problems that were created then by those mistakes.  I urge my colleagues to listen to this debate very carefully. Listen to the debate of the consequences of the actions that are proposed on both sides of the aisle, and remember what happened when that rhetoric was carried to fruition.
