President, we ``new'' Members don't think to look up at the lights. I apologize, but I appreciate being recognized.                      Senate's Blue-Slip Tradition  Let me be serious for a moment. I am the longest serving Member of the Senate, I am a former chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and I feel obligated to speak up about the erosion of the norms and traditions that protect the Senate's unique constitutional role.  There are only 100 Senators. We should be the conscience of the Nation. We have a unique role, but, this week, we are witnessing a further degradation of the once-respected role of the blue slip in the judicial confirmation process.  Now, partisans who value only political expediency have argued that blue slips are mere slips of paper, but, instead, they represent and help preserve something far more meaningful.  For much of this body's history, blue slips have given meaning to the constitutional requirement of advice andconsent. They have protected the prerogatives of home State Senators. They are the ones who have to vouch for somebody from their State, and they are the ones who have the most at stake.  I remember when a dear friend of mine, then-the Senator from Arizona, Barry Goldwater, called and asked if he could drop by and see me. He had recommended a person to President Reagan for the U.S. Supreme Court. It was Sandra O'Connor. He explained how they had looked at a number of people, and she was the best. With respect for Senator Goldwater, I agreed, and I supported her.  They have also ensured fairness and comity in the Senate. In many ways, traditions like the blue slip have been central to what makes the Senate the Senate. All of us, whether we are a Democrat or Republican, should care about good-faith consultation when it comes to nominees from our own States. The reasons are both principled but pragmatic. We know our States better than anybody else. We know who is qualified to fill a lifetime appointment to the bench, and, critically, we know the one constant in life is impermanence. That is precisely why traditions matter.  When I became chairman of the Judiciary Committee at the start of the Obama administration, every single Senate Republican signed a letter making the case for the importance of this tradition, and requesting that it be respected during the new administration. Republicans said: We are unified. We must follow the blue-slip tradition.  I didn't need that reminder. Under my chairmanship, during both the Bush and the Obama administrations, I respected the blue-slip tradition without exception, even when it was not politically expedient, even when I was attacked for protecting a Republican Senator's prerogative. I faced pressure from my own party's leadership to hold hearings for President Obama's nominees who had not received blue slips from Republican Senators. I was criticized by advocacy groups and even the editorial page of the New York Times.  I resisted such pressure. I did so because I believed then, and I still believe now, that certain principles matter more than party. It was certainly what every single Republican said they agreed with when President Obama was President. Not all Judiciary chairmen followed the same blue-slip policy as I did, but Chairman Grassley did follow the same policy, at least when there was a Democrat in the White House. Last Congress, no judicial nominee received a hearing without both home State Senators returning positive blue slips. This Congress, coinciding with a change in the White House, there has been a change in the blue-slip policy. What was sacred to Republicans for the Democrats is not sacred to the Republicans for Republicans.  Tomorrow, the Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing for a nominee in the Ninth Circuit, Ryan Bounds. He is opposed by not just one but both of his home State Senators. If Mr. Bounds is ultimately confirmed, it will mark the first time in the history of the U.S. Senate that a judicial nominee is confirmed with opposition from both home State Senators. It is nothing we ever thought possible with Republican or Democratic Presidents because it would have been too partisan. It would have destroyed what is best for the Senate, would destroy the comity of the Senate, would destroy the ability for Senators to represent their home State.  Also, this week, the full Senate will consider the nomination of Michael Brennan to the Seventh Circuit, over the objection of home State Senator Tammy Baldwin. Mr. Brennan's nomination was not even supported by the bipartisan Wisconsin Federal Nominating Commission. This is a nominating commission made up of Republicans and Democrats. They did not support this nomination. For years, this has been a longstanding requirement for potential nominees of the Federal bench in Wisconsin, and because the bipartisan commission couldn't support him, it is no wonder Senator Baldwin cannot, in good conscience, return her blue slip.  Many of us have established processes. I have. I have a bipartisan process in my State. Many have established these processes to vet and recommend nominees in our home State. Yet somehow Mr. Brennan was nominated, and he may be confirmed this week, even though it ignores a bipartisan commission.  Make no mistake, this kind of a confirmation would do lasting damage to the Senate's traditions, would do lasting damage to the Senate I love, would do lasting damage to a Senate, which I served for almost 44 years.  My concern is not about a mere piece of paper. My concern is, we are failing to protect the fundamental rights of home State Senators--Republicans and Democrats alike--and we are failing in our constitutional duty to provide our advice and consent. This is a unique requirement the U.S. Senators have--advice and consent. There are 100 of us. Four hundred and thirty-five House Members don't have this; we do.  Mr. Brennan's nomination makes a mockery of the blue-slip process. It makes a mockery of the time-tested process that home State Senators have abided by in Wisconsin for decades--under both Republican and Democratic administrations, and that should concern all of us.  I understand the pressure on my Republican colleagues to help a President from their own party to fill judicial vacancies; even a President who attacks the very legitimacy of our judiciary, who tweeted attacks against members of the Federal judiciary. The dilemma is that yielding to such pressure--undermining a Senate tradition simply due to a change in the White House--will do lasting damage to the integrity of this body. The Senate should never function as a mere rubberstamp for nominees seeking lifetime appointments to our Federal judiciary.  Some may dismiss these warnings. I served in the Senate long enough to know that partisan winds tend to change direction. Inevitably, the majority becomes the minority. It has happened several times since I have been here. The White House changes hands. That has happened several times since I have been here. Then, the shoe is on the other foot, which is precisely why maintaining a single, consistent policy is so critical.  I urge my fellow Senators of both parties to consider the damage we are doing to this body by abandoning one of the few remaining sources of bipartisan good will in our judicial confirmation process. A vote for Mr. Brennan is a vote to abandon our ability to serve as a check on not just this President but any future President of either party. Chasing expediency provides fleeting advantage. It inflicts lasting harm on this body, and it is within our power to put a stop to it.  I urge all my Senate colleagues to ensure that home State Senators are provided the same courtesies during the Trump administration the home State Senators--both Republicans and Democrats--were provided during the Obama administration. For that reason, I ask my fellow Senators to oppose Mr. Brennan's nomination unless he has bipartisan support from his home State.  I yield the floor.
