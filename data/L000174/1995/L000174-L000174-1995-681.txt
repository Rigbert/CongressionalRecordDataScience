President, let me explain why I have done this. I remember when I first came to the Senate, I think within the first year or so I was here, I introduced legislation saying that I wished all laws would be applied to Members of Congress that apply to everybody else. The Senator from Ohio [Mr. Glenn] has been doing the same for years, and Senator Grassley from Iowa has been doing the same for years. I think we have joined as cosponsors of each other's legislation. But I remember giving an eloquent speech--as I thought anyway--as a young Member of the Senate, on a Friday as I recall, about why we should apply all the same laws to Members of Congress. As I was leaving, one of the older Members of the Senate, a very senior Member of the Senate, said, ``Where are you going?'' I said I was heading to the airport to catch a plane back to Vermont. His response was, ``Good. Stay there.'' The legislation was not greeted with enormous enthusiasm. I know the Senator from Ohio and the Senator from Iowa have experienced similar things--we have commiserated with each other about it--the latest being even on Sunday when the Senator from Ohio and I had a chance to join each other for lunch. But what I want to do is give employees of the Congress the same protections available to other workers in the Federal Government and private sector.  As we changed from the majority to the minority, the new majority came in and, as is perfectly appropriate, they did a great deal of new hiring. I have no problem with that. I have been here in the majority and then the minority, and I have gone back and forth four times. I know a lot of staff changes with that. But I was surprised by news reports that the Republican Study Committee required prospective congressional employees to take an ideological litmus test, not so they could be hired but they had to take it before they could even be listed with a placement service.  Mr. President, I think Senators know me well enough to know this is not partisan. I would object to this whether Republicans or Democrats did it. I do not know whether these questionnaires are legal under Federal laws or the rules of the Senate, but they smack of McCarthyism while I was a teenager during the fifties. I know enough about McCarthyism to know how destructive to human beings and the sense of the public comity loyalty oaths can be.  I have a copy of the questionnaire, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record at this point.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:            Republican Study Committee--Issues Questionnaire       The following questions are designed to assist us in      placing you with an office in which you are most compatible.      If you tend to agree with the statements put a ``Y'' in the      blank. If you tend to disagree with the statement, put a      ``N'' in the blank.                         Defense/International       __ The United States devotes too great a portion of its      budget to defense spending in the post Cold-War era.       __ The U.S. should not move to deploy current SDI      technologies.

From: Grace L. Crews, Job Bank Coordinator.       This is just a brief note to explain the RSC Job Bank to      you. The RSC is a Republican research organization which      exists solely for the aid of its members.       The RSC provides numerous services for its members      including the Job Bank. When a member calls with a job      vacancy, he/she gives us the description which includes      title, duties, salary, contact, etc. We then refer resumes of      qualified applicants to them for their consideration. If they      are interested, they will contact you. You will not receive a      call from us. Because most of our members prefer it, we never      disclose the location of a vacancy.       Rest assured that the RSC wants you to find a job. We will      do everything possible to aid you in your search. However, we      cannot guarantee you a job, and we do not know of all the      jobs on the Hill. Therefore, we ask that you do everything      you can to aid in your search.       Because we receive so many resumes, it is impossible for us      to keep in contact with you. Therefore, we ask that you keep      in contact with us by letting us know when you have found a      job or if you are still looking. If we do not hear from you      within three (3) months, we will discard your resume. If you      are still looking after that, you will have to give us a new      one.       And now, for some important advice. Be flexible. We would      all like to start at the top--very few of us get the chance.      Be willing to do whatever it takes to get that Hill      experience, even if you have to open mail for someone for a      while. Don't price yourself out of the market. Be willing to      negotiate salary. If you turn down a job because you think      you are worth more than the Congressman is willing to pay,      you may find yourself looking longer than you anticipated.       The RSC wishes you the best in your search for employment      on the Hill.                                  ____                       Job Placement Information       Date: ______       Name: ______       Street: ______       City: ______       State: ______       Zip: ______       Home Phone: ______       Work Phone: ______       Home State: ______       Position(s) Desired: (You may circle more than one.)
