 President, this resolution concerns testimony by a former Senate employee in an ongoing civil action pending in New Jersey Federal district court. The case arises out of a labor dispute between a company that owns and manages five assisted-living facilities and the union that represents the employees at those facilities.  Previously, Senator Blumenthal's office has provided information in this matter, with Senate authorization. In response to a further request from Plaintiffs, Senator Blumenthal is making available a former employee for a limited, additional deposition.  This resolution authorizes that former employee to testify in a deposition, and also authorizes the Senate Legal Counsel to represent the former employee in this matter.
