Last, I will ask the Senator from Pennsylvania, if this requires a joint resolution, under the rules of the Senate,Members in a filibuster, a minority, say, 41 Senators, could stop us from ever taking action on this measure. How would the Senator from Pennsylvania respond to that? Does that, in effect, give to a minority the authority to stop the debate and a vote by the Senate and thereby tie the President's hands when it comes to committing ground troops, should we ever reach the point where that is necessary?
