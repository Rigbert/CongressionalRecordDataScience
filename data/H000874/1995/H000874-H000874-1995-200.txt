Speaker, I say in all due respect to my friend, the majority leader, this is a bill that I understand exceeds 450 pages. The bill has not received any days of hearings because it was not drafted. But there were no hearings in the Committee on Commerce.  I say with all due respect to my friend, the majority leader, does the majority leader believe that 2 hours or so of debate on a bill of this magnitude is sufficient to fully inform the Members on all the issues that will be incorporated in the bill?
