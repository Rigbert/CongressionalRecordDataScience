 President, later today we will welcome the Prime Minister of India as he visits the Capitol. Although this is Narendra Modi's fourth trip to the United States as Prime Minister, it marks the first time he will address a joint meeting of Congress. It also marks the fifth time an Indian Prime Minister has done sosince the 1980s. It shows how far our relationship has come in recent decades. Mutual misgivings have given way to mutual benefits in both the economic and security spheres. We are now key trading partners. We are the two largest democracies in the world. Our relationship is an important one, and there are more benefits that can be shared from future cooperation.  Today's address by Prime Minister Modi provides an important opportunity for all involved--an opportunity to hear his perspective on India's economic growth and how he feels we can strengthen the strategic partnership between our countries, an opportunity to learn more about his ideas for pursuing areas of common ground and advancing shared interests, and an opportunity to better understand his view of the challenges currently facing India and his outlook for overcoming them.  We welcome Prime Minister Modi. We are interested in learning more about his vision, both for India and for the country's continued partnership with the United States in the years ahead.                          ____________________
