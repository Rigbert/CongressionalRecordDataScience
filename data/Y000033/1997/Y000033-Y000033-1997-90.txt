Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise.  The motion was agreed to.  Accordingly the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Solomon) having assumed the chair, Mr. Sununu, Chairman of the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union, reported that the Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 901), to preserve the sovereignty of the United States over public lands and acquired lands owned by the United States, and to preserve State sovereignty and private property rights in non-Federal lands surrounding those public lands and acquired lands, had come to no resolution thereon.                          ____________________
