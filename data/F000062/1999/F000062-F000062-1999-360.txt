 President, today, I am introducing the Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1999 with Senator Olympia Snowe.  This bill has four provisions:  For breast cancer--  1. It requires insurance plans to cover hospital stays as determined by the attending physician, in consultation with the patient, to be medically appropriate. Our bill does not prescribe a fixed number of days or set a minimum. It leaves the length of hospital stay up to the treating physician.  2. It requires insurance plans to provide notice to plan subscribers of these requirements.  For all cancers--  3. It prohibits insurance plans from linking financial or other incentives to a physician's provisions of care.  4. It requires plans to cover second opinions by specialists to confirm or refute a diagnosis. If the attending physician certifies that there is no appropriate specialist practicing under the insurance plan, the plan must ensure that coverage is provided outside the plan for a second opinion by a qualified specialist selected by the attending physician at no additional cost to the patient beyond that which the patient would have paid if the specialist were participating in the plan.                          Need for Legislation  The movement from inpatient to outpatient mastectomies and reduced hospital stays for mastectomies in recent years has been documented. A June 3, 1998 study in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute found that from 1986 to 1995 ``the proportion of mastectomies performed on an outpatient basis increased from virtually 0% to 10.8%,'' said these researchers. This report also says that the data ``clearly suggested a shorter average length of stay and a higher likelihood of a short stay for women covered by HMOs'' and that ``while short stays appear to be more prevalent among HMO enrollees, they are not limited exclusively to women with HMO coverage.''  Another study, by the medical research firm HCIA of Baltimore, Maryland, found that in 1995, 7.6 percent of the 110,000 breast removals in the country were done on an outpatient basis, up from 1.6 percent in 1991.  Another study found that the average length of stay for women who have had a mastectomy is 4.34 days nationally,but in California, it is 2.98 days, the shortest in the country. (New York has the longest mastectomy length of stay at 5.78 days.) This study, published in the winter 1997-1998 issue of Inquiry, says:       California had the highest proportion of mastectomy      patients discharged after only one day or within two days . .      . Nearly 12% of mastectomy patients in California were      discharged with a length of stay equal to one day; the next      highest proportion was 4.8% in Massachusetts; the percentages      in the other three states ranged from 1.1% to 2.2%.  A July 7, 1997 study by the Connecticut Office of Health Care Access found the average hospital length of stay for breast cancer patients undergoing mastectomies decreased from three days in 1991 and 1993 to two days in 1994 and 1995. This study said, ``The percentage of mastectomy patients discharged after one-day stays grew about 700 percent from 1991 to 1996.''  The Wall Street Journal on November 6, 1996, reported that ``some health maintenance organizations are creating an uproar by ordering that mastectomies be performed on an outpatient basis. At a growing number of HMOs, surgeons must document `medical necessity' to justify even a one-night hospital admission.''  And so the studies confirm that (1) hospital lengths of stay for mastectomies are decreasing and (2) more mastectomies are being done on an outpatient basis.                       Incidence of Breast Cancer  In 1998, over 180,000 people (one in every 8 American women) were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer and 44,000 women died from breast cancer. Only lung cancer causes more cancer deaths in American women. There are 2.6 million American women living with breast cancer today.  In my state, in 1998, approximately 17,600 women were diagnosed with breast cancer and 4,300 died, according to the American Cancer Society. Officials at the Northern California Cancer Center say that breast cancer incidence rates in Los Angeles and San Francisco are significantly higher than national rates.              the stress of mastectomy; the need for care  After a mastectomy, patients must cope with pain from the surgery, with drainage tubes and with psychological loss--the trauma of an amputation. These patients need medical care from trained professionals, medical care that they cannot provide themselves at home. A woman fighting for her life and her dignity should not also be saddled with a battle with her health insurance plan.  Dr. Christine Miaskowski at the University of California, San Francisco, estimates that about 20 percent of women who have breast cancer surgery have chronic pain of long duration. A University of California, San Diego, study suggests that the rate may be double that, reports the May 20, 1998 Journal of the National Cancer Institute.  Patients who have mastectomies in outpatient settings have higher rates of rehospitalization than women with a one-day hospital stay, according to the study reported in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.  As the National Breast Cancer Coalition wrote me on March 12, 1998: ``The NBCC applauds this effort and believes this compromise will put an end to the dangerous health insurance practices that allow cost and not medical evidence to determine when a woman leaves a hospital after cancer surgery.''                     some accomplishments last year  In the last Congress, Senators D'Amato, Snowe and I introduced a similar bill, S. 249, which also included a requirement that plans cover breast reconstruction following a mastectomy. Fortunately, Congress passed and the President signed that part of our bill, into law, the omnibus appropriations bill for FY 1999, now P.L. 105-277.  The mastectomy hospital length-of-stay and the other provisions did not become law, despite many efforts:  At our request, the Senate Finance Committee held a hearing on S. 249 on November 5, 1997.  We attempted to get this considered by the Senate, three times in 1998:  On March 16, we filed it as an amendment to H.R. 2646, the Parent and Student Savings Account PLUS Act.  On May 6, we filed it as an amendment to H.R. 2676, the IRS restructuring bill.  On May 12, we tried to bring the bill to a vote in the Senate, but were blocked.  In addition, Senator D'Amato offered it as an amendment in the Finance Committee twice.                          two california cases  Two California women have shared their real-life experiences with me:  Nancy Couchot, age 60, of Newark, California, wrote me that she had a modified radical mastectomy on November 4, 1996, at 11:30 a.m. and was released by 4:30 p.m. She could not walk and the hospital staff did not help her ``even walk to the bathroom.'' She says, ``Any woman, under these circumstances, should be able to opt for an overnight stay to receive professional help and strong pain relief.''  Victoria Berck, of Los Angeles, wrote that she had a mastectomy and lymph node removal at 7:30 a.m. on November 13, 1996, and was released from the hospital 7 hours later, at 2:30 p.m. Ms. Berck was given instructions on how to empty two drains attached to her body and sent home. She concludes, ``No civilized country in the world has mastectomy as an outpatient procedure.''  These are but two examples of what I believe is happening around the county--insurance plans interfering with professional medical judgment and arbitrarily reducing care without a medical basis.  Premature discharges for mastectomy, with insurance plans strong-arming physicians to send women home, are one glaring example of the rising tide abuses faced by patients and physicians who have to ``battle'' with their HMOs to get coverage of the care that physicians believe is medically necessary.                        No Financial Incentives  For all cancers, our bill also prohibits insurance plans from including financial or other incentives to influence the care a doctor's provides, similar to a law passed by the California legislature last year. Many physicians have complained that insurance plans include financial bonuses or other incentives for cutting patient visits or for not referring patients to specialists. Our bill bans financial incentives linked to how a doctor provides care. Our intent is to restore medical decision-making to health care.  For example, a California physician wrote me, ``Financial incentives under managed care plans often remove access to pediatric specialty care.'' A June 1995 report in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute cited the suit filed by the husband of a 34-year old California woman who died from colon cancer, claiming that HMO incentives encouraged her physicians not to order additional tests that could have saved her life.                            Second Opinions  Finally, our bill requires plans to cover second opinions by specialists for all cancers when a patient requests them. And if the attending physician certifies that there is no appropriate specialist practicing under the plan, the plan must cover a second opinion outside the plan by a qualified specialist selected by the attending physician, at no additional cost to the patient beyond that which the patient would have paid if the specialists were participating in the plan.  The alarm of learning one has cancer is profound. It affects the individual and the whole family deeply. People need the best medical judgment they can get, to make some of the most important decisions of their lives. I believe plans should cover a second opinion, so that patients can get the best care possible and can try to find some peace of mind that they are getting competent, complete medical advice.                               Conclusion  This bill would restore professional medical decision making to medical doctors, those whom we trust to take care of us. It should not take an act of Congress to guarantee good health care, but unfortunately that is where we are today. As the National Breast Cancer Coalition wrote, ``. . . until guaranteed access to quality health care coverage and service is available for all women and their families, there are some very serious patient concerns that must be met. Without meaningful health care reform, market forces propel the changes in the health care system and women are at risk of being forced to pay the price by having inappropriate limits placed on their access to quality health care.''  This is an important protection for millions of Americans who face the fear, the reality and the costs of cancer every day. Seven states have a law allowing a physician to determine the length of stay following a mastectomy. Seven states have a required 48-hour minimum stay requirement.  It is long past time for this Congress to send a strong message to insurance companies. Medical decisions must be made by medical professionals, not anonymous insurance clerks.                                 ______                                       By
