''  I ask unanimous consent that be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                      National Health Council,                                 Washington, DC, February 9, 1998.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: Early this week the Senate will      decide whether to begin debate on legislation to ban the      cloning of a human being. The National Health Council, which      represents the Nation's leading patient organizations, agrees      with the American public that the cloning of a human being      should be prohibited. However, we urge careful consideration      of the issue and a vote against cloture, so a more thorough      debate can occur within the committees of jurisdiction before      consideration by the full Senate.       Current advances in medical research are, for the first      time, holding true promise of curing some of the most well-     known diseases: cancer, diabetes, and paralysis. In the past,      scientific gains have provided patients with novel      treatments, allowing us to manage disease more effectively.      But cures have eluded us.       Cloning, the duplication of scientific material, such as      cells or genes, has allowed scientists to more efficiently      study biological processes, and has led to many recent      medical advances. The technique which created the sheep Dolly      was a new approach to producing duplicate material. This      novel process, called somatic cell nuclear transfer, may hold      the key not only to understanding the function of all human      cells but also to identifying new avenues to repair damaged      cells.       By gaining a greater understanding of how cells develop and      differentiate we may be able to replace damaged pancreatic      cells with healthy cells, therefore curing diabetes. Combined      with gene therapy, cloning may also make it possible to      eliminate the transmission of such inherited diseases as      Huntington's Disease.       We appreciate your concerns regarding the issues relating      to cloning, but it is critical     that we have a better understanding of all the implications      of the various approaches aimed at banning the cloning of      human beings. I am certain that you share our interest that      important medical research is protected. In order to ensure      medical progress and the attainment of future opportunities,      we urge you to proceed cautiously.       Thank you for your consideration of this important issue.           Sincerely,                                               Myrl Weinberg, CAE,                                                        President.
