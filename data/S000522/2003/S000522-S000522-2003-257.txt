Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished chairman for yielding me this time and for his great work on behalf of this legislation, and to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Houghton) for his superb leadership in crafting this bill.  I rise in strong support, Mr. Speaker, of the Clean Diamond Trade Act, a long overdue measure that will restore the U.S. in a leadership position in the fight against the trade in conflict diamonds. For too long, the international community has looked the other way as rebel groups have trafficked in the sale of lethal military weapons using the profits from the sale of these diamonds to finance efforts to overthrow legitimate governments.  This bill will put in place the required laws and regulations designed to monitor and control the import and export of the trade in conflict diamonds so they can no longer be used to support instability and armed conflict throughout much of Africa and other parts of the world.  By all accounts, they are aptly named conflict diamonds. During the past decade, more than 6 million people from Sierra Leone, Angola, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo have been driven from their homes by wars waged in large part for control for diamond mining areas.  I have met on several occasions, Mr. Speaker, with David Crane, the Sierra Leone Special War Crimes Prosecutor, who told me about ghastly war crimes committed in the name of diamond profits. Not only has the illegitimate trade of diamonds led to systematic and gross human rights violations and civil unrest, so too it has hurt the trade in legitimate diamonds, which makes a critical contribution to the economies of many developing countries.  Numerous resolutions, Mr. Speaker, of the United Nations Security Council under Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter, including resolutions 1173, 1295, 1306, and 1343, as well as a United Nations General Assembly resolution in 2000 have laid the groundwork for devising an international regime to stop the flow of these conflict diamonds.  The first meeting, as I think Members know, to discuss this took place in Kimberly, South Africa, in May of 2000 at the initiative of the African producing countries. Many technical and working group meetings took place subsequent to that throughout Africa and Europe, culminating in the November 2002 meeting in Interlaken, Switzerland, finalizing the so-called Kimberly Process.  This historic meeting committed all 48 participants, including the United States, to the rapid implementation of its diamond certification scheme for rough diamonds consistent with international trade rules. Fully consistent with the work of the diamond industry, including the World Diamond Council, numerous civil society representatives and key NGOs, the voluntary self-regulating initiatives from many producing importing countries have now been melded through the Kimberly Process into a global system of mutually recognized certificates for legitimate diamonds.  Our own Nation's extensive participation in this effort, under the auspices of the State Department's special negotiator for conflict diamonds, is reflected in the measure before us today. The bill implements our obligations to prohibit the import or export of rough diamonds not controlled by the Kimberly Process.  The bill specifies that the exporting authority under the bill will be the Bureau of the Census, and their role will be to issue the required regulations and guidelines to ensure that any proposed exports of rough diamonds be made through the automated export system. Any efforts to fully evaluate and enforce this system validating Kimberly Process Certificates would be undertaken by the United States Bureau of Customs and Border Protection and the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement.  I would also point out to my colleagues that the legislation gives the State Department a lead role, together with the Treasury, in implementing the legislation. In this regard, the existing special negotiator for conflict diamonds in the Bureau for Economic and Business Affairs should continue to play a key role in this effort.                              {time}  1600  Mr. Speaker, it is the expectation of the Committee on International Relations that it will be fully consulted by the Department to the extent it decides to take any action to modify this position in any way. It has been brought to my attention that a number of nongovernmental organizations who are taking an active role in monitoring the implementation of the Kimberly Process have expressed concerns that several countries, including the Republic of the Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Zimbabwe and theCentral African Republic, have been admitted as participants in the certification scheme despite evidence of continued illegal trade in rough diamonds.  I would ask the Department to examine this evidence and take any and all appropriate actions necessary to mitigate and stop this illegal activity. I urge support for the bill.
