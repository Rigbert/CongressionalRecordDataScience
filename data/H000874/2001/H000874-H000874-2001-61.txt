Speaker, the unspeakable barbarism perpetrated on American soil yesterday was directed at freedom-loving people on every continent on Earth. It will never be forgotten. Another day of infamy and perfidy is etched indelibly on the pages of the history of the world.  Our thoughts and our prayers go out to all those who perished or were injured by these mindless murderous acts; acts of war. Our hearts go out to their loved ones as well.  Our thoughts, our prayers, and our heartfelt thanks go out to all of those who put their own lives in harm's way to help others: the law enforcement officers, the military personnel, the firefighters and paramedics, the doctors and nurses, and the countless civilians who came to the aid of their fellow citizens. They are the true American heroes, and their selfless courage fortifies this Nation. Yesterday, today, and tomorrow we fear that many of these brave souls too have become victims of this contemptible criminal conspiracy.  Today, every American, every civilized human speaks with one voice in saying to those who planned, participated, aided and abetted, or gave sanctuary to the perpetrators of this unmitigated evil, we will not rest until you are rooted out, rooted out like a cancer, and destroyed.  As President Franklin Delano Roosevelt said in his address to Congress the day following the attack on Pearl Harbor, and I quote, ``Always we will remember the character of the onslaught against us.'' And in remembering, it will fashion our response.  The United States of America will never, never, never rest until you and all of those who provide you with shelter and safe harbor are held accountable for this horrific and heinous crime.                              {time}  1600  Know, too, that no amount of fury, no amount of anger, no amount of revulsion at such senseless and cowardly acts on innocent men, women, children in the street, none of that will drive us to embrace your twisted law of the jungle. But we will see justice done.  Our national character charged by the bravery and determination of generations who preceded us demands more. Our resolute commitment to democratic values and the rule of law and reason demands more.  The depraved brutality of September 11, 2001, much like that of December 7, 1941, has left each of us shaken and sorrowful. But now, as then, the American will and the American resolve are unshaken and undeterred.  Freedom, all of us know, has never meant freedom from risk, nor will it ever be. In fact, such risk is a component of that very freedom we cherish. But we must and we will confront those who criminally and viciously put freedom itself at risk.  Mr. Speaker, the memory of all of those whose lives were lost, who were surely on the front lines of freedom, must lead us to renew our pledge of allegiance to our one Nation, under God, indivisible, and with liberty and justice for all.
