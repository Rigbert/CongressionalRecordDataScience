Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend for yielding me this time.  Mr. Speaker, I just want to say very briefly in response to my good friend, the gentleman from California [Mr. Berman], we were engaged in a very difficult negotiation with the White House over the last several days, and in the end we gave half a loaf on the Mexico City policy which separates abortion from family planning. We said that foreign nongovernmental organizations would be precluded, those that are subsidized by the U.S. Government, would no longer be able to lobby in foreign capitals to topple their pro-life laws. It seems to me this was a very modest proposal. This was rejected.  The good news for the pro-life said that the Speaker of the House and the majority leader have given their solemn word that the IMF issue and arrearages payments, and those arrearages payments are in dispute, there are all different, conflicting numbers as to what they should be, that those three issues are intertwined and they will move forward together or they will not move forward at all.  We have offered the White House a true compromise; they have rejected it at this point. My hope is that in the spirit of comity, I would hope that we could move to a real compromise on this, and then we could work in partnership on all three of these issues.
