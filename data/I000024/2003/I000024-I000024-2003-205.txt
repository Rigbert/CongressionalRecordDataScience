President, our brownfield legislation was very successful. Nothing is adequately funded, but this comes very close to being adequately funded. We put out an amendment to include the petroleum sites which doubles the scope of the brownfields program.  As chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I do not believe it is necessary to have this additional amount of money. I ask you to defeat the amendment.
