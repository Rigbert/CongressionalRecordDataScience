 President, I ask unanimous consent that the votes occur in relation to the pending Dodd amendment and the Gorton amendment beginning at 6:10 p.m., with the first vote in relation to the Gorton amendment, to be followed by a vote in relation to the Dodd amendment, with the time between now and 6:10 p.m. to be equally divided for debate on both amendments, and no second-degree amendments be in order prior to the votes just described, with 2 minutes between the two votes for explanation.
