President, before she leaves the floor, I want to thank my seatmate on the Finance Committee--a strong advocate for the concept that Medicare and Medicaid are guarantees. They are lifelines for working families.  It is a pleasure to have you here on this special occasion, and I look forward to many more partnerships as we start thinking down the road, as Senator Cardin said, about how we are going to strengthen these programs, not just play defense against Congress.  I thank you.
