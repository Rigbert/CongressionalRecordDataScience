Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 507 directs the Secretary of the Interior to take two 10-acre parcels into trust for a tribe in Arizona. These two parcels are both completely surrounded by either the tribe's reservation or by fee lands owned by the tribe. Before the parcels can be taken into trust, however, the Tucson Unified School District will first need to relinquish its possessory interest in one parcel. The school district no longer needs the land, which it had previously received under the Recreation and Public Purposes Act.  The Secretary of the Interior will also need to approve a lease agreement between the tribe and the school district for the construction and operation of a regional transportation facility on the tribe's land.  Both parcels would be utilized as part of a golf course that is currently under construction. Neither parcel is necessary for the construction of the golf course, but if the tribe does not acquire and use these parcels, they will be orphaned and of relatively no use to either the tribe or to the United States.  As has become customary when taking land into trust, the bill includes language that prohibits any gaming on the two parcels to be taken into trust.  Finally, I would like to commend the gentleman from Arizona for his bill, and I urge its adoption.  I reserve the balance of my time.                              {time}  1720
