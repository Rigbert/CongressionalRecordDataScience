The Riverside educational community has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent for the betterment of our children. Maxine Frost is one of these individuals. On December 8, 2007, Maxine will be honored at a retirement dinner after serving 40 years as a member of the Riverside Unified School District Board of Education.  Mrs. Maxine Frost graduated from Stanford University with a bachelor's degree in history and has been a resident and active member of the Riverside community since 1958. Mrs. Frost's interest in education began with her involvement in the education of her children. She was an active mother who served on various school committees. In 1967, the President of the Riverside Unified School District Board of Education selected Maxine to fill a vacancy on the Board of Education. During her tenure, Mrs. Frost witnessed history including the desegregation of the Riverside school district. Maxine went on to serve on the California School Boards Association and in 1981 she was elected President of the organization.  During her tenure on the Board, Maxine has been elected by her fellow board members to serve as board president, vice-president and clerk. One of Maxine's many success stories is the creation and development of the AVID program: Achievement Via Individual Determination. AVID offers average students the opportunity to take college prep classes while teaching them study techniques and teamwork.  Mrs. Frost's involvement in the community is not limited to education; she has also dedicated her time to many other organizations that improve our quality of life including the Riverside Art Alliance, Junior League of Riverside, League of Women Voters and the National Charity League. One reflection of Maxine's many contributions to the community are the countless awards and honors she has received over the years. Recently the Riverside Unified School District Board of Education voted to name a school after Maxine, a vote which required the Board to make an exception to its policy which requires that a person be deceased for two years before a facility can be designated.  Mrs. Maxine Frost's tireless passion for community service has contributed immensely to the betterment of the community of Riverside, California. She has been the heart and soul of the Riverside Unified School District Board of Education and many other community organizations. I am proud to call Maxine a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for her service and salute her as she retires.                          ____________________
