 President, I wish to pay tribute to John Kazlauskas, who after 41 years of dedicated service, will be retiring as the Owensboro, KY, chief of police this November.  Ever since his start at the Owensboro Police Department in 1966, Chief Kazlauskas has been committed to the progress of the department and to the safety of his community. His dedication and hard work allowed him to quickly progress from a patrol officer to captain, and ultimately to the highest rank within the department, chief of police, in 2002.  Throughout his tenure, Chief Kazlauskas has played a vital role in developing several innovative internal programs that have modernized the department. Chief Kazlauskas helped to create the evidence collection unit and the polygraph unit. Chief Kazlauskas also assisted the department with its accreditation process, which involved implementing 120 standards required by the Kentucky Association of Chiefs of Police.  As chief, Mr. Kazlauskas helped improve the services offered by the local police department by further expanding the bomb squad and emergency teams, ensuring police cruisers had modern mobile data terminals, and overseeing the implementation of an electronic management system, providing a major overhaul to the records department.  Chief Kazlauskas also made a significant impact throughout Owensboro, increasing the community involvement with the department by putting into place the Citizens Advisory Panel, Crime Stoppers, and creating a public information officer position within the department. These steps have built a trusting relationship between the citizens of Owensboro and local law enforcement, making them partners in keeping their neighborhoods safe.  Chief Kazlauskas not only spent his career ensuring the safety of his community, but also contributing to the safety of this Nation. Drafted into the armed services in 1968, Chief Kazlauskas served as an Army helicopter pilot, chief warrant officer. After a tour of duty in the Republic of South Vietnam, Chief Kazlauskas received a Bronze Star with 23 Air Medal Oak Leaf Clusters for flying over 800 hours of combat time.  Chief Kazlauskas has provided constant support, always placing the well-being of his community above his own. The Commonwealth, as well as the city of Owensboro, has benefited greatly from his outstanding leadership. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join with me in recognizing Police Chief John Kazlauskas's unwavering dedication to his fellow officers, his community, and Kentucky.                          ____________________
