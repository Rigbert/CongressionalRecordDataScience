Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the brave men and women of the 110th Fighter Wing of the Michigan Air National Guard as they returned this past Saturday from a successful completion of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Often overlooked, our National Guard personnel provide an invaluable service to our country and to our Armed Forces. The men and women of the 110th Fighter Wing have shown the utmost courage, traveling a world away to help remove a threat to civilization. These folks made a great sacrifice, departing from families, careers, and livelihoods to preserve our way of life. Because of their sacrifices, the Hussein regime is gone and our world is a more secure place. Freedom isn't free; it comes at a price--and individuals like these are the ones who bear the cost. I wish them well as they are reunited with their families and loved ones.                          ____________________
