Speaker, on February 28, 2002, the House Subcommittee on the Constitution held a legislative hearing on H.J. Res. 67, Representative Brian Baird's proposed constitutional amendment to allow lawmaking by an appointed House of Representatives following a terrorist attack.  During the 107th Congress, a bipartisan working group co-chaired by then-House Republican Policy Committee Chairman Christopher Cox and House Democratic Policy Chairman Martin Frost, met regularly to discuss the issues surrounding continuity in government, including constitutional amendments. As a result of those working group meetings, the House passed H. Res. 559 during the 107th Congress, expressing the sense of the House that each State should examine its existing procedures governing special elections so that, in the event of a catastrophe, vacancies in the House could be filled in a timely fashion. Unfortunately, only one state, California, responded to that request. Consequently, the House responded precisely as the Founders would have expected the House to respond, namely by acting pursuant to Congress's authority under the Constitution to ensure that the House is repopulated expeditiously through elections in extraordinary circumstances. To that end, H.R. 2844, the Continuity in Representation Act, was introduced in the 108th Congress. The bill received a hearing before the House Administration Committee on September 24, 2003, and it was marked up by both the House Administration (on November 19, 2003) and House Judiciary Committees (January 21, 2004). Amendments adopted on the House floor included one that would protect the rights of military and overseas voters to participate in the expedited elections, and a provision that provided explicitly that all federal laws governing the administration of federal elections would apply.  Because H.R. 2844 was a bipartisan bill that resonates best with America's democratic values, on April 22, 2004, it passed the House on an overwhelming bipartisan basis by a more than 3-to-1 margin, by a vote of 306-97.  As part of a bipartisan agreement, I agreed to a markup of Representative Baird's proposed constitutional amendment (H.J. Res. 83 in the 108th Congress) in the Judiciary Committee. That was done on May 5, 2004. Committee Members all had the opportunity to offer amendments to H.J. Res. 83 to either perfect its language or replace it entirely with the text of any other version of the amendment. During the markup, I asked if there were any Members who wanted to offer amendment more than half a dozen times. The Judiciary Committee adversely reported out H.J. Res. 83, so all Members could have an opportunity to vote on it on the House floor.  The constitutional amendment the House voted on was the approach supported by Representative Brian Baird, the Member who is widely regarded as the most outspoken House proponent of appointed Members. This proposal and a host of others have been extensively studied by scholars both inside and outside of Congress, including during the last Congress, and by previous Congresses, going back some 50 years. It remains a terrible idea because it would introduce into our Founding document, for the first time, the concept that laws can be written by an unelected aristocracy. That is a bad idea now, and it was a bad idea then, when the House of Representatives, controlled by both Democrats and Republicans, rejected all constitutional amendments authorizing appointed House Members sent to it by the Senate, even during the height of the Cold War.  The conclusion of the Continuity in Government Commission's (a privately-funded commission's) report recommending a constitutional amendment that would deny the right to self-government under laws enacted by elected representatives states that ``The exact details of a solution are less important than that the problem be addressed seriously and expeditiously.'' (This is from page 31 of the re-port, which can be found at http://www.continuityofgovernment.org/report/report.html.)  On June 2, 2004, the House voted on H.J. Res. 83 and generally on the question of whether Americans should be governed by laws passed by an unelected aristocracy. There are only two ways to go on the issue: either you support an appointed House--the ``details,'' by the Continuity in Government Commission's own admission, are relatively unimportant--or you support preserving lawmaking by an elected House. Representative Baird, the author of H.J. Res. 83, said of a constitutional amendment--quote--``The more urgent matter is to put that measure before the body.'' On June 2, 2004, that measure was put before the House, and the House overwhelmingly rejected it by a vote of 63-353, a margin of over 5-1. That margin of defeat of a constitutional amendment is historically large.  The right to self-government under laws passed by the People's chosen representatives has endured since America's birth, through two World Wars, a Civil War, a Cold War, and now a war against terrorism. The terrorists would like nothing more than to make us rewrite our Constitution to reflect their twisted vision of autocratic rule. The Continuity in Representation Act rejects that terrorist vision and would preserve the right to elected representation.                          ____________________
