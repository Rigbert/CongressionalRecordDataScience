 President, I congratulate Caitlin Snaring, a bright young woman from my home State of Washington. Today, she won the National Geographic Bee, a competition that starts with nearly 5 million students each year. Caitlin is from Redmond, WA, and this was her second time representing our State in the national competition held in Washington, DC.  On Monday, Caitlin and I sat near each other on the plane flight from Seattle to Washington, DC. While everyone else was reading magazines or watching a movie, Caitlin was studying her notebooks and preparing for the competition. I had a chance to talk with her, and I could see that she was really determined and focused. I remember thinking to myself, ``She's going places.''  After her victory today, I called her and said: ``Caitlin, I can tell that when you decide what you're going to be and what you want to do, you are going to achieve any dream you have.'' And I really believe that.  Caitlin won a $25,000 college scholarship. I understand that she is the second girl to win the geographic bee since the competition started in 1989 and the fifth winner from Washington State. In fact, Washington has produced more national winners than any other State.  I want to congratulate Caitlin, her family, and friends on this great achievement and on the wonderful example she has set for young people in Washington State and around the country.                          ____________________
