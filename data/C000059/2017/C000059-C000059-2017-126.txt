Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to residents of California's 42nd Congressional District who were tragically killed during the massacre at the Route 91 Harvest country music festival in Las Vegas, Nevada on Sunday, October 1, 2017.  Thomas Day, Jr. was born and raised in my hometown of Corona, California. After graduating from Corona High School, Tom attended Riverside Community College and later went to work for Portrait Construction, a home building company founded by his father, Tom Sr. Those who worked with Tom knew him as someone who was easy to talk to and get along with. The Day family has been active in our community for many years, making a number of important contributions to non-profit organizations. Attending concerts and music festivals with his children was a win-win for Tom because it allowed him to do two things he loved at one time--listen to music and spend time with his family. Tom was attending the Route 91 Harvest country music festival with his children when he was senselessly taken from us.  Rocio Guillen grew up in Anaheim, California and attended Katella High School, where she ran track and cross country. Most recently, she worked as an assistant manager at a California Pizza Kitchen. Rocio was a tireless worker both at her job and at home caring for her children. She was blessed with four children: 18-year-old Marcus, 13-year-old Christopher, 1-year-old Sofia and 1-month-old Austin. Marcus recently described Rocio as ``an amazing mother. She worked so many hours at work and would come back and take care of all of us.'' Rocio's fiance, Chris Jaksha, attended the Route 91 Harvest country music festival with her and comforted her in those terrifying final moments of her life.  Pati Mestas lived in Menifee, California and was a graduate of Garey High in Pomona. While she previously helped manage the deli at a Corona gas station, Pati recently stopped working to spend more time with her three children, eight grandchildren and one great-grandchild. Pati loved going to country music concerts and having a good time with her friends. Her son Brandon wrote, ``She left this world surrounded by friends, singing and dancing with thousands of people. If I had to write the script myself, I could not have done a better job.''  Christopher Roybal proudly served his country in the U.S. Navy as a dog handler, completing multiple tours in Afghanistan. After leaving the Navy, Chris returned home to Corona, California, and managed Crunch Fitness gyms. According to family and friends, Chris loved to sing and enjoyed all genres of music--they say he was a karaoke king. Chris is survived by his wife Dixie Roybal, his mother Debby Allen, father Samuel Roybal brothers Jacob, Jayson and Nicholas, and sisters Nina and Jillian. We are eternally grateful for Chris' service to our nation.  Our hearts ache for all of those whose lives were cut short and forever impacted by the evil acts of that evening. We pray that their loved ones, colleagues and friends find comfort in the memories shared with those we have lost. We also pray for the speedy recovery of all of the wounded. As a country we must stand together in the wake of this horrific event and demonstrate that the love, decency and compassion inside all of us is far stronger than any evil act.                          ____________________
