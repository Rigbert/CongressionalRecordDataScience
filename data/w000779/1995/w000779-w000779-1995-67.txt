Chairman, this amendment would encourage our States to utilize the Nation's grandparents, with their vast treasury of love and practical experience, to help our youngsters who might otherwise be abandoned or put in foster care facilities, or put up for adoption.  From across the country in recent months I have heard from grandparents who often are not informed at all by child protection agencies in their States when their grandchildren are moved to foster care facilities or put up for adoption.  We all know that when children are separated from their parents, it is usually a painful and traumatic experience. Living with grandparents they know and trust gives them a better opportunity in the world.  This amendment would strengthen the ability of families to rely on their own family members as resources, and would promote self-reliance within our families and within our communities.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to emphasize that this amendment is not prescriptive. It is a permissive one. It would simply offer to the States to use the Nation's grandparents when those grandparents meet child safety protection standards. This amendment is supported by the American Association of Retired Persons, the National Coalition of Grandparents, and grandparents organizations from across the country.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to say that the majority has been extremely helpful in the developing of this amendment, for which I appreciate their assistance.
