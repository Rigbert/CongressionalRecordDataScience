 President, I rise today in support of legislation to maketechnical corrections to the Bipartisan Social Security Reform bill my colleagues and I introduced last summer. The purpose of this legislation is simple: to conform our previous legislative language to changes that have been made in the Social Security program--such as eliminating the earnings limit--since last July; to correct some inadvertent errors we discovered; and to update our assumptions to reflect the new reality of the Trust Funds as reported in the 2000 Social Security and Medicare Trustees Report which came out earlier this year.  Since July 16, 1999 when Senators Gregg, Kerrey, Breaux, Thompson, Thomas, and Robb and I introduced our legislation to save Social Security, the issue has taken on new life, due to Governor Bush's willingness to make Social Security reform a primary issue in his presidential campaign. He should be commended for his leadership and for grabbing the third rail of American politics fearlessly in order to create a truly secure Social Security system so that future generations will be able to rely on Social Security like their parents and grandparents.  I want to urge my colleagues to take a serious look at our proposal to save Social Security. It was designed in a bipartisan, bicameral manner: four Republicans and three Democrats cosponsored the Bipartisan Social Security Reform Bill, and Congressmen Kolbe and Stenholm sponsored similar legislation in the House of Representatives.  The bipartisan plan would maintain a basic floor of protection through a traditional Social Security benefit, but two percentage points of the 12.4 percent payroll tax would be redirected to individual accounts. Individuals could invest their personal accounts in any combination of the funds offered through the Social Security system. An individual who invested his or her personal account in a bond fund would receive a guaranteed interest rate. However, individuals who wish to pursue a higher rate of return through investment in a fund including equities could do so.  Our proposal would eliminate the need for future payroll tax increases by advance funding a portion of future benefits through personal accounts. With individual accounts, we provide Americans with the tools necessary to build financial independence in retirement--especially to those who previously had limited opportunities to create wealth. The legislation provides incentives for low and middle income working Americans to save additional funds for retirement by matching their voluntary contributions to their individual accounts. Under our plan, they will be able to save for retirement and benefit from economic growth.  As all the cosponsors have said a hundred times, our proposal offers no ``free lunch''. In order to save Social Security for future generations it must be modernized. We have crafted a responsible plan to save Social Security for generations to come. By making incremental, steady changes to the Social Security system, we will be able to ensure the long-term solvency of the program.  With this technical corrections bill we have improved upon our original legislation and I urge my colleagues to support the bipartisan proposal to save Social Security.  Mr. President, I ask that the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2774       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
