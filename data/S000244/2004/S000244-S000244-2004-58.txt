Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, this is not an issue of humanitarian application of our immigration refugee laws. It is an issue of securing our borders. None of the people the gentleman from New Jersey described would be subject to this if they have come to the United States and entered legally with a claim of persecution under the Refugee Act or a claim of asylum because of what is going on in their home country.  Simply stated, the amendment of the gentleman from New Jersey would strike the expedited removal provisions of this bill. The expedited removal provisions say that the provision of existing law shall be used when the INS picks up somebody who is illegally in this country and who has not been here for 5 years or more.  What is going on is that there are a lot of non-Mexicans that are coming across the southern border. Many of these people come from the Middle East. Without having the expedited removal procedures that are contained in this law, we are stuck with these people. This is a tremendous security threat to the United States. And what the provision that the gentleman from New Jersey seeks to strike is a provision that says that you do not have to jump through all kinds of legal hoops to get these people who have illegally entered the United States out of our country or who have entered legally and have overstayed their visas. It is as simple as that. This is a question of border security. It is not a question of persecuting all of the list of people that the gentleman from New Jersey talked about.  If you want secure borders in this country, the only vote on the Smith amendment is ``no.''  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
