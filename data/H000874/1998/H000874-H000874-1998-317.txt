Speaker, next week, on Thursday, June 25, human rights activists and defenders of the environment plan to gather in front of the Russian Consulate in San Francisco to protest the continuing mistreatment of former Russian Navy Captain Alexandr Nikitin.  Working with the Norwegian environmental group ``Bellona,'' Mr. Nikitin provided resource material for a report entitled ``The Russian Northern Fleet: sources of Radioactive Contamination,'' that exposed the Russian Navy's nuclear waste dumping in the White Sea and Kola Peninsula region. the report revealed, for instance, that fifty-two decommissioned nuclear submarines still containing nuclear fuel are rusting at the Murmansk dockside and that nuclear reactors from other decommissioned submarines were simply dumped into the Arctic Ocean.  It would probably be too much to ask that the Russian government thank him for his efforts. Frankly, the Russian government is not the only government that has not looked kindly on environmental whistle blowers. However, most governments would not go to the lengths to which the Russian government has gone to punish Mr. Nikitin for his expose.  On February 2, 1996, he was arrested and charged with ``revealing state secrets,'' a charge that could carry the death penalty if he were convicted. In October 1996, the Federal Security Service (FSB) declared the Bellona/Nikitin report ``forbidden literature.'' Nikitin was held in pretrial detention from February to December 1996. I would note that during this time his brother-in-law, who had served in the Russian Northern Fleet, died of radiation poisoning.  Protests from human rights activists and defenders of the environment resulted in Nikitin's release from detention, but the charges were not dropped. The FSB attempted to have him indicted on the basis of unpublished ``secret decrees,'' a blatant violation of the Russian constitution. Even the Federal Prosecutor's office admitted that ``mistakes were made'' and that the case ``contains no hint of espionage.'' The FSB had to back down, and after six earlier investigations, now claims to have a legitimate case to go to trial. One wonders how many chances the FSB gets.  Meanwhile, Nikitin has been required to remain in St. Petersburg. His wife and daughter came to the United States last year to accept on his behalf the prestigious Goldman Environmental Prize for his environmental work. Their apartment is kept under surveillance, the phone has been tapped, and Nikitin's lawyer was recently approached by thugs on the street and told to ``stay away from this.''  But the FSB has misjudged their man. Alexandr Nikitin and his family are standing up to the reactionary forces of the past. They do this not only for themselves, but for millions of Russians and millions of others on this planet who are endangered by ecological irresponsibility and indifference. if we care about human rights and the future of our planet, we should add our voices in support of Alexandr Nikitin's cause. The Russian governmentwoud be better served by honoring the efforts and integrity of citizens such as Alexandr Nikitin rather than trying to silence and punish him.                          ____________________
