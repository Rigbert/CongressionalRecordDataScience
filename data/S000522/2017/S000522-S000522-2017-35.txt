Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from Iowa's leadership, which has been over many decades. I want to thank him for his eloquence and his steadfastness. The day will come when the unborn are protected, and he will be a major part of that.  I would also concur with the gentleman from Iowa fully in how much we miss the great Henry Hyde. He was extraordinary. He was irreplaceable. And the fact that his amendment has saved 2 million lives, at least--some estimates put it even higher--is a testimony to his vision, which we now carry on with.  I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert). I again thank him for his outspokenness on behalf of the weakest and most vulnerable.
