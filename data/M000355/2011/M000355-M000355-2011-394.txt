 President, I rise today to recognize the impressive accomplishments of a remarkable men's basketball team in the Commonwealth, the Bellarmine University Knights.  On March 26, the Knights made school history by winning the 2011 National Collegiate Athletic Association Division II basketball championship. By defeating the Brigham Young University-Hawaii Seasiders 71 to 68, Bellarmine brought home its first national championship title in any sport. Senior guard Justin Benedetti described the atmosphere in the MassMutual Center in Springfield, MA, where the championship game was held to be like a home game for the Knights, as many fans traveled to fill the crowd of nearly 3,000.  The morning following their championship win, hundreds of fans, alumni, and students cheered as the team returned to campus and filed off the bus holding high their national trophy. I applaud not only the team's athletic achievement, but also the teamwork and sportsmanship on display as they represented my hometown, Louisville, and our Commonwealth in front of the country's basketball fans.  A state that honors basketball will honor the 2011 Bellarmine Knights team as among the best for seasons to come. Fans will remember a team of unselfish players whose only goal was to win. And they will remember head coach Scott Davenport, who taught his players to play basketball the way it was meant to be played.  Coach Davenport built this team around talented local players--the entire roster hails from Kentucky, Indiana, and Ohio. A Louisville native, he led his Knights to a 33-2 overall record this year on their way to the Division II championship. He can now add this collegiate championship to the one he earned coaching the Ballard High School Bruins of Louisville, KY, to the State championship in 1988. It is no wonder he was recently named the 2011 Schelde North America/Division II Bulletin Coach of the Year. I would like to extend my sincere congratulations to Scott Davenport upon receiving this distinguished honor.  Family members, friends, and the Louisville community are justifiably proud of this team's achievement and the recognition they have earned. This season was a special one for Bellarmine University that we will remember for a long time to come.  I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the Bellarmine University Knights men's basketball team upon earning their first national title. I wish them continued success both on and off the court.                          ____________________
