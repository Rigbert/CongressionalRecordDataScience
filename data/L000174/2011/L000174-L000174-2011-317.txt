President, today, I am pleased to introduce the Refugee Protection Act. This bill, which is cosponsored by Senators Levin, Akaka, and Durbin, will reaffirm the commitments our Nation made in ratifying the 1951 Refugee Convention, and help to restore the United States as a global leader on human rights. This bill would repeal the most harsh and unnecessary elements of current law, and restore the United States to its rightful role as a safe and welcoming home for those suffering from persecution around the world.  During this challenging economic time, it can be tempting to look inward rather than to fulfill our global humanitarian commitments. However, this bill is necessary now more than ever. Millions of refugees remain displaced and warehoused in refugee camps in Eastern Africa, Southeast Asia, and other parts of the world. The ``Arab Spring'' is helping to move governments of the Middle East toward democracy, but some governments have responded to peaceful demonstrations with violence. We will continue to see genuine refugees who are in need of protection. I was pleased to be able to protect funding for refugee assistance and resettlement programs in the fiscal year 2011 appropriations continuing resolution, when many other programs were cut.  In my home state of Vermont, I have seen how the admission of refugees and asylum seekers has revitalized and enriched communities, resulting in the creation of new businesses, safer neighborhoods, and stronger schools. Since Senator Ted Kennedy authored the 1980 Refugee Act, more than 2.6 million refugees and asylum seekers have been granted protection in the United States. And since 1989, almost 5,600 refugees have been resettled in Vermont. We are fortunate to have the Vermont Refugee Resettlement Program, with its decades of experience and award-wining volunteer program, leading this effort. Over the last five years, many of these new Vermonters have come from Bhutan, Burma, and the Congo. Their culture is enriching my historically Anglo Saxon and French Canadian state.  Once resettled, these refugees have become nursing assistants, soccer coaches, and small business owners. In Burlington's Old North End, there are two thriving halal markets, side by side. The Nadia International Halal Market is run by an Iraqi refugee. Next door is the Banadir Market, run by a Somali Bantu refugee. Vermonters enjoy these new additions to the culture, and these thriving small businesses create local jobs in a historically disadvantaged neighborhood.  Equally important are the family- and community-based values of these new Vermonters. The Burlington Chief of Police has commented that refugees have reduced crime in some historically troubled areas, creating more family oriented neighborhoods.  Vermonters have played a tremendous role in welcoming refugees and asylees to their communities. Many have hosted refugee families in their homes until suitable housing could be found. The Ohavi Zedek Synagogue has made an effort to help all refugee families, regardless of their faith. The synagogue offers free English language classes so that refugees can improve their English skills. In this year's Passover service, refugees were encouraged to share their own personal tales of exodus.  The synagogue also runs a thrift shop where refugees who have been in the country for less than a year are allowed to take whatever they need without charge. Yet, a refugee from Bhutan has offered to help make physical improvements to the building's foundation, a testament to his desire to give back to the communities that have helped refugees build new lives. Many other places of worships have also reached out to these new Vermonters.  The Association for Africans Living in Vermont, AALV, which now assists any refugee in Vermont regardless of the country of origin, helps refugees access social services, organizes community cultural events, and provides cross-cultural training to Vermont service providers. The organization offers workforce development programs to ensure refugees can find meaningful work that sustains their families. The AALV New Farms for New Americans program enables refugees, many of whom farmed in their home countries, to learn to grow crops well suited to the Vermont climate. This program can connect such refugees to their heritage, and invites them to become part of Vermont's longstanding and vibrant agricultural tradition.  In cooperation with Vermont Adult Learning, AALV offers the PersonalCare Assistant Workforce Training Program, which trains refugees to serve as personal care assistants, the first level of service in the nursing profession. Graduates are able to pursue additional training as a licensed nursing assistant.  Vermont's resettlement program and the community support are not without their challenges. We experience many of the same hurdles faced by resettlement efforts and receiving communities across the Nation. The Refugee Protection Act of 2011 includes provisions that will help the nationwide resettlement effort operate more effectively. I want to acknowledge the leadership of Senator Lugar who has investigated the resettlement program and called for a GAO study to obtain recommendations for improvement. I also appreciate the efforts of Representative Gary Peters of Michigan, who introduced a resettlement bill in the House of Representatives to improve communication among all stakeholders.  In addition to support and improvement of the resettlement program, this bill addresses several areas of domestic asylum adjudication that are in need of significant reform. This bill would repeal the one-year filing deadline for asylum seekers, removing an unnecessary barrier to protection. The bill would allow arriving aliens and minors to seek asylum first before the Asylum Office rather than referring those cases immediately to immigration court. The Asylum Office is well trained to screen for fraud and able to handle a slight increase in its caseload. Meanwhile, as we learned in a May 18, 2011, hearing before the Judiciary Committee, the immigration courts are overburdened, under-resourced, and facing steady increases in their caseloads.  The Refugee Protection Act ensures that persons who were victims of terrorism or persecution by terrorist groups will not be doubly victimized with a denial of protection in the United States. Vermont Immigration and Asylum Advocates, a legal aid and torture treatment provider, continues to see cases where persons granted asylum are later blocked from bringing their families to the United States or applying for permanent residency by overly broad definitions in current law. This bill would help such persons prove their cases without taking any shortcuts on national security. The bill also gives the President the authority to designate certain groups of particularly vulnerable groups for expedited consideration. All refugees would still have to complete security and background checks prior to entry to the United States.  Finally, the bill addresses the need to treat genuine asylum seekers as persons in need of protection, not as criminals. It calls for asylum seekers who can prove their identity and who pose no threat to the United States to be released from immigration detention. Vermont Immigration and Asylum Advocates, like other legal aid providers across the Nation, struggle to visit detention facilities located at a distance from urban centers, or to reach clients who have been transferred to far away locations. I appreciate efforts made by the Obama administration to parole eligible asylum seekers and to improve the conditions of detention overall, but more must be done. The Refugee Protection Act will improve access to counsel so that asylum seekers with genuine claims can gain legal assistance in presenting their claims. It will require the Government to codify detention standards so that reforms are meaningful and enforceable.  There is no question that the United States is a leader among nations in refugee protection, but we can do better. The refugees we welcome to our shores contribute to the fabric of our Nation, and enrich the communities where they settle. I urge all Senators to support the Refugee Protection Act of 2011.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a section by section analysis and a list of support organizations be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:      The Leahy-Levin-Akaka-Durbin Refugee Protection Act of 2011                           Sectional Analysis       The Refugee Act of 1980 was a landmark piece of legislation      that sought to fulfill the United States' obligations under      the 1951 Refugee Convention. Unfortunately, in the      intervening years, U.S. law has fallen short of those      obligations. Last year, on the thirtieth anniversary of the      Refugee Act of 1980, Senator Leahy, introduced the Refugee      Protection Act of 2010 (S. 3113, 111th Congress), a      comprehensive package of improvements to our law. On June 15,      2011, Senator Leahy, along with Senators Levin, Akaka, and      Durbin, introduced a new version of the bill for the 112th      Congress. The Refugee Protection Act of 2011 will ensure that      refugees and asylum seekers with bona fide claims are      protected by the United States, restoring the United States      as a beacon of hope for those who suffer from persecution.     Sec. 1. Short Title.       The short title is the Refugee Protection Act of 2011.     Sec. 2. Definitions.       This section defines the terms ``asylum seeker'' and      ``Secretary of Homeland Security.''     Sec. 3. Elimination of Time Limits on Asylum Applications.       This section eliminates the one-year time limit for filing      an asylum claim. The stated intent of Congress in 1996 in      enacting the one-year deadline was to prevent fraud, not to      deprive bona fide applicants from securing protection under      our laws. Yet, even in 1996, problems related to fraud had      been resolved through administrative reform implemented by      the Immigration & Naturalization Service, which opposed the      implementation of an application deadline. Since the one-year      deadline was enacted, and despite exceptions available in the      law for extraordinary or changed circumstances that may      prevent the timely filing of an application, many asylum      seekers with genuine claims have been denied protection. The      exceptions to the one-year deadline are not uniformly applied      to applicants, leading to unfair treatment of those who have      legitimate reasons for applying after the one-year deadline.      Moreover, a significant number of applicants have      subsequently met the higher standard for withholding of      removal, demonstrating that their claims were valid. This      section allows such an asylum seeker to reopen his asylum      claim if he is still in the United States, has not      subsequently been awarded lawful permanent residence status,      is not subject to a bar to asylum, and should not be denied      asylum as a matter of discretion.     Sec. 4. Protecting Victims of Terrorism from Being Defined as          Terrorists.       Under current law, any asylum seeker or refugee who is      individually culpable of engaging in terrorist conduct, or      direct support for it, is barred under prohibitions to entry      for a threat to national security, serious non-political      crime, persecution of others, or engaging in terrorist      activity. Changes in the law since September 11, 2001, have      resulted in innocent activity, or coerced actions, being      labeled as ``material support'' for terrorism, a      determination that can render genuine refugees ineligible for      protection in the United States. This section would amend the      law to ensure that asylum seekers and refugees are not barred      from admission to the United States under an overly broad      definition of ``terrorist organization'' in the Immigration      and Nationality Act (INA).       This section would define the term ``material support'' to      mean support that is significant and of a kind directly      relevant to terrorist activity. This section also gives the      Secretary of Homeland Security discretion to waive      application of the terrorism bars for certain applicants.       This section clarifies that those who committed certain      acts (such as military-type training, solicitation, or other      non-violent actions) under duress may not be deemed      inadmissible if they pose no threat to the United States. It      gives the Secretary discretion to consider the age of the      applicant at the time the acts were committed in determining      whether those acts were committed under duress.       This section also creates an exception for those who were      forced to recruit child soldiers under duress, or who engaged      in such recruitment under the age of 18. Finally, this      section would repeal an unduly harsh provision in current law      that makes spouses and children inadmissible for the acts of      a spouse or parent.       All applicants for asylum or refugee status must meet all      of the other traditional background and security checks.     Sec. 5. Protecting Certain Vulnerable Groups of Asylum          Seekers.       To be eligible for asylum under the Refugee Convention and      domestic law, an applicant must show that he or she has      experienced persecution or have a well-founded fear of future      persecution on account of race, religion, nationality,      political opinion, or membership in a particular social      group. This section makes several modifications to current      law to ensure that particularly vulnerable groups of asylum      seekers have a full and fair opportunity to seek protection      in the United States.       Subsection (a) codifies the holding of the landmark Board      of Immigration Appeals (BIA) decision in Matter of Acosta, 19      I. & N. Dec. 211 (BIA 1985). That holding defined the basis      of persecution based on membership in a ``particular social      group'' as one comprised of individuals who share a common      characteristic they either cannot change, or should not be      required to change because the     characteristic is fundamental to their identity or      conscience. The Acosta precedent has been clouded in recent      years by BIA opinions that require asylum applicants to prove      additional factors, some of which are unnecessary or contrary      to the spirit of domestic law and the Refugee Convention.      Most damaging is a requirement that the social group in      question be ``socially visible,'' a factor that could      endanger certain categories of refugees, such as victims of      gender persecution or LGBT asylum seekers. These are groups      that, as Judge Posner of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals      described, are at great pains to remain socially invisible.      This subsection codifies the definition of social group in      Matter of Acosta such that inappropriate, additional factors      such as social visibility cannot be required by the BIA.       Subsection (b) makes additional changes to current law.      Paragraph (1): United States law has long recognized that      persecutors may have mixed motives for harming their victims.      For example, a militia that operates outside government      control may persecute a particular race of persons because of      xenophobia and also because it seeks to deprive the      persecuted race of valuable land and property. The fact that      the persecutor is motivated by two intertwined goals should      not prevent the victims from obtaining protection.      Nonetheless, the REAL ID Act of 2005 raised the burden of      proof that asylum seekers must meet in order to show that      they fear persecution on account of one of the five grounds      enumerated in the Refugee Convention and in U.S. law. (The      five grounds are race, religion, nationality, membership in a      particular social group, or political opinion.) The REAL ID      Act requires that the asylum seeker demonstrate that harm on      account of a protected ground is ``at least one central      reason'' for the feared persecution. See INA      Sec. 208(b)(1)(B)(i). The ``one central reason'' language is      modified in this section, which does not fully repeal the      notion of persecutor intent but applies it in a manner that      is both realistic and fair. This paragraph strikes the      language that requires the protected ground (e.g., race) to      be one central reason for the persecution and requires      instead that the protected ground ``was or will be a factor      in the applicant's persecution or fear of persecution.''       Paragraph (2): The REAL ID Act of 2005 added requirements      to the INA with regard to an asylum seeker's duty to provide      corroborating evidence when it is requested by an immigration      judge. The REAL ID Act stated that ``such evidence must be      provided unless the applicant does not have the evidence and      cannot reasonably obtain the evidence.'' Corroborating      evidence can be an important component of an asylum claim,      but asylum seekers must have a fair opportunity to respond to      requests for corroboration. In addition, as courts have      noted, it is sometimes virtually impossible for asylum      seekers to obtain certain types of corroborating evidence.      Therefore, this paragraph requires that when the trier of      fact seeks corroborating evidence, the trier of fact must      provide notice and allow the asylum applicant a reasonable      opportunity to file such evidence unless the applicant does      not have the evidence and cannot reasonably obtain the      evidence.       Paragraph (3) renumbers text in the statute.       Paragraph (4): As noted above, an asylum seeker must show      that his or her well-founded fear of persecution is on      account of one of the five grounds of asylum. This link is      often called the nexus requirement. Some genuine asylum      seekers have been denied asylum because of a lack of clear      guidance on how the nexus requirement may be established when      the persecutor is a non-state actor. The Department of      Justice issued draft regulations in 2000 that made clear that      an asylum seeker can demonstrate nexus through either      ``direct or circumstantial'' evidence. This draft regulation      was consistent with the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in INS      v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 483 (1992). This paragraph      would codify the draft regulation by making clear that either      direct or circumstantial evidence may establish that      persecution is on account of one of the five grounds.       Paragraph (5): The REAL ID Act also modified the INA with      regard to factors that an immigration judge may consider in      determining the asylum seeker's credibility. In short, the      REAL ID gave heightened importance to inconsistencies in an      asylum seeker's claim, even if those inconsistencies were      minor or immaterial to the heart of the claim. In practice,      an asylum seeker with limited English skills, with post-     traumatic stress disorder, or with other conditions, may make      simple, minor errors in the telling and retelling of their      story. This paragraph modifies the INA to state that if the      immigration judge determines that there are inconsistencies      or omissions in the claim, the asylum seeker should be given      an opportunity to explain and to provide support or evidence      to clarify such inconsistencies or omissions. Subsection (c)      makes identical corrections to the corroboration and      credibility determinations for removal proceedings that are      described in paragraphs (2) and (5) above.     Sec. 6. Effective Adjudication of Proceedings.       This section authorizes the Attorney General to appoint      counsel to an alien in removal proceedings where fair      resolution or effective adjudication of the case would be      served by doing so. In certain cases, such as those involving      highly complex asylum claims, unaccompanied minors, mentally      impaired persons, or individuals who are incapable of pro se      representation, delays in adjudication may result while an      alien prepares a case or searches for pro bono      representation. The immigration courts will operate more      efficiently (with savings to taxpayers) if the Attorney      General is provided explicit authority to exercise discretion      to appoint counsel in certain instances, such as those      described above.     Sec. 7. Scope and Standard for Review.       This section prevents the removal of an alien during the      30-day period an alien has to file a petition for review to a      Federal Circuit Court of Appeals after the alien has been      ordered removed. Staying the removal during this period will      enable an applicant to carefully consider whether to file an      appeal rather than rush to file in order to preserve his or      her rights. In weak cases, the alien will likely decline to      appeal, and deport voluntarily or via government removal.      This section also restores judicial review to a fair and      reasonable standard consistent with principles of      administrative law. The standard in this section is that the      Court of Appeals shall sustain a final decision ordering the      removal of an alien unless that decision is contrary to law,      an abuse of discretion, or not supported by substantial      evidence. The decision must be based on the administrative      record on which the order of removal is based.     Sec. 8. Efficient Asylum Determination Process for Arriving          Aliens.       Under current law, an alien who requests asylum as they      attempt to enter the United States (an ``arriving alien'') is      subject to detention for part or all of the time that they      await an asylum hearing. Such asylum seekers are provided an      initial interview with an asylum officer to determine whether      they have a credible fear of persecution, but then must      pursue their asylum case in immigration court, rather than in      a non-adversarial proceeding. Generally speaking, the      adversarial immigration hearing is considerably lengthier and      costlier than a non-adversarial asylum hearing. Under this      section, the DHS asylum office would be given jurisdiction      over an asylum case after a positive credible fear      determination. The alien would then undergo a non-     adversarial asylum interview. If the asylum officer is      unable to recommend a grant of asylum, the case will be      referred to an immigration judge and the asylum seeker      placed in removal proceedings. This structure mirrors the      current process for asylum seekers who apply for asylum      from within the United States.     Sec. 9. Secure Alternatives Program.       This section requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to      establish a secure ``alternatives to detention'' program. The      program will allow certain aliens in civil immigration      custody to be released under enhanced supervision to prevent      the alien from absconding and to ensure that the alien makes      all required appearances associated with his or her      immigration case. The program is to be designed as a      continuum of alternatives based on the alien's need for      supervision, which may include placement of the alien with an      individual or organizational sponsor, or in a supervised      group home. The program shall restrict the use of ankle      monitoring devices to cases in which there is a demonstrated      need for enhanced monitoring, and the use of ankle monitors      shall be reviewed periodically. The program shall be designed      to include individualized case management and referrals to      community based organizations. In designing the program, the      Secretary is instructed to consider prior successful      programs, such the Vera Institute of Justice's Appearance      Assistance Program.       The Secretary of Homeland Security currently has discretion      to detain asylum seekers. This section maintains such      discretion but clarifies that, consistent with a DHS policy      announced in December 2009, it is the policy of the United      States to release (``parole'') asylum seekers who have      established a credible fear of persecution. Under this      section, asylum seekers who have established identity will be      released within 7 days of a positive credible fear      determination unless DHS can show that the asylum seeker      poses a risk to public safety (which may include a risk to      national security) or is a flight risk. If parole is denied,      DHS must provide the asylum seeker with written notification      for the reason for denial conveyed in a language the asylum      seeker claims to understand.     Sec. 10. Conditions of Detention.       Regulations regarding conditions for detention shall be      promulgated, and must address several issues including access      to legal service providers, group legal orientation      presentations, translation services, recreational programs      and activities, access to law libraries, prompt case      notification requirements, access to working telephones,      access to religious services, notice of transfers, and access      to facilities by nongovernmental organization. This section      also limits the use of solitary confinement, shackling, and      strip searches. This section requires that, after the date of      enactment, facilities first used by ICE to detain alien      detainees must be located within 50 miles of a community in      which there is a demonstrated capacity to provide free or      low-cost legal representation.     Sec. 11. Timely Notice of Immigration Charges.       This section requires the Department of Homeland Security      to file a charging document with the immigration court      closest to     the location at which an alien was apprehended within 48      hours of the alien being taken into custody by the      Department. The Department is also required to serve a copy      of the charging document on the alien within 48 hours of      apprehension. This section will serve multiple purposes. It      will prevent asylum seekers and other aliens from languishing      in detention at taxpayer expense without being charged. It      will encourage efficient handling of cases by both the      Department of Homeland Security and the immigration courts,      which are operated by the Department of Justice. Finally, it      will ensure that if an asylum seeker or other alien is      transferred from one detention facility to another,      jurisdictional and due process protections will attach.     Sec. 12. Procedures for Ensuring Accuracy and Verifiability          of Sworn Statements Taken Pursuant to Expedited Removal          Authority.       This section modifies current policy to ensure that asylum      seekers are not harmed by error in the production of sworn      statements taken during the expedited removal process. It      requires that the Secretary of Homeland Security establish a      procedure whereby the interviews of asylum seekers are      recorded. The recording may be a video, audio or other      reliable form of recording. The recording must include a      written statement, in its entirety, being read back to the      alien in a language that the alien claims to understand, and      include the alien affirming the accuracy of the statement or      making any corrections thereto. If an interpreter is      necessary, such interpreter must be competent in the language      of the asylum seeker. Once a record is produced and signed by      the asylum seeker under these conditions, it may be      considered part of the record. The Secretary may exempt      facilities from the requirements of this section under      certain circumstances.     Sec. 13. Study on the Effect of Expedited Removal Provisions,          Practices, and Procedures on Asylum Claims.       A 2005 study by the United States Commission on      International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) documented      widespread problems in the implementation of expedited      removal policy by U.S. Customs and Border Protection      immigration officers at ports of entry. A few months prior to      release of the Study, the Secretary of Homeland Security      expanded expedited removal authority from immigration      inspectors at Ports of Entry--as applied to arriving aliens      without proper documentation--to Border Patrol agents who      apprehend an alien within 100 miles of the border within 14      days after an entry without inspection. The 2005 USCIRF Study      did not analyze the implementation of expedited removal by      the Border Patrol, as USCIRF's data collection had been      completed by that point in time. This section authorizes the      Commission to conduct a new study to determine whether Border      Patrol officers exercising expedited removal authority in the      interior of the United States are improperly encouraging      aliens to withdraw or retract claims for asylum. The      Commission is also authorized to study whether immigration      officers incorrectly fail to refer asylum seekers for      credible fear interviews by asylum officers; incorrectly      remove such aliens to a country where the alien may be      persecuted; and/or detain such asylum seekers improperly or      in inappropriate conditions.     Sec. 14. Refugee Opportunity Promotion.       The immigration statute requires a refugee who is resettled      in the United States to remain on U.S. soil for a full year      before adjusting to lawful permanent residence. For many,      this requirement presents no obstacles, as resettled refugees      immediately begin to work, learn English, and contribute to      their local communities. Yet, the one-year physical      presence requirement poses a significant barrier to      resettled refugees who are eager and willing to serve the      United States Government overseas. This section waives the      continuous presence requirement for any refugee who,      during their first year of residence in the United States,      accepts employment overseas to aid the United States      Government, such as by working as a translator or in      another professional capacity.     Sec. 15. Protections for Minors Seeking Asylum.       The William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection      Reauthorization Act of 2008 (TVPRA) amended the immigration      statute to exempt unaccompanied alien children from the safe      third country and one-year filing deadline bars to asylum.      This section will amend the statute to expand these TVPRA      exemptions to all child applicants for asylum. This section      also expands the exemption to the bar to asylum for      applicants under 18 years of age who were previously denied      asylum. The proposed language also clarifies that      unaccompanied alien children who have previously been      removed, or who departed voluntarily, should not have their      removal orders reinstated, but should instead be placed in      removal proceedings. Finally, this section states that all      cases of children seeking asylum be adjudicated in the first      instance by an asylum officer in a non-adversarial      proceeding. These protections, which were provided to      unaccompanied minors in the TVPRA, are expanded in the bill      to all child asylum seekers.     Sec. 16. Legal Assistance for Refugees and Asylees.       The Immigration and Nationality Act authorizes the      Secretary of Health and Human Services to make grants to non-     profit organizations to assist resettled refugees with mental      health counseling, social services, education (including      English as a Second Language, or ESL), and other assistance      to help refugees assimilate into American communities. This      section would authorize the Secretary to make similar grants      to assist lawfully resettled refugees with legal advice on      applications for immigration benefits to which they may be      eligible after residing in the United States for certain      periods of time, e.g., family reunification, adjustment of      status, or naturalization.     Sec. 17. Protection of Stateless Persons in the United          States.       This section will enable individuals who are de jure      stateless to obtain lawful status in the United States. De      jure stateless persons are individuals who are not considered      to be citizens under the laws of any country. They do not      have a nationality and therefore cannot be returned anywhere.      (These individuals are not rendered stateless by any negative      action of their own, such the commission of crimes that leads      the country of origin to deny return, but generally by forces      beyond their control, such as the collapse of the country of      origin (e.g. the Soviet Union) and the succession of a state      or states that will not recognize certain former nationals.)      De jure stateless persons are ineligible for lawfully      recognized status in the United States based on the fact that      they are stateless. This section would make such persons      eligible to apply for conditional lawful status if they are      not inadmissible under criminal or security grounds and if      they pass all standard background checks. After five years in      conditional status, de jure stateless persons would be      eligible to apply for lawful permanent status.     Sec. 18. Authority to Designate Certain Groups of Refugees          for Consideration.       This section authorizes the President to designate certain      groups as eligible for expedited adjudication as refugees.      The authority would address situations in which a group is      targeted for persecution in their country of origin or      country of first asylum. The designation by the President      would be sufficient, if proved to the satisfaction of the      Secretary of Homeland Security, to establish a well-founded      fear of persecution for members of the designated group.      However, each individual applicant would still have to be      admissible to the United States and pass security and      background checks before being admitted. Refugees admitted      under this authority would not be exempt from the annual      limit on refugee admissions. This section simply enables the      President to call for expedited adjudication where necessary      and appropriate. This section explicitly includes groups      previously protected under the Lautenberg Amendment, which      include, among others, Jews and Evangelical Christians from      the former Soviet Union, and religious minorities from Iran.     Sec. 19. Multiple Forms of Relief.       This section simply allows individuals applying for refugee      protection to simultaneously apply for other forms of      admission to the United States, such as through a family-     based petition. All applicants for admission must pass      security and background checks. This modification to current      law would not allow would-be refugees from gaming the system,      but simply enable them to escape harm or persecution at the      first opportunity a visa becomes available. This section also      allows the very small number of asylum applicants who win the      opportunity to apply for a green card through the diversity      lottery the ability to apply for that diversity visa from      within the United States. Typically, diversity visa      applicants must apply from their home country, a requirement      that would subject a genuine asylum seeker to risk of harm.     Sec. 20. Protection of Refugee Families.       This modification to current law would enable the spouse or      child of a refugee (a ``derivative'') to bring their children      to the United States when they accompany or follow to join      the spouse or parent who was originally awarded refugee      status (a ``principal''). Current law does not allow a      derivative's child to be admitted as a refugee, yet given the      long waits and often unsafe conditions that many derivative      applicants and their children face in camps overseas, the      United States should provide this group protection. This      section also aids children who were orphaned or abandoned by      their blood relatives and are living in the care of extended      family, friends, or neighbors who are granted admission to      the United States as refugees or asylees. Where it is in the      best interest of such a child to join that refugee or asylee      in the United States, this section creates a mechanism      whereby they may be admitted. This section also repeals an      unnecessary time limit in regulations on the filing of family      petitions related to refugee and asylee family reunification.      Finally, to facilitate the admission of eligible family      members, this section requires that U.S. Citizenship and      Immigration Services adjudicate family reunification      petitions for those following to join refugees and asylees      within 90 days of filing.     Sec. 21. Reform of Refugee Consultation Process.       Each year, the executive branch is charged with consulting      with Congress over the annual allocation of refugees to be      admitted to the United States. This section requires      meaningful consultation to take place between Cabinet-     level officers and the committees of jurisdiction of the      Congress by May 1 of each year.     Sec. 22. Admission of Refugees in the Absence of the Annual          Presidential Determination.       This section states that for a fiscal year in which the      executive branch does not determine the allocation of      refugees for that year, the admission of refugees is not      delayed. Rather, until a determination is announced for the      new fiscal year, in each quarter of the new fiscal year, the      number of refugees equal to one-quarter for the prior fiscal      year's allocation may be admitted.     Sec. 23. Update of Reception and Placement Grants.       When a refugee is resettled in the United States, the      federal government assists him or her through Reception and      Placement Grants to non-governmental organizations (NGOs)      that help refugees find housing, place their children in      school, enroll in ESL classes, and take other initial steps      toward building a new life in the United States. Early in      2010, the administration increased the per capita grant level      to $1800 per refugee, up to $1100 of which may be awarded      directly to the refugee for immediate costs, and up to $700      of which is used by the NGO to cover the cost of dedicated      staff and expenses. Prior to 2010, the per capita level had      not kept pace with inflation. For years it was set at a level      so low that refugees were effectively consigned to poverty      upon arrival in the United States, and NGOs were only able to      offset the cost of basic support services to the refugees by      raising additional funds. To ensure that the per capita      amount does not fall behind the minimum level required for      basic needs, this section requires the per capita amount to      be adjusted on an annual basis for inflation and the cost of      living. It also calls for better forecasting of financial      needs with regard to the number of refugees expected to be      resettled each year and allows for additional amounts to be      paid out in the event that a higher than anticipated number      of refugees is admitted in a fiscal year.     Sec. 24. Protection for Aliens Interdicted at Sea.       The U.S. government should apply one standard, consistent      with the Refugee Convention, to all asylum seekers      interdicted at sea, regardless of their nationality. Yet a      patchwork of policies has evolved over the past two decades      often in response to mass migrations at sea. The result is      disparate treatment of Cubans, Chinese and Haitians. This      section will require the Secretary of Homeland Security to      develop uniform policies to identify asylum seekers among      those interdicted at sea and to treat those individuals      fairly and in a non-discriminatory manner.     Sec. 25. Modification of Physical Presence Requirements for          Aliens Serving as Translators.       Under current law, in order to be naturalized, most non-     U.S. citizens must have continuous residence in the United      States for five years and physical presence for periods      totaling half that time (2\1/2\ years). This section would      permit absence from the United States while serving as a      translator for the U.S. government in Iraq or Afghanistan to      count toward the 2\1/2\ years physical presence required for      naturalization.     Sec. 26. Assessment of the Refugee Domestic Resettlement          Program.       This section directs GAO to conduct a study on the      effectiveness of the domestic refugee resettlement program      operated by the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) of the      Department of Health and Human Services. The study will      analyze issues pertaining to the definition of self      sufficiency, the effectiveness of ORR in helping refugees to      attain self-sufficiency, the unmet needs of the program, and      the role of community-based organizations. The GAO study will      issue statutory recommendations.     Sec. 27. Refugee Assistance.       This section revises the formula for social services      funding allocated to states to include projections of future      refugee arrivals, as well as refugee data from prior years.      This section requires an annual report on secondary migration      and its impact on states.     Sec. 28. Resettlement Data.       This section expands and improves data collection and      reporting within ORR with regard to the mental health and      housing needs of refugees. It will also collect long term      employment and self-sufficiency data on resettled refugees.     Sec. 29. Protections for Refugees.       Current law makes refugees resettled in the United States      eligible to apply for lawful permanent residence after one      year. However, current law also suggests that a refugee who      does not adjust status after one year may be taken into      custody by DHS. (See Section 209 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1159).      The agency recently issued guidance to clarify interpretation      of the law, stating that detention of an unadjusted refugee      who is found to be inadmissible or deportable should be      determined under the statute relating to apprehension and      detention of aliens. (See Section 236 of the INA, 8 U.S.C.      1226.) Accordingly, this section of the bill strikes language      in current law that suggests that refugees may be taken into      custody simply for remaining unadjusted. This section also      allows a refugee to apply for lawful permanent residence up      to three months prior to obtaining a year of presence in the      United States.     Sec. 30. Extension of Eligibility Period for Social Security          Benefits for Certain Refugees.       This section extends social security benefits to elderly      and disabled refugees who have not yet naturalized.      Typically, certain eligible refugees may receive social      security for seven years. That period was extended for two      years in 2008 by a bipartisan bill supported by President      Bush. This section extends the social security funding for      one additional year.     Sec. 31. Authorization of Appropriations.       This section authorizes such sums as are necessary to carry      out the Act.     Sec. 32. Determination of Budgetary Effects.       This section contains standardized ``PAYGO'' language.                                  ____      The Leahy-Levin-Akaka-Durbin Refugee Protection Act of 2011                    Endorsements as of June 15, 2011       American Bar Association; American Civil Liberties Union;      American Humanist Association; American Immigration Lawyers      Association; American Jewish Committee; Amnesty International      USA; Association of Africans Living in Vermont; Asylum      Access; Center for American Progress Action Fund; Center for      Gender & Refugee Studies; Center for Victims of Torture;      CenterLink: The Community of LGBT Centers; Church World      Service, Immigration and Refugee Program; The Episcopal      Church; Family Equality Council; Golden Door Coalition of      Illinois; Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society; Hebrew Immigrant Aid      Society Chicago; Heartland Alliance for Human Needs & Human      Rights; Human Rights Campaign; Human Rights First; Human      Rights Watch; Immigrant Child Advocacy Project at the      University of Chicago; Immigration Equality Action Fund;      International Rescue Committee; Jewish Child and Family      Services (Metropolitan Chicago); Kids in Need of Defense      (KIND); Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service; National      Center for Transgender Equality; National Immigrant Justice      Center; National Immigration Forum; National Immigration Law      Center; National Council of Jewish Women; National Latina      Institute for Reproductive Health; Organization for Refuge,      Asylum & Migration; PFLAG National (Parents, Families and      Friends of Lesbians and Gays); RefugeeOne; Refugee Women's      Network, Inc.; Refugees International; State Coordinators of      Refugee Resettlement (SCORR); Tahirih Justice Center; United      African Organization; U.S. Committee for Refugees and      Immigrants; U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops; Vermont      Immigration and Asylum Advocates; Women's Refugee Commission.
