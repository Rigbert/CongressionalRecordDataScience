President, I am delighted to commend Cape Elizabeth High School of Cape Elizabeth ME, on being named a 2019 National Blue Ribbon Exemplary High Performing School. This outstanding high school is one of only 362 schools across the country to receive Blue Ribbon recognition this year from the U.S. Department of Education.  Created in 1982, the Blue Ribbon Schools Program honors schools that are either academically superior in their States or that demonstrate significant gains in student achievement. The schools singled out for this national recognition are models of high educational standards and accountability.  This award recognizes the hard work and determination of Cape Elizabeth High School's students, faculty, and staff. This top-performing school has a strong commitment to professional development that ensures that teachers and staff, as well as students, are life-long learners. This recognition continues a tradition of excellence that builds upon Cape Elizabeth High School's previous Blue Ribbon Award in 2004.  Cape Elizabeth High School's mission is to ``open minds, open doors.'' The school provides its 540 students with a rigorous academic experience that prepares students for college and career, in a supportive environment that offers students many opportunities to explore their interests. Approximately 90 percent of students participate in at least one extracurricular activity, from the arts and athletics to robotics club and model united nations.  Cape Elizabeth students support each other. Every incoming ninth-grade student is assigned an upper class mentor to ease the transition to high school. Freshman Academy helps ninth graders explore their own values and strengths. Across the grade levels, students often say ``thank you'' to their teachers at the end of class, a powerful sign of a respectful school climate.  An active high school parents association strengthens the connections between school and home. The Cape Elizabeth Education Foundation, the first education foundation in Maine, fosters innovation and excellence. Over the years, the foundation has funded the creation of the Achievement Center to offer individualized tutoring, commissioned compositions for performance by school music ensembles, sponsored sexual assault awareness programs planned by students and staff together, and supported teacher professional development.  This Blue Ribbon Award is a tribute not only to the students but also to the administrators, teachers, staff, and parents of Cape Elizabeth High School. Together, they are accomplishing their mission to help students succeed in the classroom and as engaged citizens. They are making a difference in the lives of their students, helping them reach their full potential. I congratulate the entire community for this well-deserved recognition.                          ____________________
