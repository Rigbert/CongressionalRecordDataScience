They do not believe we are listening. They do not believe the problems that families face across America are problems we share. They think we are some sort of political elite that really is out of touch with the world.  They understand in the cities and the suburbs across Illinois that gun violence is an issue that affects so many lives. They wonder how people can be elected to the Senate and not try to do something about it.  I know the Senator from California agrees with me that even passing this gun safety legislation will not eliminate gun violence, but we hope it will reduce it.  It is a commonsense approach to reducing the ownership of guns by people who should not own them. I believe--and I am sure the Senator from California does, too--those who use guns legally and safely, such as sportsmen and hunters, should be allowed to do so, but I do not agree with the NationalRifle Association of basically giving guns to everyone, no questions asked, and hope for the best, and wants to see concealed weapons in every place. Governor Bush decided he wanted concealed weapons to be carried in churches and synagogues in the State of Texas. That strikes me as a ridiculous situation.
