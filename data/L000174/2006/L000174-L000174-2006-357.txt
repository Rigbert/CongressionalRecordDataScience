President, when we began this debate on Monday afternoon I referred to the important discussion that occurred in Vermont several years ago. In that statement I referred to the extraordinary example set of Senator Robert Stafford. I will ask that the Rutland Herald editorial from November 2, 2000, entitled ``Stafford's Gift,'' be printed in the Record. This editorial memorializes the bipartisan call for respect and tolerance to which Vermonters responded. Senator Jeffords and I were honored to join Senator Stafford in rejecting vitriolic attacks during Vermont's experience with this debate. The Rutland Herald's series of civil editorials that examined these issues during Vermont's debate earned the Pulitzer Prize for the newspaper and its editorial page editor, David Moats.  The fairness and equality that resulted from passage of Vermont's civil union law has not threatened the marriages of the Green Mountain State or any other State in this country. It has not led to the parade of horribles threatened by the proponents of this divisive constitutional amendment.  Recently, I was contacted by a number of physicians in Vermont who voiced their strong opposition to the constitutional amendment that we are debating. These pediatricians are concerned that the proposed amendment will deprive children ``of the benefits of both parents being able to provide health insurance, take time off from work to care for their children, authorize medical care, or stay with their children in the hospital.'' I will ask that their letter be printed in the Record.  Hundreds of thousands of American children are being raised by committed same-sex couples. I am gravely concerned that the so-called Marriage Protection Amendment would prevent States from providing benefits and protections to these dedicated parents and their families.  I ask unanimous consent to include two recent editorials opposing the proposed amendment from the Brattleboro Reformer from May 24, 2006, and the Rutland Herald from June 6, 2006, in addition to the aforementioned materials.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Rutland Herald, Nov. 2, 2000]                            Stafford's Gift       Robert Stafford was never a politician who wore his heart      on his sleeve. He served Vermont with distinction over five      decades, beginning as Rutland County state's attorney, later      becoming governor of Vermont and later U.S. senator.       He is now 87 years old, and he lives in Rutland Town.      During his career he focused on getting the job done, and      millions of Americans who are able to use Stafford loans to      finance their higher education have Robert Stafford to thank.       So when Stafford came forward on Tuesday to speak about the      climate of intolerance that has arisen during the present      election campaign, it was because he was moved by a profound      conviction. He was not alone. Sens. Patrick Leahy and James      Jeffords and Rep. Bernard Sanders were with him to request a      return to the atmosphere of respect that has traditionally      characterized the state of Vermont.       Stafford described his marriage of many years to his wife,      Helen, and of the love they have shared. ``I believe that      love is one of the great forces in our society and in the      state of Vermont,'' he said. ``And everyone in this country      is better off living in a society based on love.''       The civil union law has confronted many Vermonters with the      reality that gay and lesbian couples also share love. That      reality prompted a question from Stafford: ``If a same-sex      couple unites with true love,'' he said, ``what is the harm      in that? What is the harm?''       Conscientious people disagree on the moral questions      surrounding homosexuality and civil unions. The point is not      that everyone should agree; it is seldom the case that      everyone will agree on any issue.       The important distinction is between those who disagree      with civil unions and those who take their disagreement a      step further, using offensive language, shouting down      opponents, and employing tactics of character assassination      like those being used in Chittenden County.       Disagreement must be respected. But when disagreement turns      into denigration, it creates the atmosphere that Stafford,      Leahy, Jeffords, and Sanders came to Rutland to deplore.       Stafford and Jeffords are the two senior Republican leaders      in the state, and it is good that leading Republicans have      chosen to speak up about the extremism that has tarred the      debate over civil unions. If the Republicans intend to help      heal the wounds caused by the bigotry of a few, they have to      be willing to distance themselves from some of the attacks      that are made in their name.       Jeffords had harsh words for the ``tone of intolerance and      hate'' this year. And he spoke of the need for respect.      ``When individuals with narrow minds seek to vilify public      servants in the name of religion, it's time to take a step      back.''       A flier distributed by a religious group in Chittenden      County warned that because of the civil union law, Vermont      would become ``a San Francisco-like rural haven.''       Leahy called such fears ``vitrolic nonsense.''       The issue inevitably comes back to Stafford's point, which      asks us to look at the reality of human relationships. In      homosexual relations, just as in heterosexual relations,      there are respectful, loving relationships, and there are      relationships that are less.       And as Stafford said, in simple, heartfelt language, when      it comes to love, what is the harm?                                       ____                                     Pro-Family Pediatricians,                                Burlington, Vermont, June 5, 2006.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.     Hon. James M. Jeffords,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Leahy and Jeffords: As Vermont pediatricians      dedicated to the care of infants, children, adolescents, and      young adults, we strongly urge you to oppose amending the      Constitution to forever deny gay and lesbian couples and      their children the same protections available to other      families. A discriminatory constitutional amendment would      have a particularly severe impact on the health and security      of the hundreds of thousands of children whose parents are      same-sex couples.       On a daily basis, we care for sick children in the context      of their families. Children deserve all the love, care, and      emotional and financial security their families can provide.      Any constitutional amendment that throws obstacles in the way      of two parents being able to provide the full measure of      security for their children that the law allows is clearly      not in the best interest of children. The best result for      children is the defeat of the Federal Marriage Amendment.       As demonstrated by census and other data, there are      literally hundreds of thousands of children whose parents are      gay or lesbian couples. According to the 2000 census, same-     sex couples are raising children in at least 96 percent of      all counties in the U.S. These children go to school, play in      sports, sing in choirs, go to worship services, play at the      beach, get hugs from their parents and grandparents--and get      sick--just like children of opposite-sex couples or single      parents. And when these children are sick, their parents come      to doctor visits together, take time off from work to stay      home with the sick child, worry about paying the medical      bills, and if serious enough, stay at the hospital together      with their child, take turns holding an oxygen mask or      meeting with doctors and nurses.       Whether the problem is as medically simple as a bad cold or      a broken finger or as serious as leukemia or a life-     threatening heart condition, a child's illness or injury      strains both the child and his or her parents. No parents who      are already under the emotional stress of caring for their      sick or injured child should also have to worry about whether      the Constitution will deprive their child of the benefits of      both parents being able to provide health insurance, take      time off from work to care for their child, authorize medical      care, or stay with their child in the hospital. Adding to the      worries of already strained parents is simply wrong.       The American Academy of Pediatrics has found that ``a      considerable body of professional literature provides      evidence that children with parents who are homosexual can      have the same advantages and the same expectations for      health, adjustment, and development as can children whose      parents are heterosexual. When two adults participate in      parenting a child, they and the child deserve the serenity      that comes with legal recognition.''       We urge you to find ways to make the lives of all children      happier, healthier, and safer. There are lots of good ideas,      and good legislation, to meet these goals. But the Federal      Marriage Amendment will do the opposite. It will make the      lives of children more difficult and make the assurance of      the best health care a broken promise. We strongly urge you      to protect children by defeating the Federal Marriage      Amendment.

Republicans are getting their arms vigorously twisted by      the religious right. They have begun threatening the      Republicans that they will stay home in November if progress      is not made on banning abortion, same-sex marriage and flag      burning.       A poll conducted in March by four groups representing      evangelical Christians found that 63 percent of so-called      ``values voters''--the evangelicals who oppose abortion and      same-sex marriage--believe that, in the words of the poll,      ``Congress has not kept its promises to act on a pro-family      agenda.''       So, between now and November, you can expect to see these      ``values'' issues trotted out by Republicans in Congress to      convince the religious right they are still on their side.       It's not like the GOP has anything else to run on. They      can't run on national security, not with Iraq in a bloody      civil war. They can't run on ethics, not with the growing      list of indictments filed against GOP members of Congress.      They can't run on the economy, not with $3 a gallon gasoline,      rising interest rates and stagnant wage growth.       No, all they have left is the hope that voter turnout will      be low and the most extreme members of their constituency      will show up to vote.       Mid-term elections are usually decided by turnout, and      usually only the most motivated voters from each party show      up on Election Day. While pandering to religious extremists      may seem like a smart short-term strategy, in the long term,      it alienates the rest of the population.       Given the bigger issues facing this nation--out-of-control      energy and health care costs, the criminally slow response to      the Gulf Coast's plight after Katrina, the lack of an exit      strategy from Iraq, the threat of another war in Iran and a      president who shows no respect for the rule of law--arguing      about flag burning and gay marriage is ridiculous.       But that's the legislative agenda that the Republicans are      working on. Even though the gay marriage ban has no chance of      receiving the required two-thirds majority which will move      the proposed amendment to the states to ratify, the goal is      to get both houses to vote on it next month. Likewise for      flag burning and more restrictions on abortions.       In short, the GOP would rather devote its energies to      pointless and divisive legislation than address the real      problems facing the nation.       We do not think this is not going to work this November.       As weapons, the powers of fear and divisiveness, the two      biggest guns in the GOP arsenal, are no longer as powerful as      they were in 2002 or 2004. More and more Americans, liberals      and conservatives alike, are on to the Republican game. This      growing awareness that the GOP has nothing going for it other      than fear and divisiveness may lead to big victories for      Democrats in November. And Republicans will only have      themselves to blame.                                  ____              [From the Rutland (VT) Herald, June 6, 2006]                           The Bully's Pulpit       George Bush is a bully and a coward.       How else to explain this weekend's performance by the      president, who used his weekly radio address to push for a      constitutional amendment banning gay marriage?       His cowardice is long established, from using his family's      influence to duck military service during Vietnam to hiding      behind underlings while in the Oval Office. He's never seen a      fair fight he can't run from or pay someone else to fight for      him.       Now he's beaten down in the polls, with both his foreign      and domestic policy initiatives in tatters, already a lame      duck and staring at a legacy as a war president during a      losing fight. His next-best shot at being remembered by      history is as the president who single-handedly bankrupted      the country, going from a surplus to record deficits almost      overnight.       So what did Bush do? What any schoolyard bully does when      they feel threatened: He picked on someone he perceives as an      easy target.       In this case, the target is gay marriage. While the country      is generally more accepting of homosexuals than it was a      generation ago, there is still a taboo against using the word      marriage to define homosexual relationships.       The GOP used the same gay-bashing tactic to get out the      vote in the last election, and their strategists are clearly      banking on a repeat performance to revitalize support for the      president, and for the party headed into     the fall elections. Bill Frist, the Senate majority leader,      claimed an amendment is needed to protect the other 49 states      from Massachusetts' recognition of gay marriage in an opinion      piece released over the weekend.       Oddly, the tactic may backfire on the GOP. While the states      that have voted on defining marriage as the union of a man      and a woman have been unanimous in supporting the measures,      using the Constitution as a tool must strike many as a large,      blunt instrument.       Amending the Constitution is not easy; it is not meant to      be so. That choice by the framers, reinforced through the      centuries, makes rational people pull back from cheap      grandstanding with this nation's most-cherished document. And      the latest move is nothing if not a grandstand play.       In fact, true conservatives may find themselves in conflict      over whether cheapening the importance of a constitutional      amendment is too steep a price to pay, seeing as the country      already has the Defense of Marriage Act, which already does      what the amendment promises. And they must despair at seeing      a raid on states' rights, a conservative touchstone.       But surely, surely the move must backfire in Vermont. Any      candidate who does not immediately and publicly renounce a      constitutional amendment against gay marriage will alienate      the state's open-minded middle of the road, as well as its      substantial liberal population. But any candidate who opposes      the amendment will alienate the right wing of the Republican      Party. So Bush and Frist have put moderates into a tough      spot.       Regardless, it is time for Vermont's candidates in this      fall's election to stand up and be counted on the issue. No      ducking or excuses, please.       Martha Rainville and Richard Tarrant are running as      moderate Republicans; it is their party's leadership that has      put the issue on the table; it is their time to speak. They      both say they are independent thinkers in the Vermont      tradition, who will not simply repeat the party line.       Now they can prove that claim or they can follow the lead      of their boss, the coward. It's a clear, if not simple,      choice.  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.
