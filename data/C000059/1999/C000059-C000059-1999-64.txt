Speaker, I rise today to introduce the Social Security Number Confidentiality Act of 1999. In a time of increasingly easier access to personal information by people other than the owner of that information, ``Identity Theft'' is becoming more and more of a problem.  Given this significant problem, I found it alarming to learn from senior citizens in my district that the Social Security Administration openly displays a recipient's Social Security number, name and address in the window of the envelope. This same envelope makes its way through the United States Postal system.  By simply taking a quick peek in a mailbox, or in a pile of mail left in a person's car, anyone could obtain the information needed to steal someone's identity. The open display of such private and confidential information is an invitation for scam artists to rip off our senior citizens.  As I investigated this situation, I found that the Social Security Administration knowingly continues this practice. At the same time they advocate the need to keep Social Security numbers confidential.  Ironically, in the July/August issue of Social Security Today, the agency advises us that, ``All the information Social Security collects about you is kept confidential: it's protected by law,'' and reminds us to ``protect your Social Security number. Be careful how you use it and keep it confidential whenever possible.''  Mr. Speaker, this is a glaring inconsistency that requires immediate attention. My legislation will prohibit the appearance of Social Security numbers on or through the window of unopened Social Security checks. It will allow the Social Security Administration to practice what they preach--that we all need to be careful and keep our Social Security numbers private and confidential. In all fairness, the checks are printed by the Department of Treasury, and my legislation will direct them to change their procedures.  In closing, I ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in supporting the Social Security Number Confidentiality Act of1999. This important legislation protects our senior citizens from scam artists and maintains the privacy and confidentiality of our Social Security numbers.                          ____________________
