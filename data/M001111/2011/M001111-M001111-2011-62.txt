Res. 214       Whereas the National Association for Music Education has      designated the week of June 24 through 28, 2011, as      ``National Music Education Week'';       Whereas school-based music education is important and      beneficial for students of all ages;       Whereas music education programs enhance intellectual      development and enrich the academic environment for students      of all ages;       Whereas 3 out of every 4 Americans have participated in      music education programs, including chorus groups and formal      instrument lessons, during their time in school;       Whereas of those who have participated in school-based      music education programs, 40 percent stated that such      programs were extremely influential in contributing to their      current level of personal fulfillment;       Whereas music education provides students with the      opportunity to express their creativity and to develop skills      that will benefit them throughout the rest of their lives;       Whereas the skills gained through music instruction,      including discipline and the ability to analyze, solve      problems, communicate, and work cooperatively, are vital for      success in the 21st century workplace;       Whereas many students have limited access to music      education, which places them at a disadvantage compared to      their peers;       Whereas local budget cuts are predicted to lead to a      significant curtailment of school music programs, thereby      depriving millions of students of an education that includes      music;       Whereas the arts are a core academic subject, and music is      an essential element of the arts; and       Whereas every student in the United States should have an      opportunity to reap the benefits of music education: Now,      therefore, be it       Resolved, That the Senate designates the week of June 24      through 28, 2011, as ``National Music Education Week'' in      order to recognize the benefits and importance of music      education.
