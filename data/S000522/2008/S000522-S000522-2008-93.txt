Madam Speaker, I submit the following:  Requesting Member: Rep. Christopher H. Smith  Bill Number: HR 2638.  Account: Research, Development, Test and Evaluation, Defense-wide Account.  Legal Name of Requesting Entity: the Gallo Prostate Cancer Center, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey.  Address of Requesting Entity: Cancer Institute of New Jersey, 195 Little Albany & Somerset St., Room 2002, Newark, NJ 08901-1998.  Description of Request: Funding support is requested for key projects for the Cancer Institute of New Jersey to address national goal of eradicating cancer, including prostate cancer which is the second leading cause of cancer death in American men. Our proposed initiatives are The Dean and Betty Gallo Prostate Cancer Center, which seeks to eradicate prostate cancer through research, treatment, education and prevention; the Center for Imaging, Structures and Function, which will provide state of the art image analysis crucial to the overall applications of cancer research; a Center for Cancer Bioinformatics, which combines theoretical biology, computer science, mathematics and physics with cancer research expertise; the LIFE Center, which coordinates efforts in the eradication of breast cancer; and our plans to merge and enhance the radiation oncology capabilities to create a unified, academically and clinically strong program for the citizens of New Jersey.  By targeting breast and prostate cancer, through developing novel cancer bioinformatics approaches to identify new biomarkers for therapy and prevention and through developing new technologies and approaches in molecular imaging, computational, informatics and systems biology, this project will contribute to the national goals of the elimination of death and suffering from cancer and to the enhanced discovery, development and delivery of novel means of cancer diagnosis, prevention and treatment.
