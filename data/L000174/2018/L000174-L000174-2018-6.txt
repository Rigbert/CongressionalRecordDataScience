President, I know that Senator Jeff Flake believes, as I do, that the Senate at its best can be the conscience of our Nation. Lately, I believe the Senate has been less than that. In the closing months of his tenure in the Senate, however, Senator Flake has spoken about his hopes for this body and for our Nation. What is more, throughout his tenure, he has on many occasions reached across the aisle to bridge the partisan divide for the good of the Nation.  When I first approached Senator Flake about joining me in visiting Cuba, he was willing to come with an open mind. He recognized the failure of the continuing U.S. embargo, and his partnership helped us create a new path forward that culminated in the release of Alan Gross, an American long imprisoned in Cuba, and restored diplomatic relations between our two countries. The few minutes on the tarmac in Cuba while we waited to bring Mr. Gross back home after 5 years in captivity are some of the most meaningful minutes of my life. Senator Flake's partnership helped lead to that moment.  While the release of Alan Gross was the most dramatic event in U.S.-Cuban relations in a generation, Senator Flake has also partnered with me on initiatives to encourage Cuban entrepreneurs, open Cuban markets to American farmers and agriculture, and boost the Cuban Government's respect for human rights. His assistance from across the aisle has been helpful in shining light on the more than 50 years of failed policy toward this small island neighbor.  I have also watched with admiration Jeff's commitment of the last month in protecting one of the most pivotal national security investigations in our Nation's history--the special counsel's investigation into Russian interference in our elections. The security and sanctity of our elections is a cornerstone of our democracy. As he rounds out this chapter of his career, Senator Flake's stance and insistence that the Senate act to protect the work of the special counsel has been laudable.  I will be sad to see Senator Flake leave, and the Senate will be losing anindependent voice willing to pursue bipartisan progress. That is a voice that is needed now more than ever. I will miss working with my friend here in the Senate, and Marcelle and I wish Jeff and Cheryl all the best as they begin a new chapter.                          ____________________
