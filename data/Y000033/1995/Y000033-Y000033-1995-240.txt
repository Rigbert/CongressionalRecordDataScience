Mr. Chairman, I am so impressed that the gentleman from Ohio has made me accept his amendment with great happiness and joy. It makes great sense. We should have put it in to begin with, and I thank the gentleman for offering it.  Mr. Chairman, we do accept the amendment.                              {time}  1530
