Sanders], and your people are very lucky to have you as their Representative, for sure. I am sure you are as distraught as I am that people like ourselves receive phone calls from the administration, whether it is this administration or the prior administration, anytime we try to question when the big interests are able to get special access at the U.S. Treasury Department or at the Federal Reserve, it is amazing to me how quickly the administration responds.  So, for example, if it Mattel Corp. or the Big Three or some of the big investment houses stand to lose anything, right away they get invited over to the Fed. They get welcomed. In fact, we were called by the Treasury Department very concerned about our saying anything about this whole question of the peso bailout here in Congress today. Yet when we tried to call them over a year ago and tried to get them interested and get the administration interested in workers across this country who would lose their jobs, they would not even come over and meet with us.  We wanted to put provisions in NAFTA to pay the kind of attention that is being paid to the investment community to the workers of our country, and we were given short shrift. In fact, we were not even welcomed into 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, those of us concerned about what is happening to workers across this country. Yet we know there has been one factory a day closed in this country as a result of NAFTA.  We have a list in our office of thousands and thousands of U.S. workers losing their jobs, 50 jobs here, and in Horsham, PA, 40-some workers who used to make bridal and bridesmaids gowns, at Alfred Angelo Co., in Bennington, VT, your home State.
