President, today is the day before the departure of Capitol Hill Chief of Police Terry Gainer, a man who has served us so well.  I have known Terry Gainer for almost 20 years. He served as superintendent of the Illinois State Police and left that position to become one of the leading officers in the District of Columbia Police Force. He was then asked to become chief of the Capitol Police Force. I knew that the people making that decision had made a very fine choice. Chief Gainer proved me right.  Terry Gainer grew up in Illinois, served his country in Vietnam, returned from that war a decorated veteran. His service did not end when he left the military. Prior to his position with the Illinois State Police, he spent 16 years with the Chicago Police Department. With his extensive experience at the highest levels of police work, his reputation for professionalism and his tireless commitmentto the security of our Nation's most honored building and those who visit and work within it, Terry Gainer brought the Capitol Police Force to a new level of professionalism.  In the words of one of their officers, Chief Gainer transformed the Capitol Police Force from an inside operation, where the officers were often viewed many times as security guards, to a well-known, highly visible, professional law enforcement team. That change took place at a critical moment in our Nation's history. The threat of terrorism became very real and the vulnerability of the building in which I speak became very obvious. Today, the well-trained group of men and women protecting our security today in this hallowed building are among the finest in the Nation, and we are extremely fortunate to have them.  As a Member of the Senate whose life was made safer because of Chief Terry Gainer's leadership, I am indebted to him for his singular service to Congress and to our country. The Gainer legacy on Capitol Hill is written in a police force proud of its mission and committed to serve and protect. Chief Gainer deserves the gratitude of the Capitol family for his fine service. He will be missed.
