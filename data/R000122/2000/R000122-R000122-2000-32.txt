President, I thank the Senator for his gracious cooperation. This would increase the money we are committing to the weatherization program so that we could, in fact, provide more assistance to low-income homes to weatherize their homes, both to protect themselves in the cold of winter and the heat of summer. It would also make, we hope, the Nation less dependent on foreign sources of energy. It is an excellent proposal and program.  I thank the Senator for his cooperation.  Mr. President, I yield back my time and ask for a voice vote on the measure.
