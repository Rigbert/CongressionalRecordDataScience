President, this is a great date in the history not only of the United States, but of all free people, and of all people who would be free. On September 17, 1787, a small group of truly remarkable Americans gathered to sign one of the greatest documents in all of human history, the Constitution of the United States.  George Washington signed it as the President of the Constitutional Convention and deputy from Virginia. The names of other signers are familiar to all Americans: Benjamin Franklin, James Madison and Alexander Hamilton. Other names should be more familiar than they are, names like Morris and Pinkney and Dickinson and Rutledge.  We owe them a great debt. They have given us a firm foundation on which has been built our great and abiding stability. Even when this Nation was torn by a terrible fight over the institution of slavery, the Constitution allowed us to recover with amazing speed, become one Nation again, and avoid the generations of smoldering conflict that afflict so many other countries.  Our Constitution is at once solid and flexible. It can and has been amended from time to time to improve the machinery of government and to expand the rights that citizens enjoy. Throughout our history we have sought to follow Madison's wise advice to limit amendments to ``certain great and extraordinary occasions.''  In Federalist No. 43, James Madison wrote that the Constitution establishes a balanced system for amendment, guarding ``equally against that extreme facility, which would render the Constitution too mutable, and that extreme difficulty, which might perpetuate its discovered faults.'' The Constitution is profoundly conservative, in the best sense of that word. As Madison expressed in Federalist No. 49:       [A]s every appeal to the people would carry an implication      of some defect in government, frequent appeals would, in      great measure, deprive the government of that veneration      which time bestows on everything and without which perhaps      the wisest and freest governments would not possess the      requisite stability.  It is remarkable that although some 11,000 constitutional amendments have been offered in our history, and more than 100 in the 105th Congress alone, the elected representatives in Congress and in the States have adopted only 17 since the original Bill of Rights. We have rejected many amendments that seemed to be good ideas at the time, but which on further reflection proved to be unnecessary. We have found that we could achieve the same results by statute, or have on sober reflection recognized that the amendments would have been mere symbolic gestures. We have avoided turning the Constitution into a mere bulletin board on which we ``send a message.'' We have respected it and, most importantly, we have resisted the temptation to limit the fundamental freedoms of Americans. We have rejected the temptation to erode the Bill of Rights.  I cannot ignore the fact that Congress and the States did succumb once to what looked like a good idea without carefully considering the consequences of their action. The eighteenth amendment imposed prohibition and conjured up a swarm of gangsters, bootlegging, and wholesale disobedience of the law. It was a bad idea that had to be undone by another constitutional amendment. We should regard the eighteenth amendment as a reminder that we should go slow, and stop and consider carefully all of the implications of any change before we put it in the Constitution.  I submit that the Constitution of the United States is a good document--not a sacred text--but as good a law as has been written. That is why it has survived as the supreme law of the land with so few alterations throughout the last 200 years.  It has contributed to our success as a Nation by binding us together, rather than tearing us apart. It contains the Great Compromise that allowed small States and large States to join together in a spirit of mutual accommodation and respect. It embodies the protections that make real the pronouncements in our historic Declaration of Independence and give meaning to our inalienable rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.  The Constitution requires due process and guarantees equal protection ofthe law. It protects our freedom of thought and expression, our freedom to worship or not as we each choose, and our political freedoms, as well. It is the basis for our fundamental right of privacy and for limiting government's intrusions and burdens in our lives.  I oppose what I perceive to be a growing fascination with laying waste to our Constitution and the protections that have served us well for over 200 years. The First Amendment, separation of powers and power of the purse should be supported and defended.  When we embarked in this Congress, we each swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution. That is our duty to those who forged this great document, our responsibility to those who sacrificed to protect and defend our Constitution, our commitment to our constituents and our legacy to those who will succeed us.  The Framers gave us a remarkable document, an extraordinary system of government and protections for our individual liberties. So I celebrate this day, not with the parades or fireworks of the Fourth of July, but with solemn consideration of how the Framers guaranteed our freedom through checks on government power. Most of all, I mark this day with a renewed commitment to cherish and to protect this most precious of legacies, to resist easy amendments, to resist assaults on our Bill of Rights, and to preserve the Constitution for our children and grandchildren.                          ____________________
