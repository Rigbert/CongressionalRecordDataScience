 Speaker, common sense would dictate, is it not far more difficult to regulate the vegetables or the beef or pork that are raised on farms and ranches, what pesticides are they using, who knows, it is very difficult to regulate, but it is okay to import that product into the United States. But when you have prescription drugs manufactured in the United States and approved by the FDA, sent to Canada, approved by their regulatory system, all of a sudden we cannot regulate it. On the surface it is absurd and laughable, and anyone who makes that case should be laughed out of this institution.
