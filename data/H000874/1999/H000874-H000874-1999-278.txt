Speaker, I want to congratulate the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cummings) and thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Scarborough) who explained this bill. It is hard for me to thank Mr. Nesterczuk, but I want to do that--I say that facetiously--for his efforts on this legislation as well. This obviously is a position that our Federal employees found themselves in not through their own fault but through the administrative oversight of their employer. Obviously we ought to act to make them whole. I appreciate the action of the committee.
