President, at the conclusion of this year, we will bid farewell to a Senator who is larger than life, both literally and figuratively.  Fred Thompson, may chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, and my food friend, will be leaving the Senate after 8 years of distinguished service.  While there is no question that the people of Tennessee would have returned him to the Senate for another term had he chosen to seek it, Fred decided that there is life after the Senate--and if the past is prologue, we can be sure that it will be an interesting life.  Fred came to this body after a varied and distinguished career. He had been a prominent public servant--most notably as an assistant U.S. attorney and as the Republican counsel to the Watergate committee--as well as a skilled lawyer and a gifted actor. From his days with Senators Howard Baker and Sam Ervin in the Watergate hearings, to his role in exposing the sale of pardons in the State of Tennessee, to hisacting in 18 films, Fred brought a keen intellect, a great sense of humor, and an exceptional capacity for hard work to every task. And those are the very characteristics that have marked his Senate service.  Fred has been a leader in the Senate on a wide variety of critical issues, including intelligence reform and oversight, reducing the threat posed by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and reducing the tax burden on American families. He was among the first to join Senators McCain and Feingold in the quest for campaign finance reform and fairly and effectively chaired extensive hearings to expose the abuses in the financing of the 1996 Presidential campaign.  As chairman and later ranking Republican on the Governmental Affairs Committee, his efforts have led to management and regulatory reforms as well as the passage of the legislation to create the new Department of Homeland Security.  In the 6 years that I have worked closely with Fred, I have never known him to be unprepared. I have never known him to be undisciplined. And I have never known him to be anything less than eloquent--although, as a Yankee, I may not always appreciate the subtlety of his colloquial expressions. Two examples that I recall with special fondness are: ``Don't load up the wagon unless you're willing to pay the freight,''--which is, I believe, a reference to spending proclivities--and then, my personal favorite: ``It's like teaching a pig to dance. It wastes your time, and it irritates the pig.  Of course, Fred is much more than just quotable. Fred is a truly courageous leader. He actually relishes being in the minority, even a tiny minority, when one of his basic principles, such as States rights and the 10th amendment, is at issue. He always votes his convictions--even when the current polls suggest that public sentiment is on the other side. His good judgment and his careful consideration of every issue are a model for all of us. Fred's fearless leadership is one of many reasons why his constituents, even those who may disagree with him, hold him in such high regard. They know that Fred Thompson will speak the truth and do with it right, that he will make the hard choices, and that the well being of his constituents and our country guides his every decision.  No one can be certain what the future will hold for Fred. We know that he has already drawn on two of his previous careers--the law and acting--by signing on to play the avuncular district attorney on the popular television show, ``Law and Order.'' It also seems very likely that he will have future responsibilities in Government, since I anticipate that this President will seek to use his extraordinary talents.  But no matter what Fred Thompson's post-Senate career may entail, one conclusion can be stated with confidence. He has graced this institution and served his Nation well. I feel so fortunate to have served with him during these past 6 years, and I shall miss him.  Godspeed, my friend.                             TIM hutchinson  Mr. President, I rise this morning to pay tribute to my colleague and good friend from Arkansas, Senator Tim Hutchinson.  I have particularly enjoyed working with Tim on the Senate HELP Committee. We have literally worked ``shoulder to shoulder'' both in committee and on the Senate floor on many issues of tremendous importance to the health and well-being of all Americans--the Patients' Bill of Rights, legislation to increase access to more affordable prescription drugs, home health care, increased funding for diabetes research, and legislation to increase access to health care in the rural and underserved areas of our country.  Tim demonstrated his ability to reach across the aisle and work on a bipartisan basis when he joined with Senator Mikulski in developing legislation to address our Nation's growing shortage of registered nurses. I was pleased to join as an original cosponsor of the Nurse Reinvestment Act, which has been signed into law, and which will address this problem by providing incentives for individuals to enter the nursing profession, providing continuing education and opportunities for advancement within the profession, and increasing the number of nurse faculty to teach at our nursing schools.  Senator Hutchinson has also been a leader and an advocate for our men and women in uniform, and I have been honored to serve with him on the Senate Armed Forces Committee. As the ranking member on the personnel subcommittee, he has seen to the needs of the soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines time and time again. He has fought to ensure that the men and women serving our country receive adequate pay and compensation, and this year he went to the mat to support our military retirees on concurrent receipt/special compensation.  In January 2000, I traveled with Senator Hutchinson to Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan where we got an update on the region and had an opportunity to meet with many troops there. In particular, Senator Hutchinson spent a lot of time speaking with our troops who were serving proudly on the front line of the DMZ. In Korea, it was the dead of winter, and the meeting rooms in South Korea actually straddled the DMZ line.  On that trip we also visited the U.S.S. Kitty Hawk in Japan, where I found that Senator Hutchinson had a special place in his heart for our naval forces. We also made history when we met with the first democratic president of Taiwan--President Lee.  Senator Hutchinson has always taken the time to listen to our troops and military leaders, as he was always looking for ways that he could make a positive difference for these young men and women proudly serving our country. Senator Hutchinson will be greatly missed, but his legacy and accomplishments will remain in our history forever.                             Fred Thompson
