President, I rise today to introduce a bill that will give consumers important information many will want to factor into their decisions when they shop for a new vehicle. My legislation will ensure that consumers have the information they need to compare the pollution emissions of new vehicles. The Automobile Emissions Consumer Information Act of 1999 simply takes data already collected by the Environmental Protection Agency and requires that this information be presented to consumers in an understandable format as they purchase cars. This proposal, if enacted into law, will benefit both the consumer and the environment.  This measure is modeled after existing requirements for gas mileage information. It ensures that emissions information will be on the window stickers of new cars just as fuel efficiency information is currently displayed. Additionally, emissions information for all new vehicles will be published by the EPA in an easy-to-understand booklet for consumers.  This information is already collected by the EPA, but is disseminated in an extremely burdensome way. First, consumers must pro-actively request emissions information. Then, after securing the relevant EPA documents, the consumer is presented with an overload of complicated data in spreadsheet form. Furthermore, the EPA organizes emissions data by engine type and not by the more commonly compared model and make categories.  Let me refer to a page from the EPA's 1999 Annual Certification Test Results of emission standards. As my colleagues can see, it is an extraordinarily difficult document to read and interpret. The complicated nature of this document becomes increasingly apparent when this table is compared with the simplified information currently provided to consumers about fuel mileage. The federal government should be aiding consumers who want to consider emissions in choosing which vehicle to purchase. This bill will do just that.  Mr. President, this is not a new idea. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970 mandated that the EPA make available to the public the data collected from manufacturers on emissions. The 1970 Amendments further required, ``Such results shall be described in such nontechnical manner as  will responsibly disclose to prospective ultimate purchasers of new motor vehicles and new motor vehicle engines the comparative performance of the vehicles and engines tested.'' Mr. President, clearly, the EPA is not abiding by the letter and spirit of the 1970 law.  It is important to note that the Automobile Emissions Consumer Information Act of 1999 does not require either motor vehicle manufacturers or the EPA to conduct new tests. Manufacturers must already test emissions of all new vehicles and submit the test results to the EPA. Unfortunately, the gathering of this information does not translate into useful information for consumers.  While all vehicles must meet the Federal standards, some vehicles exceed the standards. Consumers who are concerned about vehicle emissions deserve to be able to exercise their right to buy from manufacturers who take extra steps in reducing emissions, if they so chose.  Representative Brian Bilbray of California is introducing this bill in the House of Representatives today. I greatly appreciate his leadership on this issue and his bringing this common-sense proposal to my attention. He is clearly committed to protecting both consumers and the environment.  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in enacting the Automobile Emissions Consumer Information Act, and I ask unanimous consent that one page from the EPA's 1999 Annual Certification Test Results of emissions standards be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                  CERTIFICATION AND FUEL ECONOMY INFORMATION SYSTEM (CFEIS), 1999 ANNUAL CERTIFICATION TEST RESULTS, ALL SALES AREA--LIGHT DUTY VEHICLES AND LIGHT DUTY TRUCKS                     [Manufacturer: 20; DaimlerChrysler; Engine Family/Test Group: XCRXA0318H11; Engine System: 1; Evaporative/Refueling Family: RXE0174G4H; Evap System: 1]------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                            Emission    Eng.
