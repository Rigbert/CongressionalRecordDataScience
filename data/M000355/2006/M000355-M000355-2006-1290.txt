 President, we are about to have the cloture vote, and it is going to take a minute to thank Senator Specter and Senator Leahy for this extraordinary compliment from the New York Times. I do not think it is an experience the Senator from Kentucky has ever had.  This cloture vote is going to be approved. We learned about an hour ago that the Democratic leader has decided to support the cloture vote, and I think that is good. We would prefer to have been on this bill last Friday. Senator Specter was here and ready to work, ready to process amendments last Friday. But here we are on Tuesday night.  So let me say I think it is good for the Senate that this cloture is going to be invoked. We are ready to get on the bill. I heard the Democratic leader offer to begin tomorrow. I think that is a good idea. Senator Specter will be here in the hopes that amendments will be offered and processed. We are prepared to deal with that tomorrow and through the days until we can reach a point of conclusion.  So, Mr. President, I do not know how much time I have remaining, but so that we may move forward and vote, I am prepared to yield back the remainder of my time.
