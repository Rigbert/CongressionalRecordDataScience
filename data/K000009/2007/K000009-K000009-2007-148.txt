Formally incorporated following elections in November of 1957, Oregon celebrates its 50th anniversary in 2007.  Oregon, located on the Western Bay of Lake Erie, was once part of Northwest Ohio's Great Black Swamp. Cultivated for its trees and rich earth, its first government--Oregon Township--was formed in 1838. It is bounded by the City of Toledo to the West, Lake Erie to the North, Wood County to the South, and Jerusalem Township to the East.  Through the 1800s and 1900s, water and rail systems developed in the region. Northwest Ohio is a cornerstone of water, rail, and surface transportation, and Oregon is at its hub. As a result of its location, its two largest employers built and remain in Oregon: Sun Oil and BP refineries. Oregon continued to grow as an industrial center of the region, with several chemical plants and energy generating facilities. Industrialization brought residential and commercial growth, and Oregon thrives.  Throughout its earlier years of growth, its Western neighbor Toledo tried to annex Oregon Township. Annexation attempts failed, but so, too, did early attempts to incorporate Oregon on its own. In 1957 after another annexation attempt, the residents of Oregon voted overwhelmingly to incorporate as the City of Oregon.  Oregon's own residents coined the slogan ``City of Opportunity'' in 1958 shortly after adopting the City Charter. Indeed Oregon lives up to its slogan. The City is home to Maumee Bay State Park--a jewel on our Western Lake Erie shoreline--as well as Pearson Metropark, South Shore Park, and Coontz Recreational Complex. Oregon is home to one of Ohio's largest festivals, the German American Festival, as well as its own Oregon Fest. The community is an urban mix of business, industrial, residential, recreational, educational and municipal ventures.  The City of Oregon is a vibrant community full of pride. Oregonians celebrate their past while moving toward the future. It is a City on the move. While recognizing the achievements of its first 50 years, Oregon is poised for the next 50. Onward!                          ____________________
