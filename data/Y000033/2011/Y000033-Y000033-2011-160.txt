Mr. Speaker, over the course of many years, I have observed thework ethics, tenacity, and love of Alaska by a Pioneer of Alaska Aviation. Today, I stand in recognition and honor Mr. Cliff Everts.  Mr. Everts was an instructor for the predecessor of Alaska Airlines, Alaska Star Airlines. In 1945 he joined the team of Wien Alaska flying Boeing 247s and Lockheed Lodestars hauling fuel from Barrow to Umiat and after 15 years saw an opportunity to begin his first business experience. When Wien's business plan dropped fuel delivery, he purchased one of the C-46s and continued delivering fuel to Alaska's villages. Wien was lucky to keep Mr. Everts as one of their team until 1980 when he retired after 35 years and 30,000 hours in a cockpit.  Mr. Everts has flown at forty below temperatures, through dark days and nights, in snow, sleet, and rain, to supply the needs of village residents. He is a true Alaskan with a frontier spirit.  One of the most interesting adventures of Cliff was delivering 110 reindeer from Nome to Colorado so that people in the ``lower forty-eight'' could experience a Santa Clause sleigh ride. Somewhere today there are decedents of one of the escapees there in Colorado along with our Alaskan wolves!  Cliff also gave new meaning to ``when pigs fly'' when he delivered several dozen pigs in a C-46 from Ohio to Big Delta for a farm project.  As a committed Alaskan, he realized early the opportunity in our State and the value of our resources, our people, and our commodities. He purchased surplus equipment and resold or rented it. His renowned collection of planes with historical nose art, which are still flying today, is an example in recycling and honorable use of assets, when others may have disregarded them for lack of value.  Cliff has contributed to Alaska with the creation of more than one successful company; the leadership today exemplifies his integrity, values, commitment to community and family, and love for our State and Country. Cliff and his planes have provided fuel to villages and mines, while not only improving quality of life, but often saving life. Our State would be less today without you and Pioneers like him.  I rise today to congratulate Mr. Cliff Everts on this day as we place a plaque and memory in perpetuity on the East Ramp of the Fairbanks International Airport.                          ____________________
