Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Speaker be authorized to recognize motions for suspension of the rules tomorrow as though clause 1 of rule XV were in place. In other words, I'm asking for authority to have a suspension calendar tomorrow. Absent the unanimous consent, we would simply go to the Rules Committee and get a rule to do that.
