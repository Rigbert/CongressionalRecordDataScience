Chairman, if the gentleman had remained on the floor for a moment, I was going to direct a question to him, which is: Since the EPA has found it does not have legal authority to regulate these substances, why do we need to pass a law to prevent a law from being passed? Which I guess is what we are trying to do here. In case we wanted to ever consider a law to do this, we would say, Well, we already passed a law to prohibit that.  Because the EPA says they don't have the authority to do this, it is not going to happen. There was a petition filed. It was rejected. End of story.  With that, I reserve the balance of my time.
