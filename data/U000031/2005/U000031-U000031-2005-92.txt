Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Chairman, I have a trivia question for you. What automaker has the most vehicles that get a highway fuel economy of 30 miles per gallon or greater? I will give you a hint. They make 19 of the vehicles, and that is more than any other automaker.  Do you know who it is? General Motors.  What frustrates me about this debate is the misconception that CAFE standards are some Holy Grail that foreign manufacturers can get to, but domestic ones cannot. We do not need to micromanage our auto manufacturers. They are doing just fine. CAFE standards are being met and they are being exceeded virtually every single day.  But the more important work is finding real alternatives to gasoline-powered cars and developing them, for every dollar we force the auto companies to spend on the CAFE standards is a dollar they will not spend on hybrids, hydrogen fuel cell and other alternative fuel cell vehicles.  I am sick of hearing the same old debate. I want to get us to the point where we talk about which one of the new alternatives we are most excited about.  I urge you to defeat this used amendment and vote for a new car. Please defeat this amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
