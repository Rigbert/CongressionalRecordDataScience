  Today we are passing the Adoption Incentives Reauthorization Act of 2003. It is particularly appropriate that we are doing so during National Adoption Month. Since the original Adoption Incentives Act was passed in 1997, the number of adoptions has doubled in 33 states. I am proud of this achievement and pleased that we are today continuing the authorization of this effective program.
