Con. Res. 78, a resolution regarding Saddam Hussein. Following the vote, the Senate will be in a period of morning business with Senator Bennett being recognized for 45 minutes.  As announced last night, the Senate may also begin consideration of S. 270, the Texas low-level radioactive waste legislation; S. 414, the international shipping bill; or H.R. 2646, the A+ education bill.  Finally, as a reminder, the majority leader stated that all Senators should anticipate one or two rollcall votes during Monday's session of the Senate. Those would begin at approximately 5:30 p.m.  I thank all Senators for their attention, and I yield the floor.                          ____________________
