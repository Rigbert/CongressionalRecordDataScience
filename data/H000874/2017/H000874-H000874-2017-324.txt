Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas.  The gentleman refers to a fee that was levied, apparently, for a late filing of a financial disclosure statement that is required under the rules. We are troubled, however, by the fact that this is not a fee in the sense; it is a penalty for taking an action which is obviously directed toward proscribing that action, which we see as speech and transparency to the American people.  One of the things that concerns us most, Mr. Speaker, is that there appears to be no due process; that is to say, the Sergeant at Arms can make an individual determination as to whether or not the rule has been violated without any opportunity given to the Member to explain or deny the allegations that are made on which the fine would be based.
