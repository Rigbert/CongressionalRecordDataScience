 Just this morning the Washington Post reported that the Federal Trade Commission sued the Associates, a lending unit of Citigroup, for its predatory lending practices.  This is not just an occasional storefront operation. The growth of thesepredatory loans tells us we are dealing with a national phenomenon. This is what they said at the FTC about this group from Citigroup called Associates:       ``They hid essential information from consumers,      misrepresented loan terms, flipped loans [repeatedly offering      to consolidate debt into home loans] and packed optional fees      to raise the costs of the loans,'' said Jodie Bernstein,      director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection. The      practices, she said, ``primarily victimized . . . the most      vulnerable--hardworking homeowners who had to borrow to meet      emergency needs and often had no other access to capital.''  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this article from today's Washington Post be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From The Washington Post, March 7, 2001]                   FTC Sues Lending Unit of Citigroup                 associates accused of ``abusive'' acts                         (By Sandra Fleishman)       The Federal Trade Commission yesterday sued a recently      acquired arm of financial giant Citigroup Inc., accusing it      of deceiving often cash-strapped home-equity borrowers      through ``systematic and widespread abusive lending      practices.''       The case is the largest ever brought for abusive or      predatory lending by the FTC, the government's chief      consumer-protection agency. If the case is proven, the FTC      estimates that it could result in hundreds of millions of      dollars in refunds to tens or hundreds of thousands of      borrowers.       The suit filed in U.S. District Court in Atlanta names New      York-based Citigroup, CitiFinancial Credit Co. and the      acquired companies, Associates First Capital Corp. and      Associates Corp. of North America, collectively known as      Associates.       Associates, which specialized in loans to higher-risk      borrowers, was one of the nation's largest home-equity      lenders when Citigroup bought it in November for $31 billion.      It was then wrapped into the bank's CitiFinancial unit.       Yesterday's action was sought by consumer activists, who      for years labeled Associates as the worst predatory lender in      the country.       The FTC has been investigating Associates since at least      1998, when the company was a subsidiary of Ford Motor Co.      Ford eventually spun it off.       In a statement issued yesterday, Citigroup said, ``We      regret that we have been unable to resolve the FTC claims      regarding past practices of the Associates without      litigation.''       The statement also said: ``From the time we announced our      intent to acquire Associates, we indicated our full      commitment to resolve concerns that had been raised about      their business. To date, we have reached out to nearly a      half-million customers including every Associates home loan      customer, and we will continue these outreach efforts.''       According to the FTC suit, Associates' aggressive marketing      ``induced consumers to refinance existing debts into home      loans with high interest rates, costs and fees and to      purchase high-cost credit insurance.''       ``They hid essential information from consumers,      misrepresented loan terms, flipped loans [repeatedly offering      to consolidate debt into home loans] and packed optional fees      to raise the costs of the loans,'' said Jodie Bernstein,      director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection. The      practices, she said, ``primarily victimized . . . the most      vulnerable--hardworking homeowners who had to borrow to meet      emergency needs and often had no other access to capital.''       The suit seeks financial redress but doesn't specify an      amount, ``If all of the charges are proven [the amount] could      be much more than $500 million,'' Bernstein said. That number      is drawn from the Associates financial reports, which show      earnings of more than $500 million from 1995 to 1999 in      single-premium credit life insurance premiums alone.       Single-premium credit life insurance, which enrages      consumer groups, is paid upfront through a home loan, rather      than monthly.       Because such insurance was factored into the loans, it      added ``hundreds or thousands of dollars to consumers' loan      costs,'' and in many instances ran out years before the home      loan did, the FTC said. Credit life insurance is a way to      cover the borrower's loan payments in the case of death,      illness or loss or employment. But the FTC said Associates      employees did not always mention or explain products and      discouraged consumers from refusing them.       Federal and state regulators cleared the way for the      Citigroup-Associates merger last year despite consumer      groups' pleas that Citigroup first be required to agree to      specific steps to protect consumers.       Yesterday, consumer groups welcomed the FTC suit but sought      further action.       ``The FTC case backs up what we've been saying, that      Associates has been ripping off homeowners across the      country,'' said Maude Hurd, president of the Association of      Community Organizations for Reform Now.       Citigroup's stock closed yesterday at $48.63, up 38 cents,      on the New York Stock Exchange. John Wimsatt, who tracks      Citigroup for Friedman, Billings, Ramsey Group Inc., said      strong investor confidence in the company reflects      ``consensus estimates that it will earn about $15.8 billion''      in 2001 and the belief that the company, aware of the FTC      investigation, either put money into reserves to cover the      litigation ``or factored it into the purchase price.''       Most of the other 14 predatory lending cases the FTC has      brought since 1998 have been settled. One case still in      litigation involves Washington-based Capital City Mortgage      Corp.
