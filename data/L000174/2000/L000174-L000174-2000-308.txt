President, I must say that the Senator from Kentucky would probably like to do it at the same speed I would but we are both realists in this regard.  Mr. McCONNELL. I believe this will move us toward a completion, hopefully by early evening tomorrow.  Therefore, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all first-degree amendments to the pending bill must be filed at the desk by 3 p.m. on Wednesday.
