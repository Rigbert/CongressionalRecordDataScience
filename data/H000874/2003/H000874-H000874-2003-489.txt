 Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I doubt that. I have not had an opportunity to see that the Senate has even passed the partial birth abortion bill yet. If they have, we will take a look at it. The last I checked, there was an amendment put on the bill that would cause it to go to conference under regular order.
