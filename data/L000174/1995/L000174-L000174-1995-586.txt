President, I have listened to the recent proposals of several Republican Senators for deep cuts in our foreign assistance program. Some of these proposals do not mention cuts specifically, but that is the thinly veiled consequence of what they propose. We pride ourselves for our generosity, but our foreign assistance accounts for less than 1 percent of the total Federal budget. These proposals would cut that even further, with the deepest cuts in the funds that go to help the neediest people in the world.  I will speak at length on this subject in the coming weeks, but I wanted to talk briefly about what are talking about if these proposals gain support.  At the same time that Republicans are pushing for drastic reductions in aid to needy American children and families, they would have us turn our backs on people around the world who are even more desperate. Let me mention one example, that was described in the Washington Post on March 17.  Uganda, once a prosperous, peaceful country, was destroyed by Idi Amin in the 1970's. Today, the average yearly income is $170 per person, and as Uganda struggles to rebuild from civil war it is being destroyed from within again. One of every fifteen Ugandans is HIV positive. Half a million Ugandan children have lost a parent to AIDS. By 1998, 10,000 Ugandan children will have died from AIDS, and another 300,000 children will be infected.  In towns like Kakuuto with 70,000 residents, 30 percent of the people are either infected with HIV or already suffering from AIDS. There are 17,000 orphans in that town alone.  The article describes a typical girl who became the head of her family at the age of 13, when her mother died from AIDS. AIDS had already killed her father. She now cares for her four younger brothers and sisters.  In 1990 I went to Uganda, and I saw the devastation caused by AIDS. I saw the heroic efforts of people there, everyday people, trying to fight the epidemic, a battle they could not possibly win without the help of countries like ours.  The article goes on to describe similar stories in Kenya, where Father Angelo D'Agostino, a Jesuit priest and a personal friend of mine, founded a home in Nairobi for AIDS orphans. He gets calls seeking a home for 100 AIDS babies every month. He has room for only 80 children, many of whom watched their parents die.  Mr. President, there are more rescissions coming from the House, and there are proposals to cut the foreign assistance program. Meanwhile, in Africa there are 10 million people infected with HIV, and the number continues to climb. Close to a million and a half are children. Many of the HIV infections were spread by sexually transmitted diseases that are common wherever there is poverty. These diseases are common in our own country, but here we have the vaccines or medicines to cure them. There they do not, and they become HIV positive, and they die.  There is no cure for AIDS. Would those who would cut the meager funds we spend to fight AIDS in places like Uganda, or India where it is spreading like wildfire among a population of a billion people, have us seal our borders? Tell future generations of Americans that if they leave our shores they cannot return?  Mr. President, this is one of a dozen examples I could mention of what will happen if we cut these foreign assistance programs. It makes a great press release today. We might just as well be sentencing our children and grandchildren to death.  I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 17, 1995]   African AIDS Epidemic Creating a Society of Orphans--Hundreds of  Thousands of Children Left Parentless as Scourge Sweeps the Continent                          (By Stephen Buckley)       Kakuuto, Uganda.--Elizabeth Nakaweesi, 17, became head of      her household at 13.       In 1989, her mother died of AIDS. In 1991, AIDS killed her      father. That left Elizabeth to care for her four brothers and      sisters, now aged 10 to 15.       Instead of spending her days in school, she spends them      making straw mats and cultivating her family's half-acre of      banana trees. She makes $40 a year.       ``It is painful to have no parents,'' Elizabeth said      recently, sitting in her family's battered clay hut. ``If      they were here, they      [[Page S4693]]  would take care of us: we would have the      things we do not have.''       Nakaweesi's plight has become a familiar one in Africa,      where AIDS has left millions of children without parents and      has afflicted thousands of others who contracted the AIDS      virus through their mothers.       Statistics on the impact of AIDS among African children are      sketchy but nonetheless grim. UNICEF predicts that by 1999,      up to 5 million African children will have lost their mothers      to AIDS. Of the 9.5 million people in sub-Saharan Africa who      either have the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)--which      causes AIDS--or the disease itself, an estimated 1.3 million      are children.       AIDS has ravaged the continent in part because of cultural      mores that assent to men having simultaneous sexual      partnerships with more than one woman. Researchers also have      found that a high rate of nonfatal sexually transmitted      diseases among both genders has made Africans more vulnerable      to HIV.       AIDS specialists fear that the impact of the disease on      children will slash school enrollments, roll back gains in      infant morality rates and further tax family structures      already shattered by political and economic crises in many      African countries.       Uganda's AIDS crisis is among the most urgent in Africa, as      1.5 million of the nation's population of 17 million are HIV-     positive. An estimated 519,000 Ugandan children have lost at      least one parent to AIDS, and the government reports that by      1998 about 150,000 children will have died of it and another      300,000 will be infected.       ``What we have seen is staggering,'' said Omwony Ojwok,      director of the Uganda AIDS Commission. ``The families in      particular are simply at a breaking point. You have some      adults with 10 orphans in their house, plus their own      children. Eventually, you run out of adults to take care of      the children.''       The town of Kakuuto, three hours west of Kampala, has been      hit especially hard. An estimated 30 percent of its 70,000      residents are either HIV-positive or have AIDS. Relief      workers estimate that there are 17,000 orphans. Some are left      on their own, but many more live with grandparents who often      are too old to provide the economic '' and emotional security      of a mother and father.       Alandrena Nakabiito, 62, was left with six orphans, ages 5      to 13, when two relatives died of AIDS in the early 1990s.      Nakabiito, who reared four of her own children, said that she      never expected to be cast in this role.       ``I never thought of it,'' she said, waving her arms in her      dark, narrow, two-room hut. ``I built this small house for      myself.'' Now eight people, including Nakabiito's 72-year-old      sister, live there.       Nakabiito said she makes about $60 a year, adding that she      would work harder on her acre of land but age has drained her      strength. She digs only in the morning, resting in the      afternoon. The slight woman, whose hands bear scars of a hard      farm life, said she is especially sad that she cannot help      Lucky Nakkazi, the 13-year-old, with her studies. Lucy can go      to school only because the World Vision relief organization      pays fees for her and about 2,500 other orphans in Kakuuto.       ``I would try to help, but I have poor sight at night,''      Nakabiito said, referring to Lucy's school work.       Lucy attends Kakuuto Central Primary School, where      headmaster Kyeyune Gelazius said that 220 of his 450 students      have lost parents to AIDS. he predicts that within five      years, 75 percent of his students will be orphans. He said      that generally their attendance is sporadic and their      behavior disruptive and that they lag academically.       ``They don't get the attention they need at home,'' said      Gelazius, who has seen 11 relatives die of AIDS. ``Their      grandparents are usually too old, and the children don't      respect them.''       A study in neighboring Tanzania found that children who      have lost their mothers to AIDS ``have markedly lower      enrollment rates and, once enrolled, spend fewer hours in      school'' than youngsters with two parents, the World Bank      Research Observer reported. The same study concluded that by      2020 the AIDS death rate among children in Tanzania will have      cut primary and secondary-school enrollments by 14 and 22      percent, respectively.       Doctors also fear that AIDS will wipe out improvements in      infant mortality rates over the past decade. For now, the      rate remains stable, but a 1994 World Bank report on AIDS in      Uganda warned: ``Because of the large numbers of women      carrying the virus, there are increasing numbers of infants      and children infected. This together with the loss of mothers      due to AIDS will increase infant and child mortality      significantly.'' At the Kakuuto offices of Doctors of the      World, a medical relief group, AIDS program coordinator Fred      Sekyewa said babies born to mothers with AIDS have a 25 to 50      percent chance of being infected and that one in three      pregnant women examined here tests HIV-positive.       Sekyewa added that many women with AIDS have babies because      of cultural pressures. ``In African societies it is an      abomination for a woman to die without a child,'' he said.      ``A woman in her twenties who has AIDS will say, `I must have      a child now because I may die before I get the      opportunity.'''       In Nairobi, Kenya, hundreds of HIV-positive children die in      hospitals annually after being abandoned by their mothers.      Three years ago, the Rev. Angelo D'Agostino, a Jesuit priest,      founded a home in Nairobi for such children. A surgeon and      psychiatrist who taught at George Washington University for      14 years, D'Agostino said he gets calls from hospitals and      social workers seeking homes for 100 AIDS babies every month.       D'Agostino, 69, has taken in about 80 children. He said      that some have become healthy after receiving a steady diet      of nutritious meals and attention.       ``They were born with their mother's HIV antibodies, so      they initially tested positive. But they never got      infected,'' D'Agostino said. ``So after a while, they're      fine. But usually these kids die of malnutrition or something      else in a hospital; because they once tested positive,      everybody gives up on them.''       The priest said that his children, most of whom are under      5, often show the strains of losing their parents. They cry      for hours. They have nightmares. They stare into space.       ``They talk about seeing their parents die,'' D'Agostino      said. ``They talk about being alone with their 10- or 12-     year-old sibling.''       Elizabeth Nakaweesi understands their pain. The teenager      said she quit school in the sixth grade to care for her young      siblings after her parents' deaths because ``there was nobody      else to do it.''       Elizabeth's father, who died at 51, had collected taxes at      the local market. Her mother, who was 39, had cultivated      their plot of bananas, sweet potatoes and cassavas.       Sometimes, when crops are poor and her straw mats are not      selling, Nakaweesi must beg neighbors for help. She said that      without assistance from neighbors and World Vision--which      pays school fees, bought her a bicycle and provides other      necessities--she and brothers and sisters would not survive.       Elizabeth works hard to foster a spirit of family teamwork.      After her siblings return from school, everyone works in the      field before dinner. At supper time, one child fetches water.      Another finds firewood. Another picks bananas. Another puts      out bowls and eating utensils. Another does the cooking.       But the teenager knows that she cannot replace her parents.      When she tries to speak of them, tears will in her eyes. She      turns her face to the wall.       ``They must be mother and father now,'' said Grace Mayanja,      a staff worker with World Vision, referring to children in      Kakuuto left to raise siblings. ``But in their hearts,      they're still little girls.''                               ____________________
