Speaker, the gentleman pointed out under Ronald Reagan and George Bush what happened was, because we could not override the President's veto any more than you can override President Clinton's veto, and what happened from our perspective, I tell my friend, the gentleman from New York, is that the Democratic Congress accommodated President Reagan and President Bush on issues on which there was strong feeling on this side, on which the President said he will not sign a bill if it has, for instance, pregnancy termination rights, which was one of the issues on which there was deep difference.  We accommodated the President. Why? Because we could not override the veto, and there was no intent to shut down the Government. I understand what the gentleman is saying. I understand the purpose of this rule, and I understand that it if goes forward, perhaps we could have movement.
