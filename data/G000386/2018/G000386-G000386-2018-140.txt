 President, I just need 1 minute because all of my colleagues are waiting to speak now.  For the benefit of the Senator from Texas, I wish to just say one thing. I don't question that he accurately quoted the union leader at the Philadelphia refinery, but I also, maybe within the last 2 weeks, read a statement by the so-called president--and I believe it is the same person whom we are talking about--that RINs were not an issue.  The other thing that I would add just for clarification of what the Senator said, that nobody has offered any relief, I have offered to make two offers. One of them would be the Reid vapor pressure thing, the issue connected with E15--that could be done by a regulation out of EPA--and also transparency to make sure the markets work.  I thank the Senator from Texas for his consideration of my effort to get Secretary Northey confirmed. I am sorry that he has objected, but that is the way the Senate can work and will work, and we will have to keep working to get Secretary Northey confirmed.  I thank my colleagues for their patience.
