 President, I rise today to honor the long and exemplary service of Washington State University (WSU) President Samuel H. Smith and his wife Pat Smith.  Samuel Smith has served as President of WSU since July of 1985, and he will be retiring at the end of the month.  Under Dr. Smith's leadership, the University has prospered. During his tenure, he strengthened the undergraduate and graduate curricula and worked to increase opportunities for women and minorities.  As a result of President Smith's work, many programs at WSU have received national and worldwide recognition.  President Smith deserves special honor for expanding the number of people who benefit from the University's educational system and for bringing education at WSU into the Information Age.  Dr. Smith established branch campuses of WSU in Vancouver, the Tri-Cities, and in Spokane, opening the doors of higher education to an even greater number of Washingtonians.  These branch campuses serve transition communities, helping people build the skills and training they need to succeed in today's workplace. Their lives are improving thanks to Dr. Smith's vision.  Dr. Smith was also instrumental in expanding educational opportunities to remote areas through WSU's innovative distance-learning programs.  One of the clearest examples of the way WSU has grown during Dr. Smith's tenure is the fact that more than one-third of all WSU graduates in the University's history were granted degrees by President Smith.  Dr. Smith has also been a member of and a leader in many national educational organizations. He is the Chair of the National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges Board of Directors for 2000. He is also a member of the Kellogg Commission on the Future of State and Land-Grant Universities.  He is a member of the Board of Trustees of the Western Governors University. He has also served as Chair of the Executive Committee of the National Collegiate Athletic Association. For his exemplary service, Dr. Smith has received many honors and awards for his work in these organizations.  President Smith is a native of Salinas, California, and holds bachelor's and doctoral degrees in plant pathology from the University of California at Berkeley and honorary doctoral degrees from Nihon University in Tokyo, Japan, and Far Eastern State University in Vladivostok, Russia.  Mr. President, I also want my colleagues to know that Pat Smith has been an instrumental figure in the growth of Washington State University.  From her position on the Washington State Arts Commission, she worked to expand the art collection and increase awareness of the WSU Museum of Art. She also serves on the boards of the Girl Scouts of the Inland Northwest and the United Way of Pullman, Washington.  Mrs. Smith is also from Salinas, California, and is a graduate of Salinas Union High School. She studied at Hartnell College in Salinas, California.  Mr. President, as a citizen of Washington state and as an alumna of Washington State University, I could not be more proud of the great job that President Smith and Pat Smith have done in expanding educational opportunities for the people of my state and nation and making my alma mater an even brighter beacon of learning and opportunity.  Mr. President, in closing I would like to say--on behalf of the people of my state and the many graduates, faculty members and current students of Washington State University--thank you President and Mrs. Smith.  Thank you for putting your compassion, energy and leadership to such good use at the helm of Washington State University.  Your presence will be missed, but the many gifts you gave us serve as a constant reminder of your many years of generous service.                          ____________________
