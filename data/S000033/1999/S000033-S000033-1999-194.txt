 Speaker, I would like to have printed in the Record statements by high school students from my home State of Vermont, who were speaking at my recent town meeting on issues facing young people today. I am asking that you please insert these statements in the Congressional Record as I believe that the views of these young persons will benefit my colleagues.                    Religion in Public High Schools     (On behalf of Nathan Loizeaux, Larry Grace and Melissa Tobin)       Nathan Loizeaux: In opening, we would just like to thank      Congressman Bernie Sanders and everybody else who is involved      in this to give us a chance to voice our opinion. Thank you.       We would like to address the subject of religion in the      public high school. We believe that our laws need to be      reformed or we need new ones, because the existing laws seem      to be inadequate at this time. They seem to be very broad,      and most high schools that we have attended seem to ignore      most of these laws, based on the fact that we are teenagers.       I would just like to say, in the court case Rosenberg v.      Reactor and Visitors of the University of Virginia, the 115th      Circuit Court, 25,010, 1995, the court concluded that free      speech itself was threatened if religious speech was singled      out for different treatment.       We have found that, in the current high school, public high      schools, that religious groups are treated in a different      way, and by Vermont and federal government laws, they are      required to give us equal rights.       Larry Grace: At our school, the subject of religion is      needed to be addressed, because it is a major issue that      concerns us teenagers who have religious beliefs. Since time      in our school has past, we have noticed that the public      school system is not upholding the state and federal      government laws for equal rights for religious groups inside      the public school system. The laws are ignored, and the      school system gets away with it, because we, as students,      don't have the funds to fight back. And there should be new      laws or for the current laws to be better enforced, to be      instituted. The federal government and state laws require for      the public school system to give religious groups inside      schools equal rights. We feel they should be the same as      nonreligious groups inside the school, allowing them to      express their thoughts and beliefs in forms of materials and      displays. The public school system is not adhering to these      laws of equal rights in a way that we feel the religious      groups within the public school are being discriminated      against because of what they are.       Melissa Tobin: If schools allow noncurricular student-led      groups to use their facilities for meetings and displays, why      couldn't they allow student-led prayer groups to use the      facilities in the same way? If a religious group were to put      up a display, it may be thought of as forcing a certain      religion on fellow students. If another group were to put up      a display on sexual preferences, no one would feel that it      was forcing their beliefs or preferences. Is the Constitution      being violated if schools allow religious symbols and forums      within the school building?                                       ____                              Safe Schools                (On behalf of Erin Gover and Beth Ziner)       Erin Gover: This morning I've chosen to talk about a      pressing issue, which is educational safety. Lately there      have been many occurrences throughout the country that have      involved school shootings, most recently the Colorado      incident. This topic hits a little too close to home, and if      I were to sit here and talk about the many, many aspects of      it, it would take valuable time that could be spent solving      those problems, so I have chosen to focus on three main      things, which are the weapons, the influences of this      violence, and the effects of this violence.       First let's start off with the weaponry. Right now, there      are a 192 million handguns in private possession. Think about      that for a minute: 192 million. Now, they are not all legal,      they don't all have permits. Most come from newspaper ads      from, let's say, the Burlington Free Press. And it is not      okay. In 1996, there were 9,390 murders involving handguns;      in New Zealand, there were 2. What is the real difference      between the United States and New Zealand? Sure, there's the      distance factor. But are we really that different? They're      the same people. And out of those 192 million handguns, there      are 280 million people in the United States. That is over      half, and that is including children. Where are these guns?       And the influences of this violence. The media is not the      cause. We want to blame someone, and when I say ``we,'' I      mean the human race in general. We want a quick solution, but      there really aren't any. We have been doing this for      centuries. For example, Hitler and the Jews. He blamed the      Jews because he could; that's all. And we are blaming the      media for these shootings because we can and it's a quick      solution. We need to open our eyes and we can see the warning      signs. It goes back to the individual. The problem starts      there.       And the effects of the violence. It is at Colchester High      School, and it is not just Littleton, Colorado. It makes      people wonder: Could it happen here? Because we have had--as      Beth is going to speak about--gun threats and bomb threats,      and what's next?       Solutions to these problems need to be done and need to be      done now. There need to be stricter laws, harsher penalties.      I don't care if the kid is 7 years old; he still brought a      gun to school, and he needs to be made an example of so it      doesn't happen again. There needs to be a town meeting or a      public forum telling the community members about these      warning signs. If parents are going to deny they are there,      the need to know.       One source that I have heard of that had an idea is for      students to pick a mentor that they felt comfortable talking      to, even if things are good, or bad, even. But the point is,      it's their choice, and there's comfort, and it solves the      communication problem. Things need to be done so that      Colchester, Vermont, doesn't become Littleton, Colorado.       Thank you.       Beth Ziner: The problem of gun and bomb threats needs to be      recognized and dealt with in a better manner. For the threats      appearing at Colchester High School, the school took the      following actions. For the bomb threats, school was canceled,      lockers were searched, metal detectors were placed in the      doors, armed police were stationed in the halls. When the gun      threat happened, heightened security became an issue at the      school. Everything was the same, except that the police were      unarmed. An article from the Times Magazine states that in      1996, handguns were used to murder two people in New Zealand,      15 in Japan, 30 in Great Britain, 106 in Canada, 213 in      Germany, and 9,390 in the United States. We have a problem,      and it needs to be recognized.       The last issue I would like to present is the option of      bringing together the state of Vermont. I feel we have had so      much negativity in the past few months, something needs to be      done. Perhaps a ``Celebrate Life Week'' in the state of      Vermont, where there are parades, sales in stores, happenings      in theaters, fireworks, and awards given out to people who      have done something good in the community.       Thank you.                                 ____________________
