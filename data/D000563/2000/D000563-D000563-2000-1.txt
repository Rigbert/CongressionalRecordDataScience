President, today I am introducing legislation to make available to all of our constituents the same range of private health insurance plans available to Members of Congress and other federal employees through the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, FEHBP.  The OPTION Act--Offering People True Insurance Options Nationwide--would expand insurance options by allowing individuals to enroll in private health insurance plans nearly identical to the plans federal employees currently choose from. Though the OPTION program would be separate from the federal employees program, it would be modeled after FEHBP and would draw from FEHBP's strengths: plan choice, group purchasing savings, comprehensive benefits, and open enrollment periods.  Too many Americans do not have real insurance options. Many individuals lack insurance because no insurer is willing to cover them at a reasonable price. Others work for employers who do not provide health insurance or offer only one insurance provider. The OPTION Act addresses these issues by giving individuals and businesses access to the group purchasing power that undergirds FEHBP and the wide range of health plans in that program.  Under this legislation, all FEHBP health plans would be required to offer an OPTION health plan to non-federal employees with the same benefits they offer federal employees through FEHBP.  OPTION enrollees would be placed in a separate risk pool, to prevent any effect on current FEHBP employees, and the OPTION Act would not result in any changes in the premiums or benefits of today's FEHBP health plans.  One of the few differences from FEHBP is that OPTION plans would be allowed to vary premiums by age, so that younger enrollees would be more likely to enroll. OPTION plans also would be required to offer rebates or lower premiums for longevity of health coverage. These provisions would act as an incentive for people to sign up when they are young and to maintain continuous coverage.  OPTION health plans would not be allowed to impose any preexisting condition exclusions on new OPTION enrollees who have at least one year of health insurance coverage immediately prior to enrollment in an OPTION plan. To prevent people from waiting until they get sick to enroll, health plans would be allowed to exclude coverage for preexisting conditions for up to one year for people without coverage immediately preceding enrollment.  All employers would have the option of voluntarily participating in the OPTION program and providing OPTION health plans to their employees. To be eligible, a business would have to be willing to pay at least a minimum percentage of the premiums, varying from 30 percent to 50 percent depending on the size of the business. This innovative employer option would encourage employer health coverage rather than shifting coverage away from the private sector. I want to emphasize that employer participation would be entirely voluntary.  Opening up these health plans to employers would give small businesses a new opportunity to provide health coverage to their employees. Premiums in today's market can be especially high for small businesses buying insurance on their own. The OPTION program will allow businesses to tap into the type of group buying power in the federal employees program.  Premiums would not be government-subsidized and would instead be the responsibility of the participating enrollees and those employers who choose to participate.  Mr. President, I support efforts to provide financial assistance to those who cannot afford health insurance and I have offered other pieces of legislation to provide that assistance. We need to address the fact that 42.6 million Americans, including 1.7 million Illinoisans, currently lack health insurance--up nearly 25 percent from the 34.4 million in 1990. However, I am offering this measure on its own to focus specifically on expanding health coverage options and encouraging businesses to provide coverage. No one should be living just a serious accident or major illness away from financial ruin. Making more insurance options available to a greater number of people in this country is a good first step toward universal coverage.  The OPTION program would be administered by the Office of Personnel Management, OPM, which administers the FEHBP program, and would generally follow the rules for FEHBP. OPM has developed considerable expertise in negotiating and working with health plans and has shown that it can run a health program well at a minimum of cost. We can build on OPM's expertise to extend the same health insurance options to all Americans.  Finally, once it is up and running, the program would pay for itself. Administrative costs would be covered from a portion of the OPTION premiums. Those who benefit from the program would pay for its overhead costs.  Mr. President, this legislation could open the door for many Americans to obtain good health insurance coverage. I am introducing it at this late point in the session so that it can stimulate discussion over the next few months. I will reintroduce the measure next year. I welcome the input and support of my colleagues and hope the Senate will work next year to reduce the number of uninsured Americans and expand insurance options.  I ask unanimous consent that a fuller summary of the bill and a copy of the bill itself be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3284       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

This Act and the amendments made by this Act shall take      effect on the date of enactment of this Act and shall apply      to contracts that take effect with respect to calendar year      2002 and each calendar year thereafter.                                  ____ The Offering People True Insurance Options Nationwide (OPTION) Act of                              2000--Summary       The OPTION Act (Offering People True Insurance Options      Nationwide) would expand health insurance options for all      Americans by giving them access to the group purchasing power      and same range of private health insurance plans available to      Members of Congress and other federal employees. Under the      OPTION Act:       All Americans would be eligible to enroll in OPTION health      plans nearly identical to the health plans from which federal      employees currently choose through the Federal Employees      Health Benefits Program (FEHBP).       All FEHBP health plans would be required to offer an OPTION      health plan to non-federal employees with the same benefits      as they offer federal employees through FEHBP (with the      exception of plans designated for a specific federal agency      such as the foreign service and plans that apply for and      receive an exemption due to special circumstances).       OPTION enrollees would be placed in a separate risk pool,      to prevent any effect on current FEHBP employees.       The OPTION Act would not result in any changes in the      premiums, copayments, deductibles, or benefits of FEHBP      health plans, to avoid any adverse effect on the current      FEHBP coverage of federal employees and annuitants and their      families.       All employers would have the option of voluntarily      participating in the OPTION program and providing OPTION      health plans to their employees. To be eligible, a business      would have to be willing to pay at least a minimum percentage      of the premiums for its employees, with the amount varying      depending on the size of the business. A small business with      3-25 employees would have to pay at least 30% of the premium      for its employees, a larger business with 26-50 employees      would have to pay at least 40%, and a business with more than      50 employees would have to pay at least 50%. Employers would      be offered an incentive to begin enrolling their employees by      allowing them to pay as little as 20% of the premium for the      first year only. This innovative employer option would      encourage employer health coverage rather than shifting      coverage away from the private sector. Employer participation      would be entirely voluntary.       Under the OPTION Act, premiums would not be government-     subsidized. Enrollees, and those employers who choose to      participate, would be responsible for the cost of the      premiums. (Senator Durbin supports and has offered separate      legislation to provide financial assistance to those who      cannot afford health insurance but is offering this measure      on its own to focus specifically on expanding health coverage      options and encouraging businesses to provide coverage.)       One of the few differences from FEHBP is that OPTION plans      would be allowed to vary premiums by age, so that younger      enrollees would be more likely to enroll.       OPTION plans also would be required to offer rebates or      lower premiums to encourage and reward longevity of health      coverage. This would create an incentive for people to sign      up when they are young and maintain continuous coverage.       OPTION health plans would not be allowed to impose any      preexisting condition exclusions on new OPTION enrollees who      have at least one year of health insurance coverage      immediately prior to enrollment in an OPTION plan. To prevent      people from waiting     until they get sick to enroll, health plans would be allowed      to exclude coverage for preexisting conditions for up to one      year for people without coverage immediately prior to      enrollment (reduced by one month for each month of      immediately previous coverage). OPTION enrollees who      terminate their coverage mid-year would have to wait to re-     join until the next annual open season that is at least six      months after the date of termination.       People who lost their previous health coverage and are not      eligible for COBRA would be allowed to enroll in an OPTION      plan at the start of the next month, just as newly hired      federal employees can enroll in FEHBP.       The benefits provided by OPTION plans would be the same as      the benefits in the corresponding FEHBP plans. (Current FEHBP      benefits include inpatient/outpatient hospital care;      physician services; surgical services; diagnostic tests; and      emergency care; as well as child immunizations; certain      cancer screening tests, including mammography; prescription      drugs, including contraceptives; mental health and substance      abuse treatment benefits with parity for mental and physical      health; organ transplantation; and a 48-hour minimum      inpatient stay for childbirth and mastectomies.)       The OPTION program would be administered by the Office of      Personnel Management (OPM), which administers the FEHBP      program, and would generally follow the rules for FEHBP. For      example, OPM would conduct the same annual open season for      enrollment and would negotiate premiums and benefits with      OPTION health plans as it does with FEHBP plans. OPM has      developed considerable expertise in negotiating and working      with health plans and has shown that it can run a health      program well at a minimum of cost. Its expenses are currently      limited to no more than one percent of the total premiums for      the FEHBP program. Rather than reinventing the wheel, we can      build on OPM's expertise to extend the same health insurance      options to all Americans.       Once it is up and running, the program would pay for      itself. Administrative costs would be covered from a portion      of the OPTION premiums.                                 ______                                       By
