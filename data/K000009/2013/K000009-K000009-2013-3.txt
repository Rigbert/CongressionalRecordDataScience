Speaker, I would like to respond to the gentleman and say that I walked into the Kiwanis pancake breakfast in Berea, Ohio, the other day and out of a crowd of probably a thousand people, a gentleman said, Congresswoman, Congresswoman, and came up to me and threw his arms around me. He said:       Thank you so much for voting for the Affordable Care Act. I      just got a plan 10 times better than I ever had--ten times      better. My wife had a $5,000 deductible and I had a $5,000      deductible. I am a small business person. I now have a $1,000      deductible. I have much better coverage. Preventive health      care is covered. I cannot believe how much better my plan is      than what I had before.  It made me feel so good.  We had breakfast together. The pancakes and sausage were great, by the way.  It made me feel so good because I knew that in his business as a shoemaker and his wife as an alterations person in that same business, they would be protected as they grow older before they go onto Medicare. They have worked so very hard in their lives.  They went to the Web site, and guess what? It worked.  And so across America there are small business people saying thank you to those in Congress who voted for an Affordable Care Act that is working.                          ____________________
