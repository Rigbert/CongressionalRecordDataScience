Chairman, I want to reexpress my appreciation to the gentleman from Florida (Chairman Young) and the gentleman from New Mexico (Chairman Skeen) for trying to restore regular order in this House and permitting the Members to exercise their will. The legislative will of the House and its membership must be retained both here on the floor and in the conference committee, and no special set of leaders who may have a higher title than any Member that stands on this floor should have a right to write our conference bill.  We thank them for restoring the power back to the membership where it belongs and to the regular order of the committee process.
