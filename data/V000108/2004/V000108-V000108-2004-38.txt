Speaker, it is with great honor and pleasure that I stand before you today to recognize the many accomplishments of the Girl Scouts of the Calumet Council throughout its 50 years of service to the Northwest Indiana community. The special black tie gala celebration and fundraiser will be held on Saturday, November 13, 2004 at the Ville Cesare in Schererville, Indiana.  The Girl Scouts is an informal educational organization of more than three million girls. The organization was founded in the United States by Juliette Gordon Low in 1912. The Girl Scouts of the Calumet Council is one of 319 councils nationwide whose sole mission is to help all girls reach their fullest potential. This group emphasizes the values of fairness, self-respect, community service, high standards of conduct, and appreciation for diversity, which contribute to the girls becoming successful citizens and future leaders in their communities. Through a value based informal education and recreation program, the Girl Scouts of the Calumet Council also teaches girls how to set and reach goals, improve decision making skills, become leaders, develop values, and contribute to society.  The Calumet Council currently serves over 4,800 girls with an additional 1,700 adult volunteers in Dyer, East Chicago, Griffith, Hammond, Highland, Munster, St. John, Schererville, and Whiting, Indiana and Burnham, Calumet City, Lansing, and Lynwood, Illinois. With the help of the many adult volunteers, girls in the Calumet Council participate in a variety of activities and programs. Over the last 50 years, Girl Scouts of the Calumet Council has helped mold thousands of young women in Indiana's First Congressional District into responsible, dynamic, and successful leaders in the community. The Girl Scouts of the Calumet Council has achieved success in inspiring and enabling young females to realize their full potential as productive, responsible, and caring citizens.  Mr. Speaker, at this time, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring and congratulating the Girl Scouts of the Calumet Council, as well as its staff and community leaders, on their 50th anniversary. Their many accomplishments and service to Lake County, Indiana will forever be cherished and commended.                          ____________________
