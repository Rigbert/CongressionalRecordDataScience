Speaker, I rise to honor a great American, my friend Sargent Shriver, a son of Maryland, who passed away this week at the age of 95. He was a public servant who lived a full life dedicated to promoting justice andopportunity in America and, indeed, throughout the world.  As the first director of the Peace Corps, Mr. Shriver skillfully launched an organization that has strengthened respect for America across the world and has for half a century exposed generations of Americans to the world beyond their borders. Sargent Shriver also made his mark as the director of important anti-poverty programs and as the leader of the Special Olympics movement, a movement that he joined his extraordinary bride, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, in heading.  In the words of his biographer, Scott Stossel: ``Often the things that Sargent Shriver accomplished, starting the Peace Corps in just a few months, or getting 500,000 kids into Head Start programs its first summer when the experts said that 10,000 kids was the maximum feasible, were things that everyone beforehand had said were not realistic, or were downright impossible, Sarge Shriver did.''  Sarge Shriver had a gift for what one of the old War on Poverty colleagues called ``expanding the horizons of the possible.'' I am reminded of Robert Kennedy's quote that he used so often that ``some men see things as they are and say, `Why?' '' Robert Kennedy said: ``I dream things that never were and ask, `Why not?' '' Sarge Shriver mirrored that quote. May we all learn from his example. May we honor his legacy of public service by expanding our own horizons of the possible, by caring for those who need our help here and around the world.  Sargent Shriver brought to American life a singular commitment to service. His good work and his historic example will long outlive his 95 years.                          ____________________
