President, I have the privilege of being the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, working with Senator McCain with respect to the nomination of General Mattis.  I am strongly in favor of the general's confirmation for many reasons. He possesses three distinct qualities that are absolutely critical: confidence, courage, and character. And he will eminently demonstrate those virtues as Secretary of Defense, in my view.  I would like to also inform the body and everyone else that we just did this in a very thorough, careful, thoughtful way.  General Mattis was subject to a 60-vote procedural vote because we had to waive his time from retirement to his ability to serve as Secretary of Defense.  We had a hearing under the auspices of the chairman about the policy with two noted historians and policy experts.
