 But I refer my colleague from Wisconsin to the third paragraph of that letter. Is it not correct that they also say:       We . . . have concerns about McCain-Feingold's provisions      that would curb issue advertising in the 60 days prior to      elections. These provisions are ill-defined and overly      restrictive of legitimate legislative activity, and would      inhibit the ability to speak freely on issues while they are      being debated and decided in Congress.  Am I reading that right?
