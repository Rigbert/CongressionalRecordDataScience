Speaker, it is with great pleasure and admiration that I stand before you today to honor the American Hellenic Educational Progressive Association, AHEPA, Chapter 78, of Merrillville, Indiana, for being named Chapter of the Year during the association's national convention that was held in July of this year.  AHEPA Chapter 78 is to be commended for its outstanding service. AHEPA Chapter 78 was established on July 25, 1925. It currently consists of 130 members, with 13 being life members of over 50 years. In accordance with the AHEPA mission of community service, the members of Chapter 78 represent the best in all of us through their selfless giving, kindness, and generosity.  Most recently, the chapter has distinguished itself by donating significant funds to organizations throughout northwest Indiana, including Christian Haven House and Saints Monica and Luke Soup Kitchen.  For nearly two decades, the chapter has also worked tirelessly to provide safe, exceptionally well-maintained, and affordable housing for senior citizens who otherwise might today find themselves in very abject circumstances.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and the other distinguished colleagues join me in again congratulating the AHEPA Chapter 78 of Merrillville, Indiana.                          ____________________
