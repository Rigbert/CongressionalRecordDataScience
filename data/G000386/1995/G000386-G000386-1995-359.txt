 President, as I indicated yesterday, Senator Snowe is working with me on this approach.  This very simply expresses the sense of the Congress that Federal agencies should review and should evaluate planned regulations to ensure the costs of Federal regulations are within the cost estimates that are provided for the statute by the Congressional Budget Office.   [[Page S1528]] Then there is a second part that is not a sense of the Senate. The second part would allow any Senator to request that CBO provide an estimate of the cost of regulations and compare them with the cost estimates provided by CBO as required for the statute that we are passing under S. 1.  This is just a commonsense amendment that when agencies implement a Federal mandate they should take steps and make a good-faith effort to keep regulatory costs within the CBO estimates called for under S. 1. We do not want to pass legislation, in Congress, thinking when we pass the legislation that it might only be a $1 billion unfunded mandate and then, after several months have passed--in some cases I suppose years could pass--the agency unnecessarily implements regulations that would raise that cost, something above the $1 billion estimate?  I hope we could all agree to this amendment. I know at least on our side of the aisle, after discussing it with our distinguished floor manager, Senator Kempthorne, he had some concerns about it. I think the modifications will satisfy his concerns.  I think it ought to be stated as well that CBO has no problem with the costs of carrying this out. And from that standpoint, this is language similar to what was in the amendment of the Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin] when he called up a previous amendment he got adopted, calling for a report at the instigation of any particular Senator.  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.
