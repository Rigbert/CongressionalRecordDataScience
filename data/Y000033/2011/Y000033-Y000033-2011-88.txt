I thank the gentleman.  Since 1958, the strategic seaport program has facilitated the movement of military forces securely through U.S. ports. Each strategic seaport has individual capabilities that provide the Department of Defense with the port facilities and services that are critical in maintaining the operational flexibility and redundancy needed to meet a wide range of national security missions and timelines.  However, the existing infrastructure at many of the strategic ports may no longer be adequate to meet the needs of our military. Language included in the bill will help us identify the infrastructure improvements necessary to ensure our strategic ports remain accessible to our military, as well as determine whether existing authorities and funding sources are adequate to facilitate making the necessary infrastructure improvements.  This study is an important first step. I look forward to working with the Armed Services Committee on ways to improve our strategic ports to guarantee that they remain capable of supporting our military's operational needs.  Mr. McKEON. As the gentleman knows, this committee has had a longstanding interest in our strategic ports, and I will be happy to work with the gentleman from Alaska and the gentlewoman from Guam to consider the appropriate measures to address the critical infrastructure needs of our strategic seaports.
