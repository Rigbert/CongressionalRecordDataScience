 President, I am pleased that the Finance Committee has included my proposal to clarify both the tax treatment of the State-sponsored education savings plans and taxation of the beneficiary's investment. This measure will put an end to the tax uncertainty that has hampered the effectiveness of these State-sponsored programs and help families who are trying to save for their children's higher education needs.  I have been working on this proposal since I first introduced S. 1787 in 1994. This Congress I have introduced S. 386 to provide families with an incentive to save for college and put an end to the tax uncertainty regarding the State-sponsored programs. This legislation will offer families an opportunity to save in order to keep pace with the spiraling cost of education. S. 386 has been endorsed by the National Association of State Treasurers, the National Association of State Scholarships and Grant Programs and the Kentucky Advocates for Higher Education.  Mr. President, the facts are clear. Education costs are outpacing average wages, creating a barrier to attending college. Throughout the 1980's education costs have risen by roughly double the rate of inflation. In 1983, tuition at the University of Kentucky and University of Louisville rocketed 16.7 percent followed by an 11.2-percent increase in 1994. Since 1986, the cumulative percentage increase in tuition at Kentucky's two largest public universities rose an astounding 82.3 percent.  Unfortunately, Kentucky's numbers are not extraordinary when compared to average tuition increases nationwide. Over the past 10 years, tuition rose by 81.7 percent for public universities and 95 percent for private schools compared to 46.6 percent increase in the median income for the same period. Which brings us to the real problem: education costs are quickly out-pacing income growth.  As tuition costs continue to increase, so does the need for assistance. In 1990, over 56 percent of all students accepted some form of financial assistance and the statistic was even higher for minority students. It is increasingly common for students to study now and pay later. In fact, more students than ever are forced to bear additional loan costs in order to receive an education. In 1994, Federal education loan volume rose by 57 percent from the previous year. On top of that, students have increased the size of their loan burden by an average of 28 percent. So not only are more students taking out loans, but they are taking out bigger loans as well.  Over the past decade, many States have tried to respond to the concerns parents have raised regarding the affordability of a college education. Today, 11 States, including Kentucky, have responded by developing programs that will provide families with incentives to save over the long term to make college more affordable. Sixteen other States are quickly moving to put into place their own education savings plans.  Currently, there are 500,000 participants investing over $2 billion in State-sponsored savings programs. In Kentucky, there are 2,700 participants with $4 million invested in their children's future. Under this plan, participants don't have to be rich to benefit. In fact, the average monthly contribution in Kentucky is just $47.22. This proposal rewards those who are serious about their future and are committed to the education of their children.  The language included in this bill is a variation of my original legislation. It provides tax-exempt status to qualified State tuition programs. In November 1994, the U.S. Appeals Court ruled that the Michigan Education Trust is not subject to Federal income tax. Although the circuit court was quite clear on this issue, it is my understanding that the IRS continued to look for a different avenue to tap this growing investment pool. This proposal clarifies legislatively the tax status of these programs and puts and end to the uncertainty and constant threat posed by the IRS. I am told by Kentucky's program administrators that this tax clarification is their No. 1 priority and vital to the continued existence of the program.  This legislation will also clarify the tax treatment of the investment itself. As proposed in the recent Treasury regulations, the child would be taxed on the earnings buildup at the time of distribution. While my original legislation proposed the inside buildup be fully tax exempt, I believe that this clarification is a significant reform and consistent with the limits of this bill. I want to assure every one of my colleagues that I will reintroduce legislation and continue my efforts to make the inside buildup in this investment tax free. Nonetheless, this proposal will be a tax cut for Kentucky participants since they have been forced to pay taxes annually to avoid possible penalties, while the IRS has been considering the tax treatment of this investment.  This legislation is not a funding cure but is a serious effort to encourage long-term savings, by eliminating the tax disincentive to do so. Aside fromlimited assistance through bond programs, nothing has been done to encourage savings or decrease borrowing. I believe it is widely agreed that it is in our best interest as a nation to maintain a quality education system for everyone. We need to make a decision, however, on how we will spend our limited resources to ensure that both access and quality are maintained.  Before I close, I would like to take a moment and commend Senators Roth, Graham, Shelby, and Breaux for their hard work and support of this legislation. I appreciate their interest and look forward to working with them in the future to make these investments tax exempt.                         Small Fishing Vessels
