Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.  Mr. Chairman, regretfully, the gentleman from Virginia [Mr. Scott] has fallen under the sway of what I call Washington math. He is claiming that this bill cuts the advanced subsonics program by an amount of money. It does not. This bill increases this program by 6 percent. The gentleman from Virginia wants to increase it by more. That is his prerogative. However, under the discretionary spending cap that was passed in 1993 by the Clinton budget, whenever we increase a discretionary spending account, we are supposed to reduce other discretionary spending accounts, and this amendment does not do that. It is just a plusing up of the advanced subsonic program without an offset anywhere else in NASA.  Now, apparently the amendment of the gentleman from Virginia [Mr. Scott] wants to pump that whole issue of what to cut off to the NASA Administrator. What our committee has attempted to do is to run NASA on as tight a budget as possible. We are sick and tired of cost overruns at NASA. All of the accounts that we have put in this bill are under the new faster, better, cheaper NASA, and there really is not much play around for the Administrator to offset these other programs without underfunding them, and that is going to require stretch-outs and cost overruns in these other programs in the long run.  The gentleman from Virginia, if his amendment were to be responsible, should have identified where the offsets were, rather than leaving that decision being made to the executive branch. The fact of the matter remains that this bill increases the advanced subsonic program by 6 percent. It has been the determination of the Committee on Science that that is enough. I would hope that the House would accept the committee position and reject the amendment of the gentleman from Virginia for the reasons that I have stated.
