 President, let me begin by thanking Senator Mark Udall for his continued focus on ensuring that Congress extends the production tax credit. Senator Udall has been down on the Senate floor time after time after time on this important issue, and we all owe him a deep debt of gratitude. I thank the Senator very much.  I also want to thank him for his very kind words about the NRG company. We hope when the Senator visits us in Vermont, he will see it.
