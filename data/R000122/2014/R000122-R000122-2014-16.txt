President, I am pleased to introduce the Strengthening Research in Adult Education Act. The recently enacted Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act recognized that the adult education field has evolved from a literacy skills program to a more comprehensive college and career readiness initiative to ensure that adult learners have the foundational skills to fully participate in the community and compete for jobs that provide family sustaining wages. We need to ensure that there is a strong research base to support this vital transition.  For 2012, data from the Program for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies show that an estimated 52 percent of adults ages 16-65 in the United States lack the literacy skills necessary to identify, interpret, or evaluate one or more pieces of information. These are essential skills for postsecondary education and the workplace. Beyond their value in the labor market, these skills are also correlated with health and civic participation. Clearly, improving adult education is critically important to the health and well-being of our people, our economy, and our democracy.  In Rhode Island, it is estimated that nearly 130,000 adults have less than a high school education. Over 45,000 have limited English proficiency. Yet, we are reaching less than 6,000 through the current adult education program.Clearly, we need more resources and innovative, research-based ways to reach more people.  The Strengthening Research in Adult Education Act will support the key reforms to adult education in the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act by ensuring that adult education is included in our national education research priorities. Specifically, the Strengthening Research in Adult Education Act will amend the Education Sciences Reform Act to require the Institute for Education Sciences and the National Center for Education Statistics to collect data and carry out research on: successful state and local adult education and literacy activities, the characteristics and academic achievement of adult learners, and access to and opportunity for adult education in communities across the country. It will also ensure that the Institute of Education Sciences draws on the expertise of adult educators when developing policies and priorities. Finally, the legislation would require that at least one research center would focus on adult education.  These straightforward amendments to the Education Sciences Reform Act will go a long way to strengthening the research base that will support the improvement of adult education across the country. I was pleased to work with the adult education community, and particularly, the National Council of State Directors of Adult Education in developing this legislation. I urge my colleagues to support the Strengthening Research in Adult Education Act and to work with me to ensure that its provisions are included in the reauthorization of the Education Sciences Reform Act.                          ____________________
