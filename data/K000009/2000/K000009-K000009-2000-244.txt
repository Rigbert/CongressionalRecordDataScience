Con. Res. 145, that expresses the sense of Congress that the construction of the National World War II Memorial should be constructed expeditiously and that the appropriate site for the Memorial is on our National Mall at the Rainbow Pool. I want to thank Senator Warner, Chairman Stump, and all the other Members of Congress who worked to bring this legislation before us today.  As we enter the new century, it is appropriate that we reflect on the turning point of the past century. The World War II Memorial will commemorate that period between 1939 and 1945 that so profoundly reconfigured the modern world. So long as there is an America, this hallowed ground will pay homage to the superlative devotion that elevated duty, honor, and country to sacred proportion.  The location of the World War II memorial between the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial is not only appropriate, but also historically coherent. Those two memorials commemorate the defining national events of the 18th and 19th centuries: our Nation's founding in the Revolutionary War and our unification during the Civil War. It is only fitting that the event that reshaped the modern world in the 20th century and marked our Nation's emergence from the chrysalis of isolationism as the leader of the free world be commemorated on this site.  As we all know, the site and the form of the memorial have been the subject of ongoing qualification and even some controversy. This is how public dialogue should ensue in our country. I believe that the site and respectful style of the memorial are most appropriate. The refined design is a beautiful tribute to a generation of Americans who sacrificed their lives in service to our country with unparalleled valor and distinction. This design enhances the Mall's representation of American history. It retains open vistas--north and south as well as east and west. And it adds trees, plantings, and waterfalls while also capturing for visitors and all Americans the significance of this most historic event of the 20th Century.  More importantly, we must acknowledge that the open, expansive process by which decisions have been made about this site and this design. The democratic process these brave Americans fought to defend has been pursued. The congressional deliberations--extensive hearings, floor action, and two separate bills--that led to the authorization of the memorial were long, frustratingly long, but they were thorough. As one sage commented, ``It has taken longer to build the memorial than it did to fight the war.'' I can now say it has taken us twice as long to build the Memorial as to fight the war--over 13 years.  Our first bill authorizing the memorial was filed in 1987, and the final bill was passed in 1993. The Administrations of two presidents, five Congresses, and a decade of administrative reviews have elapsed.  After authorization, the procedures of the American Battle Monuments Commission and the other bodies responsible for approving the memorial have been open and fair. There have been 17 open, public meetings held on the proposed Memorial since 1993. Questions have been raised and suggestions offered by Members of Congress, the general public, and interest groups about the site and style of the memorial. With that deliberative process, the concept has been refined and become more elegant and appropriate for this hallowed site.  The concept of a World War II Memorial in Washington sprang from a dogged Army veteran, my constituent, Roger Durbin of Berkey, Ohio, who fought with the 101st Armored Division in the Battle of the Bulge. It was Roger's question to me about why there was no memorial to World War II in Washington to which he could take his grandchildren that inspired the historic project that is before us today.  The thought of Roger reminds me of that auspicious day, Veterans Day, 1995, when the memorial site was consecrated with soil from American battlefield cemeteries around the world. Roger Durbin participated in that dedication, accompanied by his wife Marian. He wrote about it as follows:       I stood on the site of the Memorial, November 10, 1995,      watching the activity thereon. Touch football, stickball,      Frisbee, picnicking, etc. as people enjoyed a sunny day as      they would have in an ordinary public park. The next day I      stood with President Clinton at the end of the glorious site      dedication ceremony and scattered sacred soil     gathered from 16 military cemeteries from around the world      and Arlington upon the sparse and worn grass. That is when it      became the most sacred, revered, beautiful spot in America.  Sadly, Roger passed away earlier this year. Roger was deeply wounded that he would not be able to see his idea come to fruition. The architectural rendition of the Memorial was framed above his fireplace, and he has assembled a copious note and scrapbook about the legislation and administrative proceedings for the record.  For thousands of other veterans, the same is true. Since the site dedication in 1995, perhaps a third of the World War II veterans then living have left us. There are fewer than 6 million World War II veterans living today, and we are losing them at a rate of 1,000 a day! I feel a great urgency to complete this project on schedule. As many as possible of the brave Americans who served during that conflict, abroad and on the home front, should bear witness to this memorial in its final form. Is this too much to ask?  Of course, all veterans' organizations and students of history recognize what this generation achieved in the triumph of freedom over tyranny. As Americans in future generations visit our Nation's Capital, they will have an opportunity to stop along the Mall to reflect on a time when America went to war to defend our fundamental political values. Millions of visitors every year traverse this site already as they wend their way between the various memorials, parks, roads, and special events that give our National Mall its public character. They will be able to reflect on the level of commitment that engaged millions of Americans and our allies in combat during World War Il.  The World War II memorial will thus serve as a symbol of our legacy to the future centuries: a determination to defend democracy at any cost. The world's political landscape was reshaped for all time as a result of the Allied victory. I urge the Commission to approve the architectural and landscape design as presented today. Let us move expeditiously toward the groundbreaking this coming Veterans Day in the first year of a new century and the advent of the new millennium.  Again, Madam Speaker, I fully support S. Con. Res. 145 and urge its passage.                          ____________________
