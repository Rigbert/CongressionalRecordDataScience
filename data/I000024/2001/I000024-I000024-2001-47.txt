President, we have reached agreement on the amendment having to do with depot maintenance. We have made two modest changes from that which was introduced. One is, instead of sending it to the President in lieu of the service chiefs, it nowgoes to the Secretary of Defense. No. 2, it says we need to have the report from the Secretary of Defense as to the future use of depots. That is essentially it. It is agreed to, and I ask it be accepted.
