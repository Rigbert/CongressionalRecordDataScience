President, before I make a few comments about the state of the economy, let me talk about the state of business in the Senate. I concur completely with the Senator from Vermont, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, on which I am proud to serve. I cannot imagine what is holding up this legislation. This legislation is designed to restore law and order in this country. It is designed to fight terrorism. There are elements that are absolutely common sense.  It is the first time, I believe, in over 20 years we are reauthorizing the Department of Justice. We are establishing the Violence Against Women Act, to protect areas of domestic abuse. We are talking about drug abuse education, prevention, and treatment. We have a provision in here to provide resources to the Boys and Girls Clubs of America, which in the city of Chicago and across my State of Illinois are so successful in reaching out to young people.  Time and time again, this bill addresses things the Department of Justice needs. It is quite a commentary onthe Senate that the Republican minority has held this bill up. They will not let us bring it to a vote. They won't let us bring it to the floor. I think it is unfortunate. I think we should have a vote on it, and I think if we do it will pass overwhelmingly and the President will gladly sign it. But we are caught up in a last-minute hurry to try to finish the session, and unfortunately some of the most commonsense priorities are victims of some political agenda. I hope this does not hold up this bill any longer.                          ____________________
