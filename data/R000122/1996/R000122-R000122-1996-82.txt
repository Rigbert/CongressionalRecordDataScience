Speaker, today the House is considering legislation in the wake of the recent attack by the Cuban Air Force on two unarmed civilian aircraft. This outrageous, unprovoked act resulted in the tragic loss of four American lives. I, like most Americans, believe the United States must strongly condemn this act and work to promote a democratic Cuba. Unfortunately, I do not believe that H.R. 927 will accomplish this goal.  This attack clearly illustrates the breakdown of the Cuban Government and the desperation that Fidel Castro faces in trying to hold onto power. The question we must answer is: how best to hasten the end of the Castro regime? Regrettably, the bill before us is not the answer. Isolation has not been successful inbringing down Castro. It is contrary to the policy we pursued in ending the cold war, and, indeed, it was not the course of action which resulted in the peaceful transition to democracy and market economies in Eastern Europe.  H.R. 927 will also worsen conditions in Cuba and result in greater suffering by the Cuban people who remain hostages of Castro's government. By increasing the hardships of the Cuban people, we are running the risk of increased violence in this already volatile nation, as well as the potential outflow of refugees. In addition, this legislation would allow United States citizens to sue foreign companies which traffic in property confiscated in Cuba. I believe such a provision will swamp already overburdened U.S. courts, and I submit for the record an article from the Washington Post which further details the adverse effects of this measure.  The Cuban Government's action which resulted in the deaths of United States citizens cannot be justified, and I believe it is necessary to put pressure on the Cuban Government to recognize this serious breach of international law, to pay reparations, and to punish those responsible for this heinous act. The President took the necessary initial steps in response. However, H.R. 927 is contrary to our ultimate foreign policy goals. By tightening the embargo, this legislation will only succeed in further isolating the Cuban people, raising tensions, and endangering a peaceful transition to democracy. I voted against the bill last September, I will do so again today. I urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 927.                [From the Washington Post, Mar. 3, 1996] The Great Cuban Embargo Scam--A Little-Known Loophole Will Allow the                        Richest Exiles to Cash In                         (By Louis F. Desloge)       Virtually everyone agrees that President Clinton should      retaliate forcefully against Cuba's tragic and murderous      downing of two civilian aircraft last weekend. But the least      effective and most counterproductive punishment is Clinton's      acquiescence to the Helms-Burton bill to tighten the U.S.      embargo of Cuba. This legislation, which the White House      endorsed last week, albeit with reservations, will only play      into Castro's hands by creating an expansive loophole for      property claimants, especially wealthy Cuban Americans, to      circumvent the embargo.       Jesse Helms and Dan Burton, conservatives whom I admire,      are no doubt sincere in their motivation to subvert Castro's      rule by applying economic pressure on his regime. However,      they may very well achieve just the opposite of what they      seek by buttressing, not undermining, Castro's support at      home and weakening, not strengthening, the embargo's      prohibition on trade with Cuba.       The Helms-Burton bill is a slick stratagem. Its stated      purpose is to tighten the embargo by allowing Cuban Americans      to have the unprecedented right to sue, in U.S. federal      courts, foreign companies doing business on land once owned      by these exiles. The idea is to discourage foreign business      investment in Cuba, thus undermining the island's financial      recovery which, the bill's supporters naively hope, will      result in a collapse of the Castro regime. The bill's      practical consequences are a different story.       A little-noticed provision in the Helms-Burton measure will      enable a small group of Cuban Americans to profit from the      economic activity occurring in Cuba.       To understand this provision, one must first know who      helped write it. As the Baltimore Sun reported last May, the      bill was drafted with the advice of Nick Gutierrez, an      attorney who represents the National Association of Sugar      Mill Owners of Cuba and the Cuban Association for the Tobacco      Industry. Gutierrez acknowledges his involvement, as does      Ignacio Sanchez, an attorney whose firm represents the      Bacardi rum company. Sanchez told the Sun that he worked on      the bill in his capacity as a member of the American Bar      Association's Cuban Property Rights Task Force and not as a      representative of the rum company.       It is not hard to surmise what these former sugar, tobacco      and rum interests will do if and when the law takes effect;      sue their competitors who are now doing business in Cuba.       Gutierrez told the Miami Herald last fall as saying that he      (and his clients) are eyeing a Kentucky subsidiary of      British-American Tobacco (B.A.T.) that produces Lucky Strike      cigarettes. B.A.T. has a Cuban joint venture with the      Brazilian firm Souza Cruz to produce tobacco on land      confiscated from his clients, Gutierrez claims.       Bacardi would be able to sue Pernod Ricard, the French      spirits distributor, currently marketing Havana Club rum      worldwide. Bacardi claims that Pernod Ricard's rum is being      produced in the old Bacardi distillery in the city of      Santiago de Cuba.       Here is how this vexatious scheme will work if Helms-Burton      becomes law. The former landowner of a tobacco farm files a      suit in federal court against British-American Tobacco and      seeks damages. If both sides want to avoid prolonged      litigation they can reach an out-of-court settlement whereby      the former tobacco grower can now share in the profits of the      ongoing B.A.T.-Brazilian joint venture in Cuba. Likewise,      Bacardi could reach a settlement to get a share of Pernod      Ricard's profits from sales of Havana Club internationally.       These agreements do not need the blessing of the U.S.      Government. This is the million dollar loophole in Helms-     Burton. The bill states: ``an action [lawsuit] . . . may be      brought and may be settled, and a judgment rendered in such      action may be enforced, without the necessity of obtaining      any license or permission from any agency of the United      States.''       What will be the practical result? Foreign companies like      Pernod Ricard and British-American Tobacco are unlikely to      abandon viable operations in Cuba because of a lawsuit. More      likely, these foreign businessmen will agree, reluctantly, to      pay off Cuban exiles suing under Helms-Burton. Given the      choice of forfeiting millions of dollars invested in Cuba or      their financial interests in the United States, the practical      business solution might be to give the exiles a cut of the      action. Far better to have 90 percent of something than 100      percent of nothing, these businessmen will reason. Allowing      Cuban Americans a share of their profits will just be      factored in as another cost of doing business.       Indeed, Helms-Burton gives the Cuban exile community a      strong financial stake in Castro's Cuba. If the foreign      businesses simply withdrew in the face of Helms-Burton, the      exiled tobacco, sugar and rum interests would get nothing.      But if British-American Tobacco or Pernod Ricard or any other      foreign firm now doing business with the Castro regime offers      an out-of-court settlement to Cuban American exiles, who is      going to turn them down? Given the option, at least some      people are going to choose personal enrichment over the      principle of not doing business with Fidel. After all, Fidel      has been in power for 37 years, and the exiles are not      getting any younger.       The Clinton White House is not unaware of the scam at the      heart of the bill. Before the shooting down of the plane, the      President had objected to the provisions allowing U.S.      nationals to sue companies doing business in Cuba. During      last week's conference with Congress, the President's men      surrendered and asked for a face-saving compromise: a      provision giving the President the right to block such deals      later on if they do not advance the cause of democracy in      Cuba. But how likely is Clinton to block Cuban Americans in      Florida, a key election state, from suing Castro's foreign      collaborators later in the final months of an election year?      Not very.       The bottom line is that Clinton, in the name of getting      tough with Castro, has endorsed a bill that allows the      embargo to be evaded and protects Cuban Americans who want to      legally cut deals to exploit their former properties in Cuba      while the rest of the American business community must watch      from the sidelines.       In fact, the legislation could encourage a massive influx      of new foreign investment in Cuba. Armed with the      extortionist powers conferred by the legislation, former      property holders could shop around the world for prospective      investors in Cuba and offer them a full release on their      property claim in exchange for a ``sweetheart'' lawsuit      settlement entitling them to a piece of the economic action.      Thus, the embargo is legally bypassed and everyone laughs all      the way to the bank.       Actually, not everyone would benefit. The Clinton-endorsed      version of Helms-Burton only exempts the wealthiest cabal of      Cuba's former elites from the embargo's restraints. The bill      will only allow those whose former property is worth a      minimum value of $50,000 (sans interest) to file suits. And      you had to be very rich to have owned anything of that value      in Cuba in 1959. If you were a Cuban butcher, baker or      candlestick maker, too bad. This bill is not for you.       What could be more useful to Castro in his efforts to shore      up his standing with the Cuban people? The spectacle of the      U.S. Congress kowtowing to these Batista-era plantation      owners and distillers provides Fidel his most effective      propaganda weapon since the Bay of Pigs debacle. Castro      surely knows that the overwhelming majority of the Cuban      people--60 percent of whom were born after 1959--would deeply      resent what can be characterized, not unfairly, as an attempt      to confiscate their properties and revert control over Cuba's      economy to people who symbolize the corrupt rule of the      1950s. Rather than undermining Castro's rule, this bill would      drive the people into his camp.       Where is the logic in denying the vast majority of the      American people the right to become economically engaged in      Cuba if it is extended to only a select, wealthy few? Is the      concept of ``equal protection under the law'' served if non-     Cuban Americans are now relegated to the status of second-     class citizens? Or is the real intent of this bill to allow      rich Cuban exiles the opportunity to get a jump start and      thereby head off the ``gringo'' business invasion certain to      follow the demise of the embargo and the inevitable passing      of Castro.       Let us put an end to this special interest subterfuge.      Whatever obligation the United States had to my fellow Cuban      Americans has been more than fulfilled by providing us safe      haven and the opportunity to prosper and flourish in a free      society. Providing us, once again, another special exemption      which makes a mockery of the American Constitution, laws and      courts, not to mention making a farce of U.S.-Cuba policy, is      an insult to both the American and Cuban people.       If we are going to lift the embargo for a few wealthy      exiles then, fine, let us lift it for all Americans. To be      fair and consistent,     why not liberate the entire American community to bring the      full weight if its influence to bear upon Cuban people?      Implementing an aggressive engagement policy to transmit our      values to the Cuban people and to accelerate the burgeoning      process of reform occurring on the island has a far better      chance of ending Castro's rule than the machinations of      Helms-Burton.                          ____________________
