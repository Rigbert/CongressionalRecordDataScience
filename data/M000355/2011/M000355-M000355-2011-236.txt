 President, I rise today to honor Dr. Paul Smith, a physician whose story has been chosen to be recorded as part of the London, KY, ``Living Treasures'' project.  Dr. Smith's career path began when he graduated pre-med from Cumberland College in 1949 at age 19. After attending the University of Kentucky, where he hitchhiked to class every day, Dr. Smith was accepted into the University of Louisville medical school. Unable to obtain a rural scholarship through traditional channels, Dr. Smith received a scholarship from the Tri-County Women's Club in Knox, Whitley, and Laurel counties. The only condition was that he return to one of the counties and practice medicine there for 4 years.  Before being called up for service in the U.S. Air Force, Dr. Smith worked for a doctor in Cumberland, where he met his wife. After a year of dating, Dr. Smith and his wife of 53 years, Ann, were married and moved together to the Lake Charles Air Force base in Louisiana. Their daughter Jan was born on base as Smith trained and served as a doctor.  After completing his service with the Air Force, Dr. Smith moved to London and opened up his own practice. He routinely made dozens of house calls to London residents--both in the city and out in the country. Dr. Smith also offered OB services and often worked in the emergency room of nearby Marymount Hospital when other doctors were too busy.  After 38 years of dedicated service to the London community, Dr. Smith retired in 1998. Even in his retirement,Dr. Smith volunteers at the free medical clinic run at the Community Christian Church.  The State of Kentucky is lucky to have individuals like Dr. Paul Smith, who dedicate their lives to better those of others. As he has shown us all, Dr. Smith is truly a great Kentuckian.  Mr. President, the Laurel County-area newspaper the Sentinel Echo recently published a detailed interview with Dr. Smith and his wife in which they discuss Dr. Smith's accomplishments and contributions. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 [From the Sentinel-Echo, May 25, 2011]                   London's Living Treasures: Part 2       Following is the second installment of the Living Treasures      Project. It is the story of Dr. Paul Smith, who served Laurel      County as a family physician for 38 years. Dr. Smith shared      fascinating details about his life as a medical student and      doctor, which meant hitchhiking to class, making house calls      and working with the nuns at Marymount Hospital. During his      interview, Dr. Smith was joined by his wife of 53 years, Ann.       ``I used to go to the library when I was in high school and      read all the books I could about family physicians, some of      them from Kentucky and otherwise, just the real stories of      rural physicians. I took pre-med at Williamsburg's Cumberland      College, graduated with a diploma after two years, in 1949. I      was 19.                            Working student       After I finished Williamsburg, I needed funds to go on to      the University of Kentucky. I ended up getting an emergency      certificate to teach at Henderson Settlement in Frakes, Ky.,      for one year and saved up enough. I had an aunt who worked      there, and I had room and board pretty much for free except      I'm sure my parents gave them a lot of vegetables. I saved      all my money and went to University of Kentucky in 1950.       Those years were very lean and, unfortunately with no car      or transportation, I hitchhiked every day back and forth to      the university. I went to work at the narcotic hospital out      at Leestown Pike in Lexington usually at 4 p.m. After      classes, I'd have to scurry over to Leestown Pike and put my      thumb out and just barely make it to work, usually.       Before I finished my degree, the Korean War started. I had      applied for medical school, but I hadn't heard anything. I      had already been called up for the draft, passed my physical      for the Army. They would defer you a semester at a time but      by then they were getting hard up to give deferrals to      everybody, so there was a good possibility I was going to      have to go to the service.       When I was home for Christmas vacation, I got my letter of      acceptance to the medical school at the University of      Louisville, the only one I could afford even though the      tuition was just $800 a year. It felt great because that's      what I wanted. When I got accepted, my father went to the      bank in Pineville to try to borrow money and the banker said,      ``No, not on a medical student, too many of them flunk out.''       I got deferred and finished the year and went on to      Louisville.       When I went back to medical school my sophomore year, I got      a job as an extern at Baptist. We'd do histories and      physicals of patients and, every third night, I was on call      for the lab.       When I finished medical school, there was still a doctor's      draft. You had to do two years in the service unless you were      over 35 or unless you were in the service before. That was      looming over me when I finished medical school, but I still      had my internship to complete, which I did at Good Samaritan      Hospital in Lexington in 1957.       When I finished, I joined the Air Force. I knew I'd be      called in six to 12 months, so I had to look for a job.      Finally, one of the surgeons told me that he knew this      surgeon in Lynch and Cumberland that could use a doctor. I      signed on with him and that's the best thing I did in my life      because that's where I met my wife.                           Marriage material       How'd we meet? Her mother had to have her gallbladder out      and she can tell it better than I can.       ANN: I went back home to teach school, but they put me in      first grade. I did everything to try to do a crash course on      elementary. I was cutting paper dolls for my students,      preparing for the next day. Paul walked in and when he walked      out, I said, ``Mother, I think I'm going to marry that guy.''      She said, ``Just hush.'' He's the only person I ever pursued.       DR. SMITH: I was real impressed with her, but I was a      little leery. I rented a room in Cumberland. I'd usually go      to the drive-in at night and eat. Well, she and another girl      started showing up there about every night. I got suspicious,      but my impression was good all along.       I was in Cumberland almost a year to the day. I was called      into the service on the 5th of July. In the meantime, though,      we dated and got married June 14, 1958, Flag Day. It was a      nice wedding. Like most people, I thought we were going to      have a little wedding and when I went in, the church was      full.       ANN: It was a small church. And my mother had decorated it      with a lot of mountain flowers.       DR. SMITH: We went together to the service and we went to      basic training. I had to go four weeks in Montgomery, Ala.      That was an awakening too because neither one of us liked the      racism. I didn't like that at all.       In training, doctors had to go out and shoot one time. I      can't say I hit a thing. I'd shot a BB gun before and a .22,      but they put a .45 in my hand for the first time. I aimed      perfectly at the target and when I pulled it, it went up like      that. I shot my however-many rounds I had to shoot. I only      went to the rifle range once but we marched and flew in      airplanes a lot.       In October '58, I was assigned to Lakes Charles, La. It was      a small base, the hospital was constructed during the war so      it was not very fancy, but it was a nice base. That's where      we had our first daughter, Jan.       Now, I've got to go back and fill in before I went to      medical school, because that's important. I'd applied for a      rural scholarship and I was sure with my grades I would get      one. But it seemed they'd given all of them out. At that      time, I was going to have to hold up medical school for a      year to earn what I needed, but one of the students ahead of      me knew the Tri-County Women's Club from Knox, Whitley and      Laurel had raised money for a rural scholarship and, to their      knowledge, it had never been filled. I interviewed and they      were in favor of me getting it. With the scholarship, I      agreed I would go back to practice in Knox, Whitley or Laurel      for four years.       That was one reason I didn't even consider staying in the      service because I had that obligation, and I felt it was a      deep obligation.                          Laurel County-bound       I found out Dr. Robert Pennington in London might need a      doctor. I came over here and it was a Wednesday afternoon and      Dr. Pennington was off on Wednesday afternoon and he showed      me all around town.       I didn't have an office, but it turns out that Dr.      Pennington and his brother had an office built up over the      old fire department on Broad Street. It had a space for a lab      and space for three examining rooms and a waiting room,      already plumbed and wired. So that looked good and the rent      looked good, $65 a month.       Then the next day, Dr. Pennington located me a house I      could rent. It was up on Falls Road. We unloaded on July 5,      1983 and I got busy getting my office together because, see,      I had no equipment. Marymount Hospital was nice to me, they      loaned me one or two of the bedside tables. My brother was      doing a residency in surgery in Lexington and they wanted to      get rid of an old surgical table. Owner of The Sentinel,      Martin Dyche, through him, I got a Cole metal desk, a filing      cabinet and a chair.       Next to my office, there was the taxi park and they had      five or six taxis there. They were busy all the time. They      had a ringer out there on the telephone pole so you could      hear it ring all the time.       London was a rural town, everything closed on Wednesday at      noon except me. I decided, since most of the doctors took off      on Wednesday afternoon that I was going to work and I'd take      off on Thursday afternoon.       We had three drug stores, the original Begley's, Robert      Dyche had Dyche Drug Store and then there was City Drug      Store, it was down near where the theatre is now, where the      old Hob Nob used to be. Of course London Bucket was here,      which handled plumbing, Hoskin's Five and Ten, and then the      department stores, you had Hackney's, Daniel's, and several      others. Where Weaver's is now was their pool hall and women      were not allowed in the pool hall. If Ann or somebody wanted      their hotdog, they had a window up there and they'd sell you      the hotdog out the window. It was a bustling little Main      Street, but don't expect anything after 5 o'clock.       I opened my practice about July 15, and I averaged four to      five patients a day the first year and I couldn't have paid      my rent with that because an office visit was $3 and a house      call was $5 in the city and $10 outside in the county. But I      made a lot of house calls, some I got paid for, some I      didn't.       ANN: We ate well. In those first years I learned to can      beans, freeze corn, I learned to do so much. They brought not      just a bushel of beans, but two or three. It was      overwhelming, by then I had three little kids to take care      of--Jan, Elizabeth and Paul Ray--but I felt like it was a sin      not to use that food. But anyway, we did know it would be      slow for the first couple of years, so we planned ahead.       DR. SMITH: We didn't want to go in debt and we didn't. I      probably made most of my money in the E.R. The other doctors      were all so busy they didn't care about leaving their office      full of patients and running to the emergency room. So I got      called all the time to the E.R. and that's how I picked up a      lot of patients, because they had to be healthy to climb two      floors of steps up to my office.       In 1961, in March or April, Dr. D.D. Turner decided he was      going to quit general practice and go into the health      department in western Kentucky. He came to see me about      taking over his practice. I was happy because then I'd be on      a ground floor, they wouldn't have to climb those steps. Then      things started picking up.       Our days were 24-7. Five of us physicians did OBs. When I      came here, three of the doctors were still delivering at      home. I told them up front I wasn't going to do home      deliveries. I told them I was charging $50 for     delivery, $10 for a circumcision. I tell you, you didn't make      any money back then if you were in medicine. Not here. Many      of a time I would leave at 7 in the morning and make rounds      and I'd come home for dinner, maybe, but I'd go out again and      make house calls. I would make 10 or 12 house calls a day.       A year after I started, we moved from the house on Falls      Street.       ANN: But then Dr. Pennington, he was always finding stuff      for us. He knew this house on Ninth Street was going on the      market. He said don't tell a soul.       DR. SMITH: So we moved here. Dr. Pennington decided for us.      For one thing, look how close it is to the hospital. I could      go over there and be in the delivery room in three or four      minutes.       Marymount was run by the Sisters. It was great to work with      them, I never could remember all their names, I was bad about      that, I'd call them all ``Sister.'' We had eight or 10 of      them up here. They were great to work with, they were very      good nurses.                          Changes in medicine       When I first came here, polio was dying down because the      first vaccine had come out. But measles was the big thing. We      didn't have any measles vaccinations, and it wouldn't be      unusual to go out to a house and see a kid with 104, 105      temperature with measles and two or three other siblings with      measles. The only thing you could do is advise them how to      bathe them, how to cool them off.       Mumps, had a lot of mumps. And, of course, pneumonias and a      lot of hepatitis. One year, just in my practice, I had two or      three kids from the high schools where they still had outdoor      toilets. They would come in with jaundice and they had      hepatitis, and of course we didn't have any vaccines.       A lot of changes have occurred. Technology is one of the      biggest changes and it's good and bad. It's good because we      can now do a better job with some things. In the 1960s, we      didn't have any Echocardiograms. CT or MRI hadn't been heard      of. The part that I don't like that's changed is doctors no      longer sit and do history and physicals and talk to people.      When I was externing during medical school, each history and      physical, you'd spend 30 to 40 minutes. None of this five-     minute stuff.       I quit OB in '85 because we were getting some OB doctors in      and also malpractice had gotten so bad. When we got more      lawyers, that's when things changed, that's it, that's what      changed it. I want to say around early '70s.       Medicine changed so. The insurance companies would fight      you constantly in your office and you had to fight constantly      to get people in the hospital. You'd be arguing with some      nurse up in Chicago or somewhere. That's when my blood      pressure started going up, honestly.       I closed my office in 1998, but I've worked some since      then, I'd work some now if I didn't have back trouble. I      loved being a doctor, listen, I still do. I help with the      free clinic now at the Community Christian Church. I liked      that you could see people from the time they were born until      they died. And you followed them all the way through. I loved      all of it, really, just taking care of the families, getting      to know the people.''                          ____________________
