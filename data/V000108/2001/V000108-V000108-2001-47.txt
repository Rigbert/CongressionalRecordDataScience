Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman yielding, and I also rise in opposition to the amendment. I appreciate the gentlewoman's concern, but I would also voice the opinion that it is very premature, because this is, after all, about Yucca Mountain, and the site has not been decided upon. The chairman mentioned 6, 7 years. It might be longer than that, and the gentlewoman also suggested that while language in the report that talks about the State of Nevada transportation problem, we should be concerned about other States.  I would just read a sentence or two from the committee report from page 119. This is our language: ``The Department should use available funds in fiscal year 2002 to initiate the selection of transportation routes in Nevada and other States in cooperation with the States and to begin planning for construction of a rail line to the repository site.''  So again, reluctantly, I also am very opposed to the gentlewoman's amendment.
