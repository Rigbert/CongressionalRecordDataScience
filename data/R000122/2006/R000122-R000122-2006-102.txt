 We face a challenging and exciting time in the evolution of America's health care system. Today, roughly 40 million men and women are over age 65. A full doubling of the elderly population is predicted to occur by the year 2030--with the first of the baby boom generation turning 65 in the year 2011--only 5 years from now.  Nowhere is the aging of the population more apparent than in my home State of Rhode Island. We exceed the national average in terms of citizens over the age of 65 as well as those over the age of 85. In a State of slightly more than a million people, almost 15 percent of the population is over the age of 65 today. According to Census Bureau estimates, the number of elderly is expected to increase to 18.8 percent of Rhode Island's population by 2025. Rhode Island also has one of the highest concentrations of persons age 85 and over in the country.  Dramatic increases in life expectancy over the last century can be attributed to tremendous advances in public health and medical research.
