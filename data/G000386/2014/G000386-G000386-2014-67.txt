 President, this afternoon we are going to vote on the nomination of Ms. Burwell to be the Secretary of HHS. I am going to support that nomination. I am here on the floor to alert people to some of the problems she will face and hopefully she can correct.  For starters, I hope that everybody remembers the government has checks and balances. Congress passes laws, the executive branch enforces them, and it is our responsibility to make sure that those laws are enforced according to the intent of Congress. When they are not enforced, we have a responsibility to point that out, and that is what I will be doing. I hope she will be able to correct the issues that my colleagues and I will be pointing out this morning.  We also have a situation where Congress passed the Affordable Care Act, and in that process the President has done a lot of things that some of us think are illegal and in some cases even unconstitutional. Hopefully, she, as the new director, will make sure that those practices don't continue.  When Ms. Burwell was nominated, I said that anyone put in charge of ObamaCare would be set up to fail.
