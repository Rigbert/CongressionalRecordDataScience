President, today I would like to recognize Richard Gauthier, Chief of Police in Bennington, VT. Mr. Gauthier has been saving lives and protecting Vermont communities for nearly 30 years.  Chief Gauthier began his career with the Bennington Police Department in 1980 after graduating from the Vermont Police Academy in Pittsford. Six years later, he was promoted to detective, and in 1998, he was named chief of the department, a position he has held for the past 12 years.  Chief Gauthier received his bachelor's degree from Southern Vermont College in 1991, and later attended the FBI National Academy. He also holds a master's degree in criminal justice administration from Norwich University. As chief, he has led by example and consistently sought to improve the department, encouraging officers to seek additional education, improve their training and better their performance. He currently teaches courses in criminal justice at Southern Vermont College, his alma mater, where one former student described him as ``a phenomenal educator.''  During his time as chief, he has overseen a number of positive changes in the department and in the community including the formation of the Bennington County Child Advocacy Center/Special Victims Unit, of which he is a founding member. He also led efforts to specialize police investigation into drugs and gangs, and managed the department's move to a new police headquarters. A celebrated law enforcement officer, Chief Gauthier received the Vermont VFW Law Enforcement Officer of the Year in 2005 and the Vermont Commissioner's Award for Service to Children and Families.  Chief Gauthier will celebrate 30 years of service in September, and plans to step down as Chief of Police. I commend Chief Gauthier for his dedication to the city of Bennington and the State of Vermont. He has selflessly given so much to his community.  I ask unanimous consent that a story from The Bennington Banner about Chief Gauthier's career be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Bennington Banner, Jan. 6, 2010] BPD's Chief Gauthier Retiring: 30-Year Veteran of Force Plans To Step                            Down in September                          (By Neal P. Goswami)       Bennington.--Bennington Police Chief Richard Gauthier, a      longtime member of the town police force, has informed      officials of his decision to retire in the fall.       The 54-year-old Gauthier, appointed to the post in 1998,      will reach the age of 55 and his 30th anniversary with the      Bennington Police Department in September.       ``I do have other goals that I want to achieve, and that      would be a good time to start that,'' Gauthier said Wednesday      in his downtown office. ``When I came on 30 years ago when I      was 25, I made up my mind at that point that I was going to      finish here if at all possible, and that's what happened.''       Gauthier joined the force two days after his 25th birthday,      as a patrol officer. Six years later, he joined the Bureau of      Criminal Investigations. After 12 years, and having reached      the rank of sergeant, Gauthier was tapped by Town Manager      Stuart A. Hurd to replace former Chief David Wooden.       ``He was, I think, in the end, an excellent appointment. It      was one of my first major appointments I had to face as town      manager and, believe me, I was very, very nervous about it,''      Hurd said Wednesday.       ``I say, more power to him. I certainly hate to lose him,      and I think it's going to be an interesting process to try      and replace him,'' he said. ``Overall, there isn't anything      bad you can say about Rick Gauthier.''       Gauthier said his initial goal in police work was to become      a detective, but his ambitions grew as he ascended the ranks      of the department.       ``That was as far forward as I was thinking at the time,''      Gauthier said. ``Later on, after I had been at (the Bureau of      Criminal Investigation) for a while, I began entertaining the      potential, but I was still surprised when I was actually      chosen.''       Hurd said Gauthier was selected from a group of three      internal candidates. Gauthier had a degree in criminal      justice and as head of the police union had worked well with      town officials, Hurd said.       ``He brought all of those skills and all of those      management styles, and in a sense, balance, to the police      chief job in Bennington,'' he said.       Locals involved in the legal system had also vouched for      him, Gauthier said.       ``In talking with people in the law enforcement field--the      state's attorney's office, lawyers who had worked with him--     he really seemed to be heads and tails above everybody else      in terms of his knowledge in police work,'' Hurd said.       For Gauthier, the highlight of his career in Bennington has      been the ``ability to help people out that desperately need      it at the time.'' As chief, being able to shape the      department and focus improvements on training, equipment and      the professionalism of the department has been most      rewarding, he said.       Gauthier said the department has made substantial in those      areas because of a quality command staff. ``I have what I      consider to be a superior staff, a superior supervisory      staff, and certainly this is a team effort,'' he said ``We      are where we are because we have all worked together and      done well.''       A strong relationship with other town officials has helped,      too, Gauthier said.       ``I'm kind of the envy of a lot of other chiefs around the      state. My relationship with (Hurd) is excellent. We've      disagreed on a couple of things, but the disagreements have      always been kind of minor,'' Gauthier said. ``I've also had      what I consider to be a very supportive select board,      regardless of the members changing.''       Hurd agreed that any disagreements the two have had have      been ``nothing of merit.''       ``He's always been a part of the team. He's never been sort      of egocentric, or sort of self-centered.       ``He's always been willing to step up when tough budget      times are necessary, and people have to look at their budgets      very hard and make tough decisions,'' Hurd said.       Gauthier said he has tried to encourage the officers he      commands to ``seek constant improvement,'' and hopes that      will be a lasting legacy with the department.       ``I hope that if I leave anything here, it's that      continuous quest to improve all the time--improve yourself      educationally, improve your performance as an officer,      improve your training.''       He has followed his own advice, earning a master's degree      while serving as chief, and may pursue a doctorate degree      following his retirement.       Employment outside of law enforcement is likely, Gauthier      said, who already teaches courses at Southern Vermont      College. He remains coy, however, about his full plans.      ``I've got a number of irons in the fire, and as I get closer      to my actual retirement date, it will become clearer which      one is the way I should go,'' he said.       Hurd said he intends to first look within the department to      find Gauthier's replacement. The hope is to have someone on      board at least 30 days before Gauthier departs, he said.       The search, once it begins, is expected to take at least      two months. Hurd said he will create a review panel composed      of himself, some select board members and possibly former      Vermont State Police Director James Baker or former      Bennington County Sheriff Gary Forrest. The panel will      interview potential candidates, compare resumes to the     job requirements and conduct a ``deep reference check.''       ``You're looking for somebody who understands the law, but      you're looking for somebody who has the personality to      command but also to lead. I think there is a bit of a      difference. You can be a good commander, but you might not be      a good leader,'' Hurd said. ``Hopefully, I'll be able to find      somebody with similar management skills and personality.''       At least two members of the department are interested in      the position, according to people familiar with their      thinking. Lt. Paul Doucette, currently second in the      department's chain of command, and Detective Sgt. David S.      Rowland, the third highest ranking officer in the department,      have expressed interest, sources said.       Hurd said he doesn't expect any long-term negative impact      from the internal search. ``If you're goal is to stay and      work and be a leader in Bennington then you're going to have      to take some disappointment, because there's only going to be      one chief. I'm prepared for that, and I think I'll be able to      deal with it.''                          ____________________
