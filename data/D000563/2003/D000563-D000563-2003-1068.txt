I hope sooner rather than later there will be a Hispanic on the United States Supreme Court. If you look at this nominee, Miguel Estrada, it is really instructive to me that the Hispanic Caucus of Congress has come out in opposition to his nomination. Some have dismissed that and said there are three Republican Hispanics in the House who favor his nomination. I am going to make that part of the Record. I ask unanimous consent if I might have a list of letters in opposition and concern to the nomination of Miguel Estrada be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:  Letters of Opposition to and Concern About the Nomination of Miguel               Estrada to the D.C.
