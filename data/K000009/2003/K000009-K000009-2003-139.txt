Pallone) and the gentleman from Oregon (Mr.DeFazio) for participating and spearheading this special order this evening. I think when the gentleman from New Jersey reminded us that the current recession was triggered back in March of 2001, we have to ask ourselves, well, what happened there? What happened was again rising oil prices in the global market, which America does not control because we are totally dependent on imports, thrust us into a recession which has only gotten worse and all the pump priming on Wall Street cannot draw us out of it because we are not energy independent. Oil just went up to $33 a barrel. There is instability obviously in the Middle East, certainly in Venezuela, Colombia, all these places where we are getting our oil, and the kind of short-term stimulus package that you are talking about would be an immediate shot in the arm here in the United States of America, whether it is building bridges, whether it is putting a small tax refund in the pockets of Americans that they can go out and buy things, ordinary Americans who are having trouble meeting ends from paycheck to paycheck. But beyond that, looking at how we can create entire new industries in this country so that we do not have to send our men and women to war for oil but, rather, that we can invest here at home.  Can you imagine the sentinel call it would be across just rural America if we really racheted up biofuels production and ethanol and biodiesel from coast to coast, what we could do to replace 25 percent of what we are importing today? I really wanted to say to both of my dear colleagues that there was an editorial in the New York Times on January 5 by Tom Friedman called ``A War for Oil.'' I would like to place it in the Record this evening as a part of this discussion and to say with all the pomp and circumstance that occurred here in the House today, the reality is we are faced with a likelihood that we will be at war with Iraq very soon. To do so at a time when we are suffering this major recession here at home, where we have got these rising oil prices globally and we are not energy independent, we are going into huge debt in terms of the government with all these tax payouts left and right to some of the wealthiest people in our country and no help for job creation here in this country, even in the key industry where we are totally vulnerable, that is, new fuels production.                              {time}  1815  We are importing over 60 percent of what we consume today and paying exorbitant prices for it, and Mr. Friedman says in his article that any war we launch in Iraq will certainly be in part about oil and that the Bush team is preparing to launch that war for oil and to deny the fact is actually laughable. And he says that the Bush policy towards North Korea has made it abundantly clear that the war with Iraq indeed is about oil.  The question is whether it is only about oil. And I am sure that the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio), who has been a leader in new-fuels production and energy independence for America, in his own region when we consider the biomass that is out there that could be turned to new-fuels production we can see the jobs and the investment here in the United States that could happen if we would really propel this new industry forward.  What good does it do to give shareholders in multinational oil companies on Wall Street more dividends when those dollars do not have to be invested in this country at all? So much of what Wall Street has been doing is not investing in the United States. They have been moving jobs to Mexico. The other day I just bought some windshield wipers for my car, turned the package over, made in Mexico. In fact I have a question. Is anything made in America anymore? If we look at this past holiday shopping season, what is actually out there that we make? I am glad we can still make bridges if we would only fund them in our country, but try to find an American-made clock, American-made clothing. I just talked to a gentleman today downstairs. He said, Boy, I wish I could find a good pair of shoes. He said, My feet are killing me. And I said, Well, they are not made in America anymore.  What is it that we do make that is not being outsourced somewhere else? So the recession is being exacerbated by the fact that so much of what Wall Street has done with the money is not to put it here but to put it elsewhere where they can pay slave wages to people and then ship all those goods back here. So all this investment, I would be very interested in entertaining a proposal from the Bush administration to require that any benefits to Wall Street be invested in the USA and to do it in a stimulus plan in some of the key sectors where we are strategically vulnerable, including energy, where we are totally dependent on these international imports now more and more every day.  And when we think about the fact that Iraq has the second largest reserves in the world, one of my questions of the Bush administration is, if they are going to go in and take over these reserves, who is going to benefit? Which companies are going to get the benefit of that? Maybe we should do some windfall profits taxes on the companies that are going to be getting all these Iraqi oil concessions and then use those dollars to buy down our public debt and pay off some of the bills that are being added every day with the tax cuts to the wealthiest people in this country.  So I just am very interested in what Tom Friedman said here, and he even talks about handing out drilling concessions to U.S. oil companies and how are those decisions going to be made by the administration. How is the administration going to get through this issue of nation-building in Iraq? Is this going to be like Somalia? I thought we were not supposed to be involved in nation-building. We are not out of Afghanistan yet. We are paying more and more and more every day. Our troops are on the ground there. Of course there is a press blackout; so you really do not know everything that is happening. We are not going to be out of there for years. The President of Afghanistan was on the board of Unical Oil Company, and when one looks at the movement of oil globally, it is obvious that control of that country and the movement of pipelines is really very essential to the global movement of oil, which is a diminishing world resource.  So the real question I have is, if we are going to have a stimulus package, how do we get investment here at home and how do we displace particularly in the energy area the kind of imports that have now moved us to the brink of war again in the most oil-rich region of the world? I am deeply concerned about the direction of this country and whether or not we have an exit strategy from Iraq. And when we look at the amount of money we are going to be spending on defense in order to move these troops and planes and ships for long periods of time now, the Ohio National Guard just had the longest deployment in Ohio history in that part of the world, and they have just returned home, building airfields, preparing.  This is costing an enormous amount. Imagine if we could invest those dollars here at home and create entire new industries, not just off biofuels, ethanol and biodiesel in the rural countryside, but what about photovoltaics to really rachet up our knowledge in that key area and manufacture those systems here in the United States not just for use here at home but for use abroad, to really move us into renewable resources of energy for the future. What an incredible job creator that would be, good jobs, high-paying jobs coast to coast in order to buy America true national security and energy independence here at home.  So I want to thank the gentleman for allowing me to share in this Special Order this evening and to say that I agree with Tom Friedman. I am not somebody who wants to go to war for oil. I think we should invest those dollars here at home and help America move beyond the petroleum age into a new age of renewables. I thank both gentlemen.  I include the following editorial for the Record:                [From the New York Times, Jan. 5, 2003]                             A War for Oil?                        (By Thomas L. Friedman)       Our family spent winter vacation in Colorado, and one day I      saw the most unusual site: two women marching around the      Aspen Mountain ski lift, waving signs protesting against war      in Iraq. One sign said: ``Just war or Just Oil?'' As I      watched this two-woman demonstration, I couldn't help notice      the     auto traffic whizzing by them: one gas-guzzling S.U.V. or      Jeep after another, with even a Humvee or two tossed in for      good measure. The whole scene made me wonder whether those      two women weren't--indeed--asking the right question: Is the      war that the Bush team is preparing to launch in Iraq really      a war for oil?       My short answer is yes. Any war we launch in Iraq will      certainly be--in part--about oil. To deny that is laughable.      But whether it is seen to be only about oil will depend on      how we behave before an invasion and what we try to build      once we're there.       I say this possible Iraq war is partly about oil because it      is impossible to explain the Bush team's behavior otherwise.      Why are they going after Saddam Hussein with the 82nd      Airborne and North Korea with diplomatic kid gloves--when      North Korea already has nuclear weapons, the missiles to      deliver them, a record of selling dangerous weapons to anyone      with cash, 100,000 U.S. troops in its missile range and a      leader who is even more cruel to his own people than Saddam?       One reason, of course, is that it is easier to go after      Saddam. But the other reason is oil--even if the president      doesn't want to admit it. (Mr. Bush's recent attempt to hype      the Iraqi threat by saying that an Iraqi attack on America--     which is most unlikely--``would cripple our economy'' was      embarrassing. It made the president as if he was groping for      an excuse to go to war, absent a smoking gun.       Let's cut the nonsense. The primary reason the Bush team is      more focused on Saddam is because if he were to acquire      weapons of mass destruction, it might give him the leverage      he has long sought--not to attack us, but to extend his      influence over the world's largest source of oil, the Persian      Gulf.       But wait a minute. There is nothing illegitimate or immoral      about the U.S. being concerned that an evil, megalomaniacal      dictator might acquire excessive influence over the natural      resource that powers the world's industrial base.       ``Would those women protesting in Aspen prefer that Saddam      Hussien control the oil instead--is that morally better?''      asks Michael Mandelbaum, the John Hopkins foreign policy      expert and author of ``The Ideas That Conquered the World.''      ``Up to now, Saddam has used this oil wealth not to benefit      his people, but to wage war against all his neighbors, build      lavish palaces and acquire weapons of mass destruction.''       This is a good point, but the Bush team would have a      stronger case for fighting a war partly for oil if it made      clear by its behavior that it was acting for the benefit of      the planet, not simply to fuel American excesses.       I have no problem with a war for oil--if we accompany it      with a real program for energy conservation. But when we tell      the world that we couldn't care less about climate change,      that we feel entitled to drive whatever big cars we feel      like, that we feel entitled to consume however much oil we      like, the message we send is that a war for oil in the gulf      is not a war to protect the world's right to economic      survival--but our right to indulge. Now that will be seen as      immoral.       And should we end up occupying Iraq, and the first thing we      do is hand out drilling concessions to U.S. oil companies      alone, that perception would only be intensified.       And that leads to my second point. If we occupy Iraq and      simply install a more pro-U.S. autocrat to run the Iraqi gas      station (as we have in other Arab oil states), then this war      partly for oil would also be immoral       If, on the other hand, the Bush team, and the American      people, prove willing to stay in Iraq and pay the full price,      in money and manpower, needed to help Iraqis build a more      progressive, democratizing Arab state--one that would use its      oil income for the benefit of all its people and serve as a      model for its neighbors--then a war partly over oil would be      quite legitimate. It would be a critical step toward building      a better Middle East.       So, I have no problem with a war for oil--provided that it      is to fuel the first progressive Arab regime, and not just      our S.U.V.'s, and provided we behave in a way that makes      clear to the world we are protecting everyone's access to oil      at reasonable prices--not simply our right to binge on it.
