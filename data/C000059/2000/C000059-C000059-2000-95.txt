Speaker, I rise in strong support of granting permanent normal trade relations, H.R. 4444, for the People's Republic of China.  I have long subscribed to Ronald Reagan's philosophy on dealing with adversaries: contain them militarily, engage them diplomatically and flood them with western goods and influences. I believe a similar combination will work on China.  Many Americans are rightly concerned about human rights; and religious and political freedom in China. However, rejecting normal trading practices with China will not improve freedom in China. In fact, it will plunge China further into isolation and reduce freedom.  Pat Robertson, with the Christian Broadcasting Network, and Rev. Richard Cizik, with the National Association of Evangelicals agree that engagement with China has and will continue to improve human rights in China.  Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I strongly encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to help our American economy improve human rights in China. Vote ``yes'' on H.R. 4444.
