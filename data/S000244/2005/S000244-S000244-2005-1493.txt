Chairman, I yield myself the balance of the time.  Mr. Chairman, contrary to what my distinguished friend from New Jersey says, there are no onerous new requirements to meet the standard for asylum. Page 2 of the managers amendment incorporated in the bill says the applicant has to establish that he is a refugee within the meaning of this section. The applicant must establish that race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular cultural group or political opinion was or will be a central reason for persecuting the applicant.  Now, that means that all of the Jewish people who were turned away on the St. Louis prior to the Second World War would have qualified because they were being persecuted in Nazi Germany because of their religion.  People who have been engaged in what was used to be called anti-Soviet activities in the former Soviet Union, that was a political opinion, they would have been eligible for asylum.  And the comments that the gentleman from New Jersey makes about torture are simply not true. This bill does not impact the obligations of the United States under the convention to prevent torture by prohibiting the deportation of people to countries that torture them.  Now, simply what is stated is that the burden of proof is on the applicant, just like it ought to be, like it is on our constituents who apply for Social Security disability. And it sets up standards for determining the credibility of the witness. If the witness comes and says, Gee, I made a mistake because I forgot the birth date and admits to that mistake, that certainly is exonerating evidence.  Vote down the amendment. All of these arguments are a red herring.
