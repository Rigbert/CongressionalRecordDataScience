President, in this age of digital readers and electronic books, the fine craft of bookbinding may seem to some archaic. On the contrary: the fine skills, patience, and dedication required to mend the pages of some of our greatest treasures have become all the more critical to preserving printed books--for classics printed decades or centuries ago, to cookbooks or children's books that have been in our families for generations.  At Holzer Book Bindery in Hinesburg, VT, Marianna Holzer, a third-generation bookbinder, is doing just that. Her shop is lined with leather bound books, many restored by her own hand, and hand operated cast-iron presses that help her with her handcraft. Her clients range from towns and municipalities, to personal collectors, and extend far beyond the mountains of Vermont.  In 1960, her father, 30 years her mother's senior, closed down his own bindery business in Boston to settle in Putney. Marianna was in high school when, years after her father passed away, her mother set up their own bindery in the basement. Here, Marianna learned the basics of bindery from her mother, using the storied tools of her father. After studying plant and soil science at the University of Vermont, Marianna found herself working at Four Seasons Garden Center in Williston before longing for something new. She ultimately returned to her bookbinding roots, joining a small bindery in Jericho before opening her own shop in 2008.  Marianna now works alongside her husband and folk musician, Rik Palieri, who assists her. Today, her challenges are even greater, as she battles multiple sclerosis. People send their books and heirlooms from around the country, seeking her dexterity and her expertise. For Marianna, it is her true love of preserving the past and the sentiment it brings others that makes her excel at her craft. She honors her family legacy by using her grandfather's logo as her own.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article about this exceptional Vermonter who has dedicated her life to bringing joy to others by repairing those precious keepsakes we chose to pass on to our loved ones: ``At Holzer Book Bindery, Repairing Old Volumes Is a Labor of Love.'' [Seven Days, February 19, 2014]  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                    [From Seven Days, Feb. 19, 2014]    At Holzer Book Bindery, Repairing Old Volumes Is a Labor of Love                          (By Ethan De Seife)       Any author who gets a publishing deal these days knows the      importance of e-books: Many readers now opt for pixels over      ink. At Holzer Book Bindery in Hinesburg, though, the book's      the thing. Owner Marianna Holzer, a third-generation      bookbinder, appreciates books as objects. Her love for      beautiful volumes and the increasingly rare craft of making      them by hand is evident in her shop, located on the ground      floor of her home. The place is filled with drawers of old      metal typesetting letters, rolls of buckram and leather, and      hand-operated, cast-iron book presses. Many of the hand tools      that Holzer, 58, uses were inherited from her father, Albert,      and grandfather, Ulrich, both of whom ran bookbinding shops      in Boston. Both men were known not only for the high quality      of their work, but for their personal investment in the books      they repaired. Said Holzer, ``My mom used to say that people      would bring their books to have them bound at the Holzer      Bindery, but they'd have to wait until everybody in the      family had read the book before they got it back.''       As a child, hanging around her father's shop, Holzer picked      up many of the finer points of this specialized art. A career      shift in the early 1980s brought her to Brown's     River Bindery, an operation that started in Jericho, then      moved to Essex. Holzer worked her way up to various      supervisory positions within the company.       When Brown's was reorganized and folded into a larger      bindery called Kofile, Holzer decided the time was right to      set up her own business. As it happened, her mother had      recently moved out of the downstairs apartment in Holzer's      home. That freed up the cozy space that, in 2008, Holzer      turned into her own bindery. To honor her family's craft      legacy, she still uses the logo from her grandfather's shop.       Though Holzer can and does create entire bound volumes from      scratch, most of her projects are repairs, often on the      beloved literary heirlooms of private clients. She can fix      torn pages or create new ones for old books, trimming new      folios, stitching them into signatures and assembling them      into custom bindings.       During Seven Days' visit to the bindery, Holzer was      performing surgery on some old, careworn, hardback copies of      two of L. Frank Baum's Oz novels. The client who'd brought      them wanted to resuscitate the books for sentimental reasons,      and they needed a great deal of attention. Nearly all of both      books' pages were brittle, tattered and detached from their      bindings, from which the glue had long since cracked and      flaked off. Still, Holzer estimated the job would take her      just a couple of days of mending, and only an hour or two to      sew the pages back together.       Holzer has multiple sclerosis, which can make such detailed      work difficult, so she's glad, she said, to have assistance      from her husband, folk musician Rik Palieri. In between his      concert tours, Palieri helps out on the larger binding      orders, including the municipal records of a number of      Vermont towns. (Holzer is reluctant to say which ones.)       Palieri professed admiration for the kind of beautiful,      hand-bound books that Holzer Bindery produces. The couple has      preserved and bound their own cherished keepsakes, such as an      original program from one of Buffalo Bill's Wild West shows.      Palieri's own daily journal is a huge, green, handcrafted      volume that would look right at home on the shelves of a city      planning office.       Repair jobs come into the bindery in what Holzer described      as a ``steady but not overwhelming supply.'' Every one is      different, and, she said, without first inspecting the book,      it's difficult to estimate the cost of the repairs. Prices      per piece range from about $100 to more than $1,000.       ``It will depend on what needs to be done, what the      customer wants, if we are trying to save all the original      material or make a new cover, and then that will depend on      whether it is in leather or imitation leather,'' Holzer      explained.       Demonstrating her craft to a visitor, Holzer smiled and      laughed frequently. She took particular delight in the gold      stamper, with which she embosses books' spines and covers      with shiny letters and designs. With this device, Holzer can      also turn strips of scrap leather into personalized      bookmarks, mementos that she gives visitors to the bindery.       Holzer's shop--along with the handful of other small      bookbinders scattered around the state--embodies the spirit      of quality artisanship associated with Vermont. Case in      point: Holzer mentioned a client from Houston, Texas, for      whom she bound a memorial Bible. Its owner had found Holzer      Bindery online and chosen the company specifically because of      its Vermont location, she said; to him, this guaranteed      careful craft.       Over cups of tea served beneath the cuckoo clock in her      kitchen, Holzer talked with Seven Days about the fine art of      fine books.       SEVEN DAYS: How did you get started in the bookbinding      business?       MARIANNA HOLZER: My father was 70 when I was born--30 years      older than my mother. I was pretty young when [his bindery]      was still going in Boston. He closed the business in 1960,      when he was 80, and moved to southern Vermont, to Putney. He      passed away when I was 11, and my mom set up a little bindery      later, when I was in high school, in the basement of our      house. She taught me a few basic things.       I went to UVM, [where I] studied plant and soil science. I      got a job at Four Seasons Garden Center [in Williston]. I      kind of got sick of that, and found out that there was this      small bindery [Brown's River Bindery] in Jericho, and went to      see them. That's how it began.       SD: What are all these tools used for?       MH: The board shears are basically a huge paper cutter; the      guillotine, which needs to be super-sharp, is for trimming      the edges of a book's pages. I use a lot of mending tissue,      which is a Japanese tissue used to fix rips and tears. The      rounding or backing hammer--one of my father's tools--I use      for rounding a book's spine. One of my favorite things to do      is the gold stamping, which presses down on a thin piece of      Mylar covered with 22-carat gold. That's how you decorate a      binding, letter by letter.       SD: What services do you offer?       MH: One thing I do here is deacidify paper. Anything before      the mid-1800s was printed on rag paper, which holds up quite      well. Newer paper is made with wood pulp, and we didn't know      until more recently how acidic it was. It gets really brittle      and cracks when you turn the pages. So we can deacidify the      paper, and it'll stop the progression of [the decay]--though      it won't bring it back [to its original condition].       SD: Bookbinding is such a niche field. What challenges does      your business face?       MH: It seems to me, in some ways, books are becoming more      precious as people realize they have certain books that they      want to preserve and pass on. Bibles are one thing. It's      cheaper to buy a new one, but [the owner has] written all      over it. Children's books--people have grown up with a book.      And cookbooks! People have written in them, or they have      their mother's cookbook. The newer versions they don't like      as much.       These days, newer bindings are single sheets that are just      glued in. When you open them up, they sometimes crack and      fall apart. And those are kind of hard to fix, because they      don't have enough of the margin that's necessary to drill the      holes for stitching. Older books tend to be in better shape.       SD: How does having MS affect your work as a binder?       MH: I just get really tired sometimes. It's almost like I'm      walking through mud or something. It's a big effort to do      things. It's also dexterity, fine motor control.       SD: Are you concerned about the new all-in-one machines      that can print a book from a digital file and then bind it?       MH: Not particularly. You see a book, and you never think      what goes into making it. They [bind books] by machine      nowadays. But if you want to repair a book, you can't do it      by machine.                          ____________________
