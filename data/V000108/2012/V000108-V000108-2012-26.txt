Chairman, the WRDA bill 2007, which was passed with much bipartisan support, so much so that it overcame a Presidential veto, authorized the Corps to undertake the Missouri River Ecosystem Restoration Plan and to develop the Missouri River Recovery Implementation Committee to consult on the study. This authority provided a venue for collaboration between the 70 stakeholder groups of tribes, States, public interest groups, and Federal agencies to develop a shared vision and comprehensive plan for the restoration of the Missouri River ecosystem.  At this time, by prohibiting the Corps from expending any 2013 funds on the study and the committee, we would continue to delay that start. I believe this would be very shortsighted and would lead to a further erosion of trust in the delicate partnership in the basin. While the Corps will continue to comply with Endangered Species' requirements through other activities, I believe there is a role for a long-term plan for this basin. Again, I would urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.  I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Luetkemeyer).  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it.
