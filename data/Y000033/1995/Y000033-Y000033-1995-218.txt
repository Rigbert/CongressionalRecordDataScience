Absolutely. What concerns me, we heard there were no hearings. There were hearings on this side of the aisle in 1994 under the committee on which the gentleman from California [Mr. Miller] was chairman at that time. I can tell you there is a difference in the makeup of the Congress today, but I want to get back, this is not Democrat and Republican, as the gentleman from Louisiana [Mr. Hayes] will tell you, the gentleman from Louisiana [Mr. Tauzin] will tell you, other people who have spoken, including myself. This is whether we are going to retain any type of domestic oil production in those areas that are very questionable in development.  So I am asking my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the motion offered by the gentleman from California to instruct conferees.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
