He has been a champion of polio eradication and his efforts have paid off in the continuing U.S. support for the global polio eradication effort. As my friend has said, for FY 2004, like in prior years, the House and Senate Foreign Operations subcommittees recommended $30 million and not less than $25 million, respectively. It is my expectation that USAID will provide $27.5 million in FY 2004. This is no time to reduce our support for this effort as we approach the finish line.  These funds will allow for accelerated polio eradication activities, improved surveillance for polio and other diseases, and support for cease-fires in conflict zones for National Immunization Days. The United States is the largest international donor for the Polio Eradication Initiative, and the success of this program should be a source of pride for all Americans.
