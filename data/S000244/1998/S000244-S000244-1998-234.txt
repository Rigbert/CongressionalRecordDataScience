Speaker, I rise to salute a colleague and a true patriot, Representative Sam Johnson of Texas. Today marks the 25th anniversary of Mr. Johnson's release from North Vietnam, where he was held as a prisoner of war for nearly seven years in the infamous Hanoi Hilton.  We have all heard stories of the horrific conditions endured by American servicemen who became pawns of the North Vietnamese asthe Vietnam conflict raged. Representative Johnson saw some of the worst. He has been quoted as saying, ``If hell is here on earth, it is located on an oddly shaped city block in downtown Hanoi, Vietnam.''  Isolation, starvation, and torture were almost certainly not what Representative Johnson envisioned as he participated in ROTC in college and moved on to a military career as an Air Force fighter pilot. Yet when his F-4 was shot down only two months into his second tour of duty in Vietnam, Representative Johnson took everything that was handed to him all the while heroically maintaining his pride in the country he serves to this day.  He was labeled a diehard by his guards and banished to solitary confinement for months at a time. A patriot throughout, Representative Johnson returned home an continued his military service until his retirement in 1979. He was elected to the House of Representatives in 1991, where he has repeatedly shown his dedication to responsible fiscal policy, family values, and America's patriotic heritage.  Since his return from Vietnam, Representative Johnson has received many awards in recognition of his service to his country, including two Silver Stars, two Purple Hearts, two Legions of Merit, the Distinguished Flying Cross, and one Bronze Star with Valor, among others.  Representative Johnson, our tribute today is not so prestigious an award. Yet it is meant to signify the gratefulness and respect of your colleagues for the service you have done your country and continue to do as a Member of this House. Representative Johnson, thank you. Your enduring will and patriotism in the face of unimaginable adversity is truly exemplary.                          ____________________
