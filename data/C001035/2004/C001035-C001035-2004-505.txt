President, I rise to speak on S.J. Res. 40, the Federal Marriage Amendment to the Constitution. Let me begin my remarks by plainly stating my position on the issues raised by this amendment.  First, it is my strong personal belief that marriage is between a man and a woman. Second, principles of federalism dictate that the right and the responsibility to define marriage belong to the States. Third, the proper role of the Federal Government is to ensure that each State can exercise that right and responsibility by preventing, as the Defense of Marriage Act does, one State from imposing its view on others.
