 President, others have been waiting patiently to speak. Let me say with regard to AMT, this is existing law we are trying to extend. With regard to the extenders, there is existing law we are trying to extend. We should not use that as an excuse to raise taxes on a whole lot of other Americans. That is something that virtually every member of my conference feels strongly about. We are going to continue to talk about it. I am still optimistic we are going to be able to get this worked out. The majority leader and I are good friends, and we are going to continue to work on all these issues in the hope that we can go forward in the few weeks remaining before Christmas.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
