Mr. Speaker, health care is a basic human right. It is unacceptable to see a young child die because his family could not afford for him to see a dentist. This should never, ever, happen in the United States of America. It is wrong. It must not be tolerated any longer, and today we said ``no more''.  This bill would give 6 million children access to health care. For our seniors who rely on Medicare, this bill helps our low-income seniors and makes prevention more affordable.  I applaud the work of Chairman Rangel and Chairman Stark for making these important improvements. I am proud to have worked on this bill to help those who suffer from chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease receive the highest quality care and to take the first of many steps towards preventing these terrible diseases.  Until we can make health care right for every American, we have a moral mission, a mission and a mandate to start with the most vulnerable among us, our children and our seniors. We can do no less. Vote ``yes'' on the CHAMP Act. Do it now. Do it today.
