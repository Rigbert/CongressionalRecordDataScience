 President, I rise today to pay tribute to an honored Kentuckian and a man of great accomplishment who proudly served our country. Mr. Martin Dock Scott, Jr. of Bowling Green, KY, passed away Wednesday, September 5, 2012, due to cancer. He was 65 years old.  I have great appreciation for Mr. Scott, as he lived such a remarkable life. After graduation from Menifee County High School, Mr. Scott served in the United States Army from 1966 to 1970. He served with B Company, 1st Battalion, 52nd Infantry, 198th Light Infantry Brigade. Thus far is evidence enough that Mr. Scott lived a worthy life, yet he continued onward, and so the list of his service and accomplishment also continues.  While in the military, Mr. Scott served in Chu Lai, Vietnam, and operated out of LZ Stinson and other landing zones. Needless to say, Mr. Scott put his life on the line for this country. In July 1970, Mr. Scott was honorably discharged.  Among his many military decorations, he earned two Bronze Stars. The first, with ``V'' Device, was awarded to Mr. Scott in February 1970 for expressing heroism under combined ground and mortar attack while his platoon was providing security for Dai Loc hamlet. The second medal was received in April 1970 for ``meritorious achievement in connection with military operations against a hostile force.''  Mr. Scott graduated from Eastern Kentucky University, married ViAnn Ford in November 1969, and started a family. I want to convey my deepest condolences to the many family members and friends who knew and were loved by Martin Dock Scott, Jr.  I would ask my U.S. Senate colleagues to join me in commemorating his commitment to service and in extending sympathies to the Scott family. The Commonwealth of Kentucky will be proud to remember the life and deeds of Mr. Martin Dock Scott, Jr.  Mr. President, an obituary for Mr. Scott as provided by the family recently appeared in local newspapers. I ask unanimous consent that said obituary be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows:       Bowling Green, KY.--Martin Dock Scott, Jr., 65, answered      his Lord's call on Wednesday, September 5, 2012, surrounded      by family at his residence following a brave battle with      cancer.
