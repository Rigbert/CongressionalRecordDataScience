 President, I rise to support my point of order and to say I agree on the need for long-term care insurance, a need to encourage family care giving through tax credits. The Senator and I have introduced legislation to accomplish that. Also, people need to remember that senior citizens who pay income taxes are going to benefit from our tax reduction as well.  The second and last point I will make is: This, again, is one more time of, I will bet, dozens of times over the last 4 days that we have had amendments from the other side to break up the rate structure, the bipartisan compromise in this bill. I ask we vote against waiving the point of order.
