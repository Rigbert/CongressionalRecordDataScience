Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Ms. Rachelle O'Neil, who served as a constituent services representative in my District Office for 15 years.  A Houston native who is proud of her Ragin'-Cajun roots, Rachelle is one of eight children born to the late Audrey Ann Colbert-O'Neil and George O'Neil, Sr. Her loving parents instilled a passion for education that inspires Ms. O'Neil to this day. In fact, Mr. Speaker, she recently graduated magna cum laude with master's degree in public administration from the University of Texas at Arlington.  While earning undergraduate degrees from the University of Houston in psychology and political science, Ms. O'Neil won the Mickey Leland Congressional Internship opportunity, which brought her to the U.S. Capitol where she worked in former Representative Carrie P. Meek's (D-FL) congressional office. The experience, which included meeting President Bill Clinton, cemented her passion in working on the behalf of the American people.  Within a few years of relocating to Atlanta, Ms. O'Neil joined my congressional staff, and Mr. Speaker, please trust me when I say that she hit the ground running. Rachelle assists constituents with judiciary, education, health, Social Security, child welfare, and transportation matters, and she is a tireless advocate for women and girls. Mr. Speaker, few people can match her passionate, fierce pursuit of justice and equity.  Over the years, Ms. O'Neil developed innumerable constituent service programs and initiatives, but perhaps none as personal as those that focus on future generations. Inspired by her time caring for Daniel, Princess, Annquenette, and TyRochelle, the children of her late twin sister, Michelle, Rachelle developed our office's Youth Council that sought to develop and engage young leaders in Metro Atlanta.  In her personal time, Ms. O'Neil puts family and service first--caring for her nieces, nephews, and mentees in the Through Their I's Mentoring Program, the Motherless Daughters Foundation, the Hank Stewart Foundation, and Source of Support. She also manages to make friends during her world travels and pursue exciting adventures like skydiving, white water rafting, and zip lining.  Mr. Speaker, when I look at Rachelle O'Neil, I see the spirit of Barbara Jordan and the fire of Shirley Chisholm. I am so proud to have her on my team, and I thank her for the many years of tireless service to our office and Georgia's Fifth Congressional District.                          ____________________
