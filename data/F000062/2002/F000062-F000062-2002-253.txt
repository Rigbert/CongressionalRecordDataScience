 President, I rise today to express my concern and dismay at the news of yet another suicide bombing in Jerusalem. My thoughts and prayers go out to the victims and their families.  Israel, a democratic state and a staunch friend and ally of the United States, has a simple desire that all sovereign nations share: that it may live in peace within secure and stable borders, free from the terror and senseless acts of violence.  I condemn this terrorism and those who carry it out. How many more innocent lives must be lost before Chairman Arafat takes decisive and concerted action to reign in the terrorists and put an end to their brutal campaign? He made a commitment at Oslo to settle the differences between Palestinians and Israelis peacefully and he must live up to that pledge.  I am pleased that President Bush has sent General Zinni back to the Middle East to broker a cease-fire and get both sides to adhere to the Tenet Plan. To put it mildly, he has a long road ahead of him and there is a lot of work to be done.  Three articles discuss the situation in the Middle East: one by Washington Times columnist Mona Charon, another by Libby Werthan from the Nashville Jewish paper, the Observer, and finally an article by Naomi Regan called ``Living in Parallel Universe.''  Each article in its own way describes some of the pain, anguish, and despair that Israelis feel over the continuing acts of violence and the collapse of the peace process. I urge my colleagues to read these articles and take their message to heart. Israel wants peace. Israel needs peace. Israel deserves peace.  I hope the day will come when I will not have to come to the Senate floor to condemn yet another bombing. Enough is enough. I urge General Zinni and the administration to do all that they can to help bring about an end the violence and the resumption of peace talks.  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the articles I cited.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:              [From the Augusta Chronicle, March 9, 2002]                    Flawed Saudi Peace Plan Exposed                            (By Mona Charen)       Imagine for a moment that all reporting about the U.S. war      on terrorism was presented without reference to Sept. 11.      American attacks from the air using B-52s and F-16s against      fighters armed with small weapons would seem quite      disproportionate. Our stated intention to kill as many      members of al Qaida as possible might be condemned, by our      own Department of State, as ``excessive'' and ``contributing      to the cycle of violence.''       But U.S. actions are never presented that way, because      everyone acknowledges that we have the perfect right to      defend ourselves against those who have done us grave harm.      Nor are we asked to sit by and wait for our enemies to do us      even more catastrophic damage if they get the chance. But      when it comes to the Israeli/Palestinian conflict, the      context is removed. Bleeding Israel is daily exhorted to stop      contributing the cycle of violence. Her teen-agers are blown      to bits at discotheques. Her babies are approached outside a      synagogue by a suicide bomber who     waits until he is next to the strollers before blowing      himself apart. Her adolescent boys who wander off in the      desert and get lost are torn to pieces. And all of this is      applauded and celebrated by Yasser Arafat and most of the      Arab governments in the region.       Some Arabs (those among the minority who acknowledge that      Arabs are responsible) condemned the bombing of the World      Trade Center. But not a single Islamic scholar or cleric has      condemned the systemic policy of blowing up Israeli      civilians. Israelis are demoralized and terrified.      Restaurants and shops are nearly empty. And, alone among      nations apparently, Israel is not permitted to engage in      simple self-defense.       Nearly every dispatch from the Middle East lacks basic      context. Here are some of the facts to keep in mind when      reading these flawed reports.       The PLO was not formed in order to secure a Palestinian      state on the West Bank and Gaza. It was created in 1964, when      both territories were under Arab sovereignty. Jordan and      Egypt did not create a state for the Palestinians because      they preferred to keep the refugees angry and homeless.       It is not ``Palestinian land.'' There has never been an      independent Palestinian state on the land between the      Mediterranean and the Jordan River. The area--which always      contained Arabs and Jews--was under Ottoman control for      several hundred years until World War I, then British control      under the League of Nations Mandate and finally under United      Nations control.       The United Nations approved a partition plan in 1947 that      would have created two states, on Jewish and one Arab. The      Jews accepted this arrangement. The Arabs refused. Five Arab      armies invaded the new state of Israel. In the ensuing war,      thousands of refugees fled. Jews fled Arab nations for      Israel, and Arabs fled Israel for Jordan, Egypt and Lebanon.      The Jewish refugees became full citizens of Israel. the      Palestinian refugees became pawns. Israel came into      possession of the West Bank and Gaza only because she was      attacked again by five Arab armies in 1967.       If the Palestinians are fighting for a state on the West      Bank and Gaza, why do their maps show Palestine as filling      the entire territory that is now Israel? Why do they marinate      their people in Hitlerian anti-Semitism and anti-Anercianism?      Further, why--when Ehud Barak offered just such a state, or      95 percent of it--did Arafat walk away and start this latest      round of violence? Palestinian spokesman say it wasn't      everything they wanted. But if they truly want a separate      state on so-called ``occupied territory,'' why did Barak's      offer not form the basis for further talks?       The Palestinians are said to be chafing under the      ``occupation.'' But in obedience to the Oslo process, Israel      has given administrative authority over 98 percent of the      Palestinians in the disputed territories to Arafat. Israel      has further permitted the Palestinian Authority to arm 40,000      ``police.''       If the Saudi ``peace plan'' were serious--and not an      attempt to divert attention from the Saudi role in Sept. 11      and its sponsorship of Islamic extremism worldwide--why      didn't Saudi Arabia offer it before?       Why is it impossible for the Palestinian Authority to give      Israel what Sharon has demanded--just three days of respite      from terror attacks?                                  ____                     Living in a Parallel Universe                            (By Naomi Ragen)       As an Israeli, I don't always feel I'm living in the same      universe as the rest of the world. We seem to be in parallel      universes.       In my universe, Yasir Arafat has violated the Geneva      Convention on Human Rights--which calls the murder of      noncombatants a crime against humanity--in 11,326 terrorist      attacks over the last 18 months that has left hundreds of      Israelis dead and thousands injured. In my universe, that      makes him a war criminal.       But in the parallel universe, it makes him a great freedom      fighter who deserves visits from diplomats, sympathy, and the      offer to head his own state where he can conceivably continue      his activities with a formal cache of even more deadly      weapons. In the parallel universe, the people who think this      way consider themselves liberals and humanists.       In my universe, Saudi Arabia, is a totalitarian state which      cuts off the limbs of thieves and stones women suspected of      adultery, and drowns young daughters in swimming pools to      preserve family honor. In my universe, it is a place where      women are nonpersons who cannot work, or drive, or go out      unaccompanied by men. In my universe, its exhibited medieval      antisemitism: In Saudi Arabias government daily, Al-Riyadh,      columnist Dr. Umayma Ahmad Al-Jalahma of King Faysal      University in Al-Dammam, wrote on 13/3/02 that the special      ingredient in Jewish Purim holiday cake is human blood from      non-Jewish youth.       In the parallel universe, this same Saudi Arabia has      suggested that Israel withdraw to its 67 borders for more      empty promises of peace and this is considered a serious      peace initiative which is soberly discussed by reporters,      politicians, talk show hosts, and editorial writers.       In my universe, following ten years of talking peace,      signing agreements in which the Palestinians agreed to      renounce the use of terror in exchange for Israel turning      over 95% of the West Bank and all of Gaza to Yasir Arafats      Palestinian Authority, giving the Authority millions of      dollars and thousands of guns to control the terrorists,      Israelis were rewarded by having their children blown up in      pizza parlors, discos, bar mitzvahs, and cafes; being shot in      their cars, having rockets destroy their homes and watching      Palestinians, who were our peace partners, celebrate these      deaths in their streets. In my universe, after wringing its      hands, and risking our lives, and making useless appeals to      Arafat to reign in his terrorists, our government finally      sent in soldiers to gather up the weapons. These terrorists,      who are ready to make ``brave'' forays into Israel in order      to shoot nine month-old babies and grandmothers, engaged in a      short gun battle until forced to surrender when confronted by      armed combatants.       In the parallel universe, Israelis are condemned for      ``humiliating'' Palestinians, and calls go out for      international observers to protect Palestinians.       In my universe, the United States, which has always seen      itself as Israel's greatest ally, and which has itself      suffered thousands of casualties from terrorist attacks by      Muslim extremists, calls on Yasir Arafat to stop the terror      on Israelis, and is ignored.       In the parallel universe, Israel's greatest ally reacts by      calling for the establishment of a Palestinian State, in      which Mr. Arafat, like any other head of State, can establish      his own army, airforce, and police force and import unlimited      amounts of arms. Where he can continue his present      educational system, encouraging toddlers to view themselves      as future Shahids, where present educational system,      encouraging toddlers to view themselves as future Shahids;      where his television and radio broadcasts can continue to      show blood libels, and revel in nonstop incitement. Where      instead of terrorist attacks, he can prepare himself to      launch all-out war.       I invite all those who are convinced they know what Israel      should do, to visit my universe before giving advice.                                  ____            [From the Observer (the Nashville Jewish paper)]                           (By Libby Werthan)       Last night as I lay in my comfortable bed in my lovely home      planning a pleasant night's sleep I could hear the guns in      Gilo. And I couldn't sleep; not because I was fearful for my      safety but because I couldn't help but think of all those      people living in Gilo (two neighborhoods away from us) and      how terrified they must be--especially the children. Thank G-     d only three people were injured but fifty-two apartments      were damaged by terrorist machine gun fire.       I would like to try to convey to you what life is like here      right now. I have told you long before that I thought the      Peace Process was just that a process that it wouldn't lead      to peace. And unfortunately, it has turned out that way. At      best, it was a holding period, a badly needed respite. In the      years following Oslo, we had a kind of freedom--a green      light, if you will; we could travel almost anywhere, enjoy      the country in relative safety.       After Arafat rejected the best deal he would ever get and      the Peace process came to a halt we found ourselves under      constant attack--suicide bombers (whom one expert said was a      misnomer, that they should be called Islamakazes), mortar      attacks knifings, murders and drive-by shootings. Every      morning, we open our newspapers and tally up how many people      were killed (about 350 to date) and how many more people were      permanently damaged--losing limbs, being burned so badly that      they will never leave home, seeing loved ones murdered--they      are their families will never be the same. I am talking about      thousands of people in the last 16 months, mostly children      and young people under the age of thirty.       What happened in America on 9/11 was horrifying. Over 3000      people lost their lives in the World Trade Center. America      has a population of 278 million. Israel has a population of 6      million. If you were to compare deaths per capita, Israel has      experienced almost 5 World Trade Centers in the last year and      a half. And that's only the deaths not the thousands      permanently injured. The majority have been civilians going      about their lives--mostly women and children. It's pretty      devastating when you think about it. You can imagine what      this has done to the psyche of our country.       But what I find even more incredible is the response of      Israel to this assault. The Israeli Army, has the power and      ability to go in and take over the whole Palestinian entity      in a matter of days. But they haven't done it. Instead they      have targeted the ringleaders, the bomb makers and their      installations (and been criticized for it). They have      isolated Arafat, the Father of Terrorism, (and been      criticized for it). They have bombed the installations of the      Palestinian Authority but not without first telling them that      they are going to do it. So when they do bomb buildings, they      are empty. They make every attempt to avoid injuring any      civilians. When the army entered the two refugee camps (which      by the way are so vicious and independent that the      Palestinian police won't enter them), they gave the civilians      three hours to leave the camp to get out of harm's way. In      view of the horrors perpetrated against us ours is the most      measured of responses. And yet the media doesn't report it      that way--they can't if they want to continue to have access      to the Palestinians. So they talk about Israel's heavy-     handedness, they talk about occupation, when 98% of the      territories are under Palestinian control, they highlight the      Palestinian deaths and over look many of ours. The media,      when being even-handed, will interview both a Palestinian and      an Israeli. But the Israelis they     pick are either to the far Left or the far Right and are      clearly not representative of main stream Israel. Last week      they ran a story about a Palestinian women coming into Israel      to give birth and being wounded in the shoulder when her car      ran a roadblock. The don't follow it up with the fact that      she was taken quickly taken to hospital where she gave birth      to a healthy baby and recovered from her wound. Nor do they      tell you that the very next day a pregnant Israeli woman was      ambushed on the highway and shot in the abdomen as a gift to      the Palestinian woman. We go after those who are killing us.      We do not respond by targeting civilians.       I said earlier that for ten years we had a green light. We      no longer have that green light. It has been replaced by a      flashing yellow light. We still live our normal lives--go to      work--go to the mall--go to the movies--make gourmet      dinners--have weddings and bar mizvahs--work out--plant      gardens--go to lectures, concerts, and plays--all the normal      things one does. Except that flashing yellow light makes us      more aware of where we are and who's around us. When we hear      more than one siren, as we did last night, we run and turn on      the news--another suicide bomber blew himself up in a crowded      religious neighborhood. When we hear an explosion, it could      be something on a construction site or a car backfire, but we      think bomb. You might expect us to go around with long faces      and sometimes we do, but mostly not. Nevertheless we are      always hurting inside. We know so many are grieving. We see      the pictures of the beautiful young people who have been      killed and our hearts are breaking. The hardest part for me      and, I think, others is that there is no end in sight. How      long can this go on? What will happen next?       The talk is always, let's achieve calm let's get back to      the negotiating table. But with whom are we going to      negotiate? Arafat? Arafat, the inventor of terrorism; the      consummate liar! A man who prays for the peace of the brave      on the New York Times Op Ed page and at the very same time      shouts Jihad, a million martyrs on to Jerusalem to his own      people in Arabic. A man who has not only abused the      opportunity offered him for peace but has brutally abused his      own people by manipulation and lies. he is every bit as      vicious as Ben Laden. Would America negotiate with Ben Laden?      With whom then are we going to negotiate? And if we do find      someone how meaningful will a signed piece of paper be? There      are three generations of Palestinians here who have learned      to hate Jews from birth; who's greatest mitzvah is to kill a      Jew. How can that change with a piece of paper?       We are at a terrible impasse her. How do we protect      ourselves and at the same time create a Palestinian entity      that is self-sufficient and independent of us. This is it.      This is what every Israeli wants.       And what about you? Where do you fit into this Jewish world      of ours? I have told you about Israel, but what about      Argentina where over half of the Jews there are not living      under the poverty line, or France where Jews are experiencing      a huge upsurge of anti-Semitism.       And what about America? I don't know that much about      America; but what I do know disturbs me. I hear very little      raised in the way of protests against the biased media and      little rallying in support of Israel coming from the Jewish      communities in America. What I do know is that the Arab      propaganda is so strong and effective in the US that on the      college campuses your children and grandchildren have never      been more distanced from Israel and are in fact ashamed of      her. American Jewish visitors are so few here that we can      practically thank each one personally for coming. Our hotels      and restaurants are closing. Our tour guides and bus      companies are out of work.       Where are you when we need you? Are you writing to the      Congress to thank them for their support? Are you writing to      the President? What about letters to the editor? Are you      countering Palestinian propaganda on the college campuses?      Are you writing to CNN and NPR when their reporting is      clearly biased? Are you letting people here know that you      care? Have you contributed to a victim relief fund? What's      happening, folks?       When I was in America last month, I saw a lot of hand      wringing and got a lot of sympathetic comments. Mostly,      people wanted to know why I didn't come back and live there.       And what did I answer? I told them that we have had the      most fabulous twelve years of our lives here. Grant you the      last months have been painful. But when I think about why I      am here, what is boils down to is that living her is the most      important statement that I can make with my life.       Since I began this letter, the situation has become      increasing worse. While we apprehend and thwart countless      attackers, we cannot catch them all. Some slip through. On      Thursday, I sent Moshe down to the grocery (here the grocery      is so close you can walk) to pick up a few things I had      forgotten. When he arrived, the whole areas had been blocked      off, all traffic stopped. And police everywhere. Just minutes      before, a suicide bomber had entered a very popular outdoor      cafe but had been noticed by a customer who alerted a waiter      and together they pushed him out of the cafe and at the same      time ripped out the wires of the bomb--and saved the lives of      scores of people. These were just ordinary people, but they      performed an extraordinary task. On Friday the cafe was again      packed. Saturday night a bomber entering another packed cafe      in the center of town was not detected in time--13 were      killed and over 50 wounded.       In about an hour, Moshe and I and many of our neighbors are      going to take a walk in the Jerusalem Peace Forest--a part of      the Promenade that looks out over Jerusalem. Perhaps you have      been there. It is a popular tourist spot. Some weeks ago in      this place, a young Israeli college student, a girl, was      attacked by a gang of Arab teenagers and stabbed to death.      Our walk is symbolic. It's our way of saying you can't take      our favorite places away from us. We won't give in to your      terror.       I could tell you many, many stories but I think you get the      picture. This is a war that is difficult to win; if you      defeat your enemy, you wind up with a captive hostile      population and territories that you must occupy; if you make      an accommodation with the enemy, it won't assure you of      safety or that attitudes will change. It will only put you in      an even less secure situation.       If you believe in prayer, please pray for us. Both the      Israeli and the Palestinian populations are victimized. We      are going through a living Hell.                          ____________________
