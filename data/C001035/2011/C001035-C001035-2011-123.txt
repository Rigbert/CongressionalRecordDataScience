President, I am proud to once again cosponsor the Fire Grants Reauthorization Act. I am pleased to join with Senators Lieberman, Brown, and Carper in this effort to reauthorize these vital programs. I have always been an ardent supporter of our Nation's fire services. In addition to serving as a cochair of the Congressional Fire Services Caucus, I was a cosponsor of the original FIRE Act, and an original cosponsor of the FIRE Act reauthorization bills in 2004 and in 2010. Unfortunately, last year's bill did not become law.
