 I ask unanimous consent that these be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                            Mexican American Legal                                 Defense and Educational Fund,                               Washington, DC, September 30, 2002.       Dear Senate Judiciary Committee Member: On behalf of the      Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF),      I urge you to oppose the nomination of Dennis Shedd to the      4th Circuit Court of Appeals. MALDEF is a Latino civil rights      organization that was founded in Texas in 1968. Since that      time, we have expanded our work across the nation and      represent all Latinos. In our more recent history, we opened      a community outreach office on the census in Atlanta, Georgia      prior to the 2000 census. Due to the growth of the Latino      community in the Southeast and the pressing legal needs of      our community in that region, we expanded our office this      year into a full regional office handling litigation,      advocacy and community education within the 4th Circuit      states of Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia,      and West Virginia.       Many people still are not aware of the rapid growth of the      Latino community in this region of the country. The following      is a sample of the Latino growth rates over that the last      decade in 4th Circuit states. In Maryland, Howard County's      Latino population grew at a rate of 104%, Anne Arundel County      saw its Latino population grow at a rate of 76%, Baltimore      County's Latino population grew by 65%, and Prince George's      County experienced 37% growth of Latinos. In Virginia, Prince      William County's Latino population grew by 94%, Fairfax      County experienced 71% growth of the Latino population,      Virginia Beach City's Latino population grew by 65%, and      Arlington county experienced 46% Latino growth. In North      Carolina, Wake County's Latino population grew by 190%,      Mecklenburg County saw its Latino population grow by 163%,      and Cumberland County experienced Latino growth at a rate of      97% in the last decade. In South Carolina, Richland County      saw its Latino population grow at a rate of 66%.       In addition, much of the Latino growth in these states is      being driven by the movement of Latino immigrants. What many      of these Latino immigrants face in these southeastern states      are barriers to housing, jobs, education, and health, as well      as targeting by local law enforcement similar to what many      Latino immigrants faced decades ago in states like      California, Texas and New York. While barriers and improper      law enforcement tactics still occur in states like California      and New York, these traditionally high-immigrant states also      now have a built-in infrastructure to serve the needs of      immigrants and help them find recourse if their rights are      trampled upon. Unfortunately, similar infrastructures do not      exist in most of the region covered by the 4th Circuit. As      such, ensuring that only nominees who will be fair to the new      Latino community in the southeast is particularly important.       MALDEF's evaluation of Dennis Shedd uncovered a      demonstrated lack of commitment     to protect the civil rights of ordinary residents of the      United States and to preserve and expand the progress that      has been made on civil rights and individual liberties. In      every respect, Dennis Shedd has demonstrated that he would      likely decide cases in a manner that run counter to the      core principles and rights we believe are necessary to      protect Latinos, particularly the most vulnerable who live      within the 4th Circuit.       Throughout his eleven years on the federal district court,      Judge Shedd has dismissed almost all of the civil rights      cases that have come before him; thus, preventing the merits      of these cases to be heard by a jury. Based on his handling      of race, gender, age, and disability claims, we conclude that      Judge Shedd would not give Latino plaintiffs seeking legal      remedies for civil rights violations a fair day in court.       In the area of upholding federal statutes, Judge Shedd's      rulings regarding federalism are also troubling and follow      the Fourth Circuit's bold attempts to narrow the powers of      Congress in its protection of the rights of all Americans. We      conclude that Judge Shedd, as a judge on the circuit court,      would continue attempts to limit the powers of Congress to      pass legislation that protects the rights of Latinos and      other protected groups.       Judge Shedd has also exhibited a high level of      insensitivity or poor judgment in commenting on issues about      race--while serving as a federal district judge in a state      with a population that is 30% African-American. For example,      in a recent unpublished case, Judge Shedd was reported in the      press as making several insensitive comments as he dismissed      a lawsuit aimed at removing the Confederate battle flag from      the South Carolina statehouse dome.       Dennis Shedd's eleven-year record as a federal district      judge reflects hostility towards plaintiffs in civil rights      cases, a desire to limit authority to enact legislation that      is applicable to states, and insensitivity to issues of      discrimination. Further, Judge Shedd's extremist views on      these issues render him unsuitable to serve on the Fourth      Circuit. For these reasons, we urge you to oppose his      nomination to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.           Sincerely,                                                Antonia Hernandez,                                    President and General Counsel.
