Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member of the committee.  Mr. Speaker, I would say to my dear colleagues, just about 100 hours ago you stood in this House and raised your hand and you followed this quote with an ``I do'': ``Do you solemnly swear you will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic.''  This bill, and I am wearing this red shirt today, is the color of the bill that we are debating, communist red. It is a taking. And regardless of what one says, it will go to court, and it should be decided in court. It should be decided there.  My biggest concern, it is often said the road to hell is paved with good intentions, and this is a great example. The good intentions of this bill are a pursuit of new forms of energy to replace our dependency. We all support that.  But even The Washington Post, which is not my favorite newspaper, says this is a low-wattage bill and it fits the realm of Russia and Putin, and it fits Bolivia and Venezuela. And if there is anything this bill will do, in fact it will increase the competitive edge of foreign oil imported to this country. That is what this bill does.                              {time}  1430  I ask my colleagues, if the problem is foreign oil, and it is, why increase taxes and make it harder to produce American oil and gas? That makes no sense to me.  I had a motion to recommit and I cannot offer it, but I wanted to take and strike everything after the enacting clause and insert taxes on all foreign oil imported. That would raise your money for renewable resources.  But what we are doing here today is taxing our domestic oil. We are raising dollars supposedly for renewable resources, yet we are still burning fossil fuels.  This is really a San Francisco energy policy, and America is not San Francisco.  My State gets 85 percent of its budget from oil production. I am proud of it and I hope we get more. The pipeline we want to build for gas to deliver the oil to the lower 48 will cost $20 billion, and this, by increasing taxes and taking away the incentives, which this bill does, raises the question of whether we can finance this pipeline, which we all need.  We talk about Joe Blow and all the rest of these people in the smaller income brackets and get the big old oil companies. The reality is if this bill was to become law gas would go to $5 a gallon.  Everybody talks about Big Oil and how much profit they made. These international companies are making that profit overseas shipping the oil to the United States.  If you want to do this right, then let us tax the foreign oil. Let us not tax the American oil. Let us not hurt our little companies, which this bill does. Let us not discourage what I call the frontier areas. Let us help American oil to deliver oil to the American people and quit paying the money to the foreign oil companies, and that is what you are doing.
