President, today I am pleased to introduce the Trauma Systems and Regionalization of Emergency Care Reauthorization Act along with Senators Kirk, Murray, and Isakson, and also the Improving Trauma Care Act, which includes burn injuries in the definition of trauma.  These two bills, S. 2405 and S. 2406, build on my previous efforts to improve trauma care, which is an essential component of our care system. Timely and effective trauma care is critical to ensuring lifesaving interventions for those who have serious unintentional injuries. Such injuries are the leading cause of death for children and adults under 44, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC.  I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle toward expeditious passage of these bills.                                 ______                                       By
