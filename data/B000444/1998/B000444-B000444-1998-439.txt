 President, recognizing reality and the hour, I am going to tell you what my amendment was going to be, and then I will withdraw it. This amendment was to see to it that the moneys from the tobacco settlement, if any, could have been used for VA health care, as well as Medicare. But looking at that lineup, I understand the outcome, and so I withdraw the amendment.
