Mr. Speaker, I just want to say how happy I am, and the New Jersey delegation, and what a privilege it is to welcome Don Payne to the U.S. House of Representatives, a Member from the 10th Congressional District.  Don is a former city councilman where he served in Newark as president of that council, a county freeholder. And of course he takes over after the very tragic passing of his dad, Don Payne, who all of us have worked with over the years. I personally, as chairman of the Africa Committee, Don before me, we worked side by side on issues related to Africa. Again, I will be very brief, but he takes over, of course, after the tragic passing of Don Payne, who all of us loved, admired and respected.  I sat next to Don for years on the Foreign Affairs Committee. He was the chairman of Africa, I chaired it and do so today; and we worked side by side on malaria and a whole host of other very important issues relevant to the health and well-being of the people of Africa, global health, and human rights. So, Don, you have very big shoes to fill. I'm sure you'll do it, and it is a great pleasure.  Members should know Don has been an activist on a number of issues, including Embracing Arms. He works very strongly on job creation in Newark, which has been very hard hit by the recession. So it's great to welcome you, Don. And, again, I look forward to serving with you in this Congress and the next.  I yield to my friend and colleague, Frank Pallone.
