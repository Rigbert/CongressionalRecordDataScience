President, I rise this afternoon to express my desire to work further with the Chair of the subcommittee and ranking minority member on a particularly important provision affecting our YMCAs, our YWCAs and other charitable organizations that do so much good work throughout the country. Throughout the recess, I heard continually from constituents who enjoy these important organizations in Oregon that they are concerned about a provision in the committee report accompanying this legislation that deals with the tax-exemptstatus of these organizations. I would say that I am of the view that these nongovernmental groups can provide critically needed services in our country, particularly as it relates to juveniles: preventing crime, drug use and unwholesome activities in which some kids do get caught up.  As many in this body know, Senator Smith and I have talked at some length about approaches to deal with the tragedy that we saw at Thurston High School earlier this year, when a young person entered the school with a gun. A number of our young constituents were killed and injured. It seems to me one of the very best antidotes to this kind of juvenile violence is the important work done in afterschool programs by these organizations. I am concerned that a provision in this legislation could curtail some of the important activities that the Y's and Jewish Community Centers and other important organizations provide.  What has transpired is that in 1984 the Internal Revenue Service issued a technical ruling making it clear that fitness activities provided by these and other organizations remain charitable as long as the entity, the nonprofit, serves a broad segment of the community. These organizations, the YMCAs, the YWCAs, the Jewish Community Centers across our country do provide critically needed services, particularly to low-income individuals. They have philanthropic missions related to health and education, community welfare. My concern is a provision relating to the tax-exempt status of these organizations, in effect, could prompt a review that would have a chilling effect over the entire range of work done by these organizations.  I have organized a letter with nine Members of this body, a bipartisan letter--Senator Mack, Senator Sarbanes, Senator Roberts, Senator Grassley, Senator Murray, Senator Durbin, Senator Kennedy, Senator Mikulski and myself, to make it clear to the managers of this legislation that we want to work with them on a bipartisan basis to make sure that the important work done by these community organizations is not in jeopardy. It seems to me, as we look to the 21st century, trying to make sure the budget is balanced, still meeting the needs of our communities and particularly the young people, that these are the very programs that are most likely to make a difference.  I had thought the question of the tax status of these groups was settled law in 1984. I note I am unaware of any abuses since 1984 or of any violations by the ``Y's'' with respect to this charitable exemption, and it is for that reason that I do ask this afternoon to work further with both the majority and the minority to make sure the tax status of these groups is protected and the important work they are doing continues to go forward and, in fact, expands in the years ahead.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the letter I referred to be printed in the Record, and I yield the floor.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                                Washington, DC, September 3, 1998.     Hon. Ben Nighthorse Campbell,     Chairman,     Hon. Herb Kohl,     Ranking Democrat,     Subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service and General          Government, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Campbell and Kohl: We are writing to express      our serious reservations about a provision in the committee      report accompanying the FY99 Treasury/Postal Appropriations      bill relating to tax-exempt health clubs.       The provision directs the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to      review its standards relating to ``tax-exempt health clubs''      and report on ``regulatory changes that may be required to      assure that tax-exempt health clubs are not unfairly      competing against private sector organizations.'' In 1984,      the IRS issued a technical ruling clarifying that adult      fitness is a charitable activity as long as the entity serves      a broad segment of the community. Moreover, under current tax      law, to the extent that a charity makes a profit from a trade      or business unrelated to the exercise of its charitable      purpose, it will be subject to federal income tax      (``unrelated business income tax'' or ``UBIT'') on the      profit. The statute and regulations on UBIT are very clear      and prevent any charity from gaining a competitive advantage      over a for-profit corporation.       Not-for-profit organizations, including the YMCAs, YWCAs      and Jewish Community Centers (JCCs) that serve all ages,      incomes and abilities likely could be adversely affected by      this provision. The health and fitness services offered by      these organizations are only one component of a whole range      of programs available for a community. These programs are an      integral part of the organization's philanthropic mission      related to the health, education and welfare of the      community, and are a significant component in financing such      activities. Furthermore, participation in their health and      fitness programs is not limited to adults: people of all ages      participate in them. Among the services they provide that      would be threatened are child care, juvenile delinquency      prevention, substance abuse and senior nutrition programs.       We appreciate your efforts in the July 29 colloquy in which      you stated your intent to have the IRS focus on adult fitness      provided by tax-exempt organizations that serve only adults.      However, we remain concerned that this provision still could      negatively affect the millions of Americans--young and old--     who participate in these community organizations. We ask that      in the conference report you ensure that the interests of      these individuals are protected and that the invaluable      programs offered by not-for-profit organizations are not      unfairly curtailed by unnecessary and overly burdensome      government regulation.           Sincerely,         Connie Mack, Paul S. Sarbanes, Pat Roberts, Chuck            Grassley, Ron Wyden, Barbara A. Mikulski, Ted Kennedy,            Dick Durbin, Patty Murray.
