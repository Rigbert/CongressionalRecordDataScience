 President, I believe there are problems with the law governing the consideration of these types of resolutions. One of biggest is the consideration of amendments. I have a series of parliamentary inquiries that I think will help clarify the problems with the statute.  Parliamentary inquiry: Does this statute provide any guidelines for the consideration of amendments on this resolution?
