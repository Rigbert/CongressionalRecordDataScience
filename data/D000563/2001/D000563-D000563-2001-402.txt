President, I would like to ask the Senator from Minnesota, because he has followed this education debate. He and I may disagree to some extent on this. We believe testing is an important part of education. It has proven itself in the city of Chicago with our public schools. But if we in fact agree to test students as we have debated for a long time, and don't provide any resources once we have identified the problems those kids are running into so they can improve their reading and math scores, what kind of situation are we going to be in when we talk about education reform? We will have the standards and the testing, but with this budget resolution we will not have the money to provide good teachers, good resources, and good class time to improve the kids.  Is that how the Senator from Minnesota sees it?
