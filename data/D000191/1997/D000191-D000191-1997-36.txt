Chairman, we need to understand what is at risk here:  The Buy American Act is at risk; the Helms-Burton Act supported so strongly by some of my colleagues on that side of the aisle is at risk here; all local State laws which go to local preference and purchasing are at risk here; the sovereignty not only of our Nation but of our States and our local communities is at risk. We need this amendment to get additional money to the U.S. Trade Representative so that they can defend our interests and unearth these ticking time bombs in some of these trade agreements and prevent the overturning of these laws by secret tribunals in Geneva.  This amendment should be heard and should be voted on on the floor.
