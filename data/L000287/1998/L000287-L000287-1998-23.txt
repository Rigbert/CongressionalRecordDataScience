Madam Speaker, it has been 3 years since a GAO report found that 1 out of every 3 of our Nation's schools are in need of major reconstruction and repair. Public school buildings are crumbling. Our schoolteachers are dealing with overcrowded classrooms. Many of our schools are fighting a war on drugs and violence.  Parents and teachers in my own district tell me about these problems and the lack of resources in the public schools in Atlanta. The GAO report shows that these problems exist nationwide, because overcrowded students attend classes in closets, hallways and even bathrooms. Yet, in 3years, the Republican leadership has done nothing to address these devastating problems.  Nine out of 10 children in America attend public schools. The bill before us does nothing to address the problems that they face.  In fact, this bill is nothing new. It is just the latest assault on public schools by the opponents of public education.                              {time}  1230  In the last three years, my Republican colleagues have proposed abolishing the Department of Education, cutting the school lunch program, cutting funding for safe and drug-free schools, for teacher training, and for Head Start. The Republican record is clear. It is anti-public education.  And now they have the audacity to propose draining $45 million from the Federal Treasury to send just 3 percent of D.C. students to private and religious schools. The vast majority of students in D.C. public schools, 76,000, will be left out and left behind.  Now, the Republicans will have us believe that they care about D.C. public schools and their students. Do not be fooled. Education is a great equalizer in our Nation. For $45 million, we could set up computer labs for every school in the District of Columbia. We could hire teachers, reading teachers for all of the public schools in the District. With adequate funding, with public education as our top priority, we could truly make a difference for the majority of our schoolchildren in this city and nationwide.  Madam Speaker, the Democrats have a plan that will rebuild and repair 50,000 of our Nation's schools, put 100,000 more teachers in our Nation's classrooms, reduce the class size to 18 students and strengthen teacher training.  It is time for us to take action and move forward to improve American public schools. This legislation is a step backward. It is a step in the wrong direction. Oppose the Republican D.C. voucher scheme and invest in public education for all of our children, so no child will be left behind in the District of Columbia or any place in America.
