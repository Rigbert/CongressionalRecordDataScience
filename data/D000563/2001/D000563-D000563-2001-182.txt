President, today I rise with 31 of my Senate colleagues to submit a resolution condemning bigotry and violence toward Sikh-Americans.  Last week, Amrith Kau Mago, a student at George Washington University, from my home State of Illinois, came to my office and brought the serious issue of hate crimes against Sikh-Americans in the wake of terrorist attacks on September 11, to my attention.  On the morning of September 11, 2001, our world as we knew it changed forever. On September 11, terrorists coordinated an attack on the American people by hijacking four commercial airplanes and flying them as missiles into occupied office buildings, the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon in Virginia. The staggering loss of life of over 6,000 innocent people, more than in any other day in our Nation's history; firefighters and police officers crushed under the rubble as they risked their lives to assist victims; shaken sense of security and confidence in our society; and a national anxiety about our future.  While we search for understanding, we must do our duty as Americans. We bury our dead. We comfort the wounded. We honor our heroes. And we work to protect and defend our Nation.  Unfortunately, in the aftermath of September 11, there are those, who in misguided anger and fear turned on their neighbors and fellow Americans. They mistook symbols of religious belief, such as turbans and beards, for distrust, terror, and destruction. In a twisted gesture of revenge, some vigilantes across America have taken it up on themselves to threaten, harass, and even kill our fellow Americans simply because some share some outward appearance of these terrorists, turbans, beards, olive skin.  In the past three weeks, the Sikh community has received nearly 300 reported incidents of threats, assaults, violence, and even death. Of course this is wrong and every American must speak out against it. Sikhism, like Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism, Christianity, and Catholicism, is a religion based on teachings of peace, love, and equality. Over 22 million Sikhs around the world today follow there values everyday. That is why it was so painful to me to learn that Sikh Americans are suffering from injustice targeted at them simply for their dress and customs.  We must embrace the diversity that makes America what it is, a diversity that our enemies cannot understand or accept. We are a land of immigrants, and from the beginning of our Nation's history, we have always welcomed people from other nations.  Of the thousands who perished that tragic day of September 11, citizens of over 80 countries were included among Americans.  Recent terrorist attacks should never cloud our judgment when it comes to our fellow Sikh-Americans. Sikh-Americans share with us the pain and sorrow of September 11 tragedy. Hate crimes and violence, especially violence stemming from bias and bigotry should never be tolerated.  That is why today I am submitting a resolution condemning bigotry and violence against Sikh Americans. I am pleased to say that 31 of my Senate colleagues have already cosponsored the resolution and we expect that many others will join us in condemning hate crimes against Sikh-Americans. Representatives Honda and Shays have expressed interest in introducing the exact same resolution in the House. Our country stands united with all Americans, including Sikh-Americans.  More than ever before, this is a time for us all to stand together. We are, of course, the United States of America. But today, we are a United America. As we stand together strongly against terrorism, let us also stand together as a country against prejudice and injustice targeted at each other.  Our enemies may hate us but we cannot be guided by hate, and we in America cannot hate one another. We are brothers and sisters under God's eyes. We are fellow American's under our Nation's flag and with this battle we must stand together, united by love and understanding.                          ____________________
