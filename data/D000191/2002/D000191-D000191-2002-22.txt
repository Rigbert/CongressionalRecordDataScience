  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, while the purported Republican benefit would total 16 percent of the first $4,500 of prescription drug costs, it would not reduce the outrageous and obscene charges of the pharmaceutical companies. Why? Because they are the sponsors of the big fundraiser tonight.  Mr. Robert Ingram of GlaxoSmithKline, the chief operating officer, is the chief corporate fundraiser. His company has given one quarter of a million dollars to the Republicans, and they have delivered a bill that will do nothing to deal with the outrageous extortionist cost of prescription drugs in the United States of America.  People will still be able to go to Canada and buy drugs manufactured in this country by their major contributors for half the cost, or Mexico for 40 percent of the cost, or Europe for a third of the cost. But, no, not here at home. Our seniors will be offered a Trojan horse benefit, 16 percent of the first $4,500 of their prescription drug cost. Boy, that is really going to help my seniors a lot.  Do my Republican colleagues have no sense of shame, or is it just a sense of humor, to adjourn the House early to go to an event sponsored and paid for by the pharmaceutical companies while offering this phony Trojan horse benefit?                          ____________________
