Chairman and colleagues, I believe that there is a clear consensus in this body for bipartisan reform of the Medicaid Program, and clearly the States can play a critical role in reforming that essential program.  Five States have been the lead; five States have been a laboratory for change, and the tragedy today is that this bill will turn out the laboratory for change in our home State of Oregon. This bill means that a program that is serving more than 100,000 low-income people will have to be dismantled. This means that charity care is going to increase. This means our welfare rolls are going to increase.  I would note specifically in a letter I just received from Jean Thorne, who is our Governor's assistant on Federal health policy, that she believes that the level of funding involved in this bill is going to require the dismantling of the Oregon health plan. This is a tragedy. It is a tragedy for Oregonians. But it is a tragedy for our Nation because we need bipartisan Medicaid reform, Medicaid reform that stresses prevention, holds down costs through health maintenance organizations, and this plan does it.  Let us reject this bill. Let us not turn out the lights on the laboratories for health care change in America like in my home State of Oregon.  Mr. Chairman, I believe that there is a very strong, bipartisan consensus in this House to fix Medicaid--and to fix Medicaid in some very fundamental and tough-minded ways.  And I believe that the State can play a very important role in this matter as our laboratories for change and innovation.  This bill, unfortunately, turns out the lights on those laboratories for change by eliminating waivers for these experiments in five States including my home State of Oregon.  This is bad medicine for Oregonians, and no remedy for the beleagured Federal taxpayer.  This is the last thing we should be doing. It is unwise because it will remove health care coverage from thousands of our fellow citizens, it will hog-tag States that already have undergone significant reforms, and it ultimately will cost tax payers far more dollars than you are attempting to save in this reconciliation package.  This bill sends us marching backwards, dooming States that have had the political guts to reform, back into the bad old days of public welfare programs.  Oregon is one of the States that has lead the way toward a century Medicaid Program, and our waiver plan has full, bipartisan support within our congressional delegation. It has that support because in the last 16 months: Oregon has enrolled 130,000 working poor into managed care; reduced uncompensated, charity expense at hospitals by 30 percent;  and has delivered a Medicaid Program which, per capita, is 10 percent less costly than the national average.  This bill even with the new provisions worked out by the speaker last night, dooms the Oregon health plan.  I have just received a letter from Jean Thorne, governor Kitzhaber's Federal policy director and the former manager of the state's Medicaid Program.  Here is what she has to say about the measure we are voting on, today, with regard to our health plan.  Short-term, she says that while additional moneys inserted into this bill last night will alleviate some of the problems in the first year, we will likely need to take actions limiting the program before the end of the 1996 fiscal year.  After that, according to Thorne's letter, the package will cause the Oregon plan to plummet as if from a cliff.  She says the 7 year loss from this measure ``is still almost $2 billion.''       It is likely that such a level of funding loss will require      us to dismantle the Health Plan. If this were to happen, it      would mean that approximately 130,000 low-income Oregonians      would no longer have Medicaid coverage. These are people who      are primarily families with children.  My colleagues, and particularly my colleagues within the Oregon delegation, make no mistake, this will kill the Oregon health plan as we know it.  I suspect, after speaking with State officials this morning, that this will force a special session of our State legislature early next year to revamp the Oregon plan.  This will mean fewer services covered, and fewer Oregonians under health care coverage.  One State official speculated that somewhere between 30,000 and 40,000 Oregonians--working poor--will have to be let out of their coverage in the next 15 to 20 months.  Mr. Chairman, I should point out that under this plan we have reduced the number of welfare recipient in the State by about 8 percent in the last year. We projected further decreases of about 12 percent over the next 2 years.  That projection, like health care coverage for some tens of thousands of Oregonians, is now out the window as well.  We will see our welfare rolls, and our welfare costs, grow because of the loss of this waiver.  Mr. Chairman, as I said we have worked cooperatively in our delegation to try to get this issue turned around, and I want to especially commend the work of my colleague, Jim Bunn.  But we have no remedy in what is proposed, today.  This language is a prescription for higher public costs, higher costs to hospitals which will be shifted to other consumers, and the loss of decent health coverage for many, many of my fellow Oregonians.  I urge my colleagues to reject this measure.                                                State Capitol,                                      Salem, OR, October 26, 1995.     To: Congressman Ron Wyden.     From: Jean I. Thorne, Federal Policy Coordinator.     Subject: Amendment to House Medicaid Bill.       In reviewing the special adjustment made for Oregon in the      House bill, I believe it helps alleviate the need to take      immediate action to possibly dismantle the Oregon Health      Plan, but it does not change the long-term outlook for the      Plan.       As I read the language included in the bill, it provides a      one-time allotment to Oregon of an additional $155 million in      fiscal year 1996, but does not change the allotments in      subsequent years. The amount of funding provided in 1996      basically would equal the amount spent in 1995 plus an      inflation factor of 7.24%. We are anticipating approximately      9% growth in Oregon's Medicaid expenditures between fiscal      years 1995 and 1996, so although this additional amount of      funding will alleviate much of the immediate problem, we will      likely need to take actions before the end of the fiscal year      to trim back the Health Plan and other areas of Medicaid,      such as long-term care services. By fiscal year 1997, more      drastic actions will be necessary, although it is unknown at      this point whether a special legislative session prior to the      regular 1997 session would be necessary.       Clearly, beginning with 1997 we face the same problems as      in the original House bill. The seven-year anticipated loss      with this change is still almost $2 billion, as opposed to      $2.1 billion. It is likely that such a level of funding loss      will require us to dismantle the Health Plan. If this were to      happen, it would mean that approximately 130,000 low-income      Oregonians would no longer have Medicaid coverage. These are      people who are primarily families with children. Since the      beginning of the Health Plan in February 1994, we have      increased the number of Oregonians with Medicaid coverage by      almost 50%. We currently have over 75% of all Medicaid      enrollees receiving services through prepaid health plans.      The amount of funds hospitals spend on charity care has      decreased by over 30%. Our welfare caseloads have declined by      8%, with another 12% decline anticipated in the current two-     year budget period. At the same time, our spending per      beneficiary is more than 10% below the national average. Our      ability to ``squeeze'' additional savings out of the program      is severely limited. If the Oregon Health Plan were to be      dismantled, we would face the prospects of actually going      backwards from the gains we have made--less people covered,      less people in managed care, more costs shifted to other      payers and welfare caseloads increasing.       We deeply appreciate the work of Congressman Bunn in      getting this issue before Congress, but we recognize that it      is only a first step. Our hopes are that we can secure an      exemption for states with operating Section 1115 waivers to      continue under the funding terms of the waiver, allowing us      to prove that our demonstration programs can improve the      health of poor persons in a cost-efficient manner.
