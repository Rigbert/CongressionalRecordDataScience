  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                     Conference of                                       State Bank Supervisors,                                    Washington, DC, April 3, 2008.       Dear Senator: The Conference of State Bank Supervisors      (CSBS) supports the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage      Licensing Act of 2008 (S. 2595 the SAFE Mortgage Licensing      Act of 2008) introduced by Senators Feinstein and Martinez.       The SAFE Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 will help protect      borrowers from unscrupulous lenders and brokers and improve      transparency in the mortgage lending process. CSBS encourages      Congress to include this bipartisan reform in a legislative      package to address the current mortgage crisis.       State regulators recognize that this reform effort builds      on state initiatives to modernize our mortgage regulatory      system. Specifically, the legislation establishes a      nationwide mortgage lending database that coordinates with      the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System currently being      operated by CSBS and the American Association of Residential      Mortgage Regulators (AARMR).       By January of this year, 42 state agencies representing      mortgage regulators in 40 states have signed a statement of      intent indicating their commitment to participate in the      CSBS/AARMR Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System. Eventually,      CSBS and AARMR expect all 50 will transition onto the System.      The System successfully began operations on January 2, with 7      states launching the system. An additional 9 states will be      on by the end of 2008 with the rest of the states rolling on      in 2009 and beyond.       Again, we strongly encourage you to include the provisions      of the SAFE Mortgage Licensing Act in legislation designed to      resolve the current mortgage crisis.           Sincerely                                                      Neil Milner,     President and CEO.                                  ____                             National Association of Realtors,                                    Washington, DC, April 3, 2008.     Hon. Diane Feinstein,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Mel Martinez,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Feinstein and Martinez: On behalf of over 1.3      million members of the National Association of REALTORS, I      want to share our views on the SAFE Mortgage Licensing Act      amendment offered by Senators Feinstein and Martinez.       We believe this amendment will go far toward preventing      another subprime market failure that would further erode      confidence in the Nation's housing finance system. While      responsible subprime lenders have played an important role in      helping millions of consumers achieve homeownership, abusive      subprime lending has occurred much too often. As a result,      roughly 2.2 million American households have been projected      to lose their homes and as much as $164 billion due to      subprime mortgage foreclosures.       Many of the provisions of the amendment are consistent with      NAR's ``Responsible Lending Principles.'' We believe our      principles provide an appropriate basis for legislation that      would help eliminate irresponsible practices such as making      loans without sufficient regard to the borrower's ability to      repay the loan and avoid foreclosure.       The National Association of REALTORS supports responsible      lending, mortgage servicing and appraisal practices. We      support this amendment that will help close the door on      abusive lending practices.           Sincerely,                                               Richard F. Gaylord,                                                   2008 President.
