 President, in the last several days, I have received a copy of the most recent PRIDE survey of youth drug use in this country. The numbers are not encouraging. In fact, the numbers over the last several yearshave not been encouraging. Drug use among teenagers since 1992 has risen sharply. This is true for use of more traditional drugs, like heroin. It is true for the newer or more recently popular designer drugs, like meth and now ecstasy.  I have spoken about these trends frequently here and in hearings. The Caucus on International Narcotics Control, which I co-chair, has held a number of hearings on these dangerous trends and their consequences. No one who is familiar with the details can be anything but concerned about what is happening. No one that is except those who seek to legalize drugs in our society and make them even more available than they now are.  The legalizers, of course, do not admit that this is their intent. But it is like the old magician's trick, watch the birdie. They cloak their efforts to legalize with various disguises. They want marijuana for sick people. They want treatment not prisons. They want compassion not punishment. But it's an old game. It's just a variation on the useful lie: I am for a good cause so I don't have to be honest. Well, as the old saying has it, fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me.  And they are trying to fool people again. The goal this time is to stop the nomination of John Walters to be the nation's drug czar. Their effort is a purely cynical one trying to portray Mr. Walters as some kind of stone age, Neanderthal throwback who is out of step with the needs of real drug policy. But the policy they really advocate is to make drugs more widely available. What they object to is that Mr. Walters does not accept that. So they have begun a campaign to impugn his character, misstate his views, and misrepresent the facts and their own goals. They do not want strong leadership on this issue.  They are trying to portray Mr. Walters as a total supply side advocate who cares nothing about treatment or prevention. They are relying on the hope that people will read what they have to say about his record rather than look at his record. Remember, watch the birdie. They hope to block his nomination in order not to help stop drug use but to clear the way for their efforts to legalize.  The main voices against him have come from groups funded by billionaire advocates for drug legalization. It is coming from a number of journals and organizations that are on record favoring drug legalization. They would have us believe that their motive for opposing the President's candidate to be the drug czar is out of concern for treatment and prevention. This is like the wolf expecting Little Red Riding Hood to believe it is really grandma in the bed.  Some facts. When Mr. Walters was the chief of staff for Bill Bennett, the first Drug Czar, Walters was a key player in helping to ensure that we had a serious demand reduction effort as part of our policy. In the Bush years, demand reduction resources doubled. In 4 years of that administration, the rate of funding for demand was higher than in the 8 years of the last administration. Mr. Walters was a player in making that happen in the first Bush administration. It is true he spoke out a lot on supply reduction. That too was part of the President's strategy and he was responsible for helping to implement that as well. He also became the Deputy Director for Supply at ONDCP. It was his job to speak on these issues. There was a Demand Deputy. It was his job to speak on demand issues. You will not find a lot of supply talk in Dr. Kleber's public comments. As the demand guru it wasn't the focus of his job. You won't find a lot of demand comments in Mr. Walters' statements. Why do you think that is?  In the years after he left ONDCP, Mr. Walers made numerous public statements. Many of these were before Congress. He was asked by committees in Congress responsible for dealing with supply issues to speak on them. Is it any wonder that most of those concern supply reduction? It isn't a mystery, but, remember, watch the birdie.  Let's be clear. The objection to Mr. Walters is not that he is a supply sider or a hawk on demand. It is that he believes we need a serious drug policy that is comprehensive. That is what Congress wants and funds. The President has made it clear that that is what he wants and expects. It's the President's policy. As a member of the President's Cabinet, Mr. Walters will be a strong voice, a forceful advocate. We need that. The major demand groups in this country recognize that and support him.  Mr. Walters is not a drug legalizer. He is a man committed to stopping the flow of illegal drugs across our borders and into our schools and neighborhoods. He is committed to prevention and effective treatment. He has children of his own. He is determined to help protect them in their schools from the drug pushers among us. He cares passionately about this issue.  That is why I believe the Senate needs to move quickly on his nomination. We need leadership. We need commitment. We need passion. Mr. Walters can supply those needs in working with Congress to accomplish a common goal. The only people who benefit from blocking this nomination are the legalizers. We should not become their unwitting allies.  I support this nomination. I urge my colleagues to join me. It is late in the year. The August recess is almost upon us. We need to give Mr. Walters a speedy hearing and a quick confirmation so that he can get about the Nation's business.                          ____________________
