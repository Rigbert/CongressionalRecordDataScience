Dicks, in my strong opposition to the gentleman's amendment.  We had a similar debate during the consideration of the Energy and Water bill. And one observation I would make is we do have a disparity in this country, and it continues to grow, despite how hard the average American works.  The problem today for that average American is that for 1 hour's worth of work--it could be pushing paper, it could be waiting tables at a diner, it could be working at a steel mill, it could be laying brick, it could be a contractor, it could be a manager, it could be a CEO--is less for 1 hour's worth of human labor in the United States today than it was in 1977 when I came to Washington, D.C. on a congressional staff. That is not the country my parents left me.  I think it is wrong to offer an amendment to further suppress the wages hardworking Americans are trying to earn to make sure that they can buy a house, they can send their children to what are increasingly expensive public institutions because of the lack of State support for them, and who now hold retirement programs that are probably about 40 percent less in value than they were in 2007.  This is a bad amendment, and I strongly oppose it.  I yield back the balance of my time.
