Mr. Speaker, again, I want to thank my friend from Minnesota (Mr. Ramstad) for his good and great work for bringing this bill before us today. The Inmate Tax Fraud Prevention Act is an important bill, and I urge its passage. I fully support House bill 7082, and I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this bill.  I yield back the balance of my time.
