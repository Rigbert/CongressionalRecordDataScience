 President, Secretary of State Colin Powell is in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, for an annual ASEAN meeting. There are many issues he needs to pursue with ASEAN members, including, most urgently, support for the struggle for freedom in Burma.  Also pressing is the fate of democracy in Cambodia. Secretary Powellmust be clear to all Cambodian democrats that the United States stands firmly and publicly with them in our common cause of democracy and the rule of law. Secretary Powell should make it a point to meet with the democrats during his short stay in Phnom Penh.  It is in America's national interest, and that of Cambodia, that new leadership--firmly committed to transparency, accountability and justice--is elected in upcoming parliamentary elections next month.  The ruling Cambodian People's Party, CPP, and its earlier manifestations have had an opportunity--nearly a quarter of a century--to develop that country. Their records is unimpressive, at best. Crimes are committed with impunity, corruption is endemic and extends to the highest office, and lawlessness provides a breeding ground for terrorism and other criminal activities.  Under CPP Prime Minister Hun Sen's leadership, opposition rallies have been attacked by grenade-throwing terrorists, a coalition government disintegrated in a coup d'etat, and government-paid gangsters, the Pagoda Boys, caused $50 million worth of damage in anti-Thai riots that were fueled by Hun Sen's reckless nationalistic comments.  Secretary Powell should temper his comments praising the Cambodian Government for cracking down on terrorism. The reason terrorists are on Cambodian soil is because of the very lawlessness perpetuated by the CPP. Hun Sen has swatted a few flies recently, but is directly responsible for leaving the screen door wide open. A more serious response to terrorism in the region is freedom and the rule of law for the Cambodian people.  While in Phnom Penh, Secretary Powell must push for free and fair elections in July. Opposition parties must not be denied access to media or the ability to conduct rallies, demonstrations, and other forms of free expression. Secretary Powell must make clear to Hun Sen that a single, additional political killing is one too many, and that the election will be judged by international standards--which, contrary to the Prime Minister's thinking, is not reserved only for sports competition.  Let me close by saying that it has come to my attention that the ASEAN meeting is taking place at the Intercontinental Hotel, which is owned by Theng Bunma--a suspected Cambodian drug king pin and self-described financier of the 1997 coup. This epitomizes all that is wrong in Cambodia today.  Mr. President, I ask that a letter from Cambodian opposition leader Sam Rainsy to Secretary Powell calling for Suu Kyi's immediate release be printed in the Record following my remarks.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                          Kingdom of Cambodia,                                                    June 13, 2002.     Colin L. Powell,     Secretary of State,     U.S. Department of State, Washington, DC.     c/o HE Mr. Charles Ray,     U.S. Ambassador,     U.S. Embassy, Phnom-Penh, Cambodia.       Dear Secretary Powell: I would like to take this      opportunity to express my appreciation for your statement      calling for the immediate release of Aung San Suu Kyi and      increased pressure on Burma's military junta. The struggle      led by Suu Kyi is an inspiration to all those who live in      fear under repressive regimes, and to those who fight      everyday for freedom and democracy. I proudly join you in the      call for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and hope that you      will use the opportunity of your visit to Cambodia for the      ASEAN Regional Forum to press for an end to the suffering of      the Burmese people.       The fate of Aung Sun Suu Kyi and Burma's democracy is      indelibly linked to the future success of the ASEAN region.      The transition from communism and military dictatorship to      democracy would bring untold political, economic and cultural      benefits to one of the most diverse and potentially dynamic      regions in the world. In this context your statement that      those who oppress democracy must not be allowed to prevail      has particular resonance.       In Cambodia, we are struggling to end endemic poverty,      reduce appalling illiteracy rates and to provide basic      nutritional needs to our children. This struggle is made all      the more difficult by a government more committed to      consolidating its own power than to the welfare of its      people. While offering a facade of progress and stability to      donors and the international community, the government has      used fear and violence to support a lucrative patronage      system, exploit our natural resources and suppress opposition      voices. It was just today that the latest victim, a garment      worker protesting low wages and poor factory conditions, was      shot and killed by government riot police as they cracked      down on a peaceful demonstration.       Unlike in Burma, the Cambodian people will have the      opportunity to go to the polls in July to change their      leadership. They must be allowed to do so in an environment      free from fear and intimidation. But already we have seen      that the current government is willing to sue the tools of      fear and violence to suppress the Cambodian people's desire      for freedom and democracy. This year's electoral process is      already flawed by biased elections commission, restrictions      on voter registration, restrictive media access and ongoing      intimidation of opposition activists. The potential for      democracy in Cambodia is being thwarted by this government      and it must realize that, ``its actions will not be allowed      to stand.''       As you prepare to participate in the ASEAN Regional Forum      in Phnom Penh next week, I trust that you will continue to      provide a strong and leading voice for the release of Aung      San Suu Kyi. At the same time, I ask that you use the same      strong voice to advocate for credible elections in Cambodia--     elections that reflect the true will of the Cambodian people.           Sincerely,                                                   Sam Rainsy,                               Leader of Parliamentary Opposition,     Kingdom of Cambodia.                          ____________________
