 President, we will now move to the cloture vote. Following the cloture vote, it is our understanding that Senators Hagel and Webb, under the previous agreement, will speak on the amendment to which they would like to speak. For the information of all Senators, once this vote occurs, Senator Hagel and Senator Webb will be speaking, and then we will have votes at 2 o'clock, which were just ordered.                             Cloture Motion
