President, today I wish to share a business success story from my home State of Vermont.  For years Vermont has been branded as the State of milk, apples, and maple syrup. But along the ridgelines of the Green Mountains and in the valleys along the many rivers that find their way to Lake Champlain, a new high-tech and green-tech sector is quickly emerging as an economic driver for both Vermont and the entire country. The Burlington Free Press recently highlighted one such company--Logic Supply in South Burlington, VT.  I have heard many great things about Logic Supply's work and their commitment to Vermont. Company owners Lisa and Roland Groeneveld have kept Logic Supply extremely active in our State's high-tech business networking community both as members of the Vermont Software Developers Alliance and as regular participants in the Vermont 3.0 Creative Tech Jam. In 2010, KeyBank and Vermont Business Magazine recognized Logic Supply as one of Vermont's fastest growing companies.  As Logic Supply has grown, they have helped brand Vermont as a place where businesses can succeed, and where people looking to work in the economy of tomorrow can find a job today. I commend them for their hard work and success.  I ask unanimous consent that the May 9, 2011, Burlington Free Press article entitled ``Logic Dictates, Couple Prove Tech Has Place On Vt. Buz Scene'' be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Burlington Free Press, May 9, 2011]      Logic Dictates, Couple Prove Tech Has Place on Vt. Biz Scene                          (By Dan D'Ambrosio)       In 2002, Lisa and Roland Groeneveld left behind their      corporate telecommunications jobs in the Netherlands, where      they had met, and moved to Vermont without work. Roland is      Dutch. Lisa is a native of Barre and wanted to live close to      family after her father died.       The company she worked for, WorldCom, was imploding      spectacularly, filing the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history      at the time. The company he worked for, an Anglo-Dutch      consultancy called CMG with about 14,000 employees, was about      to be swallowed up by an even bigger company, Logica, based      in Reading, England, now with almost 40,000 employees.       So, they went their own way. In less than a decade, the      Groenevelds have built a high-tech business in South      Burlington, Logic Supply, Inc., that has made a profit from      day one.       After launching with $40,000 the couple had saved, the      company is on track to reach $16 million in sales in 2011--up      nearly 40 percent from 2010 sales of $11.5 million. It is      debt free, recently moved into a $2.3 million building with      room for expansion and, in theory, will reach $350 million in      sales by 2020 if it meets the BHAG (Big Hairy Audacious Goal)      set by its management and employees. That acronym, by the      way, is proudly displayed on a bulletin board in the break      room.                  How's that for landing on your feet?       After moving to Vermont, Lisa and Roland's first order of      business was to build a house on property Lisa's parents      owned where they had a small vacation cabin. Roland bought a      book on how to build your own house, hired a carpenter, and      got to work, with Lisa's help.       ``It literally was nine months of pounding nails, which was      a lot of fun, very different than IT,'' Roland said. ``Once      you start doing it, it's pretty straightforward.''       While their house was being built, Lisa landed a job in      Boston at a business some of her former colleagues from      WorldCom had started, called Fiberlink. After the house was      finished in 2003, the couple decided to move to Boston for      Lisa's job.       ``We found an apartment there,'' Roland said. ``What am I      to do next? Together we sat down and wrote some business      plans.''       Years earlier, Roland had started a company in the      Netherlands, and sold it a year and a half later to an      Internet company during the dot.com boom. So he knew the      feeling of being an entrepreneur.       ``Running your own business is nice, it gives you a lot of      freedom and independence,'' Roland said. ``I wanted to get      back to that sort of feeling and idea.''       The couple complemented each other when it came to      launching a high-tech business. Roland had a degree in      electrical engineering and computer science. Lisa had an      extensive business background, having worked for what was the      highest flyer in telecom before it crashed to earth.       But before they got to the plan that would lead to Logic      Supply, the couple took a couple of detours.       ``One was importing high-end coffee makers from Europe,''      Roland said. ``You're drinking a cup of coffee and you think,      Boy wouldn't it be nice to get a good cup of coffee!'''       Of course, there were already companies out there importing      nice coffee pots from Europe. But there weren't so many doing      what Logic Supply would end up doing, an idea that came from      the development of smaller and smaller, and more and more      rugged computers.       ``We make very high-end computer systems for industrial      embedded applications,'' Roland said, summarizing the company      he and Lisa launched in their Boston apartment eight and a      half years ago. ``We never really sell to end users.      Typically we sell to a company that has their own product,      their own sales force and their own marketing. We're      basically the engineering department for the company.''       Logic Supply makes the computers, for example, for Project      54, a system for police cruisers and ambulances developed at      the University of New Hampshire that integrates the functions      of the vehicle into a single interface that can be operated      by voice or a touch screen, simplifying life for a police      officer or EMT in an emergency situation.       ``It's a computer that runs the police car,'' Roland said.      ``When they're driving, cops can     interact with the computer by voice: `Sirens on, lights on.'      They can request initial information on a license plate,      operate video cameras. The computer is not taking over the      functions, but controlling the functions.''       Logic Supply also makes custom computers for industrial      automation--in slaughterhouses, where they can be sprayed      with blood; or tire manufacturing, where they're subject to a      lot of moisture and particles flying around, along with shock      and vibration.       ``Our computers are designed to withstand all that,''      Roland said. ``A typical PC will fail. They can't handle that      sort of environment.''       Logic Supply is in the medical market as well.       ``One of our customers converts analog X-ray machines to      make them digital,'' Roland said. ``Our computers will      capture the images from those older machines and convert them      and make those images available online for doctors.''                             Internet savvy       Remarkably, the company has experienced its explosive      growth almost exclusively through its website, making search      engine optimization a top priority.       ``Our primary customers are engineers, and engineers don't      like to talk to sales people, they like to do their own      research,'' Roland said. ``I can say this stuff because I'm      an engineer myself.''       The website gives engineers all the information they need      to place their orders. The Logic Supply sales team does      follow up with human contact, just to make sure their      customers are satisfied and have everything they need, Roland      says, but if they want to be left alone to place their orders      in peace and not talk to anybody, Logic Supply obliges.       The Groenevelds' plan for the next 10 years is to grow at a      sustained rate of 30 percent to 40 percent a year, which      presumably would get them to the BHAG posted on the lunch      room bulletin board. If anything slows them down, Roland      says, it's likely to be the difficulty of finding qualified      employees in Vermont.       ``Vermont is not well known as a tech state, or even a      great state for employment,'' Roland said. ``People think      there's not a future for them here and they leave. We need to      stop that as a community. We need to make sure people are      aware there are opportunities here and that there are great      businesses here.''       Mark Heyman is Logic Supply's director of human resources,      and recently joined the board of directors of Vermont      Software Developers' Alliance. He said the alliance is      planning to broaden into a representative group for the      entire tech industry in the state, highlighting companies in      the state like his own, and many others.       ``There's a reason not only to stay in Vermont, but for      other people to come here,'' Heyman said. ``We see ourselves      along with other companies as leading a resurgence. Get the      word out, let's attract people. Like geeking out on a      computer? I've got a sandbox for you. As people come walking      through here applying for a job, they often say they never      even realized something like this existed in Vermont.''                          ____________________
