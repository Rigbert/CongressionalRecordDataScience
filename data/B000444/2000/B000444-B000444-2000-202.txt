 President, I attended the Million Mom March with my wife. I do not think anyone should misunderstand the significance and consequence of so many mothers and a number of fathers giving up Mother's Day to make an important point. These were not a bunch of wild radicals. These were a bunch of moms from rural areas, inner cities, and suburban areas. They were black, they were white, Hispanic, Asian American. They were basically making a plea. As I stood there and listened, I was reminded of a quote attributed to John Locke speaking about someone he heard. He said:       He spoke words that wept and shed tears that spoke.  I do not know how anyone could have attended any significant portion of that march and not felt, as John Locke felt, listening to the words these women spoke that wept and the tears they shed that spoke volumes about the insanity of our policy.  Irony of all ironies; the next day, on Monday, the Supreme Court hands down a decision, not about guns but about the protection and empowerment of women in society. Yesterday, in United States v. Morrison, the Supreme Court struck down a provision of an act that I spent 8 years writing and attempting to pass--six of which were in earnest--the so-called Violence Against Women Act. There is one provision of that act they struck down and only one provision. That is the provision that empowered women to take up their cause in Federal court to make the case they were a victim of sexual abuse because, and only because, of their gender and to sue their attacker for civil damages in Federal court; empowering women to not have to rely on the prosecutorial system or anyone else to vindicate the wrong that had been done to them if they can supply the proof.  As the author of that act, I must tell my colleagues that I was disappointed by the Court's decision but, quite frankly, not surprised by it.  I emphasize, though, the Morrison case struck down the civil rights cause of action women have in Federal court, no other part of the act. Nothing in the Court's decision yesterday affects the validity of any other provision, any other program, or the need to reauthorize these programs through my bill, the Violence Against Women Act II, which now has 47 cosponsors.  Unfortunately, I believe the Court's ruling yesterday will have a significant impact on Congress' ability to respond to public needs in a way that has not been constrained since the 1930s. The Court has been inching toward this decision and this line of reasoning in case after case over the last several years. The Court has grown bolder and bolder in stripping the Federal Government of the ability to make decisions on behalf of the American people, part of the objectives of the Honorable Chief Justice, who believes in the notion of devolution of power and thinks that the Federal Government should have significantly less power.  The Court's decision--and these have all been basically 5-4 decisions--in United States v. Lopez in 1995 struck down the Gun-Free School Zones Act, a decision upon which the Court heavily relied in the Morrison case in striking down the civil rights remedy.  In the case of Boerne v. Flores, a 1997 case, the Court struck down the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Again, this is not mostly about what act they like and do not like; it is about Congress' power. Those who thought we should not be dealing with guns were happy with the Lopez case substantively. Those who thought we should have more religious freedom in public places, our conservative friends--and I happen to agree with them on that point--were disappointed when the Supreme Court reached in and said as to section 5 of the 14th amendment, which is the provision which says the Congress shall determine how to enforce the 14th amendment, no, no, no, Congress is not the one; we--the Court--are going to decide.  There, then, was another decision, the Supreme Court's watershed decision in the Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida, a 1996 decision, and the cases that followed, in which the Court limited Congress' ability to authorize private citizens to vindicate Federal rights in lawsuits against their States, and that included the Fair Labor Standards Act and the Age Discrimination Act.  Putting it in simple terms, if the State of Florida discriminated against somebody in State employment because of age in violation of the Federal act, the Court said: Sorry, Florida has immunity. A Federal Government cannot protect all Americans against age discrimination because of a new and novel reading of the 11th amendment.  The Court's decision today is at peace with those rulings. Fundamentally, this decision is about power. Who has the power, the Court or the Congress, to determine whether or not a local activity, such as gender-motivated violence, has a substantial impact on interstate commerce? Yesterday the Court said it: The Court has this power--echoes of 1920 and 1925 and 1928 and 1930, the so-called Lockner era.  I find it particularly striking the Court acknowledged in Morrison that in contrast to the lack of congressional findings supporting the law struck down in Lopez, the civil rights remedy is supported by numerous findings regarding the serious impact of gender-motivated violence on interstate commerce. I conducted 4 years of hearings to make that record.  We showed overwhelmingly that the loss of dollars to the economy of women being battered and abused and losing work is billions of dollars. We showed overwhelmingly that women make decisions about whether to engage in a business that requires them to cross State lines based in significant part upon the degree to which they think they can be safe, based upon a survey of 50 State laws, and whether or not they adequately protect women as they do men against violence.  The record is overwhelming. Nonetheless, instead of applying the rule they had traditionally applied in determining whether Congress has the right to be involved in what is a local matter, they came up with a new standard.  Instead of applying the old standard of: Is there a rational basis for Congress to find, as they did, the traditional ``rational basis review'' to decide whether Congress' findings in this case were rational--and I cannot conceive of how they concluded they could not be--the Court simply disagreed with thefindings, marking the first occasion in more than 60 years that the Court has rejected explicit factual findings by the Congress, supported by a voluminous record. They, in fact, explicitly rejected the findings that a given activity substantially affects interstate commerce.  The Court justified the abandonment of the deference to Congress by declaring that whether particular activities sufficiently affect interstate commerce ``is ultimately a judicial rather than a legislative question.''  I could not disagree more fundamentally with the Court's ruling. Quite frankly, this will affect the Violence Against Women Act less than it is going to affect a whole lot of other things. The Supreme Court precedents have long recognized that Congress has the power to legislate with regard to local activities that, in the aggregate, have a substantial impact on interstate commerce.  I personally believe Justice Souter, who wrote the principal dissent in this case, had it right when he explained that:       [t]he fact of such a substantial effect is not an issue for      the courts in the first instance, but for the Congress, whose      institutional capacity for gathering evidence and taking      testimony far exceeds ours.  I am left wondering, where does the Court's decision leave Congress' formerly plenary power to remove serious obstructions to interstate commerce, whatever their source?  It is reminiscent of the Lockner era when they said, by the way, you have those labor standards having to do with mining--mining is not interstate commerce. Then they came along and said production is not interstate commerce. Then they said manufacturing is not interstate commerce. Until midway in the New Deal, with the end of the Lockner era, they said: Woe, woe, woe; wait a minute, wait a minute.  Unfortunately, this decision yesterday reads more as a decision written in 1930 than in the year 2000.  As Justice Souter documented so well in his dissent, the Court appears to be returning to a type of categorical analysis of Congress' power under the Commerce Clause that characterized the pre-New Deal era, where, as I said, manufacturing, mining, and production were all held to be off limits despite their obvious impact on interstate commerce. Now it is a new standard: ``Economic activity'' versus ``noneconomic activity.''  If Congress can regulate activity with substantial effects on interstate commerce, then I, as Justices Souter and Breyer, do not understand what difference it makes whether the causes of those substantial effects on interstate commerce are in and of themselves commercial.  In any event, suffice it to say that this type of formalistic, enclave analysis--where certain spheres of activity are held off limits to Congress--did not work in the 1930s and will work no better in the 21st century.  Because it is impossible to develop judicially defined subject matter categories spelling out in advance what is in Congress' Commerce Clause power and what is out, I believe the dissenting Justices are correct that Congress, not the courts, must remain primarily responsible for striking the right Federal-State balance, and that the Members of Congress are institutionally motivated to strike that balance by virtue of the fact that we represent our States and local interests as well as the Federal interest.  So why has the Court revived the form of analysis that so ill-served the Nation in the years leading up to the judicial crisis of 1937? Again, I find Justice Souter's explanation convincing: In both eras, the Court adopted these formalistic distinctions in interpreting the Commerce Clause in service of broader political theories shared by a majority of the Court's members.  In the pre-New Deal era, that broader political theory was laissez faire economics; now it is the new federalism. In both instances, the Court has been eager to substitute its own judgment for that of the political branches democratically elected by the people to do their business.  Those of you who are conservatives in this Congress, who say that you, in fact, want the democratically elected bodies making these decisions, I suggest to you that this is one of the most activist Courts we have had in 50 years. It is supplanting its judgment for the democratically elected branches of the Government.  So have at it, conservatives. This judicially active Court is supplanting their judgment for the democratically elected bodies.  Justice Stevens put it bluntly in his recent dissent in the recent age discrimination case. He said: The Court's federalism decisions constitute a ``judicial activism''--that is his quote, not mine--that is ``such a radical departure from the proper role of this Court that it should be opposed whenever an opportunity arises.''  This is one Senator who plans to keep up that opposition.  Stay tuned, folks, because what this upcoming election is about is the future--the future--of the power of the elected branches of the Government versus the Court which is appointed for life. This is a conservative agenda that is being forced upon the democratically elected bodies, as it was in the 1920s. The next President is going to get to pick somewhere between one and three new Justices.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a speech I made on the Supreme Court and its changing direction be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: Remarks By Joseph R. Biden, Jr., to the New Hampshire Supreme Court,                            Septmeber 17, 1999       Today marks the anniversary of an extraordinary event, the      212th anniversary of the birth of the Constitution of the      United States. On September 17, 1787, the Constitutional      Convention, its work complete, rose and submitted the      Constitution to the thirteen states for ratification.      Bringing together thirteen different states with diverse      cultures and established governments--some of these harking      back a hundred years--did not come easy. In 1775, at the time      of the Continental Congress, John Adams, writing to his wife,      Abigail, described: ``[f]ifty gentlemen meeting together all      strangers * * * not acquainted with each other's language,      ideas, views, designs. They are therefore jealous of each      other--fearful, timid, skittish.''       The men who attended that Constitutional Convention knew,      even then, that they had begun the greatest political      experiment in human history, producing a document that would      become an engine of change throughout the world. According to      James Madison's account, Governor Morris of Pennsylvania      stated that:       He came here as a Representative of America; he flattered      himself he came here in some degree as a Representative of      the whole human race; for the whole human race will be      affected by the proceedings of this Convention.       ``This Country,'' Governor Morris continued, must be      united. If persuasion does not unite it, the sword will. * *      * The scenes of horror attending civil commotion can not be      described. * * * The stronger party will then make [traitors]      of the weaker; and the Gallows & Halter will finish the work      of the sword.       The Framers, in their vision and wisdom, did unite the      country, fashioning a government that was both federal--that      is, comprised of sovereign states--and, at the same time,      truly national in power. The Framers respected and sustained      the essential role of the states. But, at the same time, the      Framers made national law supreme, a principle enshrined in      the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, and created a      government empowered to bind both the states and individuals,      powers denied the government under the Articles of      Confederation.       The Constitution also established a vigorous and      independent presidency--what Alexander Hamilton in the      Federalist Papers called ``energy in the executive''--by      freeing the Chief Executive from selection by the legislature      and granting the President real and meaningful powers. As      early as McCulloch v. Maryland, Chief Justice John Marshall      in 1819 recognized the ``great powers'' the national      government possessed:       to lay and collect taxes; to borrow money; to regulate      commerce; to declare and conduct a war; and to raise and      support armies and navies. The sword and the purse, all the      external relations, and no inconsiderable portion of the      industry of the nation, are entrusted to its government.       And, on this 212th anniversary of the crafting of the      Constitution--a day and age now marked by national malaise      about and distrust of our government and its institutions--it      is only fitting to reflect on how right Governor Morris was      about how the Framers' creation has transformed--and      transfixed --the human race. Under this Constitution, we      settled a vast continent--from the Atlantic to the Pacific      coasts; we mobilized millions of men to unite the nation and      end slavery, fulfilling the promise of the Constitution; we      ascended, like the mythical phoenix, from the ashes of the      Great Depression; we turned back despotism and preserved a      free Europe in two World Wars; we won the Cold War; and we      now enjoy economic and military power unrivaled across the      globe and unmatched in the history of the world. No small      achievements, these.       These achievements make us the envy of the world. Just last      week, I returned from a trip to six European countries,      including Kosovo, and I met with six Presidents. The      President of Bulgaria said to me:       I know of no other country that has risked the lives of its      young men and women and would spend $15 billion dollars on      behalf of a place in which it has no economic interest, no      strategic interest, and no territorial interest--only an      interest in defending human rights.       Could we have achieved these successes without vigorous      presidential leadership? We owe our position in the world to      the choices made by the Framers at the Constitutional      Convention. Imagine accomplishing what we have in the two      centuries of our brief history without a strong federal      government and a strong president.       More than our achievements, though, it is our public      institutions that other nations seek to imitate. In every      place I traveled around the world last month, every one of      those six foreign Presidents talked about how they wanted to      mimic American governmental institutions--our Congress, our      President, our courts. They do not talk about our resources;      they do not talk about the American people themselves; they      talk about our institutions. It is these public      institutions--not a common ethnicity or religion, which, of      course, we do not share--that acts as the glue that binds      this country together.       But although other nations clamor to model their      institutions after ours, our own public discourse reflects a      deep and abiding angst about and suspicion of our government.      Last November, only 38 percent of Americans voted, a 50-year      low that ranks the United States at or near the bottom of the      world's democracies in voter participation. As of 1995, voter      turnout in 14 European countries, by contrast, was above 70      percent.       And take Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward's recent      book, Shadow: Five Presidents and the Legacy of Watergate,      which New York Times columnist Frank Rich recently nicknamed      ``All the Presidents Stink.'' Woodward's book puts between      two covers a cynicism about government that you can purchase      for fifty cents by picking up a daily newspaper, and for less      than that by turning on your television. A style of attack      and scandal journalism toward public officials dominates the      news media--and studies by Kathleen Hall Jamieson, Dean of      the Annenburg School of Communication and her colleague      Joseph Cappella, have shown that cynical coverage breeds      cynical voter reactions.       It produces the kinds of expectations what were well      captured by Marvin Lucas, a 59-year-old custodial supervisor      at a college in Milledgeville, Georgia. Responding to a      Washington Post-Kaiser Foundation interviewer, Mr. Lucas said      ``I compare politicians with used car salesmen: say one      thing, do another.''       And the ``other thing'' that politicians do, of course, is      to feather their own nests and the nests of special interest      groups that support their reelection campaigns. That is the      dominant opinion people have of American elected officials.      If that is your starting point, it is no wonder that in 1994,      56 percent of Americans thought that government did more to      hinder their family's achieving the American dream than to      help them achieve it, while only 31 percent thought that      government helped them. (The numbers had improved by 1997,      but were still negative--47 percent to 38 percent).       Heaven knows that politicians are far from perfect, and our      own missteps and, yes, deceptions, contribute to the      country's cynical attitude. Some historians trace the      contemporary decline in faith in government to Lyndon      Johnson's 1964 Presidential campaign, where he pledged that      ``no American boy will fight a foreign war on a foreign soil      if I'm elected President.'' Within a year of that statement,      Johnson had ordered massive increases in draft calls and the      military build-up for the Vietnam War. Then Watergate cut      right to the heart of our faith in elected officials.       And today, highly negative campaigning has become an art      form, as each candidate tries to tag his opponent with being      an insider, or else being a corrupt person who just hasn't      had the chance to be corrupt on the inside yet. When Majority      Leader George Mitchell was retiring from the Senate, he      remarked to Jim Lehrer on the News Hour that so long as      campaigns consist of one candidate calling his opponent a      crook and the other calling his opponent a scoundrel, is it      any wonder that Americans believe that Congress is filled      with crooks and scoundrels?       So I don't want to understate the complexity of the sources      of contemporary cynicism and distrust toward elected      officials. What worries me, though, is that this cynicism and      distrust is way out of proportion to the actual      accomplishments of the federal government, and way out of      proportion to the sincerity and honesty with which my      colleagues conduct themselves every day in doing the      country's business.       This public cynicism is not the only current raging in      American politics today, however. There is a movement among      intellectuals, historians, and political scientists to shift      the locus of political power, or to ``devolve power,'' from      the national government to the states. George Will, one of      the champions of this ``devolution of power'' movement,      explained its premise as follows:       [I]t is unwholesome that Washington, like Caesar, has grown      so great. Power should flow back to where it came from and      belongs, back to the people and their state governments, back      to state capitals * * *       This is nothing less than a fight for the heart and soul of      America. This is a fight about power. And it is a fight about      who will be left in charge.       In my view, the value of devolution of power from the      national government to the states can be overstated.      Certainly the abuse of power, whenever it occurs, must be      checked. The federal government admittedly does tend to grab      power for itself without due regard for whether its goals can      better be achieved at the local level. But the state and      local governments, in contrast, tend toward parochialism      without due regard for the national interest. Thus,      devolution of power is not per se a good thing. At whatever      level of government, it all depends how that power is used.       It cannot be that the Framers intended to hamstring the      federal government in favor of the states. If that was their      intent, why abandon the Articles of Confederation? And just      try to imagine the United States attaining its successes to      date without a strong national government and a vigorous      President. To go one step further--imagine how difficult it      will be to fortify our position in the world in the 21st      century without a powerful central government.       The current cynicism about our public institutions, it      seems to me, is also beginning to gain a foothold in the      constitutional decisions of the Supreme Court, and that is      also of concern to me, and is something I would like to spend      the next few minutes discussing with you. Now first I want to      say that today's Supreme Court is the best-informed, hardest      working Court we have ever had. In particular, I want to      commend Justice Souter, a native son of this great state of      New Hampshire, for writing several of the most scholarly and      persuasive dissents this Court has seen in recent years--     dissents that I am confident will prove prophetic.       Yet the Supreme Court of today embodies both strands of the      phenomenon now plaguing our American culture--both the public      cynicism about, and the intellectual disdain for, our      national government. The Court is sharply critical of the      political branches of our federal government, accusing them      in case after case this decade of arrogating power to      themselves at the expense of state governments. But in      assuming the role of ``Chief Protector'' of the allocation of      power between the federal government and the states, the      Supreme Court of late has regrettably adopted a court-     centered view of the scope of federal power. In doing so, it      has arrogated to itself a responsibility that more properly      befits the political branches.       In my opinion, we have in the past eight years or so begun      to see a series of opinions in which the Supreme Court has      become bolder and bolder in stripping the federal government      of the ability to make decisions on behalf of the American      people. So far, the immediate effects of these decisions are      real, but relatively modest. They may represent marginal      readjustments in the allocation of power under      the Constitution. On the other hand, if I am right and the      jurisprudence is being driven by an oversized sense of      distrust and cynicism toward democratically elected      government--and especially toward the federal government--     the decisions could constitute the beginnings of a sea      change that could take us quite literally back to a style      of judicial imperialism unseen in this country since the      early 1930s.       The trio of cases decided by the Supreme Court at the very      end of the last Term are a prime example of this court-     centered view of federal power. For example, in its 5-4      decision in Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Education Expense      Board v. College Savings Bank, the Court held that Congress      had no power to subject the states to private patent      infringement suits in federal court because in the Court's      view, the statute was not ``appropriate'' legislation to      enforce the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court said no to patent      infringement cases against state entities because the Court--     not Congress--decided that legislation remedying patent      infringement by state entities was not really necessary. In      so deciding, the Court made a quintessentially legislative      judgment.       To the same effect was the companion case, College Savings      Bank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Education Expense      Board, in which the Court dismissed out of hand Congress'      effort to hold state entities accountable to private parties      for misrepresenting the states' commercial products in      violation of federal trademark law, because the Court decided      that the statute did not protect ``property rights'' within      the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment.       The two Florida Prepaid decisions unfortunately flow      directly from City of Boerne v. Flores, in which the Court in      1997 struck down the Religious Freedom Restoration Act as      also exceeding Congress' authority under section 5 of the      Fourteenth Amendment. In ruling that Congress had gone too      far in protecting religious liberty, the Court in essence      held that Congress had not done its homework to the Court's      satisfaction. The Court attacked the legislative record as      lacking what it considered to be sufficient modern instances      of religious bigotry and found that the statute was ``out of      proportion'' to its supposed remedial or preventive objects.      Again, the Court in effect decided that a law simply was not      really necessary.       Implicit in the Court's obvious willingness in Boerne to      second-guess Congress' legislative judgment in the name of      protecting     state governments is the notion that it is for the Supreme      Court, and not Congress, to specify the meaning of the      provisions of the Constitution, even when Congress claims to      enforce the individual liberties protected by the Fourteenth      Amendment.       It is as if the Court has forgotten that the only      institution mentioned in section 5 of the Fourteenth      Amendment is Congress. The text of section 5 is clear and      simple: ``The Congress shall have power to enforce, by      appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.'' It      was for Congress, not the courts, to be the primary guarantor      of individual rights as against oppression by state      authorities, and for Congress, not the courts, to assess      whether and what legislation is needed for that purpose.      Remember that the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted in the      long shadow of the Dred Scott decision. The court-centered      view the Court has since taken of that amendment is directly      at odds with the universal sentiment at the time of its      adoption that it was our federal legislature, not the courts,      that could best be trusted to police the states.       What seems to lie at the heart of the headline-grabbing      cases of the past few terms is the Court's willingness to      disregard the views of Congress in favor of its own. It is as      if the Court believes that it has a better sense of the      economic and other real-world implications of the laws      Congress passes than do those elected by the people to serve      in that branch.       The Court's recent decisions contain troubling echoes from      the New Deal era, when the Supreme Court was swift to      substitute its own judgment of what was desirable economic      legislation for that of Congress and the President. Here is      just one illustration from that bygone era: In Railroad      Retirement Board v. Alton Railroad Co., the Court in 1935      struck down the Railroad Retirement Act as unconstitutional,      in part because the Court concluded that it was not a valid      regulation of interstate commerce. Congress enacted the      statute, which established a compulsory retirement and      pension system for all railroad carriers, to promote      ``efficiency and safety in interstate transportation'' both      by reducing the aging population of employees and by      improving the employees' sense of security and morale. In its      opinion, the Court stated, however: ``We cannot agree that      these ends * * * encourage loyalty and continuity of      service.'' We cannot agree. That is a breathtaking      statement by a court which had abandoned its proper role.      We cannot agree?       And in denying Congress what Justice Breyer in dissent has      called ``necessary legislative flexibility,'' such as to      create, for example, ``a decentralized system of individual      private remedies,'' the Court has returned to the kind of      court-centered conception of federal power that typified not      only the New Deal era, but the Lochner era as well. As      Justice Souter predicted in his Alden v. Maine dissent      lamenting the Court's sovereign immunity decisions:       The resemblance of today's state sovereign immunity to the      Lochner era's industrial due process is striking. The Court      began this century by imputing immutable constitutional      status to a conception of economic self-reliance that was      never true to industrial life and grew insistently fictional      with the years, and the Court has chosen to close the century      by conferring like status on a conception of state sovereign      immunity that is true neither to history nor to the structure      of the Constitution. I expect the Court's latest essay into      immunity doctrine will prove the equal of its earlier      experiment in laissez-faire, the one being as unrealistic as      the other, as indefensible, and probably as fleeting.       (Justice Souter, I sincerely hope that you are correct when      you said ``probably as fleeting'' because if you are wrong,      and the Court's pronouncements endure, then I am afraid that      the country is in bigger trouble than I thought.)       Don't misunderstand me. I do not mean for a second to      disparage the role of the states. The states play a critical      part in warding off tyranny by the national government and in      performing all the fundamental functions with which the      governments closest to the people are charged. Certainly      those of you who live in this great state of New Hampshire--     whose motto is ``Live Free or Die''--understand that better      than anyone else. As James Madison wrote in the Federalist      Papers:       The powers reserved to the several States will extend to      all the objects which, in the ordinary course of affairs,      concern the lives, liberties, and properties of the people,      and the internal order, improvement, and prosperity of the      State.       But we should think long and hard before allowing one      branch of our government--the federal judiciary--to cripple      its co-equal branches, the political branches, of government.      To do so is to put in jeopardy all that we have accomplished      in our brief history and all that we may do in the future.       I must tell you that I am gravely concerned about the      direction the Court is headed. I have a particular stake in      this which I will confess now and that is the fate of the      civil rights remedy created by the Violence Against Women Act      of 1994, which I wrote. Earlier this year, the U.S. Court of      Appeals for the Fourth Circuit invalidated the civil rights      remedy in Brzonkala v. Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State      University, and the case may come before the Supreme Court in      the coming Term if the Court grants review.       The civil rights remedy creates a new federal cause of      action allowing a victim of gender-motivated violence to sue      her attacker in court. I believe--indeed, I know--that      violence against women restricts the participation of women      in the national economy, inhibits their production and      consumption of goods and services in interstate commerce, and      obstructs their ability to work and travel freely. In short,      violence against women was, and is, a national problem of      epic proportions that substantially and adversely affects      interstate commerce. A massive legislative record compiled      after four years of fact-finding hearings in Congress      irrefutably confirms the impact of violence against women on      the national economy and interstate commerce.       When we enacted the Violence Against Women Act civil rights      remedy in 1994, the Senate Judiciary Committee explicitly      found that the provision satisfied the ``modest threshold''      required by the Commerce Clause, and we in Congress were      confident of the statute's constitutionality. The civil      rights remedy quite appropriately attempted to remove an      obstruction to interstate commerce, much as the Civil Rights      Act of 1964 barred race discrimination in hotels and      restaurants because such discrimination, as the Court put it      in upholding the statute, ``imposed `an artificial      restriction on the market.' ''       But less than a year after we enacted the Violence Against      Women Act and its civil rights remedy, the Supreme Court      decided United States v. Lopez and invalidated, as beyond      Congress' Commerce Clause authority, the Gun-Free School      Zones Act, which prohibited the possession of a firearm      within 1000 feet of a school. In the wake of Lopez, I find      myself asking: Will this Court accept the congressional      judgment that violence against women adversely affects the      national economy? Or will this Court second-guess the remedy      we chose to address that effect?       Ironically, the Court may find itself the champion of      states' rights that the states do not even want. Just as with      the Patent Remedy Act, where no state testified in favor of      immunity from private patent infringement actions, the vast      majority of states strongly favor the Violence Against Women      Act civil rights remedy. Forty-one state attorneys general      wrote to Congress in favor of the statute, including the      civil rights remedy, before its enactment. Only a few weeks      ago, 33 Attorneys General submitted an amicus brief to the      Supreme Court asking the Court to grant the petition for      certiorari and uphold the statute because the states ``agree      with Congress that gender-based violence substantially      affects interstate commerce and the States cannot address      this problem adequately by themselves.''       I also fear that the Supreme Court's readiness to disregard      the people's judgment has served as a clarion call to the      federal courts to usher in what Judge Douglas Ginsburg of the      U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit has called the      ``Constitution in Exile.'' According to Judge Ginsburg, the      doctrine of enumerated powers, the nondelegation doctrine,      the Necessary and Proper, Contracts, Takings, and Commerce      clauses, had become ``ancient exiles, banished for standing      in opposition to unlimited government.''       In service of this ``Constitution-in-Exile,'' the lower      courts have begun to read the Constitution in a revolutionary      way. Thus, a district court in Alabama decided, remarkably,      that the Superfund amendments were unconstitutional because      they did not regulate interstate commerce, a decision later      reversed on appeal. Similarly, the Fourth Circuit's ruling      striking down the civil rights remedy of the Violence Against      Women Act transforms Lopez v. United States from an important      reminder that Congress' commerce power is not without limits,      into what is arguably the most momentous decision of the last      fifty years regarding the scope of federal power.       That same court of appeals has tightened the noose in yet      another way. The Fourth Circuit ruled last year in Condon v.      Reno, a case now under review by the Supreme Court, that      Congress may not pass a law when that law applies only to the      states, and not also to private individuals. In other words,      Congress may not require the states to comply with federal      law if the law does not also affect private individuals.       The jury is still out on whether the Supreme Court will let      the other shoe drop and sustain these additional restrictions      on federal power, but the Court seems primed and poised to do      so. Much hangs in the balance. If your eyes glaze over when I      speak about Congress authorizing private actions for patent      infringement or trademark violations by state entities, then      think about the Fair Labor Standards Act, which the Court      held last June in Alden v. Maine could not be enforced      against noncompliant states by state employees seeking      backpay. How far we have come from the Framers' vision of a      federal government strong enough and flexible enough to do      the people's business. As Justice Souter observed in his      dissent in Alden v. Maine:       Had the question been posed, state sovereign immunity could      not have been thought to shield a State from suit under      federal law on a subject committed to national jurisdiction      by Article I of the Constitution.       Other cases could potentially serve as a resounding wake-up      call as to the extent to which the federal government's hands      have been tied in addressing problems of national import. In      the coming Term, the Court will take up the question whether      the Congress had the power in the Age Discrimination in     Employment Act to authorize private law suits against state      violators. A case raising a similar issue with respect to the      Americans with Disabilities Act is sure to follow. And if the      Court says no, private individuals who suffer age,      disability, and other forms of discrimination at the hands      of state actors will have few means at their disposal to      enforce their rights under federal law, and the federal      government will rarely be able to help them.       The Court left open the possibility that the federal      government could sue noncompliant states, but if you think      that it is realistic for the federal government to come to      the rescue by going into court on a regular basis to      vindicate the federal rights of private individuals, think      again. I do not see a massive expansion of the federal      litigating corps happening any time soon. Nor do I see how      that could be anything but self-defeating if the goal is to      minimize the federal intrusion into state government affairs.      By elevating the states' sovereign immunity to an immutable      principle of constitutional law, the Court, as Justice Breyer      recognized in his College Savings Bank dissent: ``makes it      more difficult for Congress to decentralize governmental      decisionmaking and to provide individual citizens, or local      communities, with a variety of enforcement powers. By      diminishing congressional flexibility to do so, the Court      makes it somewhat more difficult to satisfy modern      federalism's more important liberty-protecting needs. In this      sense, it is counterproductive.''       Now don't get me wrong. Sometimes the federal and state      governments do not get their relationship quite right. We do      not have infallible institutions. But when the Supreme Court      restricts the flexibility of Congress to decide how best to      address national problems within the scope of its enumerated      powers, the Court truncates the learning process otherwise      underway in our political institutions--a result a      conservative court--conservative with a small ``c''--should      hesitate to effect.       The Court has imposed by fiat limitations on the exercise      of federal power that might very well have come about without      the Court's interference. In other words, the Court in Garcia      v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority got it right      when, in 1985, it overruled National League of Cities v.      Usery, a case decided a decade earlier, that had restricted      the federal government's power to regulate the states ``in      areas of traditional governmental functions.'' Instead, the      Court announced in Garcia that the political process, not the      Court, should serve as the principal check on federal      overreaching. I must disagree with the notion that leaving it      to Congress and the President is like leaving the fox to      guard the chicken coop, or as Justice O'Connor put it in her      dissent in Garcia, like leaving the ``essentials of state      sovereignty'' to Congress' ``underdeveloped capacity for      self-restraint.''       The Violence Against Women Act civil rights remedy is a      good example of Congress' developing capacity for self-     restraint. At the outset, those most concerned about domestic      violence and rape wanted a statute with a broad sweep, and so      we started out by introducing a provision in 1990 that      arguably would have federalized a significant portion of      state laws against domestic violence and rape. But the      Conference of Chief Justices of State Supreme Courts, the      Judicial Conference of the United States--and Chief Justice      Rehnquist, in particular--pointed out to Congress, while the      bill was under consideration, that the civil rights provision      might significantly interfere with the states' handling of      domestic relations and rape cases, while at the same time,      overburdening the federal courts. The federal and state      judiciaries raised the concern, we examined it, and we      decided that they were right. Congress then carefully      redrafted the civil rights remedy so that it would not have      that effect.       There are other recent examples--such as the Unfunded      Mandates Act--that came about because the states complained      to Congress that we were forcing them to use their tax      dollars to do whatever we mandated in Washington. The states      staged a mini-rebellion. So Congress wrote a new law      requiring federal restraint. And for that, I must give my      Republican colleagues their due.       But when the Supreme Court plays traffic cop on the streets      of federalism, the Court does our country a disservice by      cutting this national political dialogue short. We are      already reaching many of the conclusions the Court has now      cemented into the Constitution. James Madison wrote in the      Federalist Papers that the new federal government would be      sufficiently national and local in spirit as ``to be      disinclined to invade the rights of the individual States, or      the prerogatives of their governments.'' Our political      institutions can be trusted. The Framers understood this.       In short, the disconnect between our public and cultural      perceptions of our institutions and reality is stunning. Keep      in mind that the rest of the world is struggling to      emulate our institutions because they believe it is our      institutions that separate us from other nations--indeed,      from other democracies--and are the bedrock upon which our      successes are founded.       Yet our public discourse, our legal opinions, our very      culture, are compelling us to overlook or scorn our own      accomplishments. We are losing, as a nation, the communal      notion that our strength lies in our institutions.      Relentlessly accentuating the negative when it comes to our      political institutions, however, eclipses our considerable      successes. And this predilection to distrust the political      branches now seems to be shared equally by the judicial      branch, not only when it comes time to decide how to      distribute power between the federal government and the      states, but also when it comes to making a judgment of what      is in the best interests of Americans.       I talked to you tonight about cynicism, devolution of      power, and how we got here. In my view, all of that can be      overcome by the right leadership, the right people in power,      who will recharge the public's imagination and confidence.      The public mood can be transformed in an election, a single      cycle. Maybe it will take a generation. But it can be      changed. Elected officials who cater too much or too little      to state interests can be voted out of office. But if the      Supreme Court chisels into stone new constitutional      restrictions on federal power, new hoops through which      Congress must leap, where will we be then? You cannot go to      the polls to undo a constitutional ruling of the Supreme      Court. There is no further appeal--no appeal to a higher      court, no appeal to the voters. Nothing short of a new      constitutional convention or an amendment to the      Constitution--and you know how easy that is--or will do.      James Madison was right: trust the political process. ``WE      CANNOT AGREE''? Please.       Let me conclude by making the following simple point: if,      at the federal level, we are such a failure institutionally,      why does the rest of the world look to us to copy our      supposed frailties? If we are such a failure--with our last      six Presidents supposedly flops--how is that our incomes are      actually growing, crime is going down, drug use is down, and      our economy is in better shape than that of any nation in the      history of the world? How did we produce a nation willing and      able, as the President of Bulgaria pointed out, to spend      billions of dollars and risk the lives of its men and women      to advance the cause of human rights? Did it happen by      chance? Did it happen by accident? It happened as a direct      result of our unique political institutions.       The Framers set out to create a centralized government      robust enough to deal with national problems, but with built-     in guarantees that it be respectful of, and sensitive to,      local concerns. There is an inherent tension in the document.      But look at the sweep of history: as the balance of power has      shifted back and forth between the national government and      the states, our resilient political branches have adjusted      and responded. The rest of the world gets it.       We must remember that politics--and politicians--are not      the enemy. The Constitutional Convention was composed of men      who were regarded as gifted even in their own day. As the      French charge d'affaires wrote to his government as the      Convention convened:       If all the delegates named for this Convention at      Philadelphia are present, we will never have seen, even in      Europe, an assembly more respectable for the talents,      knowledge, disinterestedness, and patriotism of those who      compose it.       Above all else, these men were politicians. And I am not      suggesting by this that our government today boasts the likes      of a Jefferson or a Madison, but I am suggesting that we have      fine and decent men and women with significant capabilities      who choose public service. And some of you are among them.       The hostility we see from the Supreme Court toward the      elected branches of government is the same suspicion we see      in the eyes of the ordinary person on the street.      ``Politics'' has become a dirty word. But as those of you      here who live in this state of strong local community      governments and town hall meetings, know better than anyone,      ``politics'' is fundamental to how we govern ourselves in a      democracy. At the end of the day, politics is the only way a      community can govern itself and realize its goals without the      sword.       So I stand before you today, on this 212th anniversary of      the completion of the work of the Constitutional Convention,      ready and willing to defend politics--even national politics.      It was what those 50 gentlemen, all strangers, who met 212      years ago defended and vindicated. And it is what, in the      end, has made and will continue to make us secure and strong.                          ____________________
