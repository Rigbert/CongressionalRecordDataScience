 I am from a farm State. I want a farm bill. We have been discussing how to go forward. If I may be so bold to suggest--I know Senator Chambliss and Senator Harkin have been working on a list of amendments. I think we ought to see if we can lock in a list. It will be bigger than we would like, but that is the way it always starts. Most of those will go away in one way or another, but at least it would help define the universe. I think that is achievable, hopefully sometime this afternoon, and it will allow us to get started. That is what I would recommend.
