President, this amendment has consequences to our allies, including Libya, Tunisia, Jordan, Egypt, even Saudi Arabia, and Israel. Basically, this amendment has consequences, introducing it on the floor of the Senate has consequences, debating it has consequences, and voting for it has consequences.  I am going to close by calling to mind a lesson of historical precedent. Upon learning of the attack on Pearl Harbor, Sir Winston Churchill said this:       Silly people; that was the description many gave in      discounting the force of the United States. Some said they      were soft, others that they would never be united, that they      would never come to grips. They would never stand for      bloodletting, that their system of government and democracy      would paralyze their effort.       Now we will see the weakness of this numerous but remote,      wealthy and talkative people. But, American blood flows in my      veins. I thought of a remark made to me years before--the      United States is like a gigantic boiler. Once the fire of      freedom is lighted under it, there is no limit to the power      it can generate. It is a matter of resolve.  I say to my colleagues that, if approved, this amendment could, in a matter of minutes, undo that resolve now, and for the next generation who will face new threats to our way of life. Setting an artificial timetable will send the wrong message to the Iraqi's, who need to know that America will not leave before the job is done, and our troops, who must know that we are serious about the mission that they are risking their lives to achieve.
