President, I rise today to commend the Senate's confirmation of Margaret Ellen Curran as U.S. Attorney for the District of Rhode Island. I am proud to have been involved in the historic nomination of this outstanding career prosecutor. A native of Providence, Meg is the first woman to serve as Rhode Island's federal attorney. Her confirmation by the U.S. Senate today sends a clear message to career federal attorneys that their work and service is valued.  Ms. Curran brings not only the necessary legal expertise and technical skill to this position, but she has also demonstrated the prosecutorial temperament necessary to carry out her significant responsibilities in a fair and judicious manner. I am confident that U.S. Attorney Curran will serve Rhode Island and its people extremely well.  Ms. Curran graduated from Pilgrim High School in Warwick. She received a B.A. degree from the University of Pennsylvania, a Master of Science from Purdue University, and her law degree from the University of Connecticut School of Law, where she was Editor in Chief of the Law Review. After graduation, Meg served as a law clerk to the Honorable Bruce Selya, then a federal district judge in Rhode Island. She nexted served a clerkship for the Honorable Thomas Meskill on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. After her second clerkship, in 1985, Meg became an associate at the Providence law firm of Wistow & Barylick pursuing general litigation matters.  Since 1986, when she joined the U.S. Attorney's Office in Rhode Island, Meg has distinguished herself as an outstanding prosecutor. As a trail prosecutor, Meg tried a range of cases involving white-collar criminals, organized crime, illegal weapons possession, and was responsible for obtaining the largest monetary penalty, at the time, for the illegal discharge of pollutants into Narragansett Bay.  In 1990, Meg was appointed as the district's Principal Appellate Attorney and Appellate Chief. In that position she has had primary responsibility for all appeals. As Appellate Chief she has successfully pursued precedent setting cases involving both mandatory sentencing for career criminals as well as heightened penalties for dealers of dangerous drugs.  Meg has proven herself an accomplished trial and appellate attorney, and, for this, she has been recognized. She has received the annual Special Achievement Awards for Sustained Superior Performance of Duty from the Department of Justice four times. In 1993, she was named the Federal Employee of the Year by the Federal Executive Council of Rhode Island. Today, the United States Senate has provided her with the ultimate recognition of a career prosecutor by confirming her as U.S. Attorney for the District of Rhode Island.  In addition to her professional service, Meg has also found time to serve her community. Since 1995, Meg has been an adjunct professor at Roger Williams University School of Law, teaching advanced criminal procedure. She is a member of the Rhode Island Bar Association and serves on the Federal Bench/Bar Committee. Meg also serves on the First Circuit Gender Bias Task Force and is a member of the Board of Trustees of the Rode Island Zoological Society.  Mr. President, I am proud to have been involved in the nomination of U.S. Attorney Curran. I wish her, her husband Michael, and their daughter Margee the very best.                     confirmation of cardell cooper
