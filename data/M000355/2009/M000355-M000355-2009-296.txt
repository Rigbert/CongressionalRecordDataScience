 REID. Probably around 3 o'clock. We are going to come in Monday at 1 and work through these amendments we have remaining on hate crimes, and then we would go to the matter that will be offered by the Republicans tonight. When we complete that, we will finish the work in 2 hours on the F-22 amendment.  So next week, everybody, we will start early on Monday, as I have indicated, and we will have, perhaps, some long days. This is an important piece of legislation.
