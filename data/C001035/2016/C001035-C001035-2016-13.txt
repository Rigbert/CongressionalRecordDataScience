President, I am delighted to commend Reeds Brook Middle School of Hampden, ME, on being named a 2016 National Blue Ribbon School of Excellence. This outstanding middle school is one of only 329 schools across the country to receive Blue Ribbon recognition from the U.S. Department of Education.  Created in 1982, the Blue Ribbon Schools Program honors public and private schools that are either academically superior in their States or that demonstrate significant gains in student achievement. The schools singled out for this national recognition are models of high educational standards and accountability.  The Blue Ribbon designation continues Reeds Brook's tradition of quality education. In 1997, just 2 years after it opened, the school became just one of five middle schools in Maine to be accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges. Today, after earning reaccreditation in 2007, Reeds Brook Middle School is one of just three Maine middle schools to achieve that distinction.  This award recognizes the hard work and determination of Reeds Brook Middle School's pupils, teachers, and staff. It is a top-performing school on State-required assessments, and educators at the school use assessments throughout the academic year as a tool for improving and customizing instruction. A strong commitment to professional development ensures that teachers and staff, as well as students, are lifelong learners.  Reeds Brook excels as a school built on a foundation of responsibility, respect, honesty, and compassion. Through a unique weekly trading card program, teachers and staff recognize students who demonstrate those values, instilling a sense of individual and school pride.  Reeds Brook Middle School is known for its extensive extracurricular activities in academics, athletics, and the arts, and students are encouraged to pursue their interests. An on-site garden and greenhouse promote volunteerism throughout the community. Students serve their community by working with the local food pantry and recycling center.  Two projects underscore the values that guide Reeds Brook Middle School. Students avidly support the Special Olympics, championing and cheering not just their team, but also athletes from other schools. Through an ongoing project, students meet with and interview local veterans, preserving the veterans' living histories and honoring their service.  This Blue Ribbon award is a tribute not only to the students, but also to the administrators, teachers, staff, and parents of Reeds Brook Middle School. Together, they are succeeding in their mission to generate excitement and momentum for learning. They aremaking a difference in the lives of their students, helping them reach their full potential as independent, responsible learners and citizens. I congratulate the entire Hampden community for this well-deserved recognition.                          ____________________
