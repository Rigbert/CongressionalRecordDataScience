President, I am very pleased to offer this amendment with my colleague, Senator Snowe of Maine. It is a bipartisan amendment that would increase funding for LIHEAP from $3.2 billion to $5.1 billion. That $5.1 billion is the total we spent this year.  This is a program critical to seniors, critical to low-income people. With unemployment rates soaring in double digits, there are more and more people who will qualify. If we do not raise this ceiling, approximately 1.5 million households will lose help with their heating bills, not only in the wintertime but in the hot months in the areas of the Southwest and Southeast because they, too, benefit from LIHEAP.  Mr. President, I would be prepared to accept a voice vote, hopefully a very positive voice vote. If not, I would ask for the yeas and nays.
