Speaker, reclaiming my time, the majority leader and I serve in a coequal branch of government. We don't serve at the pleasure of the President, nor should we go hand in hand to the President of the United States and say: Can we do this?  The majority leader, of course, did not answer my question. He wants to continue to talk about who voted for or against the omnibus as opposed to responding to are we going to have a balanced budget on the floor. We can have amendments on the floor; that sounds good. We can articulate that we are going to grow ourselves out. But doing it, just do it.  Yes, temporarily, the courts have said the President didn't do the right thing in the right way, so there has been a stay. And the gentleman is correct that the DACA students are not at risk as of March 5. I say ``students.'' Some of them are students; some are not.  Words do, in fact, mean something. The leader says that all he wants is border security. Well, border security, and he wants to restrict the ability to unify moms and dads and their children in the United States of America.  Mr. McCARTHY. Will the gentleman yield?
