 I want to thank Chairman Levin. Chairman Levin has worked, along with his staff, Janice Mays, the staff director and other members of an extraordinary staff, around the clock. And I am sure Mr. Camp would say his Republican staff has worked around the clock, too. We thank all of them for the work that they do. I thank Mr. Levin for his leadership, for his focus, and his tenaciousness in bringing us to this point.  Let me make a couple of observations before I speak pointedly about the bill. First of all, ladies and gentlemen of this House, the public understands that there is no bipartisanship in this House. All Republicans are going to vote against this bill, my presumption is. Maybe I am wrong. I hope I am wrong. But my presumption is they'll vote to a person against this bill.  They have voted almost to a person against every bill that we have passed over the last 16 months to try to bring this economy back from the extraordinarily deep recession, the deepest that we have had in 75 years, resulting from the economic policies that they put in place when they were exclusively in control.  Yet they come to the floor and talk about deficits. Democrats of course, when we controlled the Presidency, created one of the highest surpluses, and indeed the only administration that had a net surplus after 8 years, the Clinton administration. The Republicans will say, yes, but for 6 of those years we controlled the Congress. And my response is, yes, and for 12 of the years you controlled the Congress, and 6 of those under a Republican President, George Bush.  Unfortunately, every year that I have been here serving with a Republican President, every year without exception, we have had large deficits. Every year. However, under Bill Clinton we had the only 4 surplus years that I have been here. We had 4 surplus years as a result of an economic program that was adopted. Again, it was adopted exclusively by Democrats. No Republican voted for that in 1993 either in the House or in the Senate.  So we created surpluses. We got the economy moving. And then my friend on the other side talks about jobs; we should have had hearings about job creation. Frankly, the worst period of job creation in the last 30 years was the 8 years of the Bush administration. Without exception the worst. Stark example: the Clinton administration, 216,000 jobs created per month; the Bush administration, 11,000 jobs per month. That's 205,000 jobs per month, over 2 million per year.  That is why, of course, because of that disastrous economic performance, we fell into this extraordinary ditch that we have tried to pull ourselves out of. And we are coming out of it. That's the good news, Mr. and Mrs. America, my colleagues. We are coming out of it. It's slow, it's not as fast as we would like, but it's successful.  Now, I give you an interesting fact: over the last 4 months of an economic program, the Recovery Act and other jobs bills that we passed, we have created 573,000 jobs in the last 4 months. All positive months. If the next two-thirds of the year replicate that production, we will create more jobs thisyear after this deepest recession any of us in this Chamber have experienced ever in our lifetimes, we will create more jobs this year, if we replicate the first third of the year, than the Bush administration created in its 8 years. Hear that statistic and check me if I am wrong. About 1.7 million jobs versus a little over a million jobs over the 96 months were net created during the Bush administration.                              {time}  1300  So when we talk about jobs and deficits, I think we have some credibility. We have some credibility because we created surpluses; the only 4 years of surplus, again, under the Clinton administration, that we had in my 30 years in Congress. And in terms of jobs, Bill Clinton created 21 million private-sector jobs during the course of his Presidency. George Bush? Approximately a million. A stark difference in the impact of the economic policies pursued by the two parties.  I would hope some of you would say to yourselves that--not because we're trying to place blame, but because we're probably trying to learn, hopefully, from our experience. And you might come to the conclusion at some point in time, You know what? What they have suggested works. What they have pursued works, contrary to what Mr. Armey, who was your former majority leader who, when we adopted that program in 1993, said we would have deep deficits and exploding unemployment. We had exactly the opposite. We had declining deficits and 4 years of surplus and an explosion of job creation; 216,000 a month.  We continue to pursue creation of jobs. That's what this bill is about, creation of jobs. We're also pursuing closing tax loopholes and making sure people don't offshore jobs so we keep jobs here in America, since inheriting the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression and an economy shedding almost 800,000 jobs per month. That's not creating jobs; that's losing. During the last 3 months of the Bush administration, we lost about 750,000 jobs per month, 1\1/2\ million in 3 months, as opposed to creating 573,000 in the last 4 months.  President Obama and the 111th Congress have been dedicated to standing up for the middle class, its interests, and its future. The work continues today with the American Jobs Closing Tax Loopholes and Preventing Outsourcing Act, which will support millions of American jobs.  This bill is a significant investment in America's entrepreneurs and its workers. It helps to restore the flow of credit to small businesses, which hire the majority of America's workers. It extends the important R&D tax credit, research and development, which helps businesses innovate, grow, and create jobs. That's what we need to be about, creating jobs for our people.  It invests in the successful Build America Bonds and Recovery Zone Bonds, which create jobs and build much needed projects, like schools, hospitals, roads, and public transit. It puts young people to work with summer jobs programs so that they're not out in the streets, so they start to learn some skills, so that they have something to do with their time. That's good for them to learn job skills, that's good to get projects done that need to be done, and it provides for idle hands having work.  This bill also protects the safety net for Americans who are out of work through no fault of their own. It extends their unemployment insurance and helps them keep their health coverage. That's not only the right thing to do; it is also one of the most effective ways to boost local economies.  In addition, by preventing physician reimbursement rates from falling, it ensures that millions of seniors, military retirees, and people with disabilities can continue seeing their doctors.  Now, let me say something about what the ranking member said, for whom I have a great deal of respect. He said the docs don't like this. I don't like this. Unfortunately, none of your colleagues in the United States Senate voted for a bill that we sent to them. I don't think any of you voted over here for it either, which made a permanent fix to this doctors' roller coaster of pretending that we're going to cut doctors' reimbursement. We're not going to do that. We're not going to do it because we want to make sure that our seniors, that our folks with disabilities and others have access to their doctors. So we're not going to do that.  So we play a game. It is a game of dollars, of course, an important game. But we play a game that we're somehow not going to do it, so we do it in short stretches. You did the same thing when you were in charge. We're doing it again.  We should do this permanently. The Speaker is for permanent fix. I'm for permanent fix. And if we need to pay for it, I will vote to pay for it. And we do need to pay for it. Now, whether we need to pay for it immediately all up front or we pay for it as we do sporadically, but either way, we all know we're going to do this.  So I say to my friend, I understand the doctors are not pleased. I am not pleased. The Speaker's not pleased. Mr. Levin is not pleased. And certainly Mr. Waxman is not pleased. And my colleagues on this side of the aisle are not pleased. I presume your colleagues are not either. But, frankly, this is what you did when you were in charge. And we're doing it for the same reason: We need to get the votes. And I'm hopeful that we can join together in a bipartisan way at some point in time, and because we don't have a bipartisan way, frankly, we've got to carry the load ourselves.  I've been in the minority. It's easy to say ``no.'' It's much easier being in the minority. When I was the minority whip, nobody ever asked me did I lose by 1 or did I lose by 20. They assumed I was going to lose, and it didn't matter how much I lost by. Now, of course, if I lose by 1, they know that and I get a lot of flack, properly so.  So we could do better policy if we would do bipartisan policy, if we could do a broader outlook. So I invite you to engage. I don't think you'll do so today, but I hope you will in the future. That's not the only right thing to do. It's also one of the most effective ways to boost our local economies.  In addition, by preventing physician reimbursement rates from falling, it insures that millions of seniors, military retirees, and people with disabilities can continue seeing their doctors. We hope you don't vote against that. It will be a separate vote. You won't have to vote for the rest of the stuff if you don't like it, but vote for the SGR. Vote at least for the next 19 months to say to doctors, We're going to reimburse you at a proper rate to serve seniors, military retirees, and people with disabilities. At least vote for that one if you think docs ought to be reimbursed. Or if you think docs ought to have a 21-percent cut, vote against it.  Those are some of the many steps this bill takes to create jobs and protect Americans struggling in hard times. But just as importantly, this job creation is funded by efforts to close unfair tax loopholes and enforce corporate accountability. This bill would close the loophole that enables Wall Street fund managers to pay taxes at a rate 20 percent lower than the rate for ordinary working Americans. We differ on that. I understand that. And a lot of people have talked about how we can tweak that, if you will. It's a question, however, of basic fairness of taxing people on money they earn at similar rates. And I want to say something on that, because I think there's been some misinterpretation.  I can't speak for every one of my Democratic colleagues, but I'm a strong believer that if people take money out of their pocket, take capital at risk, that there ought to be a differential tax rate, and there is and there will continue to be. At least with my support, there will continue to be.  Further, this bill closes the tax loophole that lets multinational corporations profit by shipping jobs overseas and putting Americans out of work. I believe most of you on the other side of the aisle, my friends and colleagues, don't believe that's a proper thing for us to do. I hope you will join us on that.  By taking advantage of the foreign tax credit, these corporations are able to avoid American and foreign taxes, giving them incentives to move offshore and take jobs from people here at home. Again, tax fairness and the needs of our middle class both urge us to close this loophole. Another loophole for the privileged that Republicans have defended for years.  Finally, this bill takes the first step to hold the oil industry accountable forthe historic mess it made in the Gulf of Mexico. British Petroleum will be millions of dollars in debt when this concludes. It increases the amount the oil industry must pay into the Oil Spill Liability Trust.  I urge my colleagues to support this bill. It's a good bill for jobs. It's a good bill for closing tax loopholes. It's a good bill for dissuading people from taking jobs overseas. Take this step for America, and continue to build on the economic progress that we have made over the last 17 months.
