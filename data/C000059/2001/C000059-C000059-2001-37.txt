Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication to the community and to the overall well-being of my hometown of Corona, CA, is exceptional. The city of Corona has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated business and community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give time and talent to making their communities a better place to live and work. Karen E. Stein is one of these individuals.  On December 4, 2001, Karen Stein will be honored as the outgoing 2001 City of Corona Mayor, after serving two terms on the city council. Currently serving on the Corona City Council's Infrastructure and Economic Development Committees, Karen was first elected to the Corona City Council in 1994. Previously she was a member of the Corona/Norco Unified School District Board of Trustees, the Corona Parks and Recreation Commission and the Corona Chamber of Commerce.  As a past chairwoman of the Regional Water Quality Control Board-Santa Ana Region, Karen Stein spearheaded a successful effort in 1995 to expand the city of Corona's wastewater treatment plant.  Karen Stein's leadership has been instrumental in strengthening the bonds between the city and business community. A person with passion and principles, who has strived to have a positive effect upon her local community, her other community activities include: the Fender Museum of the Arts Foundation Board of Directors, member of the Corona Historic Preservation Society, charter member of UNITY (United Neighbors Involving Today's Youth) and more.  Unquestionably a leader of women in her community, Karen has received numerous awards including being named ``Woman of Distinction'' by the Inland Empire Business Press and Soroptimist International.  Karen's tireless, engaged action have propelled the city of Corona forward in a positive and progressive manner. Her work to promote the businesses, schools and community organizations of the city of Corona make me proud to call her a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that all of Corona is grateful for her contribution to the betterment of the community and salute her as she departs. I look forward to continuing to work with her for the good of our community in the future.                          ____________________
