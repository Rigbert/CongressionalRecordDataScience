 President, on another matter, as the Senate continues to process nominations, I would like to take a moment to say a few words about one for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit whom we will confirm this week.  Judge Amul Thapar served with distinction on the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky for close to a decade, having previously served as U.S. attorney for that same district and as assistant U.S. attorney for several years before that.  He was the first South Asian American to become a Federal judge, and once he is confirmed to the Sixth Circuit, Judge Thapar will be only the second South Asian American to serve on a Federal circuit court.
