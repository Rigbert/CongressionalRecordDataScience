  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, the Republican majority, who've been stampeded by a radical minority of their Conference, are continuing the game of Whac-A-Mole; every time something visible pops up on television about yet another Federal agency and people having been disadvantaged, particularly when it affects Republican districts or constituencies they have some concern about, they play Whac-A-Mole. That's fun, that one. They know it's not going to happen and they know it's not going to be accepted, but they're pretending to care. It's time to stop pretending to care and to really care.  We just did a great applause for the Capitol Police. I was standing with everybody else. Guess what? They're working, they're not getting paid, and they can't take leave or be sick because they're essential employees. That's what's happening to every essential Federal employee in this country. Their life is being blown up. They're not getting paid. They can't take leave. They can't be sick.  This is not right. It's time to just allow this body to vote on a clean continuing resolution. What are you afraid of? Are afraid it would pass, to temporarily fund the government until November 15? Is that too much to ask? Then you can negotiate.                          ____________________
