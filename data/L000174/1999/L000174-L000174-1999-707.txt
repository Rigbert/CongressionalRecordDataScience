 Just so the distinguished Senator from Utah can hear this, I appreciate the fact that he has included many of the provisions in this bill I had argued for in the last Congress. I compliment him on that. I did that earlier today when I spoke, referring to the Hatch-Biden-Sessions amendment. I tell the distinguished chairman that as he and I are both people who believe in redemption, and I would say this is a long way from redemption, going from 1997 to 1999, but hope springs eternal, and he has included some of my provisions in this bill. I appreciate it.  I note that the original bill provided $15 million for primary prevention. This amendment would earmark another $112.5 million.  I understand the distinguished Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, would like to be added as a cosponsor. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for that.
