Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 minutes.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I will be brief. I understand the gentleman's frustrations, and on its surface, it is a great idea. The problem is, unless things are reformed at the Office of Management and Budget, the trolls under the bridge with the green eye shades who have way too much clout here in Washington, D.C., and are invisible, this will empower them further, potentially. They rank projects according to cost effectiveness.  So you can essentially move your project up if you can afford to put more money in it and it will jump ahead of other projects which were higher-ranked, cost-effective projects, but OMB is going to choose the one at the top, which will empower communities that can afford to contribute more and perhaps perpetually push communities that can't afford to contribute more than their regular share to the bottom of the heap, never to be funded.  Of course, I already talked about the backlog of now $74 billion of authorized unfunded projects while we still misspend the trust fund moneys on other parts of the government. That, of course, was subject to earlier debate where the Republicans stripped that out of the bill, which would have helped deal with some of these problems.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
