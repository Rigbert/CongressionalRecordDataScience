 Chairman.  I would like to pick up on some of the points the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Gilchrest) made, because intruth, this is a very sad debate. I will not forget several years ago when farm families from Wisconsin and Minnesota came to my office. They were here for some national meeting. They knew that I was concerned about the preservation of the family farm. I will not forget the women farmers weeping in my office as they fought desperately to keep their farms going in Wisconsin and in Minnesota.  The family farmers in Wisconsin and in Minnesota are being hurt, that is true, but I want the Members to understand that the farmers in Vermont are also being driven off the land. Some of the best people in our State who have worked year after year, they love the land, they want to produce a good, healthy product, they want their kids on the land, they are also being driven off the land.  It is a sad State of affairs that we have to fight against each other. We should be working together. We talk about the issue of preserving the family farm, as the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Gilchrest) pointed out. This is an issue of food security. If anyone believes that it is a good thing for this country that thousands of farmers in Wisconsin, in Vermont, and all over this country who produce what we eat get driven off of the land, and that we are reduced to dependency on imports from abroad, or we are reduced to being dependent on a handful of large corporations to charge us any price they want, if people think that is a good idea, they are dead wrong. It is not a good idea.  As the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Gilchrest) pointed out, preserving the family farm is not just about food, it is protecting our environment. Do we really want to see our open space in rural America converted into malls and parking lots? I do not think so. It is about preserving our rural economy and our way of life, in part.  The free market does some things very well, but it does not do everything very well. I think there should be a commitment to preserving the family farm all over this country.  As the gentleman from New York (Mr. Solomon) has pointed out and others have pointed out, there is a letter that has been circulated that has over 250 Members of the House in support of that. Let me just briefly quote some of the sections from that letter relevant to this debate.  I quote from the letter:  ``Option 1(b) would further reduce the price of milk received by farmers in almost all regions of the country. It will be reducing local supplies of fresh, fluid milk, and increasing costs for consumers.''  I continue: ``According to USDA's own analysis, option 1(b) would reduce dairy farmer income. It will be accelerating the already disturbing trend of American dairy farms being forced out of business. Many of the farms affected will be small family farms.''  The point we are making here is that, as the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Gilchrest) indicated, we need to come together to preserve dairy farms in the Northeast, in the Midwest, and in the West Coast. One of the things we have done in New England that people throughout the country are beginning to look at is the concept of the dairy compact.  If some people think we are going to be able to preserve family farms who are struggling too hard to exist through the market economy, when we can import cheap milk from Mexico or New Zealand, I beg to differ. I think it is appropriate to say that in our democratic society, for those of us who believe in dairy farming, in family farming, that it is appropriate for the government to intervene with the support of the people.  I would reiterate that in New England six States have come together, six State legislatures have come together, Democrat, Republican, Independents, in Maine; six Governors with different philosophical leanings have come together. This idea is spreading around the country.                              {time}  1415  I would hope that perhaps the Midwest might think of the idea of a compact. I think if it does end up costing the consumer a few cents more on the gallon, consumers all over this country know how important it is to preserve the family farm. I would love to work with my friends from Wisconsin in protecting the family farms in that region of the country as well.
