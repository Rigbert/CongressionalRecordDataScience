Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time. I want to thank Mr. Taylor for his courage and leadership, and especially his compassion, in including this very important amendment that will prevent the use of all public funds, taxpayer funds, whether they be Federal or locally-raised, but all of which are under the jurisdiction of the Congress and so under the jurisdiction of the United States Constitution. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking the lead in ensuring that the legislation you have brought to the floor will in no way put unborn children at risk.  It will save lives.  Let me remind Members, when this provision was not in effect, the District of Columbia used to perform, with public funds, taxpayer funds, something on the order of over 3,000 abortions every year.                              {time}  1800  All you have to do is open up the phone book and you see that many of the organizations, like Planned Parenthood and others, are doing abortions right up to the 24th week, 24 weeks! These are precious babies, worthy of respect. Rather than killing children, our debate ought to be how we can best mitigate disease or do microsurgery, to treat that baby as a patient rather than something that is to be destroyed like a tumor or something that is unwanted.  Unwantedness makes children objects--throwaways.  Let me remind my colleagues, I think it cannot be said enough, abortion is child abuse. One of these days my friends on the other side of this issue are going to take the time, and I think for a few that has already begun, at least to some extent, with the partial-birth abortion debate. For the first time, Americans--Members of Congress-- are taking the time to recognize that it is the deed that we are talking about. Abortion is a violent act. Dismembering an unborn child by literally taking off and hacking off the arms and the legs and even the head, that is not a benign or a compassionate act. It is child abuse. It is violence.  If you dismembered a child after he or she were born, you would rightfully be brought up on charges of abusing children. A child before birth is no less human and no less alive. Yes, he or she happens to be dependent and they are less mature than a newborn infant or toddler, but they are no less human.  I truly believe that the abortion issue, the respect for unborn children is the ultimate human rights issue. I have been in Congress for 18 years. I work day and night, my Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights is the lead committee in Congress on human rights. We have had about 70 or more hearings since I assumed the chair on Indonesia, China, Cuba, Turkey, Iraq to name a few, promoting human rights.  Human rights are dear to my heart. Respect for life is of surpassing importance. The right to life is the most elemental of all human rights. And to arbitrarily say that birth, which is only an event that happens to each and every one of us, it is not the beginning of life, and to say that just because the baby is in utero, just because the baby is seemingly out of sight, although even that has changed with ultrasound and sonograms. Now we can see. My wife and I have four children. We saw our children before birth moving, doing somersaults. That is a common occurrence now. So anyone who clings to the dark ages myth that somehow an unborn child is not a human being really needs to update their sources and undergo a reality check.  Let me also focus for a moment on some other abortion methods, which are also acts of violence against children. These are used in the District of Columbia because they are used elsewhere in the later term. Consider the abomination called salting out, injecting high concentrated salt solutions or other poisons into later term babies so as to procure their death, a very silent but painful death, I would add, it usually takes about two hours.  I say to my friends on the other side of the issue, once that salt is pumped into the amniotic fluid and the baby breathes it in, because babies do breathe in the amniotic fluid to develop the organs of respiration, that salt has a corrosive effect and chemically poisons and ultimately kills the infant. The salt solution goes to the brain and other parts of the body, stops the heart and badly burns the skin of the baby.  Without the Taylor amendment, without what the distinguished chairman has done in his committee, we will subsidize these violent acts against children. Abortion on demand would be subsidized by the public, by the taxpayers, by monies over which this Congress has a right and, I would argue, a duty to manifest a concern about.  If we have an opportunity to stand up and save just one child, it is worth it. No one should so callously mistreat and murder kids.  When you realize that abortion methods are routinely employed that destroy and maim yet are sanitized by the men and women in white coats, good people on the other side of this issue who I think will get it some day. Some day they are going to wake up and say, my God, what kind of Holocaust have we participated in. Why did we fail to see? Nationwide the body count is over 36 million and counting.  When you subsidize abortion, the predictable consequence is that more children do end up dying. The United States and other countries that are part of the abortion culture are missing kids. They are the lost generation--kids who will never play soccer or baseball or even take a first step. When this prohibition on funding went into effect, we went from over 3000 subsidized abortions per year in the district down to 1. This amendment has been in effect almost continuously since the early 1980s--thanks to Bob Dornan and now, Mr. Taylor--and it has saved children's lives.  I just strongly urge a no vote on the Norton amendment. It is a pro-abortion anti-life amendment. It will subsidize the slaughter of unborn children.
