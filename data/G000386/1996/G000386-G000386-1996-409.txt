  These tables contain the data that point to dramatic decreases in our force structure since the late 1980's.  Those tables tell the tale:  They tell me that there should be dramatic cuts in infrastructure costs.  But the savings are nowhere in sight.  Once again, the Pentagon is proving that it is incapable of allocating money in sensible ways.  Once again, the Pentagon is proving that it is incapable of saving money--even with such a golden opportunity.  Mr. President, it makes me sad to say this.  The Pentagon bureaucrats are just frittering away the money on stupid projects.  The benefits of the painful base closure process are being wasted.  If Pentagon bureaucrats have their way, the goals of base closure effort will never be reached.  The GAO has presented 13 different options for cutting defense infrastructure costs.  The GAO says these options would save about $12.0 billion between fiscal years 1997-2001.  Mr. President, I hope the defense committees will examine the GAO options.  I hope the defense committees will consider using those options to recoup some lost savings.  I hope they will do that, rather than ask for more money in this year's defense budget.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
