 President, I rise to speak to my colleagues about our trade policy with Mexico and a very specific dispute we have with them, a dispute that affects agriculture, definitely, and, within agriculture, the production of corn.  Few trade policy developments in recent years have been more significant for the United States than our flourishing economic partnership with Mexico, a partnership that results from trade agreements that have been worked out and are working very well for both countries.
