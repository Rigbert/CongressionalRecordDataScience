Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Matsui) for yielding me this time, a gentleman who has been one of the great leaders on this issue on our side of the aisle.  Mr. Speaker, I rise as someone who supported NAFTA, who supported GATT, who has voted for fast track, and who was one of the 42 Democrats ready to vote for fast track, which was not brought to the floor just about a year ago.  I rise as someone who is going to vote ``no.'' I rise lamenting the fact that this issue has been so politicized, an issue that the chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means rightfully said is critical to this country.  There has been no bipartisan discussion on fast track this year as there was last. I rise in opposition to this being brought to the floor because I think it hurts this effort; it does not help it. The gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay), the majority whip, came to the floor and intimated that Bill Clinton, the President of the United States, had withdrawn his support. President Clinton has shown more courage on trade than any president under whom I have served or with whom I have served.  This issue should not go forward now. Why? Because it is critical that we pass fast track. And I am going to support it next year. I will tell my friends, I am voting ``no'' now, and next year I will be asking a lot of ``noes'' to vote ``yes.'' I think that may get us to a majority. I am not sure, because my colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle have put this in the context of putting at risk this issue 5 weeks before an election for political purposes solely. That is the only reason this bill is on this floor right now.  The chairman said we ought to resist the seductiveness of protectionism. I agree with that. Let me repeat. The chairman said it is a shame that we do not resist the seductiveness of protectionism. I agree with that. Let me also say it is a shame that we have not resisted the seductiveness of political advantage in bringing this bill to this floor this day.  There is no one on this floor who believes this bill is going to pass today. Not one. Not on the Republican side and not on our side. And even if it did, there is no one on this floor that believes that it could get through the United States Senate. So the only thing that the Republicans are doing is perhaps making it more difficult for us in February or March of next year, in a bipartisan way, coming together on behalf of America, not on behalf of Republicans or Democrats but on behalf of a more competitive, economically vibrant America, to pass this legislation to empower our President to negotiate.  Mr. Speaker, I hope others will join me in voting ``no'' today and ``yes'' next year when we have an opportunity to pass this legislation.                              {time}  1645
