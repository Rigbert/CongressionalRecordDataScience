 I listened carefully to all her words. I just would point out what a wise observation she made about the 60-day blackout period. This bill seeks to make people go register with the Federal Government and raise hard dollars in order to have the right to say anything about any of us within 60 days of an election--unless you own a newspaper. If you own a newspaper, you are exempt from everything.  This bill, I say to my friend from Texas, sort of singles out various groups for preferential treatment. If you are a big corporation that owns a newspaper, you have no restraints. If you are a big corporation that doesn't own a newspaper, you have a bunch of restraints. So the effort here is to give some people more first amendment rights than others. That is among the things, in my judgment, that make this bill constitutionally flawed.  I congratulate the Senator from Texas for her comments and observations.
