President, I rise to engage Senators Specter and Harkin in a colloquy regarding funding for the Leveraging Educational Assistance Partnership (LEAP) program.  First, I want to commend Senators Specter and Harkin for numerous education funding increases in the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations bill. There are tough budget pressures facing Senators Specter and Harkin, and they have done tremendous work on this bill. In particular, I am pleased that they have increased funding for the Leveraging Educational Assistance Partnership (LEAP) program to $70 million.  LEAP, a federal-state partnership, is vital to our efforts to help needy students attend and graduate from college. In fact, without this important federal incentive, many states would never have established or maintained their need-based financial aid programs.  Over the past three years, I have worked with Senator Collins and others in the Senate to restore, revamp, and increase funding for LEAP. This year, the Senate Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations bill provides $70 million for LEAP. While this funding level is less than the bipartisan request that I submitted with 32 of my colleagues, it is a significant increase over current funding and the President's request. This would be the biggest boost for the program in some time, and, as such, I decided not to offer an amendment to further increase funding for LEAP.  However, I am concerned that during Conference with the House, which has once again zero-funded the program, LEAP will not remain at the Senate's $70 million funding level. This concern is also shared by the higher education community, which strongly supports the Senate's $70 million for LEAP. Would the Chairman yield for a question?
