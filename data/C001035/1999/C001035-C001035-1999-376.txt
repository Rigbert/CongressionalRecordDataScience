President, I recently discussed the continuity provisions which are included in the amendment before us. This is one of the rare areas of agreement on both sides of the aisle. We both agree that if someone is terminally ill, and if there is a change in health care providers, the terminally ill patient should be able to stay with that provider until the end of his or her life.  Our amendment clearly says that the care shall extend for the remainder of the individual's life for such care. There is, however, a technical mistake which could create some ambiguity in that provision.  I ask unanimous consent, since the yeas and nays have been ordered, that I send a modification to the desk to correct that technical amendment. I hope my colleagues will agree to that.
