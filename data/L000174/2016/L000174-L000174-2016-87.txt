President, I wish to join my colleague from Michigan, the ranking member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, Senator Stabenow, in a colloquy regarding the scope of the products that could be labeled under the GMO labeling legislation.  Does the Senator from Michigan believe that the definition of GMO included in this bill prohibits the labeling of highly refined products derived from GMO crops, including soybean oil made from GMO soybeans, high fructose corn syrup made from GMO corn, and sugar made from GMO sugar beets?
