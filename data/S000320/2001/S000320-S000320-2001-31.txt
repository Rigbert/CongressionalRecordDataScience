 As much as I respect the office of the President of the United States and particularly this President, the office of the President is not--and should not be--put in this position. In addition, it is unnecessary because the Constitution, as we all know, already gives the President the power to veto legislation.  I believe it is a slippery slope to pursue the concept that the President of the United States, or any other administration official, should determine whether acts of Congress are consistent with treaty obligations or other laws.  I put my faith in the Founding Fathers and their wisdom to separate judicial and executive functions. The Senator from Texas, my good friend, makes some interesting and novel arguments. I would hope that his enthusiasm for his interpretation of NAFTA would not overwhelm our collective support for the constitutional separation of the executive and judicial branches of Government.  The Senator from Texas has argued on several occasions that the Murray-Shelby provision contains what he alleges are four violations of NAFTA. While I believe that we should allow the processes set forth in the NAFTA agreement that I quoted from to determine that, let me assure the Senator from Texas that if his amendment is adopted there is without question one violation of NAFTA--because his amendment clearly creates a new dispute resolution process within the office of the President that appears to be inconsistent--totally inconsistent--with NAFTA itself.  Mr. President, we have talked about this issue. I think we know what is going on. At this point, I move to table the Gramm amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.
