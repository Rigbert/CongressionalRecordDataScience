 President, I ask unanimous consent that, when the Senate completes its business today, it stand in adjournment until the hour of9 a.m. on Thursday, September 26; further, that immediately following the prayer, the Journal of proceedings be deemed approved to date, no resolutions come over under the rule, the call of the calendar be dispensed with, the morning hour be deemed to have expired, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and I further ask the Senate immediately begin the veto message to accompany H.R. 1833, the partial-birth abortion bill.
