Speaker, it is my distinct honor to congratulate the Croatian Sons Lodge No. 170 of the Croatian Fraternal Union on the festive occasion of its 87th anniversary and 50-year-member banquet.  This year, the Croatian Fraternal Union will hold this gala event at the beautifully renovated Croatian Center in Merrillville, IN. Traditionally, the anniversary ceremony includes a recognition of those members who have achieved 50 years of membership. Honorees who have pledged their allegiance include: Vincent Brebrich, Bessie Briski, Marko Buncich, Edward Carija, John William Carr, Vera Depa, Julia Farrenkopf, Rose Marie Franz, Helen Griffin, Peter Hecimovich, Mildred Kennedy, Helen Lucas, John Meznarick, Lubi Paligraf, Steve Paulich, Violet Plummer, Delores Roppolo, John Simunic, Frank Sostaric, Ann Stankovic, Marie Vucich, Anna Wilson, and Peter Yukich.  These loyal and dedicated individuals share this prestigious honor with a total of 256 additional lodge members who have attained this status.  This memorable day begins with Mass at St. Joseph the Worker Catholic Church in Gary, IN, officiated by the Reverend Father Benedict Benakovich. Croatian Fraternal Union national president, Bernard Luketich, will be this year's distinguished guest speaker. Festivities will be enriched by the music of the Croatian Glee Club, ``Preradovic,'' directed by Brother Dennis Barunica and by the Hoosier Hrvati Adult Tamburitza Orchestra, directed by Ed Sindicih. In addition, the Croatian Junior Tamburitzans will perform under the direction of Dennis Barunica.  I am proud to commend lodge president, Elizabeth Morgavan, as well as every member of the Croatian Fraternal Union Lodge No. 170, for their loyalty and radiant display of passion for their ethnicity. It is my hope that this year will bring renewed hope and prosperity for all members of the Croatian community and their families.                          ____________________
