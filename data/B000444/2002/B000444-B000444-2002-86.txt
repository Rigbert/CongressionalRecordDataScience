 President, today I am introducing a bill to add outpatient prescription drug coverage as a new and integral benefit under Part B of Medicare. Under this bill, like the rest of the services under Part B, Medicare will pick up 80 percent of the cost of prescription drugs. This would be the case until a beneficiary hits a $4000 annual out-of-pocket limit, at which point the government picks up 100 percent of drug costs. Moreover, beneficiaries will not have to pay increased monthly premiums or annual deductibles as a result of this new drug benefit.  Now, we have been discussing prescription drug coverage for seniors in this chamber for many years, and there have been numerous proposals brought forward. Some might ask, why do you feel the need to propose your own prescription drug plan; what is wrong with the many previous proposals.  Well, to my way of thinking, we have lost our focus on this issue. In developing a drug plan, we have concentrated too much on such things as budget allotments, philosophy of government, desires of committee chairs, election politics, and other related issues, while ignoring the one thing that really counts: what do the citizens of this country, the ones who are supposed to use this plan, really want? All of these prescription drug plans will be voluntary, and yet unless a plan is attractive enough to ensure the participation of close to 100 percent of those eligible, it probably won't work from an economic point of view. Those of us who were around in 1988 for the debates about catastrophic health care remember with great clarity the consequences of passing a health-related bill that the citizens don't want.  Frankly, I have some doubts about whether any of the prescription drug proposals to date provide what the citizens in Delaware or elsewhere really want. And I think I have a pretty good idea of what people want in a prescription drug plan, at least people in my home state of Delaware. I live in Delaware, and I commute back and forth on AMTRAK every day between Delaware and Washington DC. I have been a Senator for 30 years and people in Delaware know me well. They have no reluctance about walking up to me at the local diner, on the train, or at the drugstore, to give me a piece of theirminds. And here is what Delawareans want in a prescription drug bill.  They want something simple and easily understandable. They don't want a plan with a lot of fine print, exclusions, complicated payment formulas, gaps in coverage, lengthy paragraphs filled with whereases and wherefores. They don't want to be in a state of constant anxiety because they really don't know what they have signed up for and what they are covered for. They don't want to have to spend hours on the phone listening to music while waiting for an insurance company clerk to answer the phone and try to explain what the benefits are. They don't want to spend a whole day filling out paperwork to try to get reimbursed for their expenses when they could just as well be playing with their grandchildren. They don't want to be caught in the middle of a fight between their drug insurance plan and their Medicare over who is going to pay for what.  They want a plan that provides meaningful and substantial financial help towards the cost of their medications. For most people I talk to, a cut in prescription drug costs from $5000 per year down to $4700 per year is not very helpful; they are still faced with choosing between paying for medications and paying for rent. With the increasing costs of prescription drugs these days, this is a criterion that is just as important to the middle class as it is to those with low incomes.  They want a plan that is stable, reliable, and predictable. They don't want to sign up with an insurance company and then have the company pull out of the state the following year. They don't want the specifics of their benefits to be changing every year. They want to know what they are getting.  They want a guarantee that a plan will be available to them. They don't want a guarantee that a plan will be available only if an insurance company decides it will offer a plan or if an insurance company decides they are a good risk.  They want a plan that is uniform, not one whose benefits change drastically if they happen to move a few miles. Delaware is a small state, and people who live or work in Delaware move back and forth across state lines with great frequency.  My prescription drug bill is focused on what consumers want, and it fulfills all of these requirements. People are already very familiar with Medicare Part B, so the addition of a prescription drug benefit will not add any confusion. People know that Medicare is stable, reliable, predictable, and the same all over the country. People know that Medicare Part B covers a substantial 80 percent of their medical expense. We know that people like Medicare Part B, since 94 percent of those eligible have voluntarily signed up for it. The addition of a new prescription drug benefit to Part B, without any change in monthly premiums or deductibles, is almost certain to increase the voluntary participation rate close to 100 percent.  Can we afford such a bill? Absolutely. It's just a matter of priorities and choices. And these choices simply reflect our values. My values tell me that providing life-saving prescription drugs to the seniors and disabled is a higher priority than, say, making permanent a tax cut for the well-to-do that they probably don't need and have not really requested.  Many of my colleagues in the Senate, and a large number of their staff, have been working enormously hard to develop a Medicare prescription drug bill that satisfies everybody's concerns. However, I am reminded of the statement by the noted British engineer Sir Alec Issigonis, who commented that ``A camel is a horse designed by committee''. If the public is expecting a horse, we better not end up with a camel.  Our current situation here in Congress brings to mind a story related by a local TV weatherman here in Washington, DC. This weatherman works in a very high tech underground office with fancy color radars, computers, split-second communications devices, and state of the art graphics. Yet before each broadcast, the weatherman goes upstairs and looks out the window to make sure it is not raining. I would ask my colleagues, as they work through their cost estimates, economic projections, and so forth in developing a prescription drug plan, to walk upstairs and look out the window. Policy makers must not work in protective isolation, in a vacuum; they need a strong dose of reality to inform their deliberations.  I believe that my bill provides the kind of prescription drug plan that Medicare beneficiaries in Delaware, and around the country, really want. I encourage my colleagues to keep the wants of their constituents foremost as they move to craft a vitally-needed prescription drug bill for Medicare beneficiaries.                                 ______                                       By
