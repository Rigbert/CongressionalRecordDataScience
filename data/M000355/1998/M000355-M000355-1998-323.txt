 President, we have been on the tobacco bill now for four weeks. What is abundantly clear to this Senator is that the best favor we can do for the American people and, in particular, for Kentuckians who are tobacco producers is to defeat this bill. President Clinton and the majority of the Democrats have been pushing this bill for some time, going back to the 1996 campaign. A typical American family today already pays 38.2 percent of its total income in taxes at all levels of government. This tobacco tax bill before us will increase taxes by more than $600 billion, some argue even up to $800 billion over the life of the bill, and 60 percent of that tax will fall on working people who make less than $30,000 a year.  Let me repeat: 60 percent of the taxes that we are raising will fall on Americans making $30,000 per year. Mr. President, more than anything else, what the tobacco bill is about is tax and spend.  The original cause is a noble cause around which I guess virtually all of the Senate is unified, and that is the question of confronting the problem of teenagers and smoking. We know, of course, that only 2 percent of smokers are teenagers. We wish they would not engage in this habit, and we ought to do everything we can to deter that behavior. But this bill, this $600 billion or $700 billion or $800 billion bill, this tax increase targeted at people in America making $30,000 or less is about big government and big spending and big taxes.  A good starting place would be to defeat this bill, which is not in the best interest of the American people and certainly not in the best interest of the people of Kentucky for whom this is a particularly sensitive issue. The biggest beneficiaries of the bill before us, in addition to the Government and literally legions of new agencies, are a number of lawyers who are going to make a substantial amount of money even with the Gorton amendment yesterday.  So a good starting place in discussing this issue is what ought to be done with the overall bill, and it has been the view of this Senator from Kentucky that the appropriate fate for this bill is defeat, the sooner the better.  Should the bill not be defeated, it creates a catastrophe for the Commonwealth of Kentucky. We have over 60,000 farm families who derive some or all of their income from the annual growing of a legal crop.  They are engaged in an honorable activity. They are raising their families, educating their children, obeying the law. And here comes the Federal Government with an effort to destroy this legal industry. And make no mistake about it, this bill is designed to bring the tobacco industry to its knees. And that goal and design is pretty clear, with the amendments that have been passed so far, including providing no immunity from lawsuits whatsoever for the tobacco companies, which, as we all know, was part of the original settlement agreed to last summer--no immunity is going to be provided in this bill for any kind of lawsuit of any sort.  We doubled the so-called look-back provision--clearly, in this Senator's view, an unconstitutional attempt to make the company responsible for anyone who chooses to use its product. I do not know any reputable lawyer, Mr. President, either in or out of the Senate, who thinks that provision is constitutional. And, of course, there are advertising restrictions in this bill. Nobody that I know thinks those can be imposed by the Government either.  The industry pulled out of this a long time ago--several months ago--when they saw what form it was taking. So make no mistake about it, Mr. President, this bill before the Senate, in its current form, is designed to destroy the tobacco industry.  Now, the victims of that are the 60,000 farm families in Kentucky who raise this legal crop every year. And in the wake of this effort to destroy this industry, it has produced a significant debate in our State about what to do.  Now, if El Nino hits, the Federal Government steps in and helps the victims. In this particular instance, the Federal Government itself is causing the disaster. And it seemed to this Senator appropriate, if the Government were going to create this disaster, then the government ought to provide a lifeline or assistance or help to those victims of this Government-made disaster.  And after a good deal of thought over many months, Mr. President, I concluded that if the Government were going to try to destroy this industry, the appropriate response was for the Government to provide assistance to the farm families who grow this legal commodity, and to do it as generously as possible over the shortest period of time.  So it was my conclusion, Mr. President, that the Senator from Indiana--certainly no friend of tobacco, as he himself would readily admit--was prepared to engage in what I thought was a generous act in the context of this impending disaster.  Where I differ with the Senator from Indiana is, I think the tobacco program has served us well. It has served us very well in Kentucky. It has allowed us to hold on to smaller farms a lot longer than we would otherwise have been able to hold on to them, even though, Mr. President, I must confess, in all candor, there has been consolidation even with the program.  When I came to the Senate in January of 1985, the average tobacco grower in Kentucky had about an acre--roughly 2,500 pounds, which is about an acre. Today, the average tobacco grower in Kentucky has 4.5 acres. So you can see that even with the program, consolidation is occurring. Without the program, unquestionably, consolidation would occur very rapidly. And the tragedy of the loss of the program is that the income, which has been divided up among an awful lot of medium- and low-income people, would in all likelihood consolidate into large farms. And I do not applaud that. I would rather keep the tobacco program. And we can keep the tobacco program if we can beat this bill.  So, Mr. President, let me say, the first order for this Senator is to defeat this bill. I have done nothing to promote this bill at any point along the way. I opposed it in 1997, 1998, 2 months ago, last month, a week ago, yesterday, and today. This is a terrible bill for America and a particularly bad bill for Kentucky.  But if it is to become law, the question you have to ask is, What is the best approach for the victims of this law, the tobacco growers of Kentucky? It is my view, in that context, that the Senator from Indiana has it right, that if the Government is trying to destroy this industry, the best thing the Government can do is to provide a generous transition payment to these growers on the way to the free market--not my first choice, but my choice in the context of the bill that President Clinton and the vast majority of Democrats in this body want to see become law.  Mr. President, there are two competing proposals. One proposal, sponsored by my colleague from Kentucky, seeks to hold on to the tobacco program for the next 25 years. If it were not for this bill, we would have a chance of holding on to the tobacco program without any legislation, because this bill is what creates the problem, not that instantly tobacco becomes less controversial. But any time this kind of bill is seriously contemplated in Congress, it seems to me the only solution to that is to provide as generous a compensation as possible for our growers over the shortest period of time, because the program is going to end in the context of this kind of Government pile-on designed to destroy the industry.  So, Mr. President, I stated my case as best I could and, if I may say so, I think pretty well, in a recent op-ed in the Lexington Herald-Leader at home, which I ask unanimous consent to be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                  We Don't Have 25 Years for LEAF Act                          (By Mitch McConnell)       One of President Bill Clinton's signature political      maneuvers occurred early in his administration when he and      Vice President Al Gore declared war on tobacco--portraying      Kentucky's leading agricultural commodity as a modern-day      plague. The anti-tobacco zealots and an army of greedy      plaintiffs' lawyers eager to prey on the tobacco industry      created the most serious threat ever arrayed against tobacco      farmers.       Disaster has loomed for Kentucky's tobacco farmers since      Clinton took office and is now manifested in the form of the      $850 billion McCain bill which sailed out of the Senate      Commerce Committee 19-1, with Sen. Wendell Ford's support.      Thus was the death knell sounded for tobacco.       Liberal Democrats in Congress have eagerly piled on, vowing      to slay the tobacco industry generally and the farmers'      price-support program in particular. Senator Dick Durbin (D-     IL) venomously wails that tobacco is the only government-     supported crop ``with a body count,'' and lambasts the      tobacco program as ``. . . subsidizing the growth,      production, and processing of a product which kills hundreds      of thousands . . . .''       Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-MA), the most influential Democrat in      the Senate, decries tobacco with characteristic hyperbole,      charging the industry with ``the insidious and shameful      poisoning of generations of children.'' Durbin and Kennedy      sentiment, shared by nearly all their liberal Democrat      colleagues, does not auger for any easing up in the war      against tobacco. Quite the contrary.       Kentucky's farmers are in this anti-tobacco squad's      crosshairs. Senator Ford and I, as always, are unified in our      goal of fighting for Kentucky farmers. Regrettably, we      disagree over the best means for achieving this protection      and security.       Kentucky farmers stand at a critical crossroads, presented      with two alternatives for survival. Senate Agriculture      Committee Chairman Richard Lugar (R-IN) offers farmers a      three-year phase-out of the tobacco program that would      provide the average quota owner with meaningful annual      transition payments of $26,500 and the freedom to continue to      grow tobacco in a free market, forever.       The LEAF Act, proposed by retiring Senator Ford, offers      farmers two very different paths: a buyout path or a gamble      that the program could continue for another quarter-century.      If the average quota owner chooses to go down the Ford buyout      path, he would receive a 10-year buyout with annual payments      of only $8,000--with the added proviso that he would be      barred from growing tobacco for the next 25 years! With such      an unpalatable buy-out option, farmers would likely buy into      the LEAF Act's contention that the tobacco program could be      preserved until the year 2023--even though the government is      currently phasing out other agriculture commodity programs      like corn, wheat and soybeans.       After extensive consideration and consultation with      Kentucky growers, I firmly believe that the Lugar plan is the      wiser course because the LEAF Act is ultimately      unsustainable--a nice idea, but an unwarranted gamble in what      promises to be an increasingly hostile anti-tobacco      environment. In short, the Lugar plan is the best option in a      bad situation, the optimal approach to ensure that our      farming families and their communities are not grievously      wounded in the escalating anti-tobacco war being led by      Commander-in-Chief Bill Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and      their eager lieutenants in the liberal Democratic      congressional caucus.       This unprecedented assault on tobacco--a legal product--has      permanently altered the political landscape to the extreme      detriment of tobacco farmers. As difficult as it is to      understand in Kentucky, where tobacco is a way-of-life, the      liberals in Washington most closely associate tobacco with a      cause of death.       Nevertheless, Senator Ford and I, joined by precious few      colleagues, have for years been fighting a rear-guard action      in defense of tobacco farmers, staving off the anti-tobacco      zealots with every parliamentary maneuver we could muster.      But Clinton gave the green light to punish the tobacco      industry into extinction; and virtually every governmental      and private-sector force--outside of Kentucky and North      Carolina--has followed suit.       On the home front, politicians like Scotty Baesler and farm      bureaucrats like the Burley Co-op's Rod Kuegel and Danny      McKinney are exploiting the tobacco growers' terrible plight      with shrill rhetoric, unproductive attacks and politics as      usual. Contrary to these attacks, I firmly believe Kentucky      farmers understand the political and economic ramifications      of the highly-charged anti-tobacco environment. A Herald-     Leader poll found that 70 percent of Kentucky farmers who      expressed an opinion said that the program would be gone in      less than five years. Similarly, the Tobacco Fairness      Coalition has reported that 63 percent of growers in Kentucky      and Tennessee favor Senator Lugar's front-loaded phase-out of      the tobacco program that pays farmers $8 a pound.       The LEAF Act has been criticized from all sides on a number      of different issues. Even Sen. Ford's long-time Democratic      friends in the Senate have expressed serious doubt about the      viability of his plan. Sen. Bob Kerrey (D-NE) recently stated      that he is ``troubled by'' the cost of Senator Ford's plan      and declared on the Senate floor: ``I have a very difficult      time voting for something that has $28 billion for tobacco      farmers . . . .''       Moreover, I am terribly troubled by the fact that LEAF      discriminates against Kentucky farmers, inexplicably treating      them worse than North Carolina farmers. For example, if a      Kentucky farmer takes the LEAF     buyout, he is forbidden from growing tobacco for the next 25      years. Since the average age of a Kentucky tobacco farmer is      60, the LEAF buyout is effectively a lifetime ban. On the      other hand, a North Carolina quota owner receives a      guaranteed buyout under LEAF and is still allowed to continue      growing tobacco. This is simply not fair.       Thoughtful newspapers in the heart of tobacco country have      surveyed the tobacco landscape and concluded that the tobacco      program is mortally wounded. In the words of the Paducah Sun:      ``[The] ultimate fate [of the tobacco program] seems sealed.      How can [the] program survive indefinitely when the      administration, Congress, health groups and public opinion      are arrayed so solidly against smoking?''       Or as the Daily News in Bowling Green concluded: ``Hating      tobacco is popular. This national mood spells an end--and      soon--to federal programs seen as supportive of the `evil      weed.' McConnell has stated the facts. They are hard. But      they are the facts.'' The Courier-Journal also acknowledged      that my decision to support the Lugar plan was ``a reasonable      and defensible course.''       As much as I would like to promise farmers 25 more years of      a federal tobacco program, I cannot in good conscience be      complicitous in handing out such a false promise to the      thousands of Kentucky families whose lives would thereafter      hang in the balance and twist in hostile political winds. The      combined forces of Clinton, Gore, opportunistic Democrats in      Congress and the nation's liberal media, have made tobacco      public enemy No. 1. In sum, I simply refuse to sell farmers      on the dreamy illusion of a new 25-year tobacco program.       Contrary to the caricature of my position by the      politically-motivated and woefully ill-informed former      Democrat State Sen. John Berry and his poet brother, my      ``sole prerogative'' is to provide certainty and protection      to Kentucky's farming families. We should allow our farmers      and communities to take the cash-in-hand and not force them      into a high-stakes crapshoot. In the words of the Owensboro      Messenger-Inquirer: ``This may be the last chance farmers      have before it all goes up in smoke.'' Nostalgia for the past      may be good for poets, but not for policymakers.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, as you can imagine, this is a much discussed issue in Kentucky. Some people think the LEAF Act is the way to go; some people think the Lugar proposal is the way to go. Interestingly enough, a number of newspapers, having surveyed the landscape and having looked at the issue, have concluded that the Senator from Indiana--not, again, thought of as any friend of tobacco--and the Senator from Kentucky, who has spent most of his career fighting, along with the senior Senator from Kentucky, for tobacco, have it right, that in the context of this kind of bill, the only rational response is to try to provide as much compensation as possible.  In fact, the Owensboro Messenger-Inquirer, the daily paper in Owensboro--one of our major cities and one of our major papers--had an editorial on May 24, the headline of which was, ``McConnell may have right idea, Lugar's plan could ultimately benefit tobacco farmers more than Ford's.''  Now, reasonable people can differ about what is the appropriate thing to do in the face of impending disaster. You can go down with the ship or you can go for the lifeboats. And what the Senator from Indiana is doing here is offering a lifeboat; and, interestingly enough, after you get in the lifeboat, you are still free to row.  In other words, under the Lugar proposal, when you go on to the free market, it is indeed free; people are still entitled to grow tobacco, a legal product, if they want to. Under the competing proposal, the LEAF proposal, there is a so-called voluntary buyout, but, candidly, it is not very attractive. If you take the voluntary buyout, it takes you 10 years to get your money. In the first year, the $8 presumably would still be worth $8; in the tenth year, the ag economist on the Senate Agriculture Committee, of which I am a member, says it is worth about $5.13. So your money erodes over a 10-year period.  In addition to that, if you accept the voluntary buyout, you cannot grow tobacco. Even though you are in a free market, the Government tells you, you cannot grow tobacco. And, even more mysterious, under the same LEAF proposal, there is a mandatory buyout for flue-cured tobacco--that kind of tobacco grown in the Carolinas and Virginia--a mandatory buyout. But after it is over, you are free to grow tobacco.  So I think, clearly, the purpose of the LEAF Act was to discourage any exit from the tobacco business. The buyout is not attractive, and it is designed to sort of hitch you up to a declining market created by a Government pile-on.  So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the editorial in the Owensboro Messenger-Inquirer be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:              [From the Messenger-Inquirer, May 24, 1998]                     McConnell May Have Right Idea lugar's plan could ultimately benefit tobacco farmers more than Ford's       Tobacco farmers may be upset with U.S. Sen. Mitch      McConnell, but ultimately he may be doing them more good than      harm.       McConnell did the once unthinkable last week--he sided with      Indiana Sen. Richard Lugar on a plan to end the federal      tobacco price support system.       McConnell said when he first came to the Senate in 1985,      there were seven tobacco-related votes. ``Tobacco was a      sleepy, regional issue to which most members of Congress did      not pay much attention,'' McConnell said.       The politics of tobacco have changed. In the current      Congress there have been 29 tobacco-related votes, McConnell      said, including one last summer in which crop insurance for      tobacco farmers barely passed.       McConnell cited a statewide poll that found 70 percent of      the respondents thought the tobacco support program would be      dead in less than five years.       Siding with Lugar is in direct opposition with Kentucky's      senior senator Wendell Ford of Owensboro. Ford's plan would      continue price supports, offer $8 per pound to cover farmers'      losses and would provide $28.5 billion over 25 years to      assist tobacco farmers and communities who suffer because of      decline in tobacco demand and jobs.       Ford is doing what he is supposed to do--taking care of the      concerns of his constituents. In a different way McConnell is      doing the same, although tobacco farmers may not yet see it.       Just a few years ago, Ford's plan would have been better      for Kentucky tobacco farmers. But tobacco is in trouble, and      with Ford leaving Washington at the end of this year, there      will be one less experienced voice in favor of the support      program.       McConnell recognizes this and is trying to bridge the gap      between the two sides on price supports.       McConnell is not simply cozying up to Lugar's initial plan,      which we still believe was overly punitive. Lugar's initial      plan was to pay those who hold quotas to grow tobacco $8 per      pound to get out of the business. Those who wanted to      continue to grow would do so under free market conditions,      but Lugar proposed transitional payments over three years to      wean farmers off the program.       At McConnell's request, the Lugar plan now allows farmers      to continue growing tobacco during the phase-out program. And      sharecroppers and those who lease quotas to grow tobacco--     initially left out of Lugar's plan--would receive $4 per      pound during the buyout.       Also new at McConnell's urging was $1 billion over five      years for rural communities hit hard by the reduction in      tobacco revenue. That money would be invested in education      and retraining, and to assist warehouse owners and operators.       We share a legitimate conflict of opinion on this issue      with, we expect, many Kentuckians. The global economy has      turned to a free market on tobacco, and some would surely      claim it wrong for the American government to continue      artificially maintaining higher prices.       It would be easier to embrace that position if we lived in      Montana, Ohio or New Hampshire. But we live in Kentucky, a      farming state in which 25 percent of total farm income is      from tobacco sales. Any movement that would ultimately cut      prices more than in half for tobacco must be met with      concern.       But McConnell obviously feels that this may be the best      chance for tobacco farmers to recoup some lucrative prices.      It is conceivable tobacco opponents will simply end the price      support program in a few years without any sort of      transitional buyout.       This makes it imperative that both alternative crops and      new markets for tobacco be found for Kentucky farmers.      Biosource Technologies is working on exciting research using      tobacco in the development of pharmaceuticals.       McConnell is too savvy a politician to make this move      without a firm belief that the majority of his constituents      favor it. Tobacco is in trouble no matter what McConnell      supports. This may be the last chance farmers have before it      all goes up in smoke.  Mr. McCONNELL. And the Paducah Sun, Mr. President, in the far western part of our State, in taking a look at the situation, reached the conclusion that the Senator from Indiana and the junior Senator from Kentucky probably had it right, that in the context of this kind of bill, the rational response is to provide a generous buyout as rapidly as possible on to the free market.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the editorial in the Paducah Sun of May 23 of this year be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                  [From the Paducah Sun, May 23, 1998]                              Smoking Bomb                   Tobacco buy-out a reasonable idea       Mitch McConnell's tobacco bomb has exploded with stunning      force throughout the state he represents. Nearly in unison,      Democrats and farm groups have denounced his buyout proposal      in the strongest terms, and his fellow Kentucky Republicans      are keeping quiet. Conservatives from outside the tobacco      belt are criticizing the Kentuckian's plan as too generous.      So politically, the senator's idea looks like a loser. As a      matter of policy, it is worth a cooler appraisal.       Sen. McConnell has signed onto Indiana colleague Richard      Lugar's legislation to close out the federal tobacco support      program over three years by buying up the production quotas      at $8 a pound. Participation would be mandatory, but in the      end, farmers would be free to grow as much leaf as they      wished and sell it in an unregulated market.       The alternative by his Democratic counterpart, Sen. Wendell      Ford, would give farmers the option of selling their quotas,      also for $8 a pound, over 10 years, but those who take the      money would have to quit growing the crop. For others, the      price subsidies would remain in place.       Gov. Paul Patton, the three Democratic senatorial      candidates, the burley tobacco organization, and the Kentucky      Farm Bureau all embrace the Ford proposal. So does Republican      Rep. Jim Bunning, his party's likely nominee for the U.S.      Senate seat this year, which is a fair indication of the      political lay of the land in Kentucky.       The competing plans are substantially different, but have      at least one major goal in common. Both are designed to      cushion the impending blow for tobacco growers in a social      and political environment that is increasingly hostile to      cigarettes and smoking.       Which proposal is superior as national policy--or better      for the growers (which is not necessarily the same thing)--     depends largely on the future of the tobacco program.       The Lugar-McConnell plan is premised on the belief that the      tobacco subsidy is on its way out no matter what and the best      deal for farmers is a short-term cash buyout.       State Democrats are far more optimistic about the leaf      program. The accuse Sen. McConnell of premature surrender and      seem to resent particularly his break from a previously      united front among the Kentucky delegation.       We believe Sen. McConnell has reason on his side. Whether      the tobacco price support program lasts another three, five      or 10 years is not the main point. Its ultimate fate seems      sealed. How can the program survive indefinitely when the      administration, Congress, health groups and public opinion      are arrayed so solidly against smoking?       Even now, lawmakers mainly are arguing about how punitive      the federal legislation will be against the tobacco industry.      At last report, the U.S. Senate is prepared to impose a $1.10      per pack tax hike on cigarettes, which incensed Sen. Ted      Kennedy because it wasn't $1.50. The contradictory notion--     manufacturers bad, growers good--will not wear well forever.       Moreover, tobacco, of all commodities, hardly would be the      exception in the overall movement of agriculture away from      support programs and toward a market system. Price supports      for corn are not surviving; why should tobacco's?       In plain fact, the tobacco program was never defensible in      a government that is trying to discourage smoking by every      means. Ending it now at least would allow government to purge      itself of hypocrisy.       The prospect of handing $80,000 to the typical tobacco      farmer who cultivates four acres, as the Lugar-McConnell      proposal would do, does not strike us as victimizing him      excessively. The out-of-state conservative critics of that      bill's generosity may have a point. The payoff would be      $20,000 an acre, as compared to about $200 an acre for corn      growers.       The relative merits of Sen. McConnell's and Sen. Ford's      competing approaches are still up for debate, and much is yet      to be decided. We fail to see how the Republican's proposal      is so inimical to state or national interest as to justify      the furor it has created.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the State Journal in Frankfort, our State capital, on May 21 of 1998, essentially agreed, as well as did the Owensboro paper and the Paducah paper, that in this particular situation the buyout proposal offered by the chairman of the Agriculture Committee makes the most sense. I ask unanimous consent that the State Journal editorial be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 [From the State Journal, May 21, 1998]                             Mortal Wounds       U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell ignited a firestorm in Kentucky      this week when he threw his support to Indiana Sen. Richard      Lugar's legislation that would end federal price supports on      burley tobacco by 2002.       In doing so, McConnell deserted his fellow Kentuckian Sen.      Wendell Ford, who is trying desperately to salvage the      tobacco price support program as the Senate debates historic      legislation targeting the tobacco industry as a whole.       It goes without saying Ford is furious. Tobacco farmers are      irate. Agriculture groups are in a frenzy. And Democrats      running to replace Ford are on the political warpath.       McConnell says he made the decision to desert Ford's      legislation, which McConnell originally co-sponsored, because      he saw the handwriting on the wall. Tobacco is so universally      despised in Congress that there is no hope the price support      program can survive at a time when federal agriculture price      support programs are being jettisoned all over the place.       The tobacco price support program, McConnell says, is      ``mortally wounded.''       If everyone will calm down and think about it, they will      realize that McConnell is right. Tobacco in all its forms is      anathema in Congress and much of the nation outside a handful      of states where it is grown. The anti-tobacco sentiment has      reached a level of zealotry rarely if ever seen involving a      single issue.       Ford, McConnell and Kentucky's congressional delegation      have waged the good fight, but they are going to lose on the      issue of price supports. The issue now must be what they can      salvage to help farmers who rely on burley tobacco for their      incomes and the communities that rely on those farmers for      their prosperity.       The Lugar legislation would pay the owners of tobacco      quotas $8 a pound over three years. Tenants and those who      lease tobacco quotas would be paid $4 per pound over three      years. Tobacco states would receive $1 billion over five      years to aid affected communities and to pay for job      retraining and crop diversification programs.       Once the support program ends in 2002, farmers could      continue growing tobacco, but the price would be subject to a      free market.       In that free market, Kentucky burley undoubtedly would be      worth far less and, in time, most small growers would get out      of the business because it no longer would be profitable.       Whether the Lugar bill is fair compensation to burley      growers is open to debate. Certainly, it will take far more      than $1 billion to insulate communities and farmers from the      potentially devastating economic impact of tobacco's      disappearance as a major crop. But Kentuckians need to join      the debate, not insist blindly that something ``mortally      wounded'' can survive, especially when that something is      associated with tobacco.
