President, on September 20, I voted against an amendment offered by Senator Brown to cap economic assistance to Turkey, because I believe the United States should strongly support economic development in that country.  Turkey is a NATO member and a close ally of the United States. Turkey has been instrumental in enabling the humanitarian program in Northern Iraq to proceed. Turkey is also struggling to become more closely tied to the European economic community, and to reform its constitution to strengthen democracy. I believe we should support that.  I also believe, however, that we have a responsibility to speak out about the mistreatment of the Kurdish minority in Turkey, which is primarily located in several southeastern provinces.  The undeniable fact is that the Kurds are second-class citizens in Turkey, where they are discriminated against in law and practice. In the southeast, where the PKK are waging a terrorist campaign against the Turkish Government, virtually any Kurd is branded with the ``terrorist'' label and considered by the Turkish military to be the enemy.  Thousands of Kurds, including innocent civilians, have been caught up in this struggle, and there are persistent reports of the excessive use of force by Turkish soldiers. There is also no denying that the PKK has used abominable tactics, resulting in many innocent deaths.  But according to a report requested by the Appropriations Committee last year and released by the State Department several months ago, and other reports by Turkish and international human rights organizations, United States military equipment, particularly fighter aircraft and helicopters, have been routinely used to strafe and destroy Kurdish villages.  The villages are targets because the Turkish Army regards them as havens for the PKK, which in some instances they may be. But the attacks have been indiscriminate, resulting in many civilian casualties. There has been a pattern of human rights violations against the Kurdish people, who have been dehumanized by Turkish society.  It recently came to my attention that the Turkish Government does not permit the International Committee of the Red Cross into Turkey. Frankly, it is inconceivable to me that a democracy, an important member of NATO, and a country that seeks closer ties to Europe, would deny the ICRC access when there is clearly a need for it. Any armed conflict involves abuses of human rights against civilians, and in Turkey the evidence of such abuses by both sides is overwhelming. In addition, the State Department has reported on the mistreatment and torture of prisoners in Turkish jails for many years.  The ICRC operates confidentially. It does not seek to embarrass governments. It does not discuss its findings with the press, or with the Congress, or anyone else. Its goal is to monitor human rights and provide objective advice to whoever is deemed to be violating them on how to improve respect for human rights.  I am told by administration officials that they have raised this issue with Turkish officials in the past, to no avail. That is discouraging, and it is for that reason that my amendment calls on the President of the United States to raise this himself with the Turkish Prime Minister. I believe this issue is that important. I also believe that Turkey's willingness to do this would be an important sign of its commitment to improve human rights.  It is for this reason that yesterday I offered an amendment, which was adopted, which aims to encourage the Turkish Government to permit unimpeded access to the ICRC, especially in the southeast where its presence is so urgently needed. I think this is the least that a civilized, democratic country should do.  I hope the administration understands the importance of this amendment, and will give it the urgency and serious attention that it deserves.  I also joined Senator Pell in an amendment, which was also adopted, which provides $5 million for nongovernmental organizations to carry out humanitarian and other activities on behalf of Kurds in southeastern Turkey. I think this is very important. It is consistent with United States policy of promoting economic development, cultural and ethnic tolerance, and human rights, and it makes clear that we want to see a portion of our assistance to Turkey used to directly further these goals. I trust the administration will make every effort to encourage the Turkish Government to permit the use of these funds as intended.                          ____________________
