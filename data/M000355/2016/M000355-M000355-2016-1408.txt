 President, it is clear that many Americans are concerned about the administration's ability to properly vet thousands of individuals from Syria and Iraq. Elected officials in both parties have expressed concern, too, as have administration officials. That is why many Americans are asking us to take a step back and press pause on the program so we can ensure that we have the correct policies and security screenings actually in place. The Senate will consider balanced, bipartisan legislation tomorrow to do just that.  Passing the American SAFE Act, which the House has already done with a bipartisan veto-proof margin, would show Americans that their concerns are being heard here in Washington. The aim is to ensure that we have facts first so we can help advance America's tradition of compassion and address the legitimate concerns of her citizens at the same time.  I will have more to say on this legislation tomorrow, but I urge colleagues across the aisle to treat this issue with the seriousness it deserves. This debate should be driven by facts and common sense and not fear mongering about targeting widows and orphans or other straw man arguments the White House has made from time to time. Americans deserve a vetting process they can have confidence in, and frankly the refugees coming to this country deserve one too. Safeguards that weed out ISIL sympathizers can help ensure legitimate refugees to our country are not unfairly stigmatized.  The American people are concerned and looking to us to lead with both safety and compassion. I am calling on colleagues to help us do so tomorrow by advancing this balanced and bipartisan legislation.                          ____________________
