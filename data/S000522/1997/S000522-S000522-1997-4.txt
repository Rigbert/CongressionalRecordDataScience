Mr. Speaker, this authority was necessary for longtime reeducation camp victims who had been persecuted in Vietnam for their pro-U.S. associations to bring their unmarried children with them to the United States if these children have reached the age of 21 during their incarceration or the long wait for an exit visa from the Communist authorities. A member of these former prisoners of conscience have refused to leave Vietnam unless they can bring their children with them. These families are trapped in Vietnam until the provision is reauthorized.  I would just like to point out to the Members that extension of this authority has been endorsed by the administration, on the other side of the building Senators McCain, Abraham, and Kennedy, and it has the bipartisan support of the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Hyde], the gentleman from New York [Mr. Gilman], and the gentleman from California [Mr. Berman], and I appreciate their cosponsorship of this legislation, and Mr. Berman and Mr. Davis, as a matter of fact, are additional cosponsors as well.
