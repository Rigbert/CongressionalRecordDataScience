Speaker, next month the College of Southern Maryland in my district will bid farewell to Dr. Bradley Gottfried, who will step down as its president. Dr. Gottfried has led the College for the past eleven years with great care and dedication to its mission of expanding higher educational opportunities to those living in Charles, Calvert, and St. Mary's Counties and throughout the region.  The College of Southern Maryland began as a public community college serving Charles County residents in 1958 and has since grown into one of our state's most highly respected institutions of higher education serving commuter and remote learning students. Offering associates degrees in the arts, sciences, and teaching, the College served a total of more than 11,000 credit students at four campus locations last year and an additional 20,000 students online. It hosts six women's and six men's intercollegiate NCJAA Division III athletic teams and nurtures a strong school pride among its students and alumni. The College also trains many students who are serving in the military or who have been recently discharged as veterans. Many of its graduates transfer to four-year colleges to pursue bachelor degrees.  During Dr. Gottfried's tenure as President, the College has expanded to launch its Regional Hughesville Campus and its Center for Trades and Energy Training, which provides direct access to specialized training in career fields that have substantial growth potential, such as HVAC, electrical, construction, and plumbing. The College has also partnered with Southern Maryland businesses to create college-to-career pipelines that help students learn in-demand skills in cybersecurity, robotics, and digital media, among others. He has been praised both for his sound management of the College's finances and for his long-term vision for the College and how it can best serve its students. I've been proud to work closely with Dr. Gottfried to secure funding for the College of Southern Maryland's STEM Workforce Initiative, to enable the College to add to its nursing and health care resources and technology, and to expand courses supporting those training for careers in construction and transportation in our region.  Dr. Gottfried is someone who believes strongly in the importance of community colleges, as I do, to impact lives positively and add to the range of higher education options available for Maryland students. He came to the College of Southern Maryland with a long and experienced career as an academic and community college administrator. Having earned a Ph.D. in Zoology from Miami University, Dr. Gottfried taught for many years and then became President of Sussex County Community College in New Jersey in 2000. He has also become a noted and accomplished historian of the Civil War and has written extensively on the Battle of Gettysburg. The entire College of Southern Maryland community and its partners across the region have been very fortunate to have Dr. Gottfried leading the school these past eleven years, and he will be greatly missed.  I join in congratulating Dr. Gottfried on his retirement and wishing him and his wife Linda all the best in the future. I also wish to congratulate incoming President Dr. Maureen Murphy, currently at Brookdale Community College in New Jersey, on her selection to take the reins from Dr. Gottfried and continue the work of making the College of Southern Maryland one of the premier community colleges in the country.                          ____________________
