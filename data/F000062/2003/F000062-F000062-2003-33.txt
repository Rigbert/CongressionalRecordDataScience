  Mr. President, I have served as a member of the Judiciary Committee since I came to the Senate. I take the job very seriously. I try to do my homework in looking at these judges. I very deeply believe that this election provided no mandate to skew the courts to the right. I deeply believe that judges should be in the mainstream of American legal thinking, that they should have the temperament and the wisdom and the intellect to represent us well on the highest courts of our land.  What I wanted to use my time for--and the 2\1/2\ minutes will not be enough to do it--is to indicate that during thetime I have been on the Judiciary Committee how I have seen the rules and the procedures of the committee change. Those changes have not been good.
