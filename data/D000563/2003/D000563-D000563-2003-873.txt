Hesaid: Senator, isn't it a fact the reason you are blocking the Miguel Estrada nomination is because he is pro-life and you are pro-choice? You disagree on the abortion issue.  I ask the Senator from New York who sat through the Judiciary Committee with me over the last few years, is it not a fact that with over 100 nominees from the White House that President Bush has successfully guided through this Senate, is it not a fact the overwhelming majority of those disagree with our position on choice, on abortion, and yet they have gone through this committee, almost all of them, without controversy, many of them with routine rollcall votes? I ask the Senator from New York, does this difference of opinion come down to whether or not we are going to receive conservative nominees from the Bush White House and now we have the Democrats in the Senate Judiciary Committees stopping conservative nominees; is that what is at issue here?
