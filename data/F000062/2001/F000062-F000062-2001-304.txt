 President, I rise today to offer my strong support for the ``Global Democracy Act of 2001'', introduced by my friend and colleague from California, Senator Boxer.  Last month, President Bush announced that he was reinstating the ``global gag rule'' restricting United States assistance to international family planning organizations. I was extremely disappointed and amazed that the President opted to start his Administration with such a divisive action.  If women are to be able to better their own lives and the lives of their families, they must have access to the educational and medical resources needed to control their reproductive destinies and their health. International family planning programs reduce poverty, improve health, and raise living standards around the world; they enhance the ability of couples and individuals to determine the number and spacing of their children.  The ``Global Democracy Promotion Act of 2001'' will allow foreign Non Governmental Organizations that receive U.S. family planning assistance to use non-U.S. funds to provide legal abortion services, including counseling and referrals and will lift the restrictions on lobbying and advocacy.  The United States must reclaim its leadership role on international family planning and reproductive issues. The United States must renew its commitment to help those around the world who need and want our help and assistance. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.                                   ____                                       By Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Hollings):  S. 368. A bill to develop voluntary consensus standards to ensure accuracy and validation of the voting process, to direct the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology to study voter participation and emerging voting technology, to provide grants to States to improve voting methods, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, on behalf of the nearly 280 million Americans in this country, today I am introducing the American Voting Standards and Technology Act. After one of the closest and most contested elections in our Nation's history, Americans want to have complete confidence in the electoral process. We can accomplish that goal by ridding politics of large, unregulated contributions, and by ensuring that every vote is counted and recorded accurately.  The key to achieving meaningful reform and to restoring Americans' faith in government, is finding both a short-term and a long-term solution to the widespread abuses of the past election. I have devised a two-pronged strategy toward realizing these necessary changes in our electoral system. First, on January 22, Senator Feingold and I introduced the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2001. This measure bans soft money contributions, restricts corporate and union spending on electioneering ads, and provides for greater disclosure and stronger election laws. I look forward to bringing campaign finance reform back to the floor next month.  The bill that I am introducing today represents the second part of my electoral reform strategy. One of the most flagrant violations of our democratic electoral process was highlighted this past November by the overwhelming number of precincts who reported voting machine flaws. This is an embarrassment to our democracy. The American Voting Standards and TechnologyAct was written to directly address the root of these voting controversies--the actual machines. In the 2000 election, pre-scored punch-card ballots were used by one in three voters. These archaic ``votomatic'' machines, engineered in the 1960's, continue to be employed throughout the country, yet their ability to accurately record voters is questionable. In 1988, The National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST, recommended the elimination of prescored ballot cards, but this recommendation was unfortunately never heeded.  To compound the problems with pre-scored punch cards, numerous studies reveal that throughout the country, ballots cast by African Americans were nullified at a much higher rate than those of Caucasians. In Atlanta's Fulton County, which uses old punch-card voting machines, one of every 16 ballots for president was invalidated, while two largely white neighboring counties, Cobb and Gwinnett, using more modern equipment had a rate of 1 in 200. Similar patterns were found in Florida and Illinois. We cannot encourage and expect every American to vote if we ignore the inequalities that are inherent in our entire voting system.  The National Association of Secretaries of States recently issued fifteen recommendations aimed at avoiding the problems of last year's presidential election. The resolution recommends that States: Ensure equal access to the election system for the elderly, disabled, and minority communities; modernize voting machines and equipment; and conduct aggressive voter education and outreach programs. The resolution also advocates that Congress authorize an update of the voluntary federal voting standards and fund the development of voluntary management standards for each voting system. Senator Hollings and I have written the American Voting Standards and Technology Act in response to these recommendations.  This legislation that we are introducing today has three targets: First, it directs NIST to develop voluntary consensus standards to ensure the accuracy and validation of the voting process. Second, it authorizes matching grants to State agencies to purchase new or rehabilitated voting equipment to improve the ability of the public to cast a timely and accurate vote for the candidate of their choice. Finally, it authorizes grants throughout the Department of Commerce to State agencies to strengthen voter education campaigns. Both Senator Hollings and I have been working closely with NIST to begin this process now so that the next election will not bring the same confusion and frustration at the polls.  How can we encourage young Americans to vote if they believe their vote may not be counted? We must modernize our voting machinery and improve our voting process without barraging the States and local governments with excessive rules and regulations. The American Voting Standards and Technology Act accomplishes these goals.
