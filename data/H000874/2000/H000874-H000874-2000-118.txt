Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from Missouri (Ms. McCarthy), for her leadership and support of this effort. She has been very much involved in bringing the bill to this point, and I certainly appreciate her support on the floor.  Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.
