Is there some reason we are not pursuing the regular order and having that bill reported back out of the committee?  Mr. DeLAY. If the gentleman will yield further, this is a very simple, straightforward provision. It is the same provision we have carried and passed by this House many times. It is not very complicated. I am advised that the chairman of the committee did not feel that he needed to use the time of the committee to mark up such a very simple bill that has been discussed and debated on this floor many times, and passed by the House many times.
