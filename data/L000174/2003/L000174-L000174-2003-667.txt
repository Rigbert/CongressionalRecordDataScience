 I welcome the distinguished Presiding Officer to the Senate today in his capacity as President of the Senate. It is not often we see the Vice President in the chair of the Senate. With the U.N. Security Council meeting today, the OPEC meeting, the unsettled and threatening circumstances in so many parts of the world from the Middle East to the Korean peninsula to Iran and Iraq, we should feel very honored that the Vice President would take time out of his schedule related to those kinds of issues to be with us today.  I hope he will come back to the Senate when we debate the disastrous economic situation in the country, the loss of 2.5 million jobs in the last 2 years following 8 years of a million new jobs being added every year, or the 300,000 lost last month.  I know Senator Daschle sought for weeks to proceed to debate on S. 414, the Economic Recovery Act of 2003, which among other things includes the First Responders Partnership Grant Act, something that we could use in Vermont and Utah and Wyoming and everywhere else, but the Senate Republican majority has blocked debate and action on the Economic Recovery Act.  So, today, instead of debating the international situation, the need to pass an economic stimulus package, the need for an increased commitment to homeland defense, the need for legislation to provide a real prescription drug benefit for seniors or the many other matters so deeply concerning Americans, Republicans are insisting on returning again in some form to debate the nomination of Miguel Estrada.  I wonder if I might have order, Mr. President?
