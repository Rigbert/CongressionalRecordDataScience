Congress finds the following:       (1) The Socialist Republic of Vietnam is a one-party State,      ruled and controlled by the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV),      which continues to deny the right of citizens to change their      government. Although in recent years the National Assembly of      Vietnam has played an increasingly active role as a forum for      highlighting local concerns, corruption, and inefficiency,      the National Assembly remains subject to CPV direction. The      CPV maintains control over the selection of candidates in      national and local elections.       (2) The Government of Vietnam permits no public challenge      to the legitimacy of the one-party State. It prohibits      independent political, labor, and social organizations, and      it continues to detain and imprison persons for the peaceful      expression of dissenting religious and political views,      including Pham Hong Son, Tran Dung Tien, Father Nguyen Van      Ly, Dr. Nguyen Dan Que, Nguyen Vu Binh, Pham Que Duong, and      Pastor Nguyen Hong Quang, among others.       (3) The Government of Vietnam continues to commit serious      human rights abuses. In January 2004, the Department of State      reported to Congress that during the previous year the      Government of Vietnam had made ``no progress'' toward      releasing political and religious activists, ending official      restrictions on religious activity, or respecting the rights      of indigenous minorities in the Central and Northern      Highlands of Vietnam.       (4)(A) The Government of Vietnam limits freedom of religion      and restricts the operation of religious organizations other      than those approved by the State. While officially sanctioned      religious organizations are able to operate with varying      degrees of autonomy, some of those organizations continue to      face restrictions on selecting, training, and ordaining      sufficient numbers of clergy and in conducting educational      and charitable activities. The Government has previously      confiscated numerous churches, temples, and other properties      belonging to religious organizations, most of which have      never been returned.       (B) Unregistered ethnic minority Protestant congregations      in the Northwest and Central Highlands of Vietnam suffer      severe abuses, which have included forced renunciations of      faith, the closure and destruction of churches, the arrest      and harassment of pastors, and, in a few cases, there have      been credible reports that minority religious leaders have      been beaten and killed.       (C) The Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam (UBCV), one of      the largest religious denominations in Vietnam, was declared      illegal in 1981. The Government of Vietnam confiscated its      temples and persecuted its clergy for refusing to join the      state-sponsored Buddhist organizations. For more than 2      decades, the Government has detained and confined senior UBCV      clergy, including the Most Venerable Thich Huyen Quang, the      Most Venerable Thich Quang Do, the Venerable Thich Tue Sy,      and others.       (D) The Catholic Church continues to face significant      restrictions on the training and ordination of priests and      bishops, resulting in numbers insufficient to support the      growing Catholic population in Vietnam. Although recent years      have brought a modest easing of government control in some      dioceses, officials in other areas strictly limit the conduct      of religious education classes and charitable activities.      Father Thaddeus Nguyen Van Ly, who was convicted in a closed      trial in 2001 after publicly criticizing religious repression      by the Government of Vietnam, remains in prison.       (E) The Government of Vietnam continues to suppress the      activities of other religious adherents, including Cao Dai,      Baha'i, and Hoa Hao who lack official recognition or have      chosen not to affiliate with the State-sanctioned groups,      including through the use of detention and imprisonment.       (5) The Government of Vietnam significantly restricts the      freedoms of speech and the press, particularly with respect      to political and religious speech. Government and Party-     related organizations control all print and electronic media,      including access to the Internet. The Government blocks web      sites that it deems politically or culturally inappropriate,      and it jams some foreign radio stations, including Radio Free      Asia. The Government has detained, convicted, and imprisoned      individuals who have posted or sent democracy-related      materials via the Internet.       (6)(A) Indigenous Montagnards in the Central Highlands of      Vietnam continue to face significant repression. The      Government of Vietnam restricts the practice of Christianity      by those populations, and more than 100 Montagnards have been      sentenced to prison terms of up to 13 years for claiming land      rights, organizing Christian gatherings, or attempting to      seek asylum in Cambodia.       (B) The Government of Vietnam uses the separatist agenda of      a relatively small number of ethnic minority leaders as a      rationale for violating civil and political rights in ethnic      minority regions.       (C) The Government of Vietnam arrested or detained nearly      300 Montagnards during 2003 and since then many hundreds of      Montagnards have gone into hiding, fearing arrest,      interrogation, or physical abuse by government authorities.       (D) During Easter weekend in April 2004, thousands of      Montagnards gathered to protest their treatment by the      Government of Vietnam, including the confiscation of tribal      lands and ongoing restrictions on religious activities.      Credible reports indicate that the protests were met with a      violent response and that many demonstrators were arrested,      injured, or are in hiding, and that others were killed.       (E) Government officials continue to restrict access to the      Central and Northwest Highlands of Vietnam by diplomats,      nongovernmental organizations, journalists, and other      foreigners, making it difficult to verify conditions in those      areas.       (7)(A) United States refugee resettlement programs for      Vietnamese nationals, including the Orderly Departure Program      (ODP), the Resettlement Opportunities for Returning      Vietnamese (ROVR) program, the Priority One (P1) program and      the resettlement of boat people from refugee camps throughout      Southeast Asia, were authorized by law in order to rescue      Vietnamese nationals who have suffered persecution on account      of their wartime associations with the United States, as well      as those who currently have a well-founded fear of      persecution on account of race, religion, nationality,      political opinion, or membership in a particular social      group.       (B) While those programs have served their purposes well, a      significant number of eligible refugees were unfairly denied      or excluded, in some cases by vindictive or corrupt      Vietnamese officials who controlled access to the programs,      and in others by United States personnel who imposed unduly      restrictive interpretations of program criteria.       (C) The Department of State has agreed to extend the      September 30, 1994, registration deadline for former United      States employees, ``re-education'' survivors, and surviving      spouses of those who did not survive ``re-education'' camps      to sign up for United States refugee programs, as well as to      resume the Vietnamese In-Country Priority One Program in      Vietnam to provide protection to victims of persecution on      account of race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or      membership in a particular social group who otherwise have no      access to the Orderly Departure Program.       (D) The former U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service      agreed to resume the processing of former United States      employees under the U11 program, which had been unilaterally      suspended by the United States Government, as well as to      review the applications of Amerasians, children of American      servicemen left behind in Vietnam after the war ended in      April 1975, for resettlement to the United States under the      Amerasian Homecoming Act of 1988.       (8) Congress and people of the United States are united in      their determination that the expansion of relations with      Vietnam, a country whose government engages in serious      violations of fundamental human rights, should not be      construed as approval of or complacency about such practices.      The promotion of freedom and democracy around the world is      and must continue to be a central objective of United States      foreign policy. Congress remains willing and hopeful to      recognize improvement in the future human rights practices of      the Government of Vietnam, which is the motivating purpose      behind this Act.  TITLE I--CONDITIONS ON INCREASED NONHUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE TO THE                          GOVERNMENT OF VIETNAM     SEC. 101. BILATERAL NONHUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE.
