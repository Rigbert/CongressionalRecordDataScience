 President, I, along with Senators Domenici, Lautenberg, Boxer, Chafee, DeWine, D'Amato, and Kennedy am offering the sense of the Senate that would require the Finance Committee to allow elderly legal immigrants to continue receiving SSI during their redetermination period. Under the current budget agreement, all elderly would be cut off of SSI as of October 1, 1997.  I want to acknowledge the leadership of the bill managers on both sides for their recognition of the devastating impact this budget agreement has on over 400,000 elderly legal immigrants, and encouraging the Senate to provide an important interim provision.  While I support the budget resolution's broad budget balancing framework, I have expressed over and over again, my deep concerns over its failure to restore SSI for over 400,000 elderly legal immigrants, 30 percent of which are over the age of 75 and who will be cut off from SSI as of October 1, 1997.  The current budget agreement, falls short of what is needed to keep the elderly immigrants from losing their life supporting benefits.  The Budget Agreement provides:  SSI benefits for disabled legal immigrants who are disabled and were in the country as of August 22, 1996.  SSI benefits for those who became disabled and got on the rolls between August 22, 1996 to June 1, 1997.  The budget agreement bans:  SSI for most elderly legal immigrants, even those elderly immigrants who rely on SSI for survival.  Food Stamps for most legal immigrants.  Although restoring SSI for the disabled is an important first step to a major flaw in the Welfare Reform bill passed by Congress last year, the elderly legal immigrants who depend on SSI will still lose their benefits under the agreement.  Under the current agreement, an 83-year-old woman with no family, who speaks little or no English, will be just as homeless as one who is disabled when she loses her SSI benefits. What is she supposed to do, get a job?  Under Welfare Reform, approximately 725,000 elderly, blind, and disabled legal immigrants could lose SSI benefits on August 22 of this year. Under the budget agreement: 42.5 percent or 307,630 disabled legal immigrants who were receiving SSI as of the date of enactment of the Welfare Bill would continue receiving SSI. However, for 417,360 or 57.5 percent of elderly legal immigrants who are currently receiving SSI would be cut off as of October 1, 1997.  The President estimates that 66 percent of the elderly legal immigrants who will be cut off from SSI initially could be recertified under the disabled category.  However, due to what I believe is an unintended mistake, even those elderly legal immigrants who are also disabled would be cut off from SSI on October 1, 1997. The elderly would become eligible for SSI only if they requalify after the cutoff.  CBO estimates that it would take 6 months or longer to rectify all the elderly legal immigrants currently on the rolls. During the recertification period, no elderly legal immigrant would be receiving SSI. How will they survive for 6 months? They will mostly become homeless or fall onto County General Assistance rolls.  The impact of the SSI ban for elderly legal immigrants will be devastating and immediate, especially in the high immigrant States.  In California, 163,900 elderly legal immigrants may lose their SSI.  In New York, 65,340 elderly legal immigrants may lose their SSI.  In Texas, 32,640 elderly legal immigrants may lose their SSI.  In Florida, 44,310 elderly legal immigrants may lose their SSI.  In Illinois, 13,360 elderly legal immigrants may lose their SSI.  In Massachusetts, 13,410 elderly legal immigrants may lose their SSI.  Come October 1, 1997, we will see hundreds of thousands of elderly legal immigrants, of which 30 percent are over 75 years old, and who may also be disabled, thrown out into the streets and homeless.  Under the Budget Agreement, 137,728 or 34 percent of elderly legal immigrants nationwide will lose their SSI permanently because they will not be able to qualify as disabled; 55,726 elderly legal immigrants in California will lose their SSI; 22,215 elderly legal immigrants in New York will lose their SSI; 11,076 elderly legal immigrants in Texas will lose their SSI; 15,065 elderly legal immigrants in Florida will lose their SSI; 4,542 elderly legal immigrants in Illinois will lose their SSI; and 4,425 elderly legal immigrants in Massachusetts will lose their SSI.  The alternatives for these elderly legal immigrants are bleak--if they do not have family who can care for them, they either end up in a homeless shelter or end up on County General Assistance rolls.  Senator John Chafee and I have previously introduced a bill that would restore SSI benefits to all elderly, blind or disabled legal immigrants who were receiving SSI prior to the passage of the welfare reform bill. We propose that no current recipient should be thrown off from their SSI benefits. We agree that for those coming into the country after the enactment date, we ban SSI and require instead, the sponsors to be responsible for their family members.  I believe that this is a responsible action that must be taken by Congress to correct a serious flaw in the welfare bill.  Allowing the elderly to continue receiving their SSI until they can be recertified is the first step but not the final solution. The final solution is to provide for all elderly and disabled legal immigrants who were on SSI as of August 22, 1996, to continue receiving their SSI.  As we go forward in the budget reconciliation process and final passage of the fiscal year 1998 budget, I urge mycolleagues to support the Chafee-Feinstein provision that protects the elderly legal immigrants who were getting SSI at the date of enactment.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an SSA table be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:    TABLE 3.--NUMBER OF ALIENS RECEIVING SSI PAYMENTS BY ELIGIBILITY                    CATEGORY AND STATE, DECEMBER 1996------------------------------------------------------------------------                 State                     Total       Aged     Disabled------------------------------------------------------------------------      Total............................    724,990    417,360    307,630                                        --------------------------------Alabama................................        480        370        110Alaska.................................        750        390        360Arizona................................      7,650      3,900      3,750Arkansas...............................        340        190        150California.............................    293,180    163,900    129,280Colorado...............................      5,140      2,740      2,400Connecticut............................      4,370      2,700      1,670Delaware...............................        330        200        130District of Columbia...................        860        530        330Florida................................     69,710     44,310     25,400Georgia................................      4,570      3,930      1,640Hawaii.................................      3,770      2,850        920Idaho..................................        410        220        190Illinois...............................     23,980     13,360      9,620Indiana................................      1,080        730        350Iowa...................................      1,170        600        570Kansas.................................      1,500        700        800Kentucky...............................        720        380        340Louisiana..............................      2,500      1,430       1070Maine..................................        540        200        340Maryland...............................      7,800      5,970      1,830Massachusetts..........................     23,980     13,410     10,570Michigan...............................      7,350      4,060      3,290Minnesota..............................      6,640      2,340      4,300Mississippi............................        440        230        220Missouri...............................      1,900      1,030        770Montana................................        150      (\1\)      (\1\)Nebraska...............................        720        340        380Nevada.................................      2,370      1,590        780New Hampshire..........................        350        200        150New Jersey.............................     22,140     14,580      7,560New Mexico.............................      3,350      1,530      1,820New York...............................    113,900     65,340     48,560North Carolina.........................      2,600      1,590      1,010North Dakota...........................        180      (\1\)      (\1\)Ohio...................................      5,340      3,380      1,960Oklahoma...............................      1,340        880        460Oregon.................................      4,260      2,200      2,060Pennsylvania...........................     11,340      6,470      4,870Rhode Island...........................      3,440      1,700      1,740South Carolina.........................        580        420        160South Dakota...........................        200      (\1\)      (\1\)Tennessee..............................      1,380        850        530Texas..................................     54,760     32,640     22,120Utah...................................      1,420        700        720Vermont................................        150      (\1\)      (\1\)Virginia...............................      6,780      5,150      1,630Washington.............................     13,160      5,920      7,240West Virginia..........................        190      (\1\)      (\1\)Wisconsin..............................      4,790      1,800      2,990Wyoming................................
