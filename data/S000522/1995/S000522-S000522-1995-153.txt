Mr. Chairman, let me make clear to the gentleman that our embassy confirmed this story. I want to go back to something I said earlier on. The Refugee Committee of Lawyers for Human Rights has so blasted the process of screening they have changed international standards. The credibility is one where they are viewed with unbelievable skepticism before they even open their mouths. It is a flawed process.  We are saying that the President should certify, and if it is not a flawed process, then the money is okay, but if he can certify these people are being voluntarily repatriated, that is a different story.
