 President, today the President nominated JudgeMichael Mukasey to be our Nation's 81st Attorney General. He has impressive credentials. I look forward to learning more about his record.  In this regard, the Judiciary Committee should promptly hold hearings on his nomination, carefully examine his record, and vote in a timely manner. For the past several months our Democratic colleagues have told us we need to install new leadership at the Justice Department and that we ``can't afford to wait,'' in their words  A successful nominee, they have told us, is someone with integrity and experience, who respects the rule of law and who can hit the ground running.
