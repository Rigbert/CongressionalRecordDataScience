President, this week, the Nation commemorates Sunshine Week, a time to educate the public about the importance of open government. In recognition of Sunshine Week 2011, I am pleased to join with Senator Cornyn to reintroduce the Faster FOIA Act of 2011, a bill to improve the implementation of the Freedom of Information Act, FOIA.  Senator Cornyn and I first introduced this bill in 2005 to address the growing problem of excessive FOIA delays within our Federal agencies. We reintroduced this bill in 2010, and the Senate unanimously passed it last year. This bill is the most recent product of our bipartisan work to help reinvigorate FOIA.  This bill will establish a bipartisan commission to examine the root causes of agency FOIA delays and to recommend to the Congress and the President steps to help eliminate FOIA backlogs.  While the Obama administration has made significant progress in improving the FOIA process, large backlogs remain a major roadblock to public access to information. A report released earlier this week by the National Security Archive found that only about half of the Federal agencies surveyed have taken concrete steps to update their FOIA policies in light of these reforms. In addition, twelve of the agencies surveyed by the National Security Archive had pending FOIA requests that were more than 6 years old, according to the report.  Senator Cornyn and I believe that these delays are simply unacceptable. And that is why we are introducing this bill.  The commission created by the Faster FOIA Act will make key recommendations to Congress and the President for reducing impediments to the efficient processing of FOIA requests. The commission will also study why Federal agencies are more and more relying on FOIA exemptions to withhold information from the public. In addition, the commission will examine whether the current system for charging fees and granting fee waivers under FOIA should be modified. The commission will be made up of government and non-governmental representatives with a broad range of experience related to handling FOIA requests.  Thomas Jefferson once wisely observed that ``information is the currency of democracy.'' I share this view. Indeed, we need look no further than the unfolding and historic events in the Middle East and North Africa for evidence of the truth of these words. The Faster FOIA Act will help ensure the dissemination of government information to the American people, so that our democracy remains vibrant and free.  I have said many times that open government is neither a Democratic issue, nor a Republican issue it is truly an American value and virtue that we all must uphold. As we celebrate Sunshine Week, it is in this bipartisan spirit that I join Americans from across the Nation in celebrating an open and transparent government. I thank Senator Cornyn for his work on this bill and for his leadership on this issue. I also thank Senator Whitehouse who has cosponsored this bill. I urge all Senators to support the Faster FOIA Act.                                 ______                                       By
