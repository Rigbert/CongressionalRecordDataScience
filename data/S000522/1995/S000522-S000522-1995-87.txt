Mr. Chairman, I thank my good friend for yielding time to me.  Mr. Chairman, I urge Members to vote no on the Hoyer amendment, which would gut the every effective language that was put into the legislation by the chairman of the committee, the gentleman from Iowa [Mr. Lightfoot]. Let me just remind Members, as the chairman pointed out so well, the language that is in the bill was current law throughout the 1980's and into the 1990's, but regrettably during the last Congress we were unable to get the language put back into the appropriations bill so we began paying for abortion on demand as part of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program.  Mr. Chairman, I think it is becoming increasingly clear by way of public opinion polls, by way of the kind of feedback that we are all getting from our home districts, that people do not want to subsidize abortion on demand, they do not want taxpayer funds or premium funds being used to subsidize for willful killing of unborn children simply because they are inconvenient, simply because it is a matter of a birth control abortion or for some other reason.  Make no mistake about it. The Hoyer amendment, if it succeeds, would usher in abortion on demand at any time during the pregnancy, and we would have situations where babies are literally dismembered or chemically poisoned simply because we were subsidizing and providing the wherewithal to kill those babies.  Taxpayers do not want any part of this. Let me make that clear. We saw with the national health care reform debate last year, which unfortunately never happened because all of us heard from our constituents that they did not want to provide premium dollars or tax dollars for this grisly business.  Let me remind Members, too, that as part of the Federal employees health benefits plan taxpayers foot approximately 70 percent of the contribution. I think everyone knows that Federal employees, including Members of Congress, do not pay the whole freight, if you will, the entire bill when it comes to our Federal Employees Health Benefits Program.  An overwhelming amount of it, 70 percent, 72 percent to be exact, is footed by the taxpayer. So this is a government-taxpayer-funded issue, not unlike the Hyde amendment. So I would remind Members that if they are for the Hyde amendment they have to be against the Hoyer amendment and for the underlying language that Chairman Lightfoot put in.  You know, I think it is becoming increasingly clear as well, Mr. Chairman, and the fight and debate that is going on in the Committee on the Judiciary on the partial birth abortion whereby children are literally almost completely born only to be killed by the abortionist by sucking the brain out of the baby. And this goes on. And those who accuse those of us on this side of trying to inflame or in any way emotionalize this issue, it is the pro-abortion side, I would submit, that has to apologize or at least explain why they do this kind of violence, why they inflict this kind of violence on unborn children.  Well, the dirty secret of the abortion movement itself are the methods themselves, the chemical poisonings that go on, the injections of high concentrated salt solutions that literally pickle the baby alive inside the mother's uterus, usually takes about 2 hours for the baby to die. It is a very slow and gruesome death. The child swallows, gulps the salt-filled amniotic water, the water inside the amniotic sac, to die a very cruel death.  That is what we would subsidize if we go with the Hoyer amendment, because saline abortions are done in those HMO's and in those hospitals and under the auspices of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program.  We would also be subsidizing the dismemberment of unborn children, again, the dirt secret of the abortion movement, a child literally dismembered, arms, legs, torso, head, completely cut.  Nobody wants to talk about that. People roll their eyes and say we are bringing emotion into this. These are the plain facts of what abortion does to a baby.  It is violence. We need to be providing positive, nonviolent alternatives to women who have distressful pregnancies, not providing and facilitating by way of taxpayer dollars the killing of their unborn children.  Let me also point out that the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program does not distinguish between lower and upper income employees. Without the Lightfoot language, taxpayers subsidize most of the costs of all Federal employees and their families, even those making over $100,000, so we would be paying for abortions for them as well.  I want to just conclude by reminding Members unborn children are not warts, a pregnancy is not a disease, and if we go with Mr. Hoyer's amendment we will be saying that if a child, simply because he or she is inconvenient or unwanted, we will provide the wherewithal, we will provide the means, the money to have that child destroyed.                              {time}  1830  Reject the Hoyer amendment, it is anti-child, and support the underlying language of the gentleman from Iowa [Mr. Lightfoot].
