President, as we speak, rescue crews are fighting valiantly to contain the damage from the wreck of the tanker New Carissa off of Coos Bay, Oregon three weeks ago. But the clock is ticking, the water is rising, and time is running short. An environmental disaster of truly alarming proportions is staring my state in the face.  Thousands of gallons of fuel oil have already leaked out of the wrecked ship and thousands more may be spilled along our precious coastline within days, if not hours.  As Oregonians struggle to make the best of a bad situation, it is not too early to start talking about how we prevent the next addition to the legacy of New Carissa. It seems clear to me that we need to look at the pernicious practice of foreign flagging. How many gallons of oil need to spill and how many miles of coastline have to be destroyed before we stop allowing unseaworthy vessels manned by untrained crews into our coastal waters.  It seems easier to register a supertanker in some foreign countries than it is to register an automobile in Portland, Oregon. As long as this so-called Flag of Convenience system continues, it's only a matter of time before the next New Carissa runs aground on a local beach. Yet our maritime policy continues to allow it.  Grave concerns have also been raised about the amount and quality of information being released to the public about this disaster. People who live in the area simply have not been told what to expect. That is unacceptable. When disaster strikes, government has an ironclad responsibility to give people as much information as possible.  Today, I am introducing legislation that focuses on avoiding disasters like the New Carissa. We need to stop playing Russian roulette with our coastal resources and the communities that depend on them.  Congressman DeFazio has authored companion legislation in the House of Representatives, which was adopted as an amendment to the Coast Guard Reauthorization Bill.  This legislation requires all vessels, foreign and domestic, to notify the Coast Guard when they intend to enter our country's territorial waters, allows the Coast Guard to bar them from entry if there are safety concerns, and gives the Coast Guard the authority to direct the movements of such vessels in our waters in hazardous situations. This bill would have given the Coast Guard the ability to block the New Carissa from allowing its deadly course of sailing so close to shore during a hazardous gale, a practice that local pilots shun.  In other words, had this bill been in place, the Coast Guard would have had the ability to stop this tragedy before it occurred, instead of having to clean up after it.  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation, and ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 498       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. CLARIFICATION OF COAST GUARD AUTHORITY TO CONTROL                    VESSELS IN TERRITORIAL WATERS OF THE UNITED                    STATES.       The Ports and Waterways Safety Act (33 U.S.C. 1221 et seq.)      is amended by adding at the end the following:     ``SEC. 15. ENTRY OF VESSELS INTO TERRITORIAL SEA; DIRECTION                    OF VESSELS BY COAST GUARD.       ``(a) Notification of Coast Guard.--       ``(1) Notification.--Under regulations prescribed by the      Secretary, a commercial vessel entering the territorial sea      of the United States shall notify the Secretary not later      than 24 hours before that entry.       ``(2) Information.--The regulations under paragraph (1)      shall specify that the notification shall contain the      following information:       ``(A) The name of the vessel.       ``(B) The port or place of destination in the United      States.       ``(C) The time of entry into the territorial sea.       ``(D) With respect to the fuel oil tanks of the vessel--       ``(i) the capacity of those tanks; and       ``(ii) the estimated quantity of fuel oil that will be      contained in those tanks at the time of entry into the      territorial sea.       ``(E) Any information requested by the Secretary to      demonstrate compliance with applicable international      agreements to which the United States is a party.       ``(F) If the vessel is carrying dangerous cargo, a      description of that cargo.       ``(G) A description of any hazardous conditions on the      vessel.       ``(H) Any other information requested by the Secretary.       ``(b) Denial of Entry.--The Secretary may deny entry of a      vessel into the territorial sea of the United States if--       ``(1) the Secretary has not received notification for the      vessel in accordance with subsection (a); or       ``(2) the vessel is not in compliance with any other      applicable law relating to marine safety, security, or      environmental protection.       ``(c) Direction of Vessel.--The Secretary may direct the      operation of any vessel in the navigable waters of the United      States as necessary during hazardous circumstances, including      the absence of a pilot required by Federal or State law,      weather, casualty, vessel traffic, or the poor condition of      the vessel.''.                                 ______                                       By
