 President, today I am pleased to introduce the Equal Justice for Our Military Act of 2011. The act would eliminate inequities in current law by allowing court-martialed servicemembers who face dismissal, discharge or confinement for a year or more to seek review by the United States Supreme Court.  In our civilian courts today, all persons convicted of a crime, if they lose on appeal, have a right to petition the U.S. Supreme Court for discretionary review. Even enemy combatants have the right to direct appellate review in the Supreme Court.  In contrast, however, our men and women in uniform do not share this same right. Our military personnel have a limited right to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. They can appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court only if the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, CAAF, actually conducts a review of their case or grants a petition for extraordinary relief. In other words, if the CAAF refuses to take their case, or denies their extraordinary relief petition, the servicemember has no right to further review in the Supreme Court.  For fiscal years 2008 through 2010, the CAAF denied a total of 2230 petitions for review. The CAAF also averages about 20 denials of extraordinary relief petitions every year. Taken together, this means that there are more than 750 court-martial decisions per year in which servicemembers are denied the opportunity to seek certiorari from the Supreme Court.  In addition to this disparity between our civilian and military court systems, there is another disparity within the military court system itself. The government may petition the Supreme Court for review of adverse court-martial rulings in any case where the charges are severe enough to make a punitive discharge possible. But servicemembers do not have the same rights to petition the Supreme Court that the military prosecutors on the other side of the aisle have.  The bill I am introducing today is a simple one, which would correct these inequities. It would allow servicemembers whose appeals are denied review by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, or who were denied extraordinary relief, the opportunity to seek review of those decisions by writ of certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court.  While this legislation would provide a fairer legal process for servicemembers, it would not unduly burden the military or the Supreme Court. As noted in the 2010 House Judiciary Committee Report on the legislation, the expanded Supreme Court review of court-martial decisions authorized by the legislation would result in only about 80-120 additional petitions for certiorari each year. Additionally, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the increased workload for Department of Defense attorneys and Supreme Court clerks would cost less than $1 million each year.  Every day, our U.S. service personnel place their lives on the line in defense of American rights. It is unacceptable for us to continue to routinely deprive our men and women in uniform of one of those rights--the ability to petition their Nation's highest court for direct relief. It is a right given to common criminals in our civilian courts, to the Government, and even to some of the terrorists who we hope to prosecute as war criminals.  It is long past time we give them the same rights as the American citizens they fight, and sometimes die, to protect. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation to give equal justice to our U.S. servicemembers.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1664       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
