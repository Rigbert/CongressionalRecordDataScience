President, I am very pleased that the Senate is able to pass the Hatch-Leahy Satellite Home Viewers Improvements Act. This bill will provide viewers with more choices and will greatly increase competition regarding network and other video programming.  For some time, I have been concerned about the lack of competition with cable TV and escalating cable rates. This bill will allow satellite TV providers to compete directly with cable and will give consumers a choice. It also avoids needless cutoffs of satellite TV service and protects local TV affiliates.  The Judiciary Committee had a full committee hearing on these satellite issues on November 12, 1997, and Chairman Hatch and I agreed to work together on this bill. On March 5, 1998, the Hatch-Leahy bill, S. 1720, was introduced and was reported out of the Judiciary Committee unanimously on October 1, 1998. It permits local TV signals, as opposed to distant out-of-State networks signals, to be offered to viewers via satellite; increase competition between cable and satellite TV providers; and provide more PBS programming by also offering a national feed as well as local programming; and reduce rates charged to consumers.  We have been racing against the clock because court orders have required the cutoffs of distant CBS and Fox television signals to over a million households in the U.S.  Under a preliminary injunction, satellite service to thousands of households in Vermont and other states was to be terminated on October 8, 1998, for CBS and Fox distant network signals for households signed up after March 11, 1997, the date the action was filed.  This bill will allow satellite TV to operate just like cable TV with local channels, movies, local weather, sports, CNN, news, superstations, and the like. It allows for local TV stations to be received over satellite, permanently, and could reduce satellite rates.  It ends the cable subscriber 90-day waiting period for those wanting to switch from cable to satellite--which has been a needless barrier to competition.  The bill extends distant network service to allow for a phase-in to local-into-local TV service and creates a national PBS feed, and also will offer the local PBS.  It also restores all lost distant stations, if the satellite provider is willing to restore service, and delays cutoffs of all other distant signals until December 31 of this year and only for a much smaller number of dish owners.  Ultimately, in 2002, the bill will impose ``must carry'' rules on satellite providers just like the ``must carry'' rules for cable TV which permits a phase-in of local-to-local service.  The chairman of the Antitrust Subcommittee, Senator DeWine, and the ranking member, Senator Kohl, also worked hard on this issue.  It is absurd that home dish owners--whether they live in Vermont, Utah or California--have to watch network stations imported from distant states.  This committee has worked together to protect the local broadcast system and to provide the satellite industry with a way to compete with cable.  Cable TV now offers a full range of local programming as well as programming regarding sports, politics, national weather, education, and a range of movies.  Yet, cable rates keep increasing--I want satellite TV to directly compete with cable TV. The only way they can do that is to be able to offer local TV stations.  We heard testimony in 1997 and 1998 that the major reason consumers do not sign up for satellite service is that they cannot get local programming. I want satellite carriers to be able to offer the full range of local programming.  We should be encouraging this so-called ``local-into-local'' service. Local broadcast stations contribute to our sense of community.  We should be encouraging competition through local-into-local service. Instead, the current policy fosters confusion-into-more-confusion service and lots of litigation.  By striking a burdensome and flawed limitation on satellite providers, we will be prescribing fairness for dish owners and injecting some much-needed competition into the television market.  I look forward to working with my colleagues at conference.                           Amendment No. 372   (Purpose: To amend the Communications Act of 1934 to enhance the   ability of direct broadcast satellite and other multichannel video providers to compete effectively with cable television systems, and for                             other purposes)
