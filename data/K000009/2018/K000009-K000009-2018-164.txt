Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to the life of a remarkable woman. Mary Gregory passed from this life on April 2, 2018. Her friends and family will gather this week to remember and honor her.  Mary Gregory was born to Louise and Richard Booker in Marion Indiana in 1930. Though they lived in town, the family owned a farm and Mary participated in its daily operation. She regularly attended the Methodist Church. Surely, Mary's faith and discipline were instilled at an early age. Some of her family left for work in Toledo and eventually the rest of the family, including Mary, joined them. Her mother established a beauty salon, one of the first African American owned salons in Toledo.  After graduating from Libbey High School, Mary was at first unable to pursue a nursing degree as she had chosen, because no nursing schools would admit an African American. In 1947 she was admitted into the St. Vincent School of Nursing and was the first African American to do so. She graduated in 1951, married Raymond Gregory, and together they raised a family of four children. Mary continued her education, completing her Masters of Education, Community Health and Administration Degree from the University of Toledo. She went on to a 47 year career at St. Vincent Hospital.  Mary Gregory's tenure at St. Vincent's was writ large. Beginning in the Emergency Room, she later was an operating room staff nurse. Then Mary really established herself. She instructed and trained students as surgical technicians for twenty years. During this time she developed a ``patient centered'' curriculum and initiated a two year Surgical Tech training program. The program was so successful it was transferred to Lawrence Tech so that it could grow and was replicated in other places. Mary also supervised the St. Vincent Sickle Cell Free Testing and Education Program provided to Toledo's African American community. She even wrote the grants to fund this service.  It was through her position as Manager of Health Promotions that Mary Gregory indelibly stamped her imprimatur on St. Vincent and the Toledo community. She developed free community health screenings and education, going out into the neighborhoods, migrant camps, and other underserved areas. She met the people where they were, at community events, shopping centers and health fairs. She talked to all people, especially those whose health and well-being were disproportionately addressed. Mary Gregory became the face of health promotion for many and fought to eliminate disparities in health care availability and accessibility.  At the same time her career progressed at St. Vincent Hospital, Mary Gregory served our community in many ways, committed to community health. She was a member of the Toledo-Lucas County Board of Health, the Toledo HIV-AIDS Task Force, and the Ohio Commission on Minority Health. Mary was a co-founder of the Toledo Council of Black Nurses, serving as its first president. Additionally, Mary started a caregiver service at Warren AME Church, implemented health screenings at Toledo Public Schools, worked through the organizations of which she was a member to provide cancer, diabetes, and heart disease screenings, lupus support services, and smoking cessation help as part of April's Minority Health Month, and she was an Ambassador for the American Heart Association.  Mary Gregory used her time and talents for the benefit of others. Through her efforts our community was compassionate, and our most vulnerable neighbors were ministered to in many ways. She lived Christ's message of Love. Surely at her homegoing, she was greeted as in Matthew 25:23, ``Well done, thou good and faithful servant.''  To Mary Gregory's family and friends, we offer our condolences. We hope they find comfort in shared memories and the gift of her life.                          ____________________
