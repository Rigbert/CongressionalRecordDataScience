Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, I want to thank all of my colleagues that participated in the debate. They have worked from 10 o'clock this morning until the night on this historical moment. Much has been said about this bill. A lot of it true; some of it not so true.  But I would ask Members in your hearts to think about one thing for one moment. We are being asked to re-vote on an amendment that was offered bythe gentleman from New York (Mr. Solomon). And if Members defeat the Solomon amendment, they are left with the language in the bill. Keep that in mind.  Mr. Chairman, I started this process over 4 years ago. I have had the hearings. I have done it the right way. I want to thank the leadership on my side of the aisle and the leadership on that side of the aisle for allowing this debate to begin. This is just one small step, as I said earlier in the day. This is one small step to bring justice to America and to the Puerto Rican people. I believe it is crucially important as we go into the year 2000.  Mr. Chairman, I think it is the best thing we can do for democracy and for this great Nation. I thank you for the indulgence. I gave my word. I gave my commitment that we would bring this bill to the floor for America and the Puerto Rican people. This is the legislative process. This is how this House should work. Not behind closed doors, not by secret meetings, but open debate, discussing the merits, the cons and the pros of legislation that decides the destiny of this great Nation.  I am asking my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the Burton-Miller-Young bill as they voted before.                              {time}  2130  I am asking my colleagues to vote yes on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Solomon), my good friend, as he asked you to do. I am asking them to vote yes on final passage so we can begin this venture into future generations.
