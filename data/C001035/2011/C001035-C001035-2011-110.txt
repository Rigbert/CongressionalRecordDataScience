President, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today to submit a resolution recognizing National Child Abuse Prevention Month. Iam honored to be joined by an advocate for children, Senator Kerry, in turning a spotlight on the issue of child abuse and neglect in this country. Senator Kerry and I share a common belief that children should be valued and nurtured by both their families and all of us.  The effort to address child abuse transcends ideological and partisan lines. This is not a Democratic or Republican issue--this is an American issue--one that we can't wish away, but that we must face head on and work to eradicate.  Abuse of children occurs in all segments of our society, in rural, suburban, and urban areas and among all racial, ethnic, and income groups. According to the 2009 Child Maltreatment Study compiled by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, during 2009, an estimated 702,000 children were determined to be victims of abuse or neglect, and an estimated 1,770 children died as a result.  Last year I became aware of yet another tragic case of child abuse. Maine was mourning the death of 15-month old Damien Lynn. Autopsy reports show that little Damien had broken bones and ribs, head and abdominal injuries, and a human bite mark on his right arm. This year the former boyfriend of Damien's mother will face the consequences of his actions, and I am proud to introduce this resolution again in Damien's memory.  The time has come for Americans to unite in an all-out effort to eradicate child abuse. National Child Abuse Prevention Month is an opportunity for communities across the country to keep children safe, provide the support families need to stay together, and raise children and youth to be happy, secure, and stable adults.  To paraphrase Mahatma Gandhi, ``You can judge a society by how they treat their weakest members.'' This resolution is sad commentary that we have to do more to protect those who are in the dawn of life, the most vulnerable among us, our children.                          ____________________
