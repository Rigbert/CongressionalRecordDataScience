 President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of this Senate resolution to pay tribute to the four boy scouts who lost their lives almost 2 weeks ago when a tornado struck Little Sioux Scout Ranch in western Iowa: Aaron Eilerts of Eagle Grove, Iowa and Sam Thomsen, Josh Fennen, and Ben Petrizilka of Omaha, Nebraska. I would like also to recognize the bravery and dedication of all the other scouts affected by this tragedy and of the emergency crews who responded.  All of these remarkable young people had already established themselves as leaders in their community. The loss of four of them is a tragedy for Iowa and Nebraska.  I would like in particular to express my condolences to the four families who have suffered such a devastating loss. My thoughts and prayers are with them at this difficult time.  The Boy Scouts of America is an organization that never fails to exceed expectations. All the Scouts at Little Sioux Ranch that day kept their courage when all about them was chaos. Many of those who survived suffered considerable injuries. As the storm passed, the Boy Scouts immediately began to administer first aid to the injured and set to work to clear the roads, allowing the emergency crews to move in. In their bravery and resourcefulness, they did honor to Boy Scouts throughout the country. We are proud of them and humbled by their service.  I am saddened that we must be here today at all offering this resolution, but I am honored to pay tribute to these young leaders, and I extend my deepest sympathy to all those affected by this tragedy.
