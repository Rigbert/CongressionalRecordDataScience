 President, I say to my good friend from Wyoming, before he leaves the floor, I share his frustration over our failure to act on any kind of medical malpractice reform. We have tried a broad approach. We have tried a narrow approach. We will be back again to try another narrow approach. We can't even seem to get cloture on the motion to proceed. That is how dug in the Senate seems to be against any effort to lower those liability insurance premiums for doctors. The Senator from Wyoming brings up a very important issue. I thank him.                          ____________________
