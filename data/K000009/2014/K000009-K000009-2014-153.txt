 Trying to hold their families together, they go try to get a job, and 1,000 people show up for one job. What are they supposed to do? They have lost footing. They haven't been able to make their mortgage payments. They can't send their kids to college. Many of them get sick. They lose their health benefits. It is not so easy getting a job in today's America.  You have been such a leader not just on unemployment benefit extensions, but also on job creation. Since we are commemorating the second anniversary of the passage of the U.S.-Korean so-called ``free-trade agreement,'' I thought I would bring a startling chart to the floor to show why we have unemployment in this country.  One of the aspects of the U.S.-Korean so-called ``free-trade agreement,'' passed 2 years ago without my support, was that we were supposed to increase exports and decrease imports.  It was supposed to actually be good for America. We were supposed to create more jobs here at home when, in fact, we have actually lost 40,000 jobs when they told us we were going to gain 70,000 jobs as a result of that agreement. Those people who were supposed to have those jobs fell on unemployment benefits, large numbers of them.  Here is a chart that shows what has happened. This gives you a sense of how big the difference is.  All right. The idea is we are supposed to export cars from here to Korea. Well, guess what, folks? This is how much we export; and this is how much they export to us, so we have fallen so deeply in the red.  What happens is, with every $1 billion of trade deficit, you get another 4,000 people out of work. Factories shut down. Suppliers shut down. The math is very simple. You just need to understand it.  Now, you know, if you look at the individuals who stand in those unemployment lines, they were told that we were supposed to sell thousands and thousands of vehicles to Korea.  Well, I will tell you what: we have sold 3,400 more vehicles in that country--3,400.  Guess how much--since the trade agreement was signed with Korea, how many more they have sold to us. 125,000. 125,000.  Now, according to my math, they have sold to us 121,600 more cars than we have sold them. That means unemployment in Wisconsin. It means unemployment in Ohio. It means unemployment across this country. It means unemployment in the steel industry, unemployment in the machine tool industry. You can tick it off.  Now, they tell us agriculture was supposed to save us. Right? We have positive trade accounts in agriculture, and we are supposed to increase our exports to Korea. Guess what has happened. They are off by 41 percent--not just 4 percent, but 41 percent.  Our exports of poultry have fallen since this agreement was signed by 39 percent. Pork exports are down 34 percent. Beef exports are down to Korea 6 percent. U.S. meat producers have lost a combined total of $442 million in poultry, beef, and pork exports to Korea in the first 22 months of the agreement. That means more than $20 million lost every month.  So, Congressman Pocan, I am sure you have seen the impacts of this in Wisconsin. We have certainly seen it in Ohio, and we see these big trainloads coming through on rail of all these cars that they bring in here from the west coast that come from points over the Pacific or the Atlantic coming in to our country.  If you go to those countries and you look around on the streets, they not only don't buy U.S. cars; they don't buy cars from anyplace else but themselves.                              {time}  1900  So part of what we are doing with unemployment benefits is we are trying to make up for failures in our trade policy that have turned people away, away from the world of work and trying to struggle to make ends meet.  I will insert into the Record tonight a special report done by Public Citizen regarding the impacts of the U.S.-Korean so-called free trade agreement, and if this is the same template that the administration intends to use for bringing trade promotion authority in the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement up here, don't even start. Don't even start, because we have to reduce this and increase this, and until an agreement does that, we are not going to create more jobs in this country.  I will show you something. This is the big hole we are digging out of. We hear a lot about the budget deficit. Well, why do we have a budget deficit? We have a budget deficit because we have a trade deficit. We have had it now for one-quarter century, and every time we get into another one of those trade deals that are lopsided, what happens? We go deeper, deeper, and deeper into trade deficit. More and more companies close down; more and more people lose their work; and then we have to subsidize the differential between imports and exports through unemployment benefits.  We are trying to keep the hold, but we are not addressing this problem. This is after China PNTR. They told us: Oh, that will be so great; we are going to sell all this stuff to China. We fell deeper into deficit.  CAFTA--then they told us: Oh, Latin America, that will make it better. This is after Korea. It went down again.  What are we doing to America? We are ceding away our sovereignty in industry after industry. They have always said that electronics are going to save us. Those big, bad auto States? We are going to do better. Well, guess what? We have now fallen into deficit in advanced electronics. We are not even succeeding in exporting those. The people of this country have to pay attention because the heart and soul is being chipped away piece by piece. Try to find something made in this country--coats? shoes? cars? Some.  What we have is state economies like China competing against merchant economies like our own. And the auto industry got in such shape that it took the Government of the United States to prop it up and save it. We were faced with: Will the United States have an automobile industry or not? That is going to happen in other sectors. That is going to happen in steel, and that is going to happen in shoes. They didn't even fight. But if you look at every sector, unemployment, unemployment, unemployment--appliances, unemployment.  You can see it by census statistics. No matter what community you go to, we have had these lost jobs; and you look over 10 years, 2000 to 2010, poverty quadruples. Don't tell me those people don't want to work. They had jobs. The jobs disappeared.  You can go to these sweatshop countries and you can go find the production. Guess what? You can find TRICO now in Mexico. They used to make windshield wipers in Buffalo, New York. It was a major employer. The man who founded the company had a decent soul. He had a huge foundation that helped that community. It still does to this day. But all those jobs have moved down south of the border. No decent wage, no benefits, nothing. No corporate conscience at all.  That is happening from one end of this country to the other. America has a rude awakening ahead of her. It goes through Democratic and Republican administrations, and the American people know it. They know that it doesn't change here. Unemployment benefits are the least we can do for the American people--the people who went to work, they believed in making a good product, and now they have fallen onto hard times. Don't tell me it is all their fault.  I have done job fairs in my district. Thousands of people show up. There aren't enough jobs for everyone that wants to work. I would invite any President, any former President.  I would like to invite George Bush II to travel with me, because he came to my district. I would like to take him and show him where in Mexico these jobs have gone. Come with me to Guangdong province in China. I will show you where our jobs have gone. I will take you to Honduras. Then, do you know what? I am going to make everybody who comes with me work like those women work, and then you tell me why we face an unemployment benefit crisis in this country and what kind of a society we have here.  Those are earned benefits. Those belong to the people who have devoted their lives to going to work, earning a living, and trying to get ahead in an honorable way and in an honest way, and they deserve them.  So I want to thank you, Congressman Pocan, for giving me time this evening.  Mr. Speaker, I place this article from Public Citizen in the Record that summarizes everything that has gone haywire with the U.S.-Korean so-called free trade agreement.On Second Anniversary of U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement, U.S. Exports Down 11 Percent, Imports From Korea Up and Deficit With Korea Balloons   47 Percent--Fueling Congressional Skepticism About Obama TPP Export                                 Promises Export Decline Hits U.S. Farmers and Auto Workers Particularly Hard, Dismal Outcomes of Pact-Used as TPP Template Will Bolster Opposition to                    Obama Bid for Fast Track Authority       Washington, DC.--Two years after the implementation of the      U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement (FTA), government data reveal      that the Obama administration's promises that the pact would      expand U.S. exports and create U.S. jobs are exactly opposite      of the actual outcomes: a downfall in U.S. exports to Korea,      rising imports and a surge in the U.S. trade deficit with      Korea. Using the administration's export-to-job ratio, the      estimated drop in net U.S. exports to Korea in the FTA's      first two years represents the loss of more than 46,600 U.S.      jobs.       The damaging Korea FTA record, detailed in a new Public      Citizen report, undermines the administration's attempt to      use the same failed export growth promises to sell an already      skeptical Congress on Fast Track authority for the Trans-     Pacific Partnership (TPP), a sweeping deal for which the      Korea FTA was the template.       Contrary to the administration's promise that the Korea FTA      would mean ``more exports, more jobs'':       U.S. goods exports to Korea have fallen below the pre-FTA      average monthly level for 21 out of 22 months since the deal      took effect.       The United States has lost an average of $385 million each      month in exports to Korea, given an 11 percent decline in the      average monthly export level in comparison to the year before      the deal.       The United States lost an estimated, cumulative $9.2      billion in exports to Korea under the FTA's first two years,      compared with the exports that would have been achieved at      the pre-FTA level.       Average monthly exports of U.S. agricultural products to      Korea have fallen 41 percent.       The average monthly U.S. automotive trade deficit with      Korea has grown 19 percent.       The U.S. exports downfall is particularly concerning given      that Korea's overall imports from all countries increased by      2 percent over the past two years (from 2011 to 2013).       The average monthly trade deficit with Korea has ballooned      47 percent in comparison to the year before the deal. As U.S.      exports to Korea have declined under the FTA, average monthly      imports from Korea have risen four percent. The total U.S.      trade deficit with Korea under the FTA's just-completed      second year is projected to be $8.6 billion higher than in      the year before the deal, assuming that trends during the      FTA's first 22 months continue for the remaining two months      for which data is not yet available.       Meanwhile, U.S. services exports to Korea have slowed under      the FTA. While U.S. services exports to Korea increased at an      average quarterly rate of 3.0 percent in the year before the      FTA took effect, the average quarterly growth rate has fallen      to 2.3 percent since the deal's enactment--a 24 percent drop.       ``Most Americans won't be surprised that another NAFTA-     style deal is causing damage, but it's stunning that the      administration thinks the public and Congress won't notice if      it recycles the promises used to sell the Korea pact--now      proven empty--to push a Trans-Pacific deal that is literally      based on the Korea FTA text,'' said Lori Wallach, director of      Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch. ``The new evidence of      the Korea FTA's damaging record is certain to make it even      more difficult for the Obama administration to get Congress      to delegate its constitutional trade authority via Fast Track      for the TPP.''       The decline in U.S. exports under the Korea FTA contributed      to an overall zero percent growth in U.S. exports in 2013,      rendering virtually impossible Obama's stated goal to double      exports by the end of 2014. At the export growth rate seen      over the past two years, the export-doubling goal would not      be reached until 2054. While the Korea pact is the only U.S.      FTA that has led to an actual decline in U.S exports, the      overall growth of U.S. exports to nations that are not FTA      partners has exceeded combined U.S. export growth to U.S. FTA      partners by 30 percent over the past decade.       ``The data simply do not support the Obama administration's      tired pitch that more FTAs will bring more exports,'' said      Wallach. ``Faced with falling exports and rising, job-     displacing deficits under existing FTAs, the administration      needs to find a new model, not to repackage an old one that      patently failed.''       The Korea FTA has produced very few winners; since the FTA      took effect, U.S. average monthly exports to Korea have      fallen in 11 of the 15 sectors that export the most to Korea,      relative to the year before the FTA. And while losing sectors      have faced relatively steep export declines (e.g. a 12      percent drop in computer and electronics exports, a 30      percent drop in mineral and ore exports), none of the winning      sectors has experienced an average monthly export increase of      greater than two percent. Ironically, many sectors that the      administration promised would be the biggest beneficiaries of      the Korea FTA have been some of the deal's largest losers.       AGRICULTURE: While the administration argued for passage of      the FTA in 2011 by claiming, ``The U.S.-Korea trade agreement      creates new opportunities for U.S. farmers, ranchers and food      processors seeking to export to Korea's 49 million      consumers,'' average monthly exports of U.S. agricultural      products to Korea have fallen 41 percent under the FTA.       U.S. average monthly poultry exports to Korea have fallen      39 percent.       U.S. average monthly pork exports to Korea have fallen 34      percent.       U.S. average monthly beef exports to Korea have fallen 6      percent.       Compared with the exports that would have been achieved at      the pre-FTA average monthly level, U.S. meat producers have      lost a combined $442 million in poultry, pork and beef      exports to Korea in the first 22 months of the Korea deal--a      loss of more than $20 million in meat exports every month.       AUTOS AND AUTO PARTS: The administration also promised the      Korea FTA would bring ``more job-creating export      opportunities in a more open and fair Korean market for      America's auto companies and auto workers,'' while a special      safeguard would ``ensure . . . that the American industry      does not suffer from harmful surges in Korean auto imports      due to this agreement.'' The U.S. average monthly automotive      exports to Korea under the FTA have been $12 million higher      than the pre-FTA monthly average, but the average monthly      automotive imports from Korea have soared by $263 million      under the deal--a 19 percent increase. So while U.S. auto      exports have risen very modestly under the FTA, those tiny      gains have been swamped by a surge in auto imports from Korea      that the administration promised would not occur under the      FTA.       In January 2014, monthly auto imports from Korea topped $2      billion for the first time on record.       About 125,000 more Korean-produced Hyundais and Kias were      imported and sold in the United States in 2013 (after the      FTA) than in 2011 (before the FTA).       Sales of U.S.-produced Fords, Chryslers and Cadillacs in      Korea increased by just 3,400 vehicles.       The post-FTA flood of automotive imports has provoked a 19      percent increase in the average monthly U.S. auto trade      deficit with Korea. The Obama administration has sought to      distract from this dismal result by touting the percentage      increase in U.S. auto sales to Korea. This allows the sale of      a small number of cars beyond the small pre-FTA base of sales      to appear to be a significant gain when in fact it is not.
