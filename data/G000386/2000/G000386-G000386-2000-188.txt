 President, it is my distinct pleasure to pay tribute to John C. Gardner, an exceptionally dedicated public servant. Mr. Gardner is retiring after ten years of service as the President of the Quad City Development Group, a public/private not-for-profit corporation. This organization promotes economic growth in and around the cities of Davenport and Bettendorf, Iowa, and Moline and Rock Island, Illinois. The Development Group markets these communities as locations for companies seeking to expand or relocate. It also works with Quad City communities to improve their climate for job creation.  Under his leadership, the Quad City Development Group has been the driving force behind the retention and addition of more than 14,000 jobs and the investment of over $1 billion in the Quad Cities area. John's leadership style, which was developed and honed in the private sector, was ideal for his position as the President of this vital community and business-based group.  I would like to take a moment to highlight John's career. Immediately before joining the Quad City Development Group, John was the director of economic development for Lee Enterprises, Inc., the owner of the Quad City Times and the Southern Illinoisan newspapers. Before that assignment, John was publisher of the Quad City Times for five years. He learned the newspaper business in a 23-year career as a reporter, editor and eventually publisher of The Southern Illinoisan newspaper in Carbondale, Illinois. He is active in a number of professional and community organizations, and has been involved in various statewide projects in both Iowa and Illinois. He is a member of the Iowa Group for Economic Development and was chairman of the Iowa Future project, a statewide strategic planning effort.  It gives me great pleasure to present the credentials of John C. Gardner to the Senate today. It is clear that the Iowa and Illinois communities he has served so well are losing a great talent. They will miss his leadership, his winning smile, and his personal and professional dedication. I would like to wish both John and his wife, Ann, the best in their retirement and continued success in all their future endeavors.                          ____________________
