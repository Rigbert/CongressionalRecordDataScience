Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of the Hungarian freedom fighters who rose up against the communist tyranny that was imposed on their country after World War II. Many men and women died in that uprising--a courageous fight against incredible odds, as the Soviets sent in tanks to restore the puppet regime they installed in 1948.  Mr. Speaker, as Chairman or Co-Chairman of the Helsinki Commission I have been on human rights missions to Hungary many times over the years. One of the things that most impresses me about this country is the deeply admirable patriotism of so many Hungarians. By patriotism I mean something very different from nationalism--whereas nationalists resent and are aggressive toward other countries, patriots love and defend their own country and its best traditions, and allow--invite--other people to love their own countries and traditions.  This summer I visited Hungary on a congressional delegation ably led by my colleague on the Helsinki Commission, Senator Roger Wicker. We met with Prime Minister Orban and others, and it is in connection with this anniversary and our meeting with Prime Minister that I'd like to place into the record a recent interview Prime Minister Orban gave to the Telegraph.  I commend this to my colleagues as the words of a Prime Minister who thinks seriously and speaks frankly about issues facing his country and Europe as a whole.   Viktor Orban Interview: ``Patriotism Is a Good Thing''--The Prime Minister of Hungary, Viktor Orban, Tells the Telegraph Why His Country  Agrees With Britain in Its Campaign Against the ``Creeping'' Power of                                 Brussels                           (By Charles Moore)                              15 Oct 2013       Viktor Orban has just had a good meeting with David      Cameron. It was easier than his first with Margaret Thatcher      (in 2001). ``I am not satisfied with you,'' were, he recalls,      her first words. She was angry that Hungary was not doing      more to help protect Nato's soldiers from Serb aggression.       Despite this rebuff, Mr Orban is a Thatcher admirer. His      political career began in 1988 when he was one of 37 young      students and intellectuals founding a party to attack      Communist rule in his country.       ``Her role was very important: she was always in favour of      freedom, always anti-Communist. She said, `There is no such      thing as society.' I like that remark very much because in      European politics people were always talking in artificial      sociological language. Social engineering was very popular.''       When he attended Lady Thatcher's funeral in April, he was      pleased that the Bishop of London explained what she really      meant by those famous words. ``The funeral was very moving      and very British--not tragical, as it would be on the      Continent--more of a tribute.''       Young Viktor, a clever boy from a country background, won a      George Soros scholarship to Oxford to study civic society as      seen by liberal political philosophers such as John Locke. He      loved the ``electrifying dance'' of ideas there; but this was      the autumn of 1989 and the Berlin Wall was coming down. Here      was the chance actually to build a liberal civic society at      home. ``I said to myself, `Viktor, what are you doing here?'      and I took the occasion of our first free elections in March      1990 to go back.''       He became prime minister for the first time in 1998, until      2002, and then, after wilderness years, returned to power      with a landslide in 2010. His time in office has been      controversial. He has been accused, often by European Union      officials, of too much nationalism, of suppressing media      freedom, politicising the judiciary and the central bank, and      even of stirring up ethnic tensions. Has the great liberal      freedom-fighter narrowed? Is there a risk that he could      become an authoritarian strongman, the Vladimir Putin of his      country?       ``The risk is there,'' Mr Orban rather surprisingly admits,      though it is much smaller if Hungary is economically      successful. He thinks that circumstances have changed.      [Update: The office of the Prime Minister of Hungary has      asked the Telegraph to clarify the reference to Vladimir      Putin in this interview. Mr Orbin intended to assent to there      being a risk that he could come to seem like a Putin of      Hungary, not actually to become one.]       For 200 years, the ``No. 1 motivation'' for Hungarians was      to catch up with more competitive Westerners. Until the      credit crisis, Mr Orban believed that this could only be      achieved by the ``ever-closer union'' of Europe. Now he has      his doubts.       The crisis shows that it is not obvious that the EU can do      better than independent nations. Unlike the British, he      cannot rule out joining the eurozone, because of its      centripetal pull for a small country like his, ``but I don't      urge it. To stand alone on your own feet is more important      than ever.'' Hungary certainly should not join until it      reaches 90 per cent of the GDP of those already in, he      believes; right now it is in the low sixties.       ``As I get older [he is still only 50], I tend to be more      sceptical. Values are more important than money. National      sovereignty is more and more important in my mind. The      question `Who is governing us?' is the key question.''       So he supports David Cameron's efforts to change the      European rules: ``We shall need a new basic treaty      eventually.'' He wants to join Britain in resisting ``the      creeping movement of Brussels to eat up national      sovereignty''.       The old answer that everything Westerners did was better is      now ``stupid''. In the 1980s, the question Hungarians faced      was ``how to get rid of things''--Communism, state      oppression, overregulation. Now that should stop. There are      things which should be upheld in the interests of      civilisation, not jettisoned: ``It would be a sad story to      get rid of religious belief, national identity, family and      even sexual identity. That's not freedom.''       In some schools on the continent, the idea has got about      that ``children should not be brought up as girls or guys'',      but to choose their sexual identity later. ``Sometimes there      is a separate changing room for those who don't know who they      are,'' he exclaims.       What does he say to accusations that he is stirring up old      ethnic, territorial passions in the region? Some blame him      for the rise of the fascistic Jobbik party in Hungary. His      answer is based on his belief that ``Xenophobia is dangerous;      but patriotism is a good thing''. Ethnic disputes, often      about land, are ``a part of life in Eastern Europe'', he      says.       ``How do we live with this?'' he asks, ``The solution is      not to lie.'' Radicals of both left and right get about 15      per cent of the vote between them. That is too high for      comfort, but ``far away from being a majority''.       At the heart of the problem in Europe, Mr Orban believes,      is the fact that the Communists were never fully defeated.      Communism as an ideology ``has no message for our future'',      but, unlike Nazism, it prevailed for so long (40 years in      Hungary's case) that its leaders, who ``were not stupid      guys'' created a culture which maintained their power. They      upheld envy ``as a perception of life'', making people      ``disagree with the world as it is and try to destroy it''.       They also inculcated a belief in ``entitlements without any      personal effort''. In Hungary, Communism brought about what      he calls ``a learned helplessness'', a deliberate destruction      of personal responsibility, which crushed the middle class.       We discuss the row here about Ed Miliband and his Marxist      father. Without commenting on the Labour situation, Mr Orban      says that there is a family tree passing from Communism      through ``the `68 generation'' (such as the former      revolutionary, now MEP, Daniel Cohn Bendit) to Brussels      bureaucrats and the media today.       ``The Communist heritage has a marriage with the radical      liberals today. That genealogy exists in Europe.'' He detects      it in the doctrine of European human rights and the attempts      by the European Commission to impose cultural and      constitutional uniformity on member states.       For conservatives, he goes on, this is difficult, because      ``we find we must argue, and conservatives generally prefer      just to live. We are shy to invest the energy, but we must do      so at a European level.''       Personally, Vilctor Orban is not shy. He is up for the      fight. ``Boxing is a noble sport,'' he declares pugnaciously.      In the West, politics is often ``just a career''. For him, he      says, it is much more. He remembers the hard times in the      late 1980s when Fidesz, his then tiny party, was opposed by      the Soviets, by trade unions, militias and the state      apparatus. ``We were surrounded, and we won. Compare the risk      now--it's nothing. It's just a peanut.''                          ____________________
