 President, on May 1-3, 2004, more than a 1,000 students from across the United States will converge on Washington, DC to compete in the national finals of the We the People: The Citizen and the Constitution program. Administered by the Center for Civic Education, the We the People program has a primary goal of promoting civic competence and responsibility among our Nation's elementary and secondary school students. It is the most extensive educational program in the country designed to educate young students about the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, and since its inception in 1987, more than 26 million students and 86,000 educators have participated.  I am very proud to announce that Amador Valley High School in Pleasanton will represent the State of California in this year's We the People national final. Four years ago I had the honor of recognizing Amador Valley for winning California's contest, and am proud to be able to do so again today. On February 6, this year's class from Amador Valley placed first in California's statewide contest. The school has a rich tradition of excelling in this program, having won California's competition five times from 1992-2000, and even winning the national championship in 1995.  During the national final, the class from Amador Valley will again have to testify as experts before a panel of judges on a wide variety of historical and contemporary constitutional issues. They will also be quizzed by the judges in an effort to illustrate depth of constitutional understanding, and ability to apply that knowledge. The competition is designed to resemble what hearings would be like in the U.S. Congress.  I congratulate the civics class at Amador Valley High School for winning this year's California We the People competition, and wish them best of luck as they conduct research and prepare for the national finals.                          ____________________
