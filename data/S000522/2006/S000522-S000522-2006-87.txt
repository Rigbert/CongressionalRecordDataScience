Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 338) expressing the sense of Congress regarding the activities of Islamist terrorist organizations in the Western Hemisphere.  The Clerk read as follows:                            H. Con. Res. 338       Whereas the brutal attacks of September 11, 2001,      demonstrated that terrorists can strike anywhere in the      world;       Whereas terrorist activity that goes unaddressed is an      invitation for terrorist organizations to carry out attacks      against the United States, our allies and interests;       Whereas the Department of State has concluded in its most      recent Country Reports on Terrorism, which was released in      April 2005, that although the threat of international      terrorism in the Western Hemisphere remains relatively low as      compared to other world regions, international terrorists may      seek safe-haven, financing, recruiting, illegal travel      documentation, or access to the United States from Latin      American and Caribbean countries and thus pose serious      threats;       Whereas in recent years, the activities of Islamist      terrorist organizations in the Western Hemisphere have      focused on financing their criminal and terrorist activities      outside of the region rather than carrying out or directly      supporting terrorist attacks in the Western Hemisphere;       Whereas, as the 1992 bombing of the Israeli Embassy in      Argentina and the 1994 bombing     of the AMIA Jewish Community Center in Argentina clearly      showed, international terrorist organizations, such as      Hezbollah, are ready, willing, and able to carry out attacks      in the Western Hemisphere;       Whereas since at least the AMIA bombing in 1994, Hezbollah      has maintained networks in the tri-border area of Paraguay,      Brazil, and Argentina--primarily focusing on fundraising and      recruitment;       Whereas in May 2003, a relative of Assad Ahmad Barakat, the      reputed head of Hezbollah in the tri-border area, was      arrested at the airport in Asuncion, Paraguay, in what      Paraguayan police believe was a scheme to sell drugs in      Syria, with proceeds reaching Hezbollah forces in Lebanon;       Whereas Barakat, a Lebanese-born Paraguayan, is himself in      custody in Brazil awaiting extradition to Paraguay after      raids on his businesses in Paraguay's tri-border area found      evidence that he transferred tens of millions of United      States dollars to Hezbollah in Lebanon;       Whereas there have been media reports of Hezbollah      sympathizers and financiers also conducting black market      activities in Iquique, Chile; Maicao, Colombia; Margarita      Island, Venezuela; and Colon, Panama;       Whereas the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas has also been      known to raise funds in the tri-border area;       Whereas in a 2002 court case, one of two Lebanese men were      convicted of financing Hezbollah with $2,000,000 in illegal      cigarette sales in the United States;       Whereas earlier this past year, a Lebanese individual from      Detroit was charged with supporting Hezbollah financially and      was described by the United States Attorney in the case as a      ``fighter, recruiter, and fundraiser'';       Whereas several members of the Egyptian Islamic Group have      been arrested in Brazil, Uruguay, and Colombia since 1998;       Whereas Ashref Ahmed Abdallah, an Egyptian national who is      one of the most significant human smuggling targets, was      arrested by United States authorities at Miami International      Airport in July 2004 for using Central America and Brazil as      a staging ground for smuggling illegal aliens from countries      of the Middle East, including special interest countries that      are linked to international terrorism, into the United      States;       Whereas the activities of sympathizers and financiers of      Islamist terrorist organizations in the Western Hemisphere      represent a potential threat to the United States, our allies      and interests;       Whereas section 7102 of the Intelligence Reform and      Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (Public Law 108-458; 22      U.S.C. 2656f note) amends United States law to identify and      address emerging and current terrorist sanctuaries and secure      international cooperation to combat this threat;       Whereas many countries of the Western Hemisphere have      cooperated with the United States and regional organizations      to counter the threat of regional and international      terrorism, including by participating in joint      counterterrorism training and simulations, Counterterrorism      Action Group (CTAG) meetings which are hosted by United      States embassies, and the Inter-American Committee Against      Terrorism (CICTE) of the Organization of American States      (OAS); and       Whereas despite these efforts, many factors within the      Western Hemisphere contribute to creating an environment      which is conducive for future activities by international      terrorist organizations: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate      concurring), That Congress--       (1) recognizes the potential threat that sympathizers and      financiers of Islamist terrorist organizations that operate      in the Western Hemisphere pose to the United States, our      allies and interests;       (2) acknowledges the commitment and cooperation of some      governments of countries of the Western Hemisphere to deny      the use of their territory to Islamist terrorist      organizations and calls on all governments to intensify their      efforts; and       (3) encourages the President to direct the United States      Representative to the Organization of American States (OAS)      to--       (A) seek support from OAS member countries for the creation      of a special task force of the Inter-American Committee      Against Terrorism (CICTE) to assist governments in the region      in investigating and combatting the proliferation of Islamist      terrorist organizations in the Western Hemisphere and to      coordinate regional efforts to prevent the spread of this      threat; and       (B) urge OAS member countries to designate Hezbollah,      Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, al-Qaeda and its      constituent entities, and other such groups as terrorist      organizations if they have not already done so.
