HATCH. The DEA need not find that DHEA meets each of the eight factors before it can be scheduled. For example, if DEA considers that DHEAhas no or minimal psychic or physiological dependence liability, DEA may nonetheless schedule DHEA if DEA concludes, after consideration of the facts and relative importance of other of the factors such as the actual or relative potential for abuse; the history and current pattern of abuse; or the scope, duration, and significance of abuse, that it should be scheduled. Karen P. Tandy, the administrator of the DEA, has written me a letter stating that the presence of each of the eight factors is not a mandatory prerequisite to scheduling. I ask unanimous consent that the letter dated May 20, 2004, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                       U.S. Department of Justice,                              Drug Enforcement Administration,                                     Washington, DC, May 20, 2004.     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to respond to questions      your staff posed regarding consideration of certain statutory      factors incident to scheduling substances under the      Controlled Substances Act.       The relevant statutory provision, 21 U.S.C. Sec. 811(c),      requires consideration of eight specific factors as one of      the prerequisites to whether a substance should be scheduled.      The presence of each individual factor or specific findings      with respect to each individual factor are not a mandatory      prerequisite to scheduling. These statutory factors are: (1)      The drug's actual or relative potential for abuse; (2)      Scientific evidence of the drug's pharmacological effects;      (3) The state of current scientific knowledge regarding the      subject; (4) Its history and current pattern of abuse; (5)      The scope, duration, and significance of abuse; (6) What, if      any, risk there is to the public health; (7) The drug's      psychic or physiological dependence liability and; (8)      Whether a substance is an immediate precursor of a substance      already controlled.       You should be aware that evaluation of these eight factors      is not solely determinative and is part of a more extensive      scheduling process. The entire process for scheduling      substances to which these eight factors apply includes:      consideration of additional statutory criteria relevant to      each specific schedule [21 U.S.C. Sec. 811(b)]; an evaluation      and recommendation by the Secretary of Health and Human      Services; and then a formal rulemaking.       I appreciate the opportunity to clarify this matter, and      please let me know if I may answer any further questions.           Sincerely,                                                   Karen P. Tandy,                                                    Administrator.
