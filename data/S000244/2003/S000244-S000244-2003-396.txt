Chairman, I believe this amendment is a very necessary amendment, if I could just take a minute to explain why.  In 1993, the National Child Protection Act was passed to provide a process for background checks for volunteers. It did not get up and running.  Additional legislation to improve the process was enacted through the Volunteers for Children Act of 1998. It still is not up and running.  What the gentleman from Texas is proposing is to tell the Justice Department that they have 120 days to tell us why these programs are not up and running, what is needed to fix them, and to get on with the background check system so that those who do volunteer to work not only with children, but also the disabled and the elderly, can be checked out to see if altruism is not their sole motivation for working with these groups of people.  I think that this is a very good amendment, and I hope that it would be adopted.
