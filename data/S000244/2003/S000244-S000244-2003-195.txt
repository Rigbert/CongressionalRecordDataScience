Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute.  Mr. Chairman, I would be happy to invite the gentleman from Michigan to my district, or I would be happy to go to Detroit, and have him explain to my constituents or me explain to his constituents why giving a consumer a coupon for 75 cents or $1 off a product that was manufactured by the company that injured that consumer and had a judgment entered against them, while giving a lawyer hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars' worth of legal fees, or having the lawyer send a deficiency bill to every member of the class, this bill takes care of this, is correct, and how it puts consumers in charge rather than lawyers.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia, Mr. Goodlatte.
