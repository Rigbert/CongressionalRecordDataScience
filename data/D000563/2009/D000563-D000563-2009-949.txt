And for 7 long years, only three individuals were convicted by military commissions at Guantanamo, and two of them have been released. So to argue that the Guantanamo model is one that ought to be protected and maintained, notwithstanding all of the danger it creates for our servicemen overseas to keep Guantanamo open, is to argue for a plan under the Bush administration that failed to convict terrorists, failed with military tribunals and through the courts of this land.  I have to say that as I listen to the argument of the Senator from Kentucky, it is an argument based on fear--fear--fear that if we try someone in a court in America, while they are incarcerated during trial, we need to be afraid. There was no fear in New York for more than 2 years while Ramzi Yousef was held in preparation for trial and during trial because he was held in a secure facility.  Today we are told by the Department of Justice that there are 355 convicted terrorists in American prisons. I ask the Senator from Kentucky, does he believe we should remove them from our prisons, those already convicted, currently serving, such as Ramzi Yousef?  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Illinois, maybe we found an area of agreement. He is critical of the Bush administration for not conducting military tribunals more rapidly. I agree with him. I think they should have been tried more rapidly. But thatis the place to try them, right down there in Guantanamo.  If my friend is suggesting it is a good idea to bring these terrorists into the United States and, if convicted, put them in U.S. facilities, the supermax facility has basically no room. There may be one bed. As far as I know, there is no room at supermax.  Not only do we have, if we bring them into the United States--I don't know why I am smiling. This is not a laughing matter. Say what you will about the previous administration, but we were not attacked again after 9/11.
