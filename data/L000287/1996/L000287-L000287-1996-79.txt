Mr. Speaker, the Republicans in this House just do not get it. The American people want an increase in the minimum wage. They know, Mr. Speaker, even if you do not, that raising the minimum wage is the right thing to do.  This is not just an economic issue, this is a moral issue. Mr. Speaker, you have the capacity, you have the ability, to bring a clean minimum wage bill to this floor. Do not fight, Mr. Speaker, what is right; do not fight what is right.  On this issue there is a national bipartisan consensus. Let us do what the American people want us to do. Let us do what is right. Let us raise the minimum wage. Struggling, hardworking people deserve the right to earn a livable income. Raise the minimum wage. Raise it now.                          ____________________
