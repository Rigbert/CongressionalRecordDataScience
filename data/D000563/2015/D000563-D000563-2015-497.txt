 I can't think of a precedent where we have had one political party in the Senate try to intervene in international negotiations.  In this situation, if these negotiations fail, it is pretty clear to me that one of the options on the horizon will be military action against Iran. I pray to goodness that we never reach that point.  But I wish to ask the Senator from Nevada, those who are so anxious to scuttle these negotiations, to undermine these negotiations, do you think they have reflected on the fact that the alternative could be another war in the Middle East?
