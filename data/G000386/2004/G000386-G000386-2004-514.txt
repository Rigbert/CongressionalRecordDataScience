 President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate resumes consideration of the pension rate bill tomorrow, there be 30 minutes of debate equally divided between the chairman and ranking member or their designees, with an additional 10 minutes under the control of Senator Kyl. I further ask consent that following the use or yielding back of the time, the Senate proceed to a vote in relationship to the Kyl amendment No. 2236; provided further, that following the disposition of the Kyl amendment, the Senate then proceed to a vote on the adoption of the Grassley amendment No. 2233, with no intervening action or debate. Finally, I ask consent that following the disposition of that amendment, the bill be read a third time and the Senate proceed to a vote on passage of the bill, again, with no intervening action or debate.
