 BENNETT. The Senator from Kentucky is correct. That is exactly the position I have taken.  In the interest of full disclosure of motive, I know there is some conversation on this floor about raising the limits for hard dollar solicitations. I am solidly and strongly in favor of raising the limits on hard dollar solicitations. I recognize if this loophole for soft dollars--as I have pointed out--is, in fact, closed it will increase the pressure when we get to the appropriate amendment to raise the hard dollar limit because it will shut off one significant source of soft dollar contributions that is currently in the bill.  I don't want to fly under any false pretense. I am hoping that by the passage of my amendment we will not only achieve the intellectual consistency I have been discussing with the Senator from Kentucky, but, quite frankly, it would create some political pressure to raise the hard dollar limitsbecause I think raising the hard dollar limits is a salutatory thing to do.  So let there be no mistake that that agenda is in my mind as I offer this amendment. But nonetheless, I think the amendment has an intellectual sustaining consistency to it because it takes the position that if, as McCain-Feingold says, soft money is inherently corrupting, or gives the appearance of corruption, this is a form of soft money that is even more the appearance of corruption because under McCain-Feingold it is, A, allowed and, B, not disclosed.  Mr. McCONNELL. Then as a practical matter, just sort of putting it another way, the treasury funds of unions and corporations cannot be used to underwrite fundraising or administrative costs in political action committees?
