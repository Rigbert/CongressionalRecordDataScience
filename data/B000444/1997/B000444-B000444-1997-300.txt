 President, the forthcoming reversion of Hong Kong to Chinese control is, as a matter of diplomacy, the mere implementation of a diplomatic agreement between the United Kingdom and the government of the People's Republic of China.  But it is, of course, far more complicated, and its implications far more profound. The challenges ahead are many. Will Beijing abide by the rule of law and uphold its commitment to the United Kingdom and the people of Hong Kong to ``one country, two systems?'' Will America and the major powers have the political will to challenge China should they renege on their commitments?  Nowhere are the challenges of reversion greater than for United States law enforcement--for Hong Kong has long been a center of the international criminal organizations which control the trade in Asian heroin, money laundering is on the rise, and there are a host of other law enforcement problems.  Here in the United States, we see the related problems of Asian organized crime, or Tongs, heroin trafficking from Asia through Hong Kong, alien smuggling, arms trafficking, and theuse of Hong Kong as a money laundering center for criminals. Unfortunately, the capacity of U.S. law enforcement to respond to this threat is limited by the fact that we simply do not have enough agents with the language skills, intelligence background and contacts to infiltrate Asian organized crime.  This is why I am introducing today the Royal Hong Kong Police Anticrime Strategy Act of 1997. I am pleased to be joined in doing so by Senator Grassley, my colleague on the Senate International Caucus on Narcotics Control.  This legislation seeks to take advantage of a potential opportunity--even in the face of all the challenges which will come with the reversion of Hong Kong. To describe in simplest terms the opportunity--as officers of the Royal Hong Kong Police leave their force, U.S. law enforcement agencies may be able to bolster our anti-drug, money laundering, alien smuggling and Asian organized crime capabilities with the unique knowledge of the former officers of the Royal Hong Kong Police.  For example, it could be of significant value to federal law enforcement to simply retain on a one-time or continuing basis former Royal Hong Kong Police personnel to use them to help build a major Asian-Crime investigative database. Such a database could form the backbone of U.S. investigations in the years to come. I offer this simply as a means to illustrate to my Senate colleagues the potential law enforcement benefits of this legislation. Of course, the best uses must be decided by the law enforcement professionals within the Justice and Treasury Departments.  I also point out that I have long worked on this issue--beginning with a hearing with the FBI on the issue of Asian organized crime way back in August, 1990. My January 1992 drug strategy also called on the Bush Administration to determine if these police officers could be of assistance. In fact, a DEA operation began in 1992 which used some retired Royal Hong Kong Police in a very limited capacity to provide translation services to support investigations of Asian heroin trafficking.  I was also pleased to include a provision offered by Senator Roth in the 1994 Biden Crime Bill to study this issue--unfortunately, this provision was dropped from the final agreement due to opposition in the House.  But, today, with the continuing rise of the heroin trade, I am reiterating my call for us to address this issue. The legislation I offer today calls on the Attorney General and the Treasury Secretary to report to Congress on the need and potential benefits--as well as any potential security or administrative problems--of adding former officers of the Royal Hong Kong Police to our federal law enforcement agencies.  And, if the benefits exist, this legislation authorizes the addition of up to 200 former officers to assist in the investigation of international drug trafficking, alien smuggling, money laundering and organized crime undertaken by the Justice and Treasury Departments.  Mr. President, preparing for the reversion of Hong Kong primarily means preparing for the challenges ahead--but it also requires us to recognize the opportunities ahead. Taking advantage of this opportunity is what the ``Royal Hong Kong Police Anticrime Act of 1997'' is all about.  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the legislation appear in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 558       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
