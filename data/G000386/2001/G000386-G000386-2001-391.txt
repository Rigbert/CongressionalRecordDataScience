 SCHUMER. I would say it should be a lot more than four or five, to answer the Senator's question.  If you look at the reconciliation vote, it was four or five. That is not bipartisan in my judgment.  I respect each Senator's right to make their decision. They come from different States.  But what I am aghast at is the implication of my good friend from Iowa that anyone who offers an amendment to the grand creation that he has put together has either not thought it through or is derelict in their duty.  Just the opposite, good sir. I am doing my duty to the people of New York by doing what they think is right. I daresay if they were asked should the estate tax, only on estates of over $3 million, get a smaller reduction so the families who are making $100,000 and $80,000 and $120,000 and $50,000 and $60,000 can get a break on tuition, my guess is, good sir, that 90 percent of the people of New York--and I would guess, although I do not want to second-guess the Senator from Iowa--but my guess is the people from his State would support this amendment.
