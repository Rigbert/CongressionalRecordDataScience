Speaker, I am not sure that the definition of commercial fishing operation contained in section 1007 in the Senate bill is sufficiently tightly worded to prevent someone who uses a yacht for sport fishing and derives income therefrom from being able to protect the yacht under the bankruptcy code. That is what my concern is.  What I am suggesting to the gentlewoman from Wisconsin, my colleague, is that perhaps section 1007 should be looked at very closely to make sure we are not creating a loophole and that it not be treated as holy writ, not subject to any modification whatsoever.
