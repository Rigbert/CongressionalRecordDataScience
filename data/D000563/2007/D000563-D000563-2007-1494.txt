President, if there is no further business to come before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate stand in recess under the previous order.  There being no objection, the Senate, at 5:29 p.m., recessed until 8:30 p.m. and reassembled when called to order by the Presiding Officer (Mr. Brown).                          ____________________
