Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I urge the committee to defeat this amendment, just as it did last year when the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson-Lee) brought it up. The issue is very simple. We want elections. Her amendment wants lawsuits. The way she has phrased her amendment for the lawsuits is that anybody can sue, not just the Governor, to determine whether or not a vacancy actually exists. And also, there is an appeals process in the gentlewoman's amendment that would allow the appeals to be dragged out indefinitely.  When there is a catastrophe that wipes out a significant number of Members of the House, it is in the interest of the public to fill those vacancies as quickly as possible through a fair election. We should not allow anybody to tie up an election call in the courts forever and ever and ever simply because their candidate might not be in a proper position to win the election.  So let us have the people decide when these vacancies will be filled and who will fill them. Let us not allow endless litigation at a time of national catastrophe. Elections can bring people together. They will result in new Representatives coming with mandates rather than having the frustration of lawsuits that go on interminably.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
