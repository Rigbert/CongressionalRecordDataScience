So for all of those older people who scrimped and saved all of their lives--they didn't take that vacation; they tried to make sure they could educate their kids--Medicaid picks up the costs of two out of three nursing home beds in America. This legislation would produce a massive rollback of the Medicaid Program, and I believe so many older people are going to find long-term care unaffordable--millions.
