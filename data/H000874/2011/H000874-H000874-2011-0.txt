Speaker, reserving the right to object, and I will not object, I know that the American people are pleased that we have come together to agree on this extension to give certainty and peace of mind to the 160 million Americans who are concerned about losing their tax cut, the 48 million seniors who were concerned about their Medicare, and the 2.3 million people who are unemployed and seeking work who were fearful of losing their benefits.  I thank the Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Missouri, and I withdraw my reservation.
