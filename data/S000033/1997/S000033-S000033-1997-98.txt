 Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Regula] for the outstanding work that he has done on this budget. I applaud his efforts. We just disagree on this issue.  This is the bottom line. It is not complicated. You have heard it from conservatives and progressives, Democrats, Republicans and Independents. This is tripartitism. The issue is that we have 1,700 communities throughout the United States of America in 50 States who are not receiving fair compensation from the Federal Government.  In fact, in 1980, in real dollars, they were receiving then $180 million in PILT payments. Today it is $113 million, significant reduction in PILT payments.  In terms of the fossil energy research and development program, what we have got to ask ourselves is whether or not we should be subsidizing Exxon, Chevron, Conoco, Texaco, Amoco, Phillips Petroleum, ARCO and Shell. These are profitable multinational corporations. I frankly do not think they need these subsidies. I would simply point out that opposition to the fossil research program is widespread from conservatives, from progressives. It was targeted as one of the quote unquote dirty dozen corporate subsidies by the Stop Corporate Welfare Coalition which includes the National Taxpayers Union, not necessarily a progressive organization, I do not get a terribly high rating from them, Taxpayers for Common Sense, USPIRG, Citizens Against Government Waste.  The choice is clear. Do we stand up for the kids who are not getting adequate education throughout this country because of lack of Federal payments, or do we stand with some companies that really do not need the subsidies. I would urge a ``yes'' vote for the Sanders-Bass amendment.                              {time}  1830
