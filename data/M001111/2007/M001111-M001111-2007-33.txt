 I hope our minority leader will work with his caucus to try to help us move this forward. It is critical infrastructure that thousands of communities are counting on this week, heading for a jampacked Thanksgiving holiday. Everyone is going to realize the impact of not investing in our infrastructure. I hope we can continue to try to work something out.  I thank the majority leader.                  UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 3996
