 I would note that, in testimony before the Senate, National Park Service Associate Director Stephen Whitesell testified that the Savannah bar pilots have operated ``with virtually no adverse impact on park resources, on the visitor experience, or on park operations.''  The legislation that passed at the request of the Park Service in 2011 was supposed to simply improve the legal basis through which the bar pilots and the Park Service entered into a contract.  I am committed to continuing to work with you to find an equitable and timely solution to this matter that ensures the Fort Pulaski National Monument Lease Authorization Act is appropriately implemented and that the bar pilots are not forced to move from Cockspur Island.
