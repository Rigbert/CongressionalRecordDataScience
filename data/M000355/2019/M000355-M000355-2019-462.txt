 President, I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding the provisions of rule XXII, the cloture motion on Executive Calendar No. 457 ripen at 12 noon on Thursday, October 24; further, that if cloture is invoked, at 1:45 p.m., the Senate vote on the nomination with no intervening action or debate; that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table; and that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action. I further ask that the mandatory quorum call be waived.
