Mr. Speaker, this morning the Democrats in the House will once again attempt to bring a minimum wage bill to the floor for a vote. I urge my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, to support bringing this bill to the floor.  Raising the minimum wage is the right thing to do. It is more than just an economic issue, it is a moral issue. Hard-working people deserve the right to earn a livable wage. No one, but no one, can support a family on $4.25 an hour, $170 per week or less than $9,000 a year.  I know some of my Republican colleagues say they support raising the minimum wage. Well, now is the time to walk the walk, not just talk the talk.  Vote ``no'' on the previous question. Support an increase in the minimum wage.
