President, I rise today to honor Dick Kay, a man of great journalistic integrity. Many things have changed in the past 40 years, but from Martin Luther King, Jr., to Adlai Stevenson, from Iraq to the Daleys, from Watergate to the 1985 Bears, there has been one voice Chicagoans have consistently trusted for an objective and thoughtful perspective. Dick Kay has establishedhimself as an institution in our television news. Over his 46-year career in the TV business, Dick has proven himself to be a professional newsman--a reporter with no motive other than to give his viewers an insight on the news.  Dick's distinguished career began modestly. A high school dropout at the age of 14, he worked to support himself. He once said, ``the experience of those years taught me the most valuable lessons of my life: that I would never achieve any real success without an education.'' He enlisted in the U.S. Navy at the age of 17, earning a GED. certificate. After his discharge, Dick realized his dream of an education by graduating from Bradley University in Peoria through the GI bill, receiving a B.S. in speech education in 1962.  Dick remained in Peoria to work on TV and radio programs before getting his big break as the news director of WFRV-TV in Green Bay, WI. After 3 years in the ``Dairy State,'' he relocated to Chicago in 1968 as a producer and writer for WMAQ-NBC 5. He was tested immediately, as one of his first assignments was the tumultuous 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Within 2 years, Dick had worked his way up to full-time reporter and eventually political editor. He became host of the weekly news show ``City Desk.'' This Sunday morning broadcast became a Chicagoland staple--a ``must-see'' for everyone following the political scene. Dick's questions were often tough but always fair. Political guests knew that a visit to ``City Desk'' would always be memorable.  Dick's achievements include a long list of honors and awards. His 1984 9-month investigation of the Illinois General Assembly's so-called Legislative Study Commissions earned him the George Foster Peabody medallion, the most prestigious honor in television broadcasting. The report also won him a National Headliner Award and the Jacob Scher Award for investigative reporting. Dick's numerous accolades include 11 Emmys; induction into the Television Academy's Silver Circle Hall of Fame; Commentator of the Year from the Joint Civic Committee of Italian-Americans; as well as multiple awards courtesy of the Associated Press, the Chicago Headline Club, and the Society of Professional Journalists. Perhaps one of Dick's proudest moments was being honored as a Bradley University Distinguished Alumnus. He has surely come a long way since shining shoes at the age of 14 in Evansville, IN.  Mr. President, after nearly a half century of reporting the news, Dick says that he is ready to ``smell the roses,'' and he has certainly earned it. Dick Kay has played an important role in reporting the exciting news stories of our time and has left his mark on the ``Land of Lincoln.'' I wish a restful and happy retirement to Dick Kay, one of Illinois' and Chicago's premier newsmen.                          ____________________[Pages S5484-S5485]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                 HONORING RETIRING JOURNALIST DICK KAY
