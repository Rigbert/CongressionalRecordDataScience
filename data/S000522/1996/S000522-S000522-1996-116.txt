Mr. Chairman, that is an excellent question by my friend from California. In point of fact the whole thrust behind this amendment is not to reform legal immigration. In fact, it is to kill any reform that we have in legal immigration. There is no separate legal immigration reform bill on the House side as there is on the Senate side. The gentlemen who have put forth this amendment to my knowledge have not proposed one amendment to reform legal immigration. I think that is very regrettable.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
