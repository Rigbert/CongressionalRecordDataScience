Chairman, when the 1995 Base Realignment and Closure Commission [BRAC] recommended closure of Fort McClellan, AL, and relocation of Fort McClellan's Military Police and Chemical Schools to Fort Leonard Wood, MO, that decision was based in part on the Defense Department's recommendation to the Commission that basic training being conducted at Ft. Leonard Wood be moved elsewhere in order to make room for the additional personnel and activities associated with MP and chemical training.  Subsequent to the adoption by Congress and the President of the BRAC '95 recommendations, the Army changed its position and has now opted to keep basic training at Fort Leonard Wood. In this regard, I am concerned that the FY97 Defense Authorization bill contains $58 million in BRAC IV military construction funds for ``unaccompanied enlisted housing'' at Fort Leonard Wood, one of four projects totaling $118 million in similar BRAC IV funding for that post. While it is possible that some of these funds are necessary to accommodate BRAC-directed moves, it is my understanding that this $58 million project is being undertaken partly to enable Fort Leonard Wood to continue to accommodate its existing basic training load.
