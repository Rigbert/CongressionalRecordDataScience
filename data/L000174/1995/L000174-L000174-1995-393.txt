President, today I am joined by Senators Brown and Kerry in introducing the Electronic Freedom of Information Improvement Act.  This bill would increase public access to the electronic records of Federal agencies, and take long overdue steps to alleviate the delays in processing requests for Government records. In the last Congress, a unanimous Judiciary Committee reported the bill, which then passed the Senate by voice vote on August 25, 1994.  The emerging national information infrastructure [NII] will consist of interconnected computer networks and databases that can put vast amounts of information at users' fingertips. Such an information infrastructure will give the public easy access to the immense volumes of information generated and held by the Government. Individual Federal agencies are already contributing to the development of the NII by using technology to make Government information more easily accessible to our citizens. For example, the Internet Multicasting Service [IMS] now posts massive Government data archives, including the Securities and Exchange Commission EDGAR database, and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office database on the Internet free of charge. Similarly, FedWorld, a bulletin board available on the Internet, provides a gateway to more than 60 Federal agencies.  The Electronic Freedom of Information Improvement Act would contribute to that information flow by increasing online access to Government information, including agency regulations, opinions, and policy statements, and FOIA-released records that are the subject of repeated requests.  Some agencies are taking important steps in this direction. For example, the Department of Energy compiled a database of photographs and texts describing federally-sponsored tests of radiation on human beings and put made that database available on the World Wide Web. Now, instead of responding to multiple requests for the same documents on Government human irradiation experiments, DOE has efficiently used technology to make this material affirmatively available to interested citizens. This bill would require all Federal agencies to make records that are the subject of multiple FOIA requests available electronically.  The bill would also require all Federal agencies to use technology to make Government more accessible and accountable to its citizens by requiring an assessment of how new computer systems will enhance agency FOIA operations to avoid erecting barriers that impede public access.  Federal agencies are increasingly dependent on computers to generate, store and retrieve records electronically. This bill would ensure that these electronic records are available, in a timely manner, to requesters on the same basis as paper records. Specifically, the bill would clarify that FOIA covers all agency information in any format and would require agencies to release records in requested formats when possible.  The changes proposed in the bill are not just important for broader citizen access to Government records. Government information is a valuable commodity and a national resource. In fact, the Government is the largest single producer and collector of information in the United States. It is essential for American competitiveness that easy, fast access to that resource be available.  We have recognized that Government must take advantage of the benefits of new technologies to provide easier and broader dissemination of information. In 1993, we passed a law requiring that people have online access to important Government publications, such as the Federal Register, the Congressional Record and other documents put out by the Government Printing Office. Earlier this year, House Speaker Newt Gingrich unveiled ``Thomas,'' an electronic archive available on the Internet that contains bills and congressional speeches. In his National Performance Review, the Vice-President has described his vision of the electronic Government of the future, where information technology will enable people to have access to public information and services when and where they want them.  Making Government information readily available electronically on people's computers can help to revitalize citizens' interest in learning what their Government is doing and better their understanding of the reasons underlying Government actions. This would, I believe, help reduce cynicism about Government.  This electronic FOIA bill is an important step forward in using technology to make Government more accessible and accountable to our citizens.  In addition, Federal agencies must work to reduce the long delays, which in some agencies stretch to over 2 years, that it takes to give responses to FOIA requests. Because of these delays, newspaper reporters, students and teachers and others working under time deadlines, have been frustrated in using FOIA to meet their research needs. This works to the detriment of us all.  These delays are intolerable. This is not the level of customer service the American people deserve from their public servants. The American taxpayer has paid for the collection and maintenance of this information and should get prompt access to it upon request. That is what the law requires and that is the standard of service Government agencies should meet. Long delays in access can mean no access at all.  The bill addresses the delay problem in several ways: first, the bill doubles the 10 day statutory time limit to 20 days to give agencies a more realistic time period for responding to FOIA requests. Second, the bill encourages agencies to implement a two-track processing system for simple and complex requests. Third, the bill provides for expedited access to requestors who demonstrate a compelling need for a speedy response. Finally, the bill gives agencies an incentive to comply with statutory time limits by allowing agencies in compliance to retain half of their fees, instead of submitting those fees to the general treasury as is currently the case. The fees the agencies can keep will be directed back to the agency FOIA operation to provide an incentive and resources to make these operations better and more efficient.   I look forward to working constructively with the administration and people in the FOIA community to keep FOIA up-to-date with new technologies and to ensure FOIA is an effective tool for open Government.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill, a section-by-section analysis, and a letter of support from 23 organizations representing a substantial portion of the FOIA requestor community, be inserted in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1090       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Electronic Freedom of      Information Improvement Act of 1995''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--       (1) the purpose of the Freedom of Information Act is to      require agencies of the Federal Government to make certain      agency information available for public inspection and      copying and to establish and enable enforcement of the right      of any person to obtain access to the records of such      agencies (subject to statutory exemptions) for any public or      private purpose;       (2) since the enactment of the Freedom of Information Act      in 1966, and the amendments enacted in 1974 and 1986, the      Freedom of Information Act has been a valuable means through      which any person can learn how the Federal Government      operates;       (3) the Freedom of Information Act has led to the      disclosure of waste, fraud, abuse, and wrongdoing in the      Federal Government;       (4) the Freedom of Information Act has led to the      identification of unsafe consumer products harmful drugs, and      serious health hazards;       (5) Government agencies increasingly use computers to      conduct agency business and to store publicly valuable agency      records and information; and       (6) Government agencies should use new technology to      enhance public access to agency records and information.       (b) Purpsoes.--The purposes of this Act are to--       (1) foster democracy by ensuring public access to agency      records and information;       (2) improve public access to agency records and      information;       (3) ensure agency compliance with statutory time limits;      and       (4) maximize the usefulness of agency records and      information collected, maintained, used, retained, and      disseminated by the Federal Government.     SEC. 3. PUBLIC INFORMATION AVAILABILITY.       Section 552(a)(1) of title 5, United States Code, is      amended--       (1) in the matter before subparagraph (A) by inserting ``by      computer telecommunications, or if computer      telecommunications means are not available, by other      electronic means,'' after ``Federal Register'';       (2) by striking out ``and'' at the end of subparagraph (D);       (3) by redesignating subparagraph (E) as subparagraph (F);      and       (4) by inserting after subparagraph (D) the following new      subparagraph:       ``(E) a complete list of all statutes that the agency head      or general counsel relies upon to authorize the agency to      withhold information under subsection (b)(3) of this section,      together with a specific description of the scope of the      information covered; and''.

Section 552(a)(3) of title 5, United States Code, is      amended by--       (1) inserting ``(A)'' after ``(3)'';       (2) striking out ``(A) reasonably'' and inserting in lieu      thereof ``(i) reasonably'';       (3) striking out ``(B)'' and inserting in lieu thereof      ``(ii)''; and       (4) adding at the end thereof the following new      subparagraphs:       ``(B) An agency shall, as requested by any person, provide      records in any form or format in which such records are      maintained by that agency.       ``(C) An agency shall make reasonable efforts to search for      records in electronic form or format and provide records in      the form or format requested by any person, including in an      electronic form or format, even where such records are not      usually maintained but are available in such form or      format.''.     SEC. 6. DELAYS.       (a) Fees.--Section 552(a)(4)(A) of title 5, United States      Code, is amended by adding at the end thereof the following      new clause:       ``(viii) If at an agency's request, the Comptroller General      determines that the agency annually has either provided      responsible documents or denied requests in substantial      compliance with the requirements of paragraph (6)(A), one-     half of the fees collected under this section shall be      credited to the collecting agency and expended to offset the      costs of complying with this section through staff      development and acquisition of additional request processing      resources. The remaining fees collected under this section      shall be remitted to the Treasury as general funds or      miscellaneous receipts.''.       (b) Payment of the Expenses of the Person Making a      Request.--Section 552(a)(4)(E) of title 5, United States      Code, is amended by adding at the end thereof the following:      ``The court may assess against the United States all out-of-     pocket expenses incurred by the person making a request, and      reasonable attorney fees incurred in the administrative      process, in any case in which the agency has failed to comply      with the time limit provisions of paragraph (6) of this      subsection. In determining whether to award such fees and      expenses, a court should consider whether an agency's failure      to comply with statutory time limits was not warranted and      demonstrated bad faith or was otherwise unreasonable in the      context of the circumstances of the particular request.''.       (c) Demonstration of Circumstances For Delay.--Section      552(a)(4)(E) of title 5, United States Code, is further      amended--       (1) by inserting ``(i)'' after ``(E)''; and       (2) by adding at the end thereof the following new clause:       ``(ii) Any agency not in compliance with the time limits      set forth in this subsection shall demonstrate to a court      that the delay is warranted under the circumstances set forth      under paragraph (6) (B) or (C) of this subsection.''.       (d) Period for Agency Decision To Comply With Request.--     Section 552(a)(6)(A)(i) is amended by striking out ``ten      days'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``twenty days''.       (e) Agency Backlogs.--Section 552(a)(6)(C) of title 5,      United States Code, is amended by inserting after the second      sentence the following: ``As used in this subparagraph, the      term `exceptional circumstances' means circumstances that are      unforeseen and shall not include delays that result from a      predictable workload, including any ongoing agency backlog,      in the ordinary course of processing requests for records.''.       (f) Notification of Denial.--The last sentence of section      552(a)(6)(C) of title 5, United States Code, is      amended to read: ``Any notification of any full or partial      denial of any request for records under this subsection      shall set forth the names and titles or positions of each      person responsible for the denial of such request and the      total number of denied records and pages considered by the      agency to have been responsive to the request.''.       (g) Multitrack FIFO Processing and Expedited Access.--     Section 552(a)(6) of title 5, United States Code, is amended      by adding at the end thereof the following new subparagraphs:       ``(D)(i) Each agency shall adopt a first-in, first-out      (hereafter in this subparagraph referred to as FIFO)      processing policy in determining the order in which requests      are processed. The agency may establish separate processing      tracks for simple and complex requests using FIFO processing      within each track.       ``(ii) For purposes of such a multitrack system--       ``(I) a simple request shall be a request requiring 10 days      or less to make a determination on whether to comply with      such a request; and       ``(II) a complex request shall be a request requiring more      than 10 days to make a determination on whether to comply      with such a request.       ``(iii) A multitrack system shall not negate a claim of due      diligence under subparagraph (C), if FIFO processing within      each track is maintained and the agency can show that it has      reasonably allocated resources to handle the processing for      each track.       ``(E)(i) Each agency shall promulgate regulations, pursuant      to notice and receipt of public comment, providing that upon      receipt of a request for expedited access to records      and a showing by the person making such request of a compelling need      for expedited access to records, the agency shall determine      within 5 days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public      holidays) after the receipt of such a request, whether to      comply with such request. No more than one day after making      such determination the agency shall notify the person making      a request for expedited access of such determination, the      reasons therefor, and of the right to appeal to the head of      the agency. A request for records to which the agency has      granted expedited access shall be processed as soon as      practicable. A request for records to which the agency has      denied expedited access shall be processed within the time      limits under paragraph (6) of this subsection.       ``(ii) A person whose request for expedited access has not      been decided within 5 days of its receipt by the agency or      has been denied shall be required to exhaust administrative      remedies. A request for expedited access which has not been      decided may be appealed to the head of the agency within 7      days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public      holidays) after its receipt by the agency. A request for      expedited access that has been denied by the agency may be      appealed to the head of the agency within 2 days (excepting      Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after the      person making such request receives notice of the agency's      denial. If an agency head has denied, affirmed a denial, or      failed to respond to a timely appeal of a request for      expedited access, a court which would have jurisdiction of an      action under paragraph (4)(B) of this subsection may, upon      complaint, require the agency to show cause why the request      for expedited access should not be granted, except that such      review shall be limited to the record before the agency.       ``(iii) The burden of demonstrating a compelling need by a      person making a request for expedited access may be met by a      showing, which such person certifies under penalty of perjury      to be true and correct to the best of such person's knowledge      and belief, that failure to obtain the requested records      within the timeframe for expedited access under this      paragraph would--       ``(I) threaten an individual's life or safety;       ``(II) result in the loss of substantial due process rights      and the information sought is not otherwise available in a      timely fashion; or       ``(III) affect public assessment of the nature and      propriety of actual or alleged governmental actions that are      the subject of widespread, contemporaneous media coverage.''.     SEC. 7. COMPUTER REDACTION.       Section 552(b) of title 5, United States Code, is amended      by inserting before the period in the sentence following      paragraph (9) the following: ``, and the extent of such      deletion shall be indicated on the released portion of the      record at the place in the record where such deletion was      made''.     SEC. 8. DEFINITIONS.       Section 552(f) of title 5, United States Code, is amended      to read as follows:       ``(f) For purposes of this section--       ``(1) the term `agency' as defined in section 551(1) of      this title includes any executive department, military      department, Government corporation, Government controlled      corporation, or other establishment in the executive branch      of the Government (including the Executive Office of the      President), or any independent regulatory agency;       ``(2) the term `record' means all books, papers, maps,      photographs, machine-readable materials, or other information      or documentary materials, regardless of physical form or      characteristics; and       ``(3) the term `search' means a manual or automated review      of agency records that is conducted for the purpose of      locating those records which are responsive to a request      under subsection (a)(3)(A) of this section.''.                                                                    ____            Electronic FOIA Improvement Act of 1995 Summary                         Section 1. Short Title       The Act may be cited as the Electronic Freedom of      Information Improvement Act of 1995.                    Section 2. Findings and Purposes       This section clarifies that Congress enacted the FOIA to      require Federal agencies to make records available to the      public through public inspection and upon the request of any      person for any public or private use. This section also      acknowledges the increase in the government's use of      computers and specifies that agencies should use new      technology to enhance public access to government      information.       The purposes of this bill are to improve public access to      government information and records, and to reduce the delays      in agencies' responses to requests for records under the      Freedom of Information Act.               Section 3. Public Information Availability       This section requires agencies to publish a complete list      of statutes that the agency relies upon to withhold      information under subsection (b)(3) of the Act. Exemption      (b)(3) covers information that is specifically exempted from      disclosure by other statutes. These exemptions currently      appear in non-FOIA bills and decrease information available      to the public without review by the Judiciary Committee. In      order to prevent ill-considered exemptions to the access      mandate of the FOIA, this section would place specific      limitations on an agency's ability to rely on the authority      of (b)(3) exemption statutes when they have not passed      through prescribed legislative channels and have not been      previously brought to public attention through publication in      the Federal Register.       The Office of Management and Budget has directed agencies      to use electronic media and formats, including public      networks, to make government information more easily      accessible and useful to the public. (OMB Circular A-130,      Revised, July 1994). To effectuate this goal, section 3 of      the bill requires that information, such as agency      regulations, which under the FOIA must be published in the      Federal Register, should be accessible by computer      telecommunications. The Government Printing Office Electronic      Information Access Enhancement Act of 1993 (``GPO Act''),      Pub. Law 103-40, already requires that the Federal Register      and certain other congressional publications, be made      available online. If an agency cannot make these materials      available online, then the information should be made      available in some other electronic form, such as CD-ROM or on      disc. Section 4. Materials Made Available In Electronic Format and Index of                   Records Made Available To The Public       The first part of this section would require that      materials, such as agency opinions and policy statements,      which an agency must ``make available for public inspection      and copying'' pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of Section 552, be      made available electronically, as well as in hard copy. If an      agency cannot make these materials available online, then the      information should be made available in some other electronic      form, such as CD-ROM or on disc. The bill would thus treat      (a)(2) materials in the same manner as it treats (a)(1)      materials, which under the GPO Act are required, via the      Federal Register, to be made available online.       The second part of this section would require agencies to      publish in the Federal Register an index of all major      information systems containing agency records and a      description of any new major information system with a      statement of how it will enhance agency FOIA operations.       The third part of this section would require that an index      of any records released as the result of ``requests'' for      records pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of Section 552 must be      made available for public inspection and copying under      paragraph (a)(2). This would assist requesters in determining      which records have been the subject of prior FOIA requests.      Since requests for records provided in response to prior      requests are more readily identified by the agency without      the need for new searches, this index will assist agencies in      complying with the FOIA time limits.       Under the fourth part of this section, copies of records      disclosed in response to FOIA requests that the agency      determines have been or will likely be the subject of      additional requests, must be made available for public      inspection and copying in basically the same manner as the      materials required to made available under paragraph (a)(2).      As a practical matter, this would mean that copies of records      released in response to FOIA requests on a popular topic,      such as the assassinations of public figures, would      subsequently be treated as (a)(2) materials, which are made      available for public inspection and copying. This would      reduce the number of multiple FOIA requests for the same      records requiring separate agency responses.       The fifth part of this section would make clear that to      prevent a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,      an agency may delete identifying details when it makes      available or publishes the index and copies of records      released in response to FIOA requests, as required under the      third and fourth parts of section 4 of this bill.       The final part of this section would, consistent with the      ``Computer Redaction'' requirement in Section 7 of the bill,      require that any deletions made in electronic records be      indicated at the place where such deletion was made.                  Section 5. Honoring Format Requests       This section would require agencies to assist requesters by      providing information in the form requested, if the agency      has the information available in that form. In other words,      requests for the electronic format of records, which are      usually not maintained or stored in electronic form, should      be honored when the records nevertheless exist and are      available in the requested electronic form.       This section would overrule Dismukes v. Department of the      Interior, 603 F. Supp. 760, 763 (D.D.C. 1984), which held      that an agency ``has no obligation under the FOIA to      accommodate plaintiff's preference [but] need only provide      responsive, nonexempt information in a reasonably accessible      form.''                           Section 6. Delays       Fees.--In an effort to decrease the delays experienced by      FOIA requesters, the bill would authorize agencies to retain      one-half of the fees they collect if the agency complies with      the statutory time limits for responding to requests. The fee      retention provisions of the bill would reward agencies that      meet the statutory time limits and should diminish the      burdens on agencies with particularly heavy FOIA workloads.      It will be very important to structure the compliance      criteria so that the reward system operates effectively and      without favoring any class of requesters over other classes.       Payment of the Expenses of the Person Making A Request.--     The current statute allows for the award of attorneys' fees      and      other litigation costs in any case in which the complainant has      reasonably prevailed. The bill would permit a court to award      payment of requesters' litigation expenses and reasonable      attorneys' fees incurred in the administrative process in any      case in which the agency fails to comply with the time      limits. In determining whether to make such an award, the      bill directs the court to consider whether an agency's      failure to comply with statutory time limits was not      warranted and demonstrated bad faith or was otherwise      unreasonable under the circumstances of the particular      request.       Demonstration of Circumstances for Delay.--The bill would      require agencies not in compliance with the time limits to      demonstrate ``that the delay is warranted under the      circumstances.'' The bill would clarify the only      circumstances that excuse compliance with the time limits are      those unusual or exceptional circumstances set forth in      paragraphs 6(B) and (C) of Section 552(a).       Expansion of Agency Response Time.--The bill would expand      the time limit for an agency to respond to a request for      records under FOIA from ten days to twenty days. Attorney      General Janet Reno has acknowledged the inability of most      federal agencies to comply with the ten-day rule as ``as a      serious problem'' stemming principally from ``too few      resources in the face of too heavy a workload.'' A doubling      of the time limit will assist federal agencies in reducing      their backlogs.       Agency Backlogs.--The current statute provides that in      ``exceptional circumstances,'' the statutory time limits can      be extended, but does not define what those circumstances can      be. In Open America v. Watergate Special Prosecution Force,      547 F.2d 605 (D.C. Cir. 1976), the court held that an      unforeseen 3,000 percent increase in FOIA requests in one      year, which created a massive backlog in an agency with      insufficient resources to process those requests in a timely      manner, can constitute ``exceptional circumstances.''       Routine backlogs of requests for records under the FOIA      should not give agencies an automatic excuse to ignore the      time limits, since this provides a disincentive for agencies      to clear up those backlogs. This section of the bill would      clarify the holding in Open America by specifying that      routine agency backlogs do not constitute exceptional      circumstances for purposes of the Act.       Multitrack FIFO Processing.--An agency commitment to      process requests on a first-come, first-served basis has been      held to satisfy the requirement that an agency exercise due      diligence in dealing with backlogs of FOIA requests. Some      agencies have taken the position that they must process      requests on a FIFO basis, even if this procedure may result      in lengthy delays for simple requests due to the prior      receipt and processing of complex requests. The bill would      encourage agencies to implement multi-track processing      systems for FOIA requests to reduce backlog.       Expedited Access.--The bill would authorize expedited      access to requesters who demonstrate a ``compelling need''      for a speedy response. The agency would be required to make a      determination whether or not to grant the request for      expedited access within five days. The requester would bear      the burden of showing, under penalty of perjury, that      expedition is appropriate and would be required to satisfy      strict time limits to obtain administrative and judicial      review of an agency's denial of such a request. The bill      would permit only limited judicial review based on the same      record before the agency.       A ``compelling need'' warranting expedited access would be      demonstrated by showing that failure to obtain the records      within an expedited timeframe would: (I) threaten a person's      life or safety; (II) result in the loss of substantial due      process rights and the information sought is not otherwise      available in a timely fashion; or (III) affect public      assessment of the nature and propriety of actual or alleged      governmental actions that are the subject of widespread,      contemporaneous media coverage.                     Section 7. Computer Redaction       The ability to redact information on the computer changes      the complexion of released documents. At times, determining      whether one sentence or 30 pages have been withheld by the      agency is impossible. The bill would require agencies to      indicate deletions of the released portion of the record at      the place where such deletion was made.                         Section 8. Definitions       The bill would add definitions of ``record'' and ``search''      to the statute to address electronically stored information.      The current FOIA statute does not define either term. The      definition of ``record'' in the bill is an expanded version      of the definition in the Federal Records Act, 44 U.S.C. 3301.      There is little disagreement that the FOIA covers all      government records, regardless of the form in which they are      stored by the agency. The Department of Justice agrees that      computer database records are agency records subject to the      FOIA. See ``Department of Justice Report on `Electronic      Record' Issues Under the Freedom of Information Act,'' S.      Hrg. 102-1098, 102d Cong., 2d Sess. 33 (1992).       The bill defines ``search'' as ``a manual or automated      review''to locate records responsive to a FOIA request. Under      the FOIA, an agency is not required to create documents that      do not exist. Computer records located in a database rather      than in a file cabinet may require the application of codes      or some form of programming to retrieve the information.      Under the definition of ``search'' in the bill, the search of      computerized records would not amount to the creation of      records. Otherwise, it would be virtually impossible to get      records that are maintained completely in an electronic form,      like electronic mail, because some manipulation of the      information likely would be necessary to search the records.                                                    July 27, 1995.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy and Hank Brown,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Leahy and Brown: The organizations listed      below, representing a substantial portion of the Freedom of      Information Act requestor community, wish to express their      strong support for the ``Electronic Freedom of Information      Improvement Act of 1995.''       The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) is a critical tool of      our democracy which allows Americans to learn about their      government and hold the government accountable for its      actions. This legislation ensures that the public will be      able to access agency records maintained in electronic form,      and also takes steps to alleviate endemic delays in      proceeding FOIA requests.       This legislation is needed to address new issues related to      increased use of computers by federal agencies. It clarifies      that the FOIA covers agency information in any form,      including electronic form, and requires agencies to provide      records in a requested form if the records are maintained in      that form. The legislation also increases on-line access to      government information, including agency regulations,      opinions, and policy statements, as well as FOIA-related      records that are the subject of repeated requests. This      increased on-line accessibility of FOIA-releasable material      is a critical step in using technology to make government      more accessible and responsible to its citizens.       The ``Electronic Freedom of Information Act'' also will      reduce agency delays in responding to FOIA requests. In      recognition of the difficulty faced by some agencies in      complying with FOIA time limits, the bill increases agency      response time from 10 to 20 days, and allows agencies to      retain half of the fees if they comply with statutory time      limits. The legislation encourages agencies to implement two-     track processing systems for simple and complex requests to      assist in the reduction of backlogs, and establishes      expedited access for requestors who demonstrate a compelling      need for a speedy response.       By keeping the Freedom of Information Act up to date with      new technologies and improving the administrative process,      this legislation will help ensure that the Act remains an      instrument for open and responsive government. We hope that      this legislation, which last year passed the Judiciary      Committee unanimously and the Senate by voice vote, will be      enacted into law.
