Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5323, the Proud to Be an American Citizen Act, which enables U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services or nonprofit entities to conduct naturalization ceremonies on or near Independence Day each year. The legislation gives us an opportunity to underscore the importance and privilege of U.S. citizenship.  This legislation does not authorize new funds, but would provide up to $5,000 for each ceremony organized on Independence Day out of the funds already available to the Department of Homeland Security. The moneys provided under this bill would be sufficient to cover the basics for a ceremony to honor those who have worked hard and met the legal requirements to become United States citizens.  The funds may be used only for the cost of government personnel needed to administer the Oath of Allegiance, facilities rental, brochures, and other logistics. The bill requires any nongovernment entity seeking to organize a naturalization ceremony to receive approval through the Department of Homeland Security.  The bill allows new Americans to celebrate their naturalization in conjunction with celebrating America on Independence Day. I believe it is important that we support those who want to take the final step toward becoming Americans and those who have legally moved through the immigration system to obtain citizenship.  I urge Members to support this bill.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
