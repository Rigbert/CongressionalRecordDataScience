 In the midst of his remarks, Mr. Schumer mentioned something that I think is terribly important. Yesterday, the Rules Committee--and the distinguished Senator used to be the chairman of the Rules Committee. I think I was ranking member at that particular time. He spoke of an agreement to move appropriations bills. I want to thank him for that, and also Senator Durbin, who indicated that as of yesterday.  We did reach an agreement in a bipartisan way to do something about filing cloture 86 times and other things going on and reducing that time period. We will get to that.  The breakthrough could be an agreement that Mr. Schumer has agreed to with regard to appropriations bills. If we can do that, we might be able to get back to the regular order that both of us experienced when we first came to the Senate. Many Members here have not experienced that.
