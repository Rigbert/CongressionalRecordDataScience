 President, this amendment involves deeming. It is a complicated issue. Let me try and explain it simply. It only involves legal aliens.  Presently, deeming only applies to cash programs, AFDC, SSI, food stamps. This amendment would remove the deeming requirements for Federal programs not traditionally considered Federal welfare programs. It would retain the deeming for the three principal Federal cash welfare programs: AFDC, SSI, and food stamps.  Under the bill, a child of a legal immigrant would not have access to Head Start; a legal immigrant would not have access to Medicaid, would not have access to child protective services, would not have access to maternal health services, would not have access to foster care, would not have access to custodial care. All of these programs deemed--excuse me, not deemed--but all these programs which are noncash programs would not be available for anyone who was in this country legally.  The amendment also provides that no one in this country legally who is a battered wife could ever make use of a domestic abuse program, a battered wife shelter. There are actually some 80 programs that provide noncash assistance, and I have named most of them. The most important one of these is Medicaid.  Everyone in this room has heard Governors across this Nation bellow that the Federal Government is not dealing with the costs of immigrants to the States. Every one of them says this, that has the program.  Essentially, the way the bill is drafted, it is a massive cost-shift to States because it says that the county then has to pick up these costs. The county would have to pick up the costs of Head Start if a youngster was going to go into it. The county would have to pick up the costs of Medicaid or the State. The county would have to pick up the costs of child protective services or foster care or any of those items.  It is a major item. And I will be candid and frank with you; it falls most heavily on four States. It falls heavily on Texas, it falls heavily on Florida, it falls heavily on New York, and it falls heavily on California. And that is because that is where the largest percentages of these legal immigrants are.  Now, as I mentioned earlier in the earlier discussion, I believe we should tighten the sponsorship requirements. I believe we should see that they are secure, even verify what they say. And I intend to introduce legislation that would provide that sponsors of immigrants must provide health insurance for those immigrants. But here we are with a situation that exists really creating a massive unfunded mandate, particularly in the area of legal immigration.  This amendment is supported by the National Governors' Association, the National Conference of State Legislatures, the National Association of Counties, the National League of Cities, the United States Catholic Conference, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, Mayor Giuliani, Mayor Riordan, and many other people as well.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter from the National Governors' Association.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                               National Governors Association,                                Washington DC, September 13, 1995.       Dear Senator, As the Senate considers amendments to the      Work Opportunity Act of 1995, the National Governors'      Association [NGA] urges you to support increased flexibility      that will enable states to build upon the experiences of      state welfare reform efforts around the country and to design      programs in accord with their particular needs and      priorities. We have provided below a partial list of      amendments that are supported by the NGA. This list is not      meant to be exhaustive, and there may be other amendments      Governors support that are not on this list.       We urge you to support these amendments based on the      recommendations of the nation's Governors, who will have      direct responsibility for meeting the challenge of designing      successful welfare-to-work and child care systems:       State penalties under cash assistance block grant. (Pryor      #2495, McCain #2542) Delays the implementation of penalties      until October 1, 1996 or six months after the date the      Secretary issues the final rule, whichever is later. Provides      that the five percent penalty for unlawful use of funds can      only be imposed if the Secretary determines the violation was      intentional. Permits states with penalties to submit to the      federal government a corrective action plan to correct      violations in lieu of paying penalties under the cash      assistance block grant.       Technical amendments. (D'Amato #2577, 2578, 2579) Technical      amendments relating to the date for determining FY 1994      expenditures, claims arising before effective dates and      efforts to recover funds from previous fiscal years.       Equal treatment for naturalized citizens. (Feinstein #2478,      Kennedy #2563) Provides for equal treatment for naturalized      and native-born citizens so that once an individual becomes a      citizen he or she will be eligible for benefits whether or      not the deeming period has expired.       Sponsor deeming. (Feinstein #2513) Limits deeming of      sponsors' income to those programs for which deeming is now      required under current law (AFDC, Food Stamps and SSI).      Additionally exempts legal immigrants who have been victims      of domestic violence from the 1) ban on SSI assistance and 2)      deeming requirements for all programs.       Prospective application of legal immigrant provisions.      (Graham #2569) Provides that any changes with respect to      legal immigrants made by this bill will not apply to      noncitizens who are lawfully present in the United States and      receiving benefits under a program on the date of enactment.      (Simon, #2509) Eliminates retroactive deeming requirements      for legal immigrants already in the U.S.       ``Good cause'' hardship waiver. (Rockefeller #2492) Gives      states the option of granting exceptions to the 5-year life-     time limit and the participation rate calculation for      individuals who are ill, incapacitated, or elderly, as well      as for recipients who are providing full-time care for their      disabled dependents.       High unemployment areas exemption. (Rockefeller #2491)      Gives states the option of waiving time limits in area of      high unemployment (ten percent or more). Recipients must      participate in workfare or community work to continue      benefits.       Vocational educational training. (Jeffords #2557) Changes      the definition of work activities to allow vocational      education to count as an eligible activity of up to 24      months.       Data reporting requirements. (McCain #2541) Provides that      states are not required to comply with excessive data      collection and reporting requirements, as determined by GAO,      unless the federal government provides sufficient funds to      meet the costs.       Work supplementation. (McCain #2280) Removes the six month      limit for an individual's participation in a work      supplementation program under the food stamp program.       Cash aid in lieu of food stamps. (Faircloth #2600) Allows a      state agency to make cash payments in lieu of food stamps for      certain individuals.       Hardship waiver. (Kennedy #2623) Permits states to apply      for waivers with respect to the 15 percent cap on hardship      exemptions from the five-year time limit.       Assistance to children. (Kennedy #2624) Permits states to      provide non-cash assistance to children ineligible for aid      because of the five-year time limit.       Modification of participation rate (DeWine #2518) Permits a      pro rata reduction in a state's participation rate due to      caseload reductions not required by federal law or due to      changes in a state's eligibility criteria.           Sincerely,                                                  Gov. Bob Miller,                                                  State of Nevada.
