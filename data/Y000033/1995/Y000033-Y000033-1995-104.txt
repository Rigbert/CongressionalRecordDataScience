Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, I will tell the gentleman, I put it in the bill understanding what he was trying to do, but removed it after hearing from the councils. That is why we have the hearing process and the input from the general public. That is why there was no outcry for this amendment at any time during the hearings.  Mr. Chairman, we had a broad spectrum of people interested in this legislation. This has been on the burner for 4 years. I am going to suggest respectfully that I followed the train of thought of the gentleman from California [Mr. Farr] when I introduced the bill originally. But after hearing the councils and other members of the public say this would be detrimental and driving us apart, I made it discretionary and not mandatory. That is the reason.
