Mr. Speaker, I rise to urge my colleagues to support this motion to recommit.  Mr. Speaker, I said to my Republican colleagues, they should not raise premiums for our seniors, not when they can find money to give tax breaks to the rich. That is not right. That is not fair. That is not just.  How long? How long until they realize what they are doing to our seniors? Not long. Not long until our seniors know what they have done.  Mr. Speaker, on this day, let the word go forth from this place into every State, every city, every town, every village, every hamlet, that it was the Republicans who voted to cut Medicare in order to give a huge tax break to the rich.  The Republican plan is too radical, too extreme, it is too much. It is more than wrong. It is a shame and a disgrace. Do the right thing. Support the motion to recommit.
