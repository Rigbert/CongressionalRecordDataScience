President, we have been gone for 6 weeks or so. It is great to see our colleagues back here. A lot of things have been exchanged about what we did back home during the break, but the focal point of most conversations on the floor this evening has been, rightfully, about my colleague, Senator Mark Kirk. Most everybody knows now he suffered a stroke over the weekend, and he underwent surgery in Chicago at Northeastern Hospital last night.  All that I know about this comes from a press conference his surgeon gave in Chicago today. We want to make it clear to Mark that he is in our thoughts and prayers, as is his family. We all feel, to a person, that he will make a strong recovery. He is young and in good condition. He prides himself on his service in the Naval Reserve and stays fit to serve our country in that capacity, as well as in the Senate. He has a tough, steep hill ahead of him, but he is up to the task.  If encouragement from a Democrat, as well as many Republicans, is what is needed, he has that. I want to let him know, if the word is passed along to him in his recovery, that his colleagues in the Senate are focusing on his quick recovery and are anxious for him to return.  I yield the floor.
