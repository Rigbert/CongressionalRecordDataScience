President, ingenuity and innovation have been a cornerstone of the American economy from the time Thomas Jefferson issued the first patent to today.  The Founding Fathers recognized the importance of promoting innovation, and the Constitution explicitly grants Congress the power to ``promote the progress and science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to . . . inventors the exclusive right to their respective . . . discoveries.'' The discoveries made by American inventors and research institutions, commercialized by our companies, and protected and promoted by our patent laws have made our system the envy of the world.  The legislation I introduce today with Senator Hatch, and many others and from across the political spectrum, will keep America in its longstanding position at the pinnacle of innovation. This bill will establish a more efficient and streamlined patent system that will improve patent quality and limit unnecessary and counterproductive litigation costs, while making sure no party's access to court is denied.  Innovation and economic development are not uniquely Democratic or Republican objectives. I have been working on the Patent Reform Act on a bipartisan basis with Senator Hatch and others for several years--and Senator Hatch and I worked on various patent issues for many years before that.  Last Congress, I introduced, along with Senator Hatch, the Patent Reform Act of 2007, which is the precursor to the legislation we introduce today. That bill was the subject of consideration and amendments over four weeks of mark-up sessions in the Senate Judiciary Committee. After the Judiciary Committee voted to approve the bill in July 2007, we continued to hold numerous meetings, briefings, and stakeholder roundtables--again, on a bipartisan basis.  The legislation we introduce today picks up where we left off in those discussions. We have made some changes from the Committee-approved bill in response to concerns we heard from groups ranging from labor unions to small inventors to manufacturers. We have removed the requirement that all patent applications be published 18 months after they are filed and we have removed the requirement for Applicant Quality Submissions. We have also adopted the House approach to improving the current inter partes reexamination process, rather than creating a new second window post-grant review.  Perhaps the most hotly debated topic in the patent reform debate last Congress was the damages provision. The reasonable royalty language in the bill we introduce today is identical to the language approved by the Judiciary Committee last Congress. While I strongly support this language, I am prepared to continue the conversation and debate from the last Congress in order to find the best language we can.  There have been several positive developments since the Committee voted to report the legislation in July 2007. Senator Specter has made constructive suggestions about a ``gate keeping'' role for the court in damage calculations. The Supreme Court's Quanta decision may offer a useful way of describing the truly inventive feature of a patent. There is much work to do on this provision and I am optimistic that by continuing to work together, we will find the right language.  During consideration of the Patent Reform Act of 2007 in Committee last Congress, I offered an amendment, which was adopted, to codify the inequitable conduct doctrine. Senator Hatch has asked that the provision be removed on introduction this year. I understand that the issue of inequitable conduct is very important to Senator Hatch, and I will work with him to address any statutory changes.  It has been more than 50 years since Congress significantly updated the patent system. In the decades since, our economy has changed dramatically. No longer is the economy defined only by assembly lines and brick-and-mortar production. We are living in the Information Age, and the products and processes that are being patented are changing as quickly as the times themselves.  A patent system developed for a 1952 economy, needs to be reconsidered in light of 21st century realities, while staying true to our constitutional imperative. The patent laws that were sufficiently robust for promoting innovation and economic development are now actually impeding growth, harming innovators and raising prices on consumers.  The array of voices heard in this debate--representing virtually all sectors of the economy and all interests in the patent system--have certainly not been uniform, but three major areas of concern with the current patent system can be distilled from their discussions.  First, there is significant concern that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, PTO, is issuing low quality patents. Patent examiners are facing a difficult task given the explosion in the number of applications and the increasing complexity of those applications. When Congress last overhauled the patent system in 1952, the PTO received approximately 60,000 patent applications; in 2006, it received 440,000. Clearly, this puts a strain on the system and understandably affects the quality of patents issued.  Second, the costs and uncertainty associated with patent litigation have escalated in recent years, and are creating an unbearable drag on innovation. Damage awards are inconsistent and too often fail to focus on the value of the invention to the infringing product. This disconnect and uncertainty is a problem that also leads to unreasonable posturing during licensing negotiations.  Third, as business and competition become more global, patent applicants are increasingly filing patent applications in other countries for protection of their inventions. The filing system in the United States, known as ``first-to-invent,'' differs from that in other patent-issuing jurisdictions, which have ``first-to-file'' systems. This causes confusion and inefficiencies for American companies and innovators.  The Patent Reform Act of 2009 promotes innovation, and will improve our economy, by addressing these impediments to growth. As the administration endeavors to guide the economy out of the recession, as payrolls shrink and the jobless rate rises, Congress cannot afford to sit idly by while innovation--the engine of our economy--is impeded by outdated laws.  Our legislation ensures that, in the Information Age, we have the legal landscape necessary for our innovators to flourish. It will improve the quality of patents and remove the ambiguity from the process of litigating patent claims, which will promote innovation stifled by the current system. As innovation is encouraged, and excessive litigation costs are removed, competition will increase and the consumer cost of products will fall. In this way, the bill directly benefits both creators and consumers of inventive products.  Patent reform is ultimately about economic development. It is about jobs, it is about innovation, and it is about consumers. All benefit under a patent system that reduces unnecessary costs, removes inefficiencies, and holds true to the vision of our Founders that Congress should establish a national policy that promotes the progress of science and the useful arts.  When Thomas Jefferson issued that first patent in 1790--a patent that went to a Vermonter--no one could have predicted how the American economy would develop and what changes would be needed for the law to keep pace, but the purpose then remains the purpose today--promoting progress.  As I said when I introduced the Patent Reform Act last Congress: If we are to maintain our position at the forefront of the world's economy, if we are to continue to lead the world in innovation and production, if we are to continue to benefit from the ideas of the most creative citizens, then we must have a patent system that produces high quality patents, that limits counterproductive litigation over those patents, and that makes the entire system more streamlined and efficient.  Now is the time to bolster our role as the world leader in innovation. Now is the time to create jobs at home. Now is the time for Congress to act on patent reform.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 515       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

Any such request may only be made within 12 months      after the date of first publication of an application      containing a claim that is the same or is substantially the      same as the claimed invention, must be made under oath, and      must be supported by substantial evidence. Whenever the      Director determines that patents or applications for patent      naming different individuals as the inventor interfere with      one another because of a dispute over the right to patent      under section 101, the Director shall institute a derivation      proceeding for the purpose of determining which applicant is      entitled to a patent.       ``(2) Determination by patent trial and appeal board.--In      any proceeding under this subsection, the Patent Trial and      Appeal Board--       ``(A) shall determine the question of the right to patent;       ``(B) in appropriate circumstances, may correct the naming      of the inventor in any application or patent at issue; and       ``(C) shall issue a final decision on the right to patent.       ``(3) Derivation proceeding.--The Board may defer action on      a request to initiate a derivation proceeding until 3 months      after the date on which the Director issues a patent to the      applicant that filed the earlier application.       ``(4) Effect of final decision.--The final decision of the      Patent Trial and Appeal Board, if adverse to the claim of an      applicant, shall constitute the final refusal by the United      States Patent and Trademark Office on the claims involved.      The Director may issue a patent to an applicant who is      determined by the Patent Trial and Appeal Board to have the      right to patent. The final decision of the Board, if adverse      to a patentee, shall, if no appeal or other review of the      decision has been or can be taken or had, constitute      cancellation of the claims involved in the patent, and notice      of such cancellation shall be endorsed on copies of the      patent distributed after such cancellation by the United      States Patent and Trademark Office.       ``(b) Settlement.--Parties to a derivation proceeding may      terminate the proceeding by filing a written statement      reflecting the agreement of the parties as to the correct      inventors of the claimed invention in dispute. Unless the      Patent Trial and Appeal Board finds the agreement to be      inconsistent with the evidence of record, it shall take      action consistent with the agreement. Any written settlement      or understanding of the parties     shall be filed with the Director. At the request of a party      to the proceeding, the agreement or understanding shall be      treated as business confidential information, shall be kept      separate from the file of the involved patents or      applications, and shall be made available only to Government      agencies on written request, or to any person on a showing of      good cause.       ``(c) Arbitration.--Parties to a derivation proceeding,      within such time as may be specified by the Director by      regulation, may determine such contest or any aspect thereof      by arbitration. Such arbitration shall be governed by the      provisions of title 9 to the extent such title is not      inconsistent with this section. The parties shall give notice      of any arbitration award to the Director, and such award      shall, as between the parties to the arbitration, be      dispositive of the issues to which it relates. The      arbitration award shall be unenforceable until such notice is      given. Nothing in this subsection shall preclude the Director      from determining patentability of the invention involved in      the derivation proceeding.''.

SEC. 4. RIGHT OF THE INVENTOR TO OBTAIN DAMAGES.       (a) Damages.--Section 284 of title 35, United States Code,      is amended to read as follows:     ``Sec. 284. Damages       ``(a) In General.--Upon finding for the claimant the court      shall award the claimant damages adequate to compensate for      the infringement but in no event less than a reasonable      royalty for the use made of the invention by the infringer,      together with interest and costs as fixed by the court,      subject to the provisions of this section.       ``(b) Determination of Damages; Evidence Considered;      Procedure.--The court may receive expert testimony as an aid      to the determination of damages or of what royalty would be      reasonable under the circumstances. The admissibility of such      testimony shall be governed by the rules of evidence      governing expert testimony. When the damages are not found by      a jury, the court shall assess them.       ``(c) Standard for Calculating Reasonable Royalty.--       ``(1) In general.--The court shall determine, based on the      facts of the case and after adducing any further evidence the      court deems necessary, which of the following methods shall      be used by the court or the jury in calculating a reasonable      royalty pursuant to subsection (a). The court shall also      identify the factors that are relevant to the determination      of a reasonable royalty, and the court or jury, as the case      may be, shall consider only those factors in making such      determination.       ``(A) Entire market value.--Upon a showing to the      satisfaction of the court that the claimed invention's      specific contribution over the prior art is the predominant      basis for market demand for an infringing product or process,      damages may be based upon the entire market value of that      infringing product or process.       ``(B) Established royalty based on marketplace licensing.--     Upon a showing to the satisfaction of the court that the      claimed invention has been the subject of a nonexclusive      license for the use made of the invention by the infringer,      to a number of persons sufficient to indicate a general      marketplace recognition of the reasonableness of the      licensing terms, if the license was secured prior to the      filing of the case before the court, and the court determines      that the infringer's use is of substantially the same scope,      volume, and benefit of the rights granted under such license,      damages may be determined on the basis of the terms of such      license. Upon a showing to the satisfaction of the court that      the claimed invention has sufficiently similar noninfringing      substitutes in the relevant market, which have themselves      been the subject of such nonexclusive licenses, and the court      determines that the infringer's use is of substantially the      same scope, volume, and benefit of the rights granted under      such licenses, damages may be determined on the basis of the      terms of such licenses.       ``(C) Valuation calculation.--Upon a determination by the      court that the showings required under subparagraphs (A) and      (B) have not been made, the court shall conduct an analysis      to ensure that a reasonable royalty is applied only to the      portion of the economic value of the infringing product or      process properly attributable to the claimed invention's      specific contribution over the prior art. In the case of a      combination invention whose elements are present individually      in the prior art, the contribution over the prior art may      include the value of the additional function resulting from      the combination, as well as the enhanced value, if any, of      some or all of the prior art elements as part of the      combination, if the patentee demonstrates that value.       ``(2) Additional factors.--Where the court determines it to      be appropriate in determining a reasonable royalty under      paragraph (1), the court may also consider, or direct the      jury to consider, any other relevant factors under applicable      law.       ``(d) Inapplicability to Other Damages Analysis.--The      methods for calculating a reasonable royalty described in      subsection (c) shall have no application to the calculation      of an award of damages that does not necessitate the      determination of a reasonable royalty as a basis for monetary      relief sought by the claimant.       ``(e) Willful Infringement.--       ``(1) Increased damages.--A court that has determined that      an infringer has willfully infringed a patent or patents may      increase damages up to 3 times the amount of the damages      found or assessed under subsection (a), except that increased      damages under this paragraph shall not apply to provisional      rights under section 154(d).       ``(2) Permitted grounds for willfulness.--A court may find      that an infringer has willfully infringed a patent only if      the patent owner presents clear and convincing evidence that      acting with objective recklessness--       ``(A) after receiving written notice from the patentee--       ``(i) alleging acts of infringement in a manner sufficient      to give the infringer an objectively reasonable apprehension      of suit on such patent, and       ``(ii) identifying with particularity each claim of the      patent, each product or process that the patent owner alleges      infringes the patent, and the relationship of such product or      process to such claim,     the infringer, after a reasonable opportunity to investigate,      thereafter performed 1 or more of the alleged acts of      infringement;       ``(B) the infringer intentionally copied the patented      invention with knowledge that it was patented; or       ``(C) after having been found by a court to have infringed      that patent, the infringer engaged in conduct that was not      colorably different from the conduct previously found to have      infringed the patent, and which resulted in a separate      finding of infringement of the same patent.       ``(3) Limitations on willfulness.--       ``(A) In general.--A court may not find that an infringer      has willfully infringed a patent under paragraph (2) for any      period of time during which the infringer had an informed      good faith belief that the patent was invalid or      unenforceable, or would not be infringed by the conduct later      shown to constitute infringement of the patent.       ``(B) Good faith established.--An informed good faith      belief within the meaning of subparagraph (A) may be      established by--       ``(i) reasonable reliance on advice of counsel;       ``(ii) evidence that the infringer sought to modify its      conduct to avoid infringement once it had discovered the      patent; or       ``(iii) other evidence a court may find sufficient to      establish such good faith belief.       ``(C) Relevance of not presenting certain evidence.--The      decision of the infringer not to present evidence of advice      of counsel is not relevant to a determination of willful      infringement under paragraph (2).       ``(4) Limitation on pleading.--Before the date on which a      court determines that the patent in suit is not invalid, is      enforceable, and has been infringed by the infringer, a      patentee may not plead and a court may not determine that an      infringer has willfully infringed a patent. The court's      determination of an infringer's willfulness shall be made      without a jury.''.       (b) Report to Congressional Committees.--       (1) In general.--Not later than 2 years after the date of      enactment of this Act, the Director shall report to the      Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate and the Committee on      the Judiciary of the House of Representatives, the findings      and recommendations of the Director on the operation of prior      user rights in selected countries in the industrialized      world. The report shall include the following:       (A) A comparison between patent laws of the United States      and the laws of other industrialized countries, including the      European Union, Japan, Canada, and Australia.       (B) An analysis of the effect of prior user rights on      innovation rates in the selected countries.       (C) An analysis of the correlation, if any, between prior      user rights and start-up enterprises and the ability to      attract venture capital to start new companies.       (D) An analysis of the effect of prior user rights, if any,      on small businesses, universities, and individual inventors.       (E) An analysis of legal and constitutional issues, if any,      that arise from placing trade secret law in patent law.       (2) Consultation with other agencies.--In preparing the      report required under paragraph (1), the Director shall      consult with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General.       (c) Defense to Infringement Based on Earlier Inventor.--     Section 273(b)(6) of title 35, United States Code, is amended      to read as follows:       ``(6) Personal defense.--The defense under this section may      be asserted only by the person who performed or caused the      performance of the acts necessary to establish the defense as      well as any other entity that controls, is controlled by, or      is under common control with such person and, except for any      transfer to the patent owner, the right to assert the defense      shall not be licensed or assigned or transferred to another      person except as an ancillary and subordinate part of a good      faith assignment or transfer for other reasons of the entire      enterprise or line of business to which the defense relates.      Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, any person may, on      its own behalf, assert a defense based on the exhaustion of      rights provided under paragraph (3), including any necessary      elements thereof.''.       (d) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section      shall apply to any civil action commenced on or after the      date of enactment of this Act.     SEC. 5.

The existence of a substantial new question of      patentability is not precluded by the fact that a patent,      printed publication, or other evidence was previously      considered by the Office.''.       (d) Request for Inter Partes Reexamination.--Section 311(a)      of title 35, United States Code, is amended to read as      follows:       ``(a) In General.--Any third-party requester at any time      may file a request for inter partes reexamination by the      Office of a patent on the basis of any prior art or      documentary evidence cited under paragraph (1) or (3) of      subsection (a) of section 301 of this title.''.
