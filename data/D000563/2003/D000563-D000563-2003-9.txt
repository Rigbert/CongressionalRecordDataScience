I might just add something I have said in the Senate and I told Senator Byrd during the debate on Iraq. I went to my church in Chicago with my wife--this is highly unusual in my church--as we came back from communion, and we are kneeling, an elderly man came up to me and leaned over on his way back from communion and he said: Stick with Bob Byrd.  I came back to tell Senator Byrd that his message reached beyond this Chamber and beyond the State of West Virginia. It has been not only heard, but it has been applauded by the Nation of grateful people who are glad you are here in service to our country and continue to be. If you reach the age of Methuselah, Abraham, Isaac, or Moses, I hope I am still here to defer to you and listen carefully as you make these presentations.
