President, I have two amendments that I believe are very significant. However, I don't believe they will clear, and that is the reason I will not be bringing them up. But it is important we do address the problems. The Military Leasing Act prohibits military installations from receiving any revenues from mineral exploration of these lands. Exploration has taken place in Oklahoma and other places, where we have, with the new horizontal drilling, been able to get at some of these reserves. The problem is that this incurs an expense by the military operations. The one I am talking about right now happens to be the depot in McCallister, OK. Under the Mineral Leasing Act that governs oil and gas leasing on Federal lands, it gives the responsibility to the Bureau of Land Management.  The problem is, we want to explore it and accommodate others who are going after these tremendous reserves and not just in Oklahoma but elsewhere. But there is not a mechanism by which they can be paid for expenses incurred by the local installation. We are going to be working on this and coming up with some kind of a solution. I will not be offering this as an amendment.  The second one I will not be offering is one that is very significant, which is treating what we refer to as the sub-S, or subpart-S carriers, nonscheduled carriers, that are currently taking materiel and personnel into areas such as Afghanistan. We have crew rest responsibilities, saying they cannot be--acrew cannot be working for more than 15 hours. The problem is this: 95 percent of the military personnel going into Afghanistan and some of these other areas go in by subpart-S operators. They are exempt from the crew rest. Right now, there is legislation that is pending that would make them fall under the crew rest requirements.  Military can take them in, but military doesn't have the capacity. That is why 40 percent of all materiel and 95 percent of personnel are being brought into these zones. As an example, if they are going from the logical place, which would be in Germany to go into Afghanistan, they would carry it in, but they would not be able to offload whatever cargo or personnel and then get back and go to Stuttgart or whatever location it is in Germany because that would exceed crew rest.  On the other hand, they are precluded from having civilian aircraft staying in places such as Afghanistan. So there is no solution to it. We want to address this. We are going to try to do it. We feel this will not clear as it is now. So I will not be offering it tonight, but it is one I think is very significant.  With that, I yield the floor.          Amendments Nos. 1094, 1095, 1096, and 1101 Withdrawn
