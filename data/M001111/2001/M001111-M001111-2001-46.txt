 President, methamphetamine production and use has had a devastating effect on many communities across our country, and tackling this problem has been very challenging to law enforcement.  Meth has a particularly large impact on my state. We rank number two in the nation in meth production and use. Last year, local law enforcement raided five times the number of meth labs than they did the year before in Washington.  The impact on our health and the environment are extensive. The byproducts of meth production are highly toxic and hazardous and pose serious threats to the public at large. Meth is produced with toxic chemicals and generates dangerous byproducts. Because manufacturing can take place in the basements of homes and other populated areas, innocent neighbors are often placed in danger by meth production. There are also serious safety issues due to the risk of fire and explosion associated with the chemicals involved. Furthermore, the toxins that are used and discarded as a part of meth production have serious and long term impacts on the environment, and the clean-up cost are substantial.  The use of this drug can also have a severe impact on families and children. People who use and make meth put children and their families at risk of hazardous contamination and often live in unsanitary conditions. Meth uses also tend to emotionally and physically abuse those around them.  With that, I yield to my colleague from the state of Washington, a member of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Cantwell.
