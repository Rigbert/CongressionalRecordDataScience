Speaker. I rise today to recognize the Charles County Chamber of Commerce on the occasion of its sixtieth anniversary. Since its establishment in 1956, with Reed McDonagh as its first President, the Chamber has provided a boost to the local business community through educational seminars, public forums business development strategies, and a strong voice for the needs of its members. Working in partnership with the county government, the public school system, and local community leaders, the Chamber continues to contribute to the goal of ensuring that Charles County grows and remains a great place to do business.  With each passing decade, the Charles County Chamber of Commerce has taken creative steps to fulfill its mission to support its members and advance the county as a leader for economic growth and private sector job creation in Southern Maryland through its effective advocacy, high level networking and timely communications.  The Chamber has always dedicated itself to the mission of making Charles County a great place to invest, work, and grow a business. In its first years the Chamber gave rise to the Committee of 100, which later became the county's Economic Development Commission. In the 1970's, it established the Annual Trade Show to introduce local businesses, large and small, to county residents and to promote available services. In the decade that followed, it launched a scholarship program in memory of U.S. Navy Seabee diver, Robert D. Stethem, a Charles County resident and an early victim of the War on Terrorism, an example of the many ways it has worked to strengthen the local community over the years.  The Chamber created a memorial ``Business of the Year'' Award honoring Reed McDonagh in the 1990's to recognize a business that provides exceptional leadership in advancing the mission of the Chamber and its core principles. Around that time as well. the Chamber played a vital role in advocating for the importance of the Naval Surface Warfare Center. Indian Head Division, during the BRAC Commission process, in which I was proud to help lead the fight to keep these installations open and an integral part of Southern Maryland's culture and economy.  In recent years, the Chamber has played a critical role in working with federal, state, and local officials to help businesses and families get back on their feet after a devastating tornado, bringing a minor league team to thecounty, and forging a new international partnership through the Sister City program. The Chamber has also been an active member of the Tri-County Council of Southern Maryland. Now located in La Plata, its services are easily accessible to residents and businesses across Charles County, and it has broadened its efforts to take advantage of new developments in the region through its Young Professionals Group and Military Alliance Council.  Throughout its history, the Chamber has sought to provide resources, gain insight, and develop and advocate for solutions which continue making our local economy stronger and more vibrant. The Chamber prides itself on its commitment to helping members grow and prosper, and I hope my colleagues will join me in saluting the great work it has done over the past six decades. I look forward to continuing to work in partnership with the Chamber as it continues to help make Charles County a great place live and do business.                          ____________________
