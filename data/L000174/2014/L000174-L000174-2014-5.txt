Green Mountain Power, with its CEO and President Mary Powell at the helm, is the perfect example of the progress our State has made and should serve as an example for the rest of the Nation.  Mary was recently named the 2014 Power-Gen Woman of the Year. Mary is a leader and trailblazer in the power industry. She took the reins of Green Mountain Power, GMP, in 2008 and has transformed it into Vermont's ``energy company of the future.'' Mary is truly committed to the idea that energy can spur socioeconomic change forVermonters and strives to help people save money and move toward more renewable sources. Under her leadership, GMP has launched successful initiatives to improve the company's quality of service, through providing low carbon, low cost, and reliable power to Vermonters.  Recently, Mary led Green Mountain Power in becoming the first utility in the world to receive B corporation certification. B corporations use the power of business to solve social and environmental problems. Mary wants Green Mountain Power to not only be the best utility in the world but the best for the world.  Mary is among the very few women who have achieved this level of success in the utility industry. I am grateful for the work she has done for the State of Vermont. She is redefining success in the energy industry, and I congratulate her on receiving the 2014 Power-Gen Woman of the Year Award.  I ask unanimous consent that the Burlington Free Press article ``Mary Powell Named Woman of the Year'' recognizing Mary for her achievements be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:            [From the Burlington Free Press, Dec. 10, 2014]                  Mary Powell Named Woman of the Year    Power generation industry group cites her advancements, outreach       The leader of Vermont's largest utility was named woman of      the year at her industry's largest trade show this week.       Mary Powell, president and CEO of Green Mountain Power in      Colchester, was named Power-Gen 2014 Woman of the Year.      Powell was selected because of how she has advanced the power      generation industry and for her community involvement.       Powell received the award at the 2014 Power-Gen Woman of      the Year Awards Dinner Monday in Florida as part of Power-Gen      International, the largest trade show in the world for the      power generation industry. She is scheduled to give the      keynote address today during the Women in Power Luncheon.       In a statement, Powell called the award an ``incredible      honor.''       ``Energy can be transformational in moving customers and      society to a more secure and environmentally sound future,      and we are determined to lead the way,'' Powell said. ``GMP      is partnering with customers to accelerate the pace of change      as Vermont's energy company of the future.''       Jennifer Runyon, chairwoman of the Women in Power      Committee, called Powell a ``trailblazer.''       ``We hope that our award will inspire young women to not      only consider careers in the power industry, but also show      them that dedication and hard work can lead to brilliant      results,'' Runyon said in a statement.       David Crane, president and CEO of NRG, a large utility with      headquarters in Princeton, New Jersey, and Houston, said in a      statement that Powell ``starts with the heretical notion of      giving the modern-day energy consumer what they want--which      is affordable, convenient, clean and storm-resistant energy--     and then uses her native intelligence, charm and drive to      make sure it happens.''       GMP said it is collaborating with NRG to make Vermont a      ``leader'' in sustainable energy. Beginning early next year,      the partnership will bring ``innovative, cost-effective clean      energy products and services to Vermont,'' according to a      statement from the Vermont utility.                          ____________________
