Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to an institution in California's 43rd Congressional District that is celebrating a milestone this week. La Sierra University is celebrating 75 years of service to students in the Riverside area, as well as students worldwide. La Sierra University has shown a strong commitment to the education of our community and I would like to especially recognize Lawrence T. Geraty, the university's current president. Mr. Geraty's leadership and dedication will prepare La Sierra University for the transition into the next millennium.  La Sierra first opened in 1922 as La Sierra Academy with 84 students. In 1927, the school became Southern California Junior College, and, in 1939, the school was renamed La Sierra College with the addition of a variety of four-year programs. After merging with Loma Linda University in 1967, La Sierra College became the La Sierra campus of Loma Linda University. La Sierra once again became an independent institution in February 1990, assuming its current title as La Sierra University. In the meantime, the professional Schools of Education, Business and Management, and Religion were added.  The campus is currently expanding by developing an additional 350 acres of land. La Sierra University has also added a variety of new programs, including offering a Masters degree in Business Administration and a minor in gender studies, with their curriculum continuing to grow. They were recently chosen by the John Templeton Foundation for its 1997-1998 Honor Roll of Character-Building Colleges. They also recently received an accreditation from the National Association of Schools of Music for their music department, as well as certification from the Western Association of Colleges and Schools. La Sierra University is also home to the four-time international championship team of students competing in the Students in Free Enterprise (SIFE). SIFE is a national organization which is supported by the Walton family, founders of Wal-Mart, that encourages entrepreneurship and community service by students interested in business. SIFE is an instrumental organization on campus, organizing tutoring, recycling and other service programs. In addition to these activities, SIFE has also been involved in several business ventures. As a result, La Sierra University gives students the atmosphere, guidance, and moral foundation needed to succeed in today's competitive job market.  I would like to commend La Sierra University for their commitment to the worldwide scholastic community. Over 1,500 students are currently enrolled, representing more than 60 countries. I encourage and support La Sierra University in continuing to set and meet its outstanding goals in the area of education for decades to come. On behalf of the residents of the 43rd Congressional District, I would like to thank La Sierra University for its contributions and dedicated service to the community, and wish them great success with their 75th anniversary celebration.                          ____________________
