Chairman, I would inform the gentlewoman, and I appreciate the question, the answer is no. I know that you and some of your other colleagues have serious concerns about the peanut program. I want to assure you that the Committee on Agriculture has heard those concerns and is working on some real policy changes and a plan to reform the program.  It is my hope that we can come to an agreement on a reform plan that all the Members of this body will be happy with and that we can avoid a protracted floor fight at the time of the farm bill. With that in mind, I would ask the gentlewoman if she would consider withdrawing her amendment and let us continue the progress, and let me add, we are making real progress, to address your concerns about this program and the concerns of the growers and everybody connected with the program.
