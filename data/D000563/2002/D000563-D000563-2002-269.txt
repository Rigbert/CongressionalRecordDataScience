President, I would like to commend the conferees to the Export-Import Bank Reauthorization, S. 1372, and particularly Senators Bayh and Dodd, for preserving language that helps protect the U.S. steel industry from illegal dumping.  By facilitating foreign purchases of U.S. goods and services that might not otherwise be possible, the Bank helps promote economic growth at home and abroad. Since its creation in 1934, the Export-Import Bank of the United States, has helped several Illinois companies, such as Caterpillar and Motorola, finance exports to foreign countries. However, there have been some instances in which the Ex-Im Bank has lent support to foreign companies that have engaged in dumping products, including steel, into U.S. markets. Such support is inconsistent with our desire for a strong domestic steel industry and our belief in a level playing field for international commerce.  The reauthorization legislation that passed the Senate today requires significantly increased scrutiny of transactions that could adversely impact domestic industries. Furthermore, it prohibits the extension of a loan or guarantee to any company or country subject to a determination of injury under Section 201 by the International Trade Commission (ITC) or subject to a countervailing duty or anti-dumping order. This is a significant step forward and I am pleased to have aided in this effort.
