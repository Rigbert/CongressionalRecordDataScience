 President, I will be very brief and then I will be prepared to relinquish whatever time I have.  According to the Office of Tax Analysis of the U.S. Treasury, last year, January 7, 2003, I repeat, small business owners, entrepreneurs, and farmers account for more than two-thirds of the top bracket income tax returns and receive 79 percent of the top bracket tax relief. That is what this amendment is all about. I hope the Senate will approve it.  I have no further observations to make, if the Senator would like to make his motion.
