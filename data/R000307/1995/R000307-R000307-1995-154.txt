If they do not, if the risks are greater, then the EPA should and does have the authority to ban the use of any kind of product on an emergency basis.  In regard to risk-benefit, and I will sum up, and this is the whole issue, my word, when we talk about gridlock, when we talk about time consumed on this issue, 14 years; more than that, 15 or 20 years? People crawl out of train wrecks faster than we handle the food safety laws around here.  We have a good bill, H.R. 1627. We need to move on it. I think we have good bipartisan support. However, this bill will, at least by peer review, describe risk assessment so the American public knows what the real risk is.  I think common sense would tell us and the American people should understand that in this debate what we are in far greater danger of, harm in regard to these kinds of risks, are from lightning, dog bites, drowning, falling down, too much sunshine, certainly smoking, certainly if we get into the smart juice; or getting in our cars to drive to the grocery store to eliminate the products that some say are unsafe, you are in greater danger of having a car wreck going down to the grocery store in regards to the products. I find it incredible that some in our country would legalize drugs and ban apples.  The whole point is I think if we had a cost-benefit yardstick here, or a description that every American could understand, we could put the food safety debate in proper perspective. We could get to risk assessment that would not endanger the apple industry or anybody else that would be in the barrel in regards to these unmitigated attacks on agriculture, and the risk-benefit or the risk assessment would be based, certainly, on sound public opinion.
