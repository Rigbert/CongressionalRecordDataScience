  According to the CRS on this point, the data is not available to determine if, in fact, most plans--private plans, that is--provide abortion services.  In fact, some of the largest insurers, like Mutual of Omaha, again, according to the CRS, do not provide these services.  To make it clear, the private sector is just not an issue here. We always hear the mantra that pro-lifers are somehow out of touch in trying to turn the clock back on women.  The problem with the other side is that they totally disregard the children that are involved in these difficult cases. I would like to move the clock forward for these children, not back, as the other side would like to do.  As far as being out of touch, the other side is out of touch with protecting these children, many of whom are going to be the future women of America.  Now, when you get past the gobbledygook of the proabortionists and you really look at this amendment, you will see it has nothing to do with the overall issue of abortion rights.  That is the part of the Constitution, I am saying, that is the law of the land. That is not the issue. The issue is the other Supreme Court decision that says the taxpayers do not have to pay for abortions. They do not have a constitutional right for the taxpayers to pay for abortions.  Mr. President, the issue is whether it should be a taxpayers' subsidy which, under law, we can do.  Those who want you and the taxpayers to fund these abortions are the ones who are really out of step. The vast majority of Americans, you see, do not support their taxpayers' money being used to pay for abortions. It is those who flaunt this majority that are out of touch with the American people.  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment of the Senator from Oklahoma and stand up for the taxpayers and the children of America.
