President, today I join my friend from Oregon, Senator Smith, in the introduction of the Steens Mountain Wilderness Act of 2000. Located in southeastern Oregon, Steens Mountain is, in the words of Oregon environmentalist, Andy Kerr, ``an ecological island in the sky.'' Rising a mile above the desert floor, Steens Mountain actually creates its own weather patterns. Though we from Oregon are blessed to have it locatedwithin our state boundary, it is truly a National natural treasure.  Some have wondered why any legislative action at all is needed to protect the Steens. They say the Steens has been there a long time and is doing just fine. Why not just leave it alone?  There are three reasons why inaction at this time is an unacceptable choice.  First, there are many landowners today in the Steens with a commitment to protect this ecological treasure. There is no assurance that this will always be the case.  Second, our federal land agencies are now committed to protecting the natural ecology of the Steens. There is no assurance that this will always be the case.  Third, the Steens includes many wilderness study areas. We now have the opportunity to begin resolving the status of these lands that have been in limbo for twenty years. There is no assurance that Oregon's future elected officials, working with all concerned parties, will ever again have such a unique opportunity to address this contentious issue.  The fact of the matter is that protecting the ecological health of the Steens isn't going to happen by osmosis. It has taken the hard work of the Oregon Congressional delegation, Governor Kitzhaber, Secretary Babbitt and numerous staff and private citizens of Oregon to get this legislation where it is today. It will take a bit more hard work to get a Senate-passed bill.  It is my task, as a United States Senator, to move this legislation forward through the committee hearing and Senate floor processes. In that context, this bill will most likely have to be fine-tuned to accommodate additional concerns. I look forward to working with all my colleagues to see that this bill is passed before the lights go down on the 106th Congress. But one major aspect of this bill can never change: the protections for the ecological treasure that is the Steens will be put in place while we also preserve the important historical ranching culture that thrives there.  There have been issues raised about the valuation of the land exchanges that make the adoption of over 170,000 acres of wilderness possible in this bill. Let me make it perfectly clear that this bill should stand or fall on whether there is significant public value at the end of the day. I believe the Senate will find that the expenditures authorized by this legislation purchase the sum of a greater public value than can be accounted for by its individual parts. I will continue to work to assure that this legislation achieves the greatest environmental good possible.                                 ______                                       By
