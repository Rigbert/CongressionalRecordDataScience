I have been pleased to have him as a partner over the years on legislation to eliminate these inhumane weapons, and I welcome the opportunity to do so again today. We want to send a message to the world that victim-activated landmines and other weapons designed to be victim-activated are beyond the pale. We have seen what they can do to our troops. We have seen what they do to a child who picks up one of these seemingly harmless objects, only to have it blow off an arm or worse. These weapons do not belong in the arsenals of civilized nations.
