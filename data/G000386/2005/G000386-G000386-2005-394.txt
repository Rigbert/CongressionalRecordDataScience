 President, October is Breast Cancer Month, and I wish to honor my wife, who is an 18-year survivor of breast cancer.  I don't often speak about this, but October is the month to raise money and bring attention to the plight of those who have breast cancer, most often with the idea in mind of adding to research for a cure of breast cancer.  My only opportunity to participate in this, besides a few remarks I make, is the second Saturday of October in Des Moines, IA, they have a 5K to raise money. Sixteen thousand of us participated in that 5K fundraiser in Des Moines, IA. I have nothing to brag about because it took me 28 minutes 6 seconds, but I was glad to have the opportunity to help raise money for the cause.  This morning, I would like to read a speech for my wife Barbara Grassley--today happens to be her 73rd birthday--about her personal challenge with breast cancer. Today is my wife's birthday, and it is fitting that we celebrate her victory over this.  Barbara's story is a familiar one. She had many busy years raising our five children, helping run the family farm, particularly during those years that I was in the State legislature, busy participating in community and church activities, and even at age 50 going back and finishing her BA degree at the University of Northern Iowa. Barbara never worried about her own health.
