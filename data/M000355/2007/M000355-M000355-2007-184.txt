 President, there is disheartening news coming out of Burma this morning. Last night, following yet another day of massive peaceful protests demanding political reform in Burma, the repressive Burmese regime imposed a nighttime curfew and banned all public gatherings of more than five people. Despite this brazen effort to muzzle freedom of expression, reports indicate that thousands of Buddhist monks and other protestors courageously defied the prohibition on public assembly and marched again in Rangoon. In response, reports indicate that the security forces of the State Peace and Development Council responded with typical brutality, beating and arresting scores of these brave protestors. It was reported that one person was shot to death and five received gunshot injuries.  Back in 1988, the regime responded to similar peaceful protests by massacring thousands of its own citizens. But the Burmese regime should know that things have changed in the intervening years. Modern technology has permitted photographs of those heroic protesters to be transmitted via the Internet around the entire world. Whereas before the news could be easily muzzled by the junta, today that is no longer the case. The world is watching, and any brutal steps taken in Rangoon are instantly made known in places such as New York, New Delhi, and Beijing. These moving images of heroism have certainly reached us here in Washington, DC.  As I have said before to the regime in Burma, we are watching you. To the people of Burma, we stand with you.
