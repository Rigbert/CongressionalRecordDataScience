 President, while I know that the Senate will not take up consideration of S. 625, The Auto Choice Reform Act of 1997, during the 105th Congress, I wanted to put my views regarding this legislation on the record.  S. 625 creates a federally mandated two-tracked automobile insurance system under which car owners would have the option to enroll in a ``personal protection system'' or the traditional ``tort maintenance system.'' Those who select the personal protection system are promised ``prompt recovery'' of economic loss, regardless of fault. However, they forfeit the right to recover damages for pain and suffering while being exempted from liability for such damages themselves.  I have some strong concerns regarding this type of so-called ``reform'' legislation.  First and foremost, I believe that the argument that ``Auto Choice'' will reduce insurance premiums is unfounded. Over the last few years, the numerous states that have adopted no-fault insurance programs similar to those in this legislation have had the highest premiums in the country. In fact, in 1995, 6 out of the 10 states with the highest average liability premiums were no-fault systems. In light of the failure of auto choice to lower premium costs, I cannot understand why we are seeking to put such a system into place across the country.  I am also greatly troubled by the fact that this bill involves an attempt by the federal government to impose a one-size-fits-all solution on the states. While I recognize that some reforms are necessary, I do not believe that federalizing our tort system, is, or should be the solution.  For more than 200 years, states have had the power to develop and refine their own tort systems. Supreme Court Justice Powell wisely observed: ``Our 50 states have developed a complicated and effective system of tort laws and where there have been problems, the states have acted to fix those problems.'' Mr. President, federally directed reform efforts such as those contained in S. 625 detract from the states' abilities to fashion their own initiatives and deny them the opportunity to provide solutions to meet their own particularized needs.  Furthermore, I am troubled by the fact that this bill allows people to waive their right to recover for noneconomic damages. Mr. President, such a provision could lead to a lifetime of pain and suffering for those who suffer massive injury in a car accident. In fact, that possibility is so high, no state, not one, allows its citizens to choose to waive their right of recovery for pain and suffering.  Consider the fact that in all likelihood people would ``choose'' to waive these rights when they are sitting in their den, filling out their insurance forms. Mr. President, I would argue that the timing of such a choice precludes the possibility of informed consent on the part of the consumer. No one can predict the future, people cannot say whether they will need to pursue recovery for some accident. I predict that, many of those who so choose will one day find that they guessed wrong. Mr. President, checking off a box on a form could forever cost someone the ability to seek damages for loss of a limb, blindness, loss of a child or permanent disfigurement. This legislation does not provide a choice, it opens people up to take an unnecessary chance.  This legislation contains another flaw in that it does not fully protect the rights of those who choose traditional tort protection. Someone who chooses tort law coverage can only seek complete access to the courts if the at-fault driver has also selected traditional tort law coverage. Thus, a victim in an accident has to hope to be lucky enough that the person that hits him has selected the ``right'' type of coverage. Again, what appear to be``choices'' in this bill are in effect risky chances.  Mr. President, if we revisit this issue in the future, I believe we must closely consider these factors. Ultimately, we must also note that we cannot advance reform without taking our federal system into consideration. What is right in Alabama, may not be proper for California, or North Dakota or Connecticut. States must play the preeminent role in setting the course for tort law reform. Common sense demands it, our legal traditions demand it, and our Constitution demands it.                          ____________________
