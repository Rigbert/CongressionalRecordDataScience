 President, the Senator from Kentucky and I joined together in this legislation because we believe that if the violence between the Palestinians and Israel is to end and the peace process is to gain any momentum, the Palestinian leadership must show it can muster the political will that is necessary to meet the commitments they made at Oslo.  Most people, I think, don't know what the Oslo accords were. In fact, the Oslo accords were letters that were sent between the Palestinian and Israeli leadership in 1993. Those letters became the Oslo accords.  I want to indicate what the Palestinians, over the signature of their chairman, Mr. Arafat, said they would do on September 9, 1993:       The PLO recognizes the right of the State of Israel to      exist in peace and security.       The PLO accepts United Nations Security Council Resolutions      242 and 338.       The PLO commits itself to the Middle East peace process,      and to a peaceful resolution of the conflict between the two      sides and declares that all outstanding issues relating to      permanent status will be resolved through negotiations.  These are not my words, these are the words of Chairman Arafat.  It goes on:       The PLO considers that the signing of the Declaration of      Principles constitutes a historic event, inaugurating a new      epoch of peaceful coexistence, free from violence and all      other acts which endanger peace and stability. Accordingly,      the PLO renounces the use of terrorism and other acts of      violence and will assume responsibility over all PLO elements      and personnel in order to assure their compliance, prevent      violence, and discipline violators.       In view of the promise of a new era and the signing of the      Declaration of Principles, and based on Palestinian      acceptance of Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, the      PLO affirms that those articles of the Palestinian Covenant      which deny Israel's right to exist, and the provisions of the      Covenant which are inconsistent [with the commitments of this      letter] are invalid.  For its part, Israel, under Prime Minister Rabin, in a letter to Chairman Arafat, stated:       I wish to confirm to you that in light of the PLO      commitments included in your letter, the Government of Israel      has decided to recognize the PLO as the representative of the      Palestinian people and commence negotiations with the PLO      within the Middle East peace process.  Mr. President, that was what formed the beginning of Oslo--not the end, but the beginning of the Oslo peace process. They were the necessary minimum threshold to begin that process--a recognition that Israel has the right to exist in peace and security and that the Palestinian people have a right to be represented in peace negotiations by representatives of their own choosing.  Unfortunately, since Camp David last year, the Palestinians have carried out more than 6,700 armed attacks against Israelis in a fundamental violation of their peace process commitments. This Palestinian campaign of terror has killed 155 Israelis, 114 of them civilians, and it has wounded another 1,500 Israelis.  As the Senator from Kentucky pointed out, whether it is a bomb that goes off in a pizza parlor, a discotheque, a school bus, or a shopping mall, this is the way that kind of violence has happened.  Now, Israel has responded. Some have criticized Israel for that response. Yet if Israel is not going to practice that kind of response, the violence--such as the incident that just happened in Jerusalem, I think, yesterday, when somebody dressed as an Orthodox Jew walking down the street with a bomb in his backpack, detonated the bomb when an Israeli officer came up to him--must stop. A group of schoolchildren were nearby, but luckily they were not injured. Many others were.  The subject here is terror, and no Israeli and no Palestinian should have to live with terror every day, when a child gets on that school bus, when a son goes to work, when a wife goes shopping, when friends meet at a cafe or pizzeria or go to a night club.  The bombings, the terror, and the violence must stop. The Palestinian use of this kind of terror over the past 10 months runs contrary to what is expected of a peace partner. Mr. Arafat must understand that allowing an atmosphere of violence and terror to continue will not and cannot lead to peace.  The bill we are proposing today, the Middle East Peace Compliance Act, sends that signal clearly and simply and says either the PLO live up to these commitments or we return to a pre-Oslo posture.  So it is a very simple and very straightforward bill based on these commitments. It calls for the President to issue a report addressing whether the PLO and the Palestinian Authority are in compliance with the fundamental commitments they have repeatedly made to renounce terrorism.  If the President is unable to find that the PLO or the Palestinian Authority is adhering to its commitments, it requires him to restrict nonhumanitarian assistance to the West Bank and Gaza and to impose one of two additional sanctions: Denial of visas to Palestinian Authority officials, or closing the Palestinian office in the United States.  I think this legislation is necessary to send a message that we cannot continue this kind of violence. We cannot see that letter abrogated in chapter and verse--the letter that became the foundation of PLO recognition, and the letter that became the foundation of the Oslo peace process.  Let me be clear. It is also my expectation that the Government of Israel, for its part, must continue to meet the commitments it has made to peace and continue to exercise restraint in reaction to these Palestinian terrorist acts.  Mr. President, we submit this legislation. Again, I am very delighted to work with the distinguished Senator from Kentucky. We have a bill and, as the Senator said, we will also offer this as an amendment to the foreign operations appropriations bill. I thank the Chair and the Senator. It has been a great pleasure to work with him.  I yield the floor.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1409       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Middle East Peace Compliance      Act of 2001''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) On September 9, 1993, Palestinian Liberation      Organization (PLO) Chairman Yasser Arafat made the following      commitments in an exchange of letters with Prime Minister of      Israel Yitzhak Rabin:       (A) ``The PLO recognizes the right of the State of Israel      to exist in peace and security.''.       (B) ``The PLO accepts United Nations Security Council      Resolutions 242 and 338'' pertaining to the cessation of      hostilities and the establishment of a just and lasting peace      in the Middle East.       (C) ``The PLO commits itself to the Middle East peace      process, and to a peaceful resolution of the conflict between      the two sides and declares that all outstanding issues      relating to permanent status will be resolved through      negotiations.''.       (D) ``The PLO considers that the signing of the Declaration      of Principles constitutes a historic event, inaugurating a      new epoch of peaceful coexistence, free from violence and all      other acts which endanger peace and stability. Accordingly,      the PLO renounces the use of terrorism and other acts of      violence and will assume responsibility over all PLO elements      and personnel in order to assure their compliance, prevent      violence and discipline violators.''.       (E) ``In view of the promise of a new era and the signing      of the Declaration of Principles and based on Palestinian      acceptance of Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, the      PLO affirms that those articles of the Palestinian Covenant      which deny Israel's right to exist, and the provisions of the      Covenant which are inconsistent with the commitments of this      letter are now inoperative and no longer valid.''.       (2) The Palestinian Authority, the governing body of      autonomous Palestinian territories, was created as a result      of the agreements between the PLO and the State of Israel      that are a direct outgrowth of the September 9, 1993,      commitments.       (3) The United States Congress has provided authorities to      the President to suspend certain statutory restrictions      relating to the PLO, subject to Presidential certification      that the PLO has continued to abide by commitments made.     SEC. 3. REPORTS.       (a) In General.--The President shall, at the times      specified in subsection (b), transmit to Congress a report--       (1) detailing and assessing the steps that the PLO or the      Palestinian Authority, as appropriate, has taken to      substantially comply with its 1993 commitments, as specified      in section 2(1) of this Act;       (2) a description of the steps taken by the PLO or the      Palestinian Authority, as appropriate, to investigate and      prosecute those responsible for violence against American and      Israeli citizens;       (3) making a determination as to whether the PLO or the      Palestinian Authority, as appropriate, has substantially      complied with such commitments during the period since the      submission of the preceding report, or, in the case of the      initial report, during the preceding 6-month period; and       (4) detailing progress made in determining the designation      of the PLO, or one or more of its constituent groups      (including Fatah and Tanzim) or groups operating as arms of      the Palestinian Authority (including Force 17) as a foreign      terrorist organization, in accordance with section 219(a) of      the Immigration and Nationality Act.       (b) Transmission.--The initial report required under      subsection (a) shall be transmitted not later than 30 days      after the date of enactment of this Act.

SEC. 4. IMPOSITION OF SANCTIONS.
