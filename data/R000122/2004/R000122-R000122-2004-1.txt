President, I rise to commend J.B. Hudson, who is retiring after 42 outstanding years of Federal service to the United States Army.  In 1962, Mr. Hudson began his Government career at Fort Eustis, VA, as a management analyst with the Office of the Assistant Chief of Staff, Comptroller. While pursuing his civilian career, Mr. Hudson also served as an Army reservist, 1963-1969, and continued his post graduate education earning a masters of personnel administration from George Washington University, 1969. In 1966, he accepted a position at Fort Monroe, VA, where he served as a management analyst with the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff, Comptroller; and later, as chief, Management Improvement Branch, Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff, Resource Management from 1973-1975.  Since 1975, Mr. Hudson has been with the Office of the Administrative Assistant to the Secretary of the Army serving in a number of senior leadership positions, including deputy director and director, studies and analyses staff, 1975-1977; director, plans and projects, 1977-1979, director, policy and plans/safety, security and support services--Washington, 1979-1995, and deputy administrative assistant, 1995-1996. In over 42 years of Government service, Mr. Hudson has received numerous honors and awards, including the Meritorious Civilian Service Award and the Decoration for Exceptional Civilian Service.  Mr. Hudson is an extraordinary leader who recognizes that people are his most important resource. He epitomizes leadership by example, perpetuating a work environment in which harmony, resilience, and productivity reign. In the days following the terrorist attack on the Pentagon, he faced his toughest leadership challenge. Not only did he have to deal with the tragic loss of 40 staff members and the injury of many more, he also had to lead the effort of restoring calm and productivity to the agency, the Army, and the Pentagon, minimizing any disruption of support to the Army and OSD.  As the overseer of the Defense Post Office, Mr. Hudson faced the possibility of receiving mail contaminated with chemical or biological agents since the Pentagon's mail is processed through the same facility where two United States Postal Service workers died from exposure of mail contaminated with anthrax spores. Working in collaboration with Defense Department and White House officials, Mr. Hudson quickly assessed the threat and developed courses of defense.  His reputation for initiating leading-edge business practices is widely recognized. His vision, adaptability, and passion for customer success have enabled him to gain recognition for the Office of the Administrative Assistant to the Secretary of the Army as a preferred support provider throughout Headquarters, Department of the Army, and Defense Department activities within the Pentagon and the National Capital Area.  Mr. Hudson has been a focused and competent defender of the Army's limited resources and is absolutely committed to achieving operational excellence. In more recent years, he consistently used his keen business acumen, technical expertise, political savvy, and resourcefulness to proficiently position the agency for the best business results.  Mr. Hudson is a superior advisor, astute negotiator, and superb administrator who can operate comfortably in all environments. His ability to bring divergent parties together and forge a common vision to achieve desired outcomes is renowned. His mastery of unique Defense Department and National Capitol Region relationships has enabled him to consistently produce quality results, even on the most contentious and complex issues. Perhaps the best examples of Mr. Hudson's ability to build coalitions and achieve results for the Army and the Department of Defense are evident in his management of the Army's executive aircraft fleet and his championing of the Pentagon Athletic Facility. In the first initiative, Mr. Hudson worked with Defense Department and Congressional representatives to acquire two state-of-the-art executive airplanes. As the overseer of the Pentagon's 55-year old athletic center, Mr. Hudson realized that the aging infrastructure of the current facility and the growing demand for fitness facilities in support of the Army's readiness mission required quick action. Once again, he negotiated prime real estate at the Pentagon for the construction of a new facility and fought for and won funding for the $19 million project that offers a state-of-the-art facility comparable to well-known commercial fitness facilities.  Mr. Hudson's distinctive accomplishments, selflessness, dedication, commitment to excellence, and willingness to ``go the extra mile'' in supporting the Department of the Army, the Department of Defense and Joint Service activities in the Pentagon truly set a standard of excellence for others to follow. Mr. Hudson's distinctive accomplishments and selfless service in support of the Defense of our great nation truly set a standard of excellence worthy of emulation. I thank him on behalf of a grateful Nation and wish him well in his retirement.                          ____________________
