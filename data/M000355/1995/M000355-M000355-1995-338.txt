 President, I rise today to recognize an outstanding Kentucky educator who has dedicated her life to serving the Catholic Church. Sister Ruth Gehres is retiring as president of Brescia College on September 15, 1995.  Sister Gehres is in her 10th year as president of the 4-year Catholic liberal arts college. She first came to Brescia College in 1967 as a teacher, a job that kept her extremely busy. She taught English, journalism, literature, linguistics, and elementary German to the hundreds of students enrolled at the campus. In 1986, her hard work and dedication paid off, she was named president of Brescia College, the third in the school's history.  Sister Gehres has seen many changes at Brescia College over the years. During her tenure, she was responsible for the new campus center, the acquisition of the former Western Kentucky Gas headquarters for the Lechner Graduate Center, the creation of a master's degree in management program, and a partnership with Mercy Hosptial to create a wellness center.  The Evansville, IN, native is a graduate of Mount St. Joseph Academy and Brescia College. She has a doctorate from St. Louis University. She also spent several years teaching elementary school in Nebraska and in Hodgenville and Owensboro, KY.  While Brescia College will miss Sister Gehres after her departure, the Catholic Church will remain a big part of her life. She plans to take a sabbatical to prepare for a new ministry. While she is unsure what field she will pursue, Sister Gehres recently told Owensboro's Messenger Enquirer she plans to seek a field that ``engages my gifts and serves the church which also allows time for reflection and--I would hope--writing.''  Mr. President, I ask you and my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to Sister Ruth Gehres. I commend her for her outstanding service to Brescia college. She has played a major role in making the Catholic college the quality institution that it is today. Her hard work, expertise, and kindness will certainly be missed by students, faculty, and fellow administrators.                          ____________________
