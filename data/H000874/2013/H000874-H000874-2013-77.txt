Speaker, put the Senate's clean compromise bill that gets our government open--the government of the people of the United States--and then let's go to conference on the budget, as Democrats have long called for, to resolve our differences and achieve a long-term solution.  A shutdown is not a political strategy; it is a failure for our country. We need a government that is open and that works for all of our people. Let us have a vote on the Senate's bill to reopen our government--at the number you put in your bill and that you sent to the Senate, on which we will now agree.
