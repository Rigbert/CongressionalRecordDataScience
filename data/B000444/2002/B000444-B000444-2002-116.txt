 Res. 253, which condemns the growing intolerance and acts of persecution against Jews in many European countries.  The Resolution urges European governments to own up to this growing evil, to reject any excuse for it, to use every tool at hand to combat these crimes, and to punish the criminals.  Finally, the Resolution calls upon European governments to cultivate an atmosphere of cooperation and reconciliation among the continent's Jewish and non-Jewish residents.  Making Jews scapegoats for societal ills has an ominous history. The Nazis' Holocaust was preceded by centuries of gradually increasing anti-Semitism--first by religious dogma, then by racial pseudo-theories--spread through preaching, villainous written propaganda, exclusionary laws, and finally pogroms and massacres.  The so-called civilized governments of the twentieth century largely remained silent and failed to confront the rising tide of anti-Jewish persecution. As a result, they set the stage for the murder of the vast majority of European Jewry.  Some of the individuals committing anti-Semitic acts today are the affluent beneficiaries of unprecedented Western European prosperity. Some may be bigots. Others may simply be ignorant of the hideous causality of the Holocaust, now more than fifty years in the past. Still others are mindless thugs.  In France, where a large number of violent attacks have occurred, many of the perpetrators are young anti-Israel Arab immigrants from North Africa who feel alienated from their host country.  Nearly all European leaders have condemned physical violence against Jews, although occasionally politicians have tempered their criticism with ill-considered advice. An unfortunate example of this was the well-intentioned Mayor of Berlin who, after a vicious attack on an Orthodox Jewish American tourist, warned Jewish Berliners that if they didn't want to be similarly beaten up on the street, they shouldn't wear clothing identifying them as Jews.  Rhetorical anti-Semitism has been met with even less principle. Instead, verbal expressions of anti-Semitism in Europe are increasingly being trivialized.  For example, we might consider the recent London dinner party at which the French Ambassador to the U.K. made a demeaning, scatological reference to the State of Israel. What happened when the story was leaked to the press? The major scandal was the so-called ``indiscretion'' of other guests for having revealed the French Ambassador's crude, bigoted, and amateurish behavior!  Or we might note the wife of Wim Duisenberg, the President of the European Central Bank, who after flying the PLO flag from her house in Amsterdam complained that ``Israel is being kept going by those rich Jews in America.'' Her highly respected husband removed the PLO flag but remained silent on her incendiary political commentary.  A similar example of objectivity came from Oslo where a member of the Norwegian Nobel Committee declared that she would like to rescind Shimon Peres's Nobel Peace Prize. Needless to say, she didn't choose to mention, let alone criticize, Yasser Arafat or the suicide bombers whom he aids and abets.  Even venerable European political institutions no longer seem immune to the anti-Semitic virus. Consider the blatant attempt to woo right-wing voters by Juergen Moellemann, one of the top officials of Germany's Free Democrats, a party with a proud history of liberalism and tolerance. Moellemann explained that the Deputy Director of the Central Council of Jews in Germany had brought on anti-Semitism himself by his supposedly aggressive behavior as a television talk-show host! If this weird argumentation weren't so dangerous, it might almost be funny. But it's not.  To Germany's credit, Moellemann's warped demagoguery has come in for massive public criticism, including from both Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and his conservative challenger Bavarian Minister-President Edmund Stoiber.  I want to believe that most Europeans reject the nauseating anti-Semitism of the last several months. I want to believe that a trans-Atlantic community of shared values still links us with the continent.  But without continuous efforts by European statesmen to combat anti-Semitism, my optimism may prove to be naive.  Instant communication means that how Europe responds to these acts of hatred matters around the world. Europe must make bigots, not Jews, its outcasts. No temporizing, no rationalizing, and no excuses.  Toward that end, I urge my colleagues to vote for S. Res. 253.  The committee amendment was agreed to.  The resolution (S. Res. 253), as amended, was agreed to.  The preamble was agreed to.  The resolution, as amended, with its preamble, reads as follows:                              S. Res. 253       Whereas many countries in Europe are protectors of human      rights and have stood as shining examples of freedom and      liberty to the world;       Whereas freedom of religion is guaranteed by all      Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)      participating states;       Whereas the 1990 Copenhagen Concluding Document declares      all participating OSCE States will ``unequivocally condemn''      anti-Semitism and take effective measures to protect      individuals from anti-Semitic violence;       Whereas anti-Semitism was one of the most destructive      forces unleashed during the last century;       Whereas there has been a startling rise in attacks on      Jewish community institutions in cities across Europe in the      last 18 months;       Whereas these violent incidents have targeted youth such as      an assault on a Jewish teen soccer team in Bondy, France on      April 11, 2002, and the brutal beating of two Jewish students      in Berlin, Germany, the burning of Jewish schools in Creteil      and Marseille, France and even the stoning of a bus carrying      Jewish schoolchildren;       Whereas attacks on Jewish houses of worship have been      reported in many cities including Antwerp, Brussels, and      Marseille and as recently as April 22 an automatic weapon      attack on a synagogue in Charleroi, Belgium;       Whereas the statue in Paris of Captain Alfred Dreyfus, who      was the victim of anti-Semitic accusations and became a      symbol of this prejudice in the last century, was defaced      with anti-Jewish emblems;       Whereas the French Ministry of Interior documented hundreds      of crimes against Jews and Jewish institutions in France in      just the first two weeks of April, 2002;       Whereas the revitalization of European right wing      movements, such as the strong showing of the National Front      party in France's presidential election, reaffirm the urgency      for governments to assert a strong public stance against      anti-Semitism, as well as other forms of xenophobia and      intolerance;       Whereas some government leaders have repeatedly dismissed      the significance of these attacks and attributed them to      hooliganism and Muslim immigrant youth expressing solidarity      with Palestinians;       Whereas the legitimization of armed struggle against      Israeli civilians by some governments voting in the U.N.      Commission on Human Rights has emboldened some individuals      and organizations to lash out against Jews and Jewish      institutions;       Whereas hostility, frustration and disaffection over      violence in the Middle East must never be permitted to      justify personal attacks on Jewish citizens;       Whereas when governments have raised a strong moral voice      against anti-Semitism and worked to promote and implement      educational initiatives which foster tolerance, we have seen      success; and       Whereas Congress recognizes the vital historical alliance      between nations of Europe and the United States and has high      regard for the commitment of our allies to fighting      discrimination, hatred, and violence on racial, ethnic, or      religious grounds: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved,       That (a) the Senate calls upon European governments to--       (1) acknowledge publicly and without reservation the anti-     Semitic character of the attacks as violations of human      rights;       (2) utilize the full power of their law enforcement tools      to investigate the crimes and punish the perpetrators;       (3) decry the rationalizing of anti-Jewish attitudes and      even violent attacks against Jews as merely a result of      justified popular frustration with the conflict in the Middle      East;       (4) take measures to protect and ensure the security of      Jewish citizens and their institutions, many of whom suffered      so grievously in Europe in the past century; and       (5) make a concerted effort to cultivate an atmosphere of      cooperation and reconciliation among the Jewish and non-     Jewish residents of Europe.       (b) Further, it is the sense of the Senate that--       (1) both Congress and the Administration should raise this      issue in their bilateral contacts;       (2) the State Department's Annual Country Reports on Human      Rights should thoroughly document this phenomenon, not just      in Europe but worldwide; and       (3) the Commission on International Religious Freedom      should continue to document and report on this phenomenon in      Europe and worldwide.                          ____________________
