President, it is my intent--and I will be doing it--but I want to give a chance for Senator Paul to be on the floor when I do this.  As we have said over and over again, Senator Reed and I have worked very closely in trying to get these amendments in place. I can remember inyears past, when there were people who objected to any amendments, we ended up without amendments, so we had to pass a bill that didn't have an open amendment process on the floor.  We wanted an open amendment process on the floor. I am talking about ``we'' being the Democrats, Republicans, and the leadership on both sides of the aisle. We have committed to that. We have tried to do that.  Unfortunately, under Senate rules, one Senator can stop and object to moving on an amendment. If that happens and continues, the same thing will happen. I can remember four times in the past when we ended up without any amendments at all because one person objected.  It is our intent to open it up so that people can offer their amendments, vote them down, vote them up--whatever we want to do.  Right now, we have several amendments, and I would like to make a motion to adopt them en bloc. These amendments are amendments that have been cleared on both sides. There are 10 of them. All 10 are germane amendments.  They are Ernst amendment No. 2289, Schatz No. 2441, Bennet No. 2617, Shaheen No. 2686, Heitkamp No. 2695, Lee No. 2723, Hatch No. 2755, Cruz No. 2598, and Tester No. 2818.  These 10 amendments are all germane. They cleared on both sides.  I ask unanimous consent that these amendments be called up en bloc.
