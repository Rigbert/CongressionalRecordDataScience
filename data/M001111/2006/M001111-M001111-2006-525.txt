 President, that sounds completely irresponsible to me, to send a false promise by some kind of sham vote that you are supporting veterans or Community Development Block Grant Programs or all the other programs that we hear from the other side. I heard the Senator from Pennsylvania say this will just tell the Appropriations Committee that this Senate says you are to spend that money.  I am the ranking member on the Transportation-HUD subcommittee. We are already looking at a transit cut of $100 million, an Amtrak cut, which I know the Senator from Pennsylvania cares about, a cut of $394 million, and the FAA is cut by $561 million, a safety factor.  I say to my colleague from North Dakota, I am completely worried about the irresponsible message that these amendments are sending and the sham that they are. I heard last night when I offered my amendment, the chairman of the Budget Committee said we were raising taxes to pay for our amendments on this side.  I want to ask this of the ranking member on the Budget Committee. My amendment I am offering today is to restore Community Development Block Grant Programs at a real, significant number. The $1 billion cut in the budget is irresponsible. Trying to pay for it out of sham money that is not there is irresponsible. We are asking for $1.3 billion by closing corporate tax loopholes. I heard those on the other side say that is raising taxes. I know my colleague, who happens to be the ranking member, who happens to be one of the most fiscally responsible Members on this side, is also a member of the Finance Committee. I would like to ask him, through the Chair, how he would respond to that being a tax increase.
