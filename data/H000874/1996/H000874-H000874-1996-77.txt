Chairman, this is an amendment similar to that of the gentleman from Virginia [Mr. Wolf] in that it extends buyouts by 60 days, and that is all it does, the time in which the agencies would have to affect the buyout.  Mr. Chairman, I believe the chairman of the committee is in agreement with this, and I believe that the chairman of the subcommittee is not in opposition to this, as well.
