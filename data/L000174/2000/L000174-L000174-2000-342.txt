President, because of the way in which the Senate last week ended its consideration of S.J. Res. 3, a proposed constitutional amendment on crime victims' rights, I did not have an opportunity to include in the Record a number of thoughtful editorials from across the country. I now ask unanimous consent to have a number of them printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the editorials were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:           [From the Asheville Citizen-Times, Apr. 25, 2000]                     Victims' Bill Seriously Flawed       Today, the United States Senate will vote on the joint      Senate Resolution proposing that a victims' rights amendment      be added to the U.S. Constitution. The amendment has been      endorsed by some 39 Attorneys General, by organizations such      as Racial Minorities for Victim Justice, as well as by the      presumptive Republican Presidential nominee Gov. George W.      Bush.       In effect, the amendment would offer victims the      constitutionally guaranteed right to:       Be notified of proceedings in the criminal case;       To attend public proceedings in the case;       To make a statement at release proceedings, sentencing and      proceedings regarding a plea bargain;       To have the court order the convicted offender to pay      restitution for the harm caused by the crime.       Some of these provisions may indeed restore some balance to      a system that leans heavily in favor of protecting criminals'      rights. Some of these provisions are already being enacted in      certain jurisdictions and in certain cases on behalf of      vitims--the right to be present at hearings and to make      statements for example.       Many prosecutors are opposing this amendment because of the      unintended effects it could have, and the public should      oppose it in light of many unanswered questions and concerns.      For example, should rival gang members be notified of pending      hearings and be invited to make statement against those      rivals? What of convicted violent felons who are themselves      victimized in prison--who are the true victims? Will      prosecutors be compelled to notify thousands of victims in      the case of a national telemarketing scam?       These are real questions that the Senate is grappling with.      Without real answers, they should vote ``No.'' We should not      tamper with the U.S. Constitution when a statute will suffice      in place of an amendment. That document is too important to      who are as Americans.                                  ____                [From the Baltimore Sun, Apr. 23, 2000]                       Distorting Victims' Rights       Senate vote: A constitutional amendment could actually harm      victims and rights of innocent.       It's an election year. You can tell by the flurry of votes      on proposed constitutional amendments in Congress this month.      The latest, set for the Senate this week, is perhaps the most      deceptive and dangerous--a victims' rights amendment.       On the surface it seems reasonable, similar to rights      adopted in 32 states. It would guarantee crime victims the      right to speak at parole, plea-bargain or sentencing      hearings, to be notified of an offender's release, to      restitution, and a speedy trial.       But wait a minute: Isn't the defendant the one who has a      constitutional right to a speedy trial? This amendment would      change all that: Victims would have rights equal to a      defendant.       That's just the start of the dangers. The amendment doesn't      define who's a victim. Parents? Ex-spouses? Cousins?      Boyfriends?       It would create a third party in trials intent on      retribution, even though the defendant may not have committed      the crime.       It would give victims the right to oppose plea bargains.      One of the lead lawyers in the Oklahoma City bombing case      says this would have made virtually impossible to convict      Timothy McVeigh.       Victims also would have the right to demand a speedy      trial--even if prosecutors say they need more time to build a      winnable case. And what happens if the ``victims'' disagree?      In the Oklahoma City case, there would have been thousands of      ``victims,'' many entitled to court-appointed lawyers.       This could lead to grotesque distortions. A battered wife      who strikes back and maims her husband could wind up paying      restitution to the ``victim.'' So could a shopkeeper who      shoots a robber--the ``victim'' becomes the robber.       We fear for the right to a fair trial. Crime victims'      prejudgement of the defendant clashes with the notion that      you're innocent until proven guilty.       Victims deserve certain rights. But not in the      Constitution. Why hasn't Congress passed federal laws to      assist them? It could be decades before a constitution-     cluttering amendment is approved.       This is the wrong approach. The proposal could damage our      court system and our fundamental rights.       We urge Senators Barbara A. Mikulski and Paul S. Sarbanes      to vote against this ill-conceived constitutional amendment--     and then commit to drawing up more clearly defined laws      giving crime victims a voice in court.                                  ____               [From the Chicago Tribune, Apr. 20, 2000]         Criminal Act--The Folly of a Victim's Rights Amendment                           (By Steve Chapman)       Some conservatives love Mt. Rushmore so much that they want      to alter it, by adding Ronald Reagan. Likewise, many people      think the U.S. Constitution is not so flawless that it      couldn't be improved. Each group ignores the possibility that      its revisions may turn something that is nearly perfect into      something that is, well, not nearly perfect.       Recently, the Senate barely failed to approve a      constitutional amendment to eliminate the terrible national      scourge of flag-burning. Next week, it will vote on the      Victims' Rights Amendment, which is based on the odd notion      that the criminal justice system does too little for the      victims of crime.       In fact, the nation spends enormous sums every year for the      victims of crime. Legions of police, lawyers and judges labor      every day to find, prosecute and punish people who aggress      against their neighbors. We run the world's biggest      correctional system, with 1,500 facilities devoted to the      care and feeding of nearly 2 million inmates--and that's not      counting more than 3 million lawbreakers on parole or      probation. All of this is partly for the protection of      everyone, but it's also an affirmation of our concern for      crime victims.       So what oversight is the amendment supposed to address?      Some victims feel their interests are not considered and      their voices are not heard when criminal justice decisions      are made. Asserts the Senate Judiciary Committee, ``The      victims of crime have been transformed into a group      oppressively burdened by a system designed to protect them.''      Its remedy is to give victims of violent crimes the      constitutional right to attend all proceedings, to make their      views known about sentencing and plea arrangements, to be      notified of an offender's impending release, to insist on a      speedy trial and to get restitution from the victimizer.       But the claim of oppression is a vast exaggeration. In a      country with 8 million violent crimes committed every year,      the justice system is bound to cause some victims to feel      dissatisfied and even angry. If 95 percent get satisfactory      treatment, that leaves hundreds of thousands of people a year      who are shortchanged.       Some of the supposed mistreatment stems not from      callousness, but from efforts to provide the accused a fair      trial. Amendment supporters want victims to be able to attend      trials from start to finish, just as defendants do. But the      only time they are barred is before they testify--to minimize      the chance that they will (intentionally or not) tailor their      testimony to match that of other witnesses.       The unassailable reason for the rule is that it improves      the chances of finding the truth. This is not a favor just to      suspects: A crime victim gains nothing if the courts punish      the wrong person and let the guilty party go free.       Keeping victims informed about the proceedings, and letting      them attend, could create huge problems in some cases. Take      the Columbine High School massacre, where two      students murdered 13 people and wounded 23 others before      committing suicide.       Suppose Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold had lived to stand      trial. Who would be entitled to attend and comment on any      proposed plea bargain? The families of the 36 dead and      wounded? The families of all the students who witnessed any      of the shootings? The families of all Columbine students?      Your     guess is as good as the Senate's: The Victims' Rights      Amendment doesn't bother defining the term ``victim.''       The wider the net, the bigger the logistical challenge.      Just notifying all these people of every proceeding, from the      time a suspect is arrested until the time he's released from      prison years or decades later, would be hard enough. Making      room for them in court might mean holding the trial in a      large auditorium. Letting each one speak would not exactly      advance the goal of speedy justice.       There is nothing to stop the states from mandating      consideration of crime victims. In fact, all 50 states have      done that. As former Reagan Justice Department official Bruce      Fein testified at a recent House hearing, ``Nothing in the      Constitution or in U.S. Supreme Court precedents handcuffs      either Congress or the states in fashioning victims' rights      statutes.''       The advantage of helping victims by these means is that we      can experiment to find solutions that are sensible and      affordable and abandon those that are not. But a      constitutional amendment would transfer the power to courts      to enforce these new rights, without much regard for      practicality or proportion.       It would amount to giving unelected federal judges      instructions to do good and a blank check with which to do      it. Only years later would we find out whether the benefits      would be worth the cost and by that time, it would be very      hard to change our minds.       The Victims' Rights Amendment is not likely to do much for      crime victims that can't be done by other means. But by      creating a new constitutional demand of unknown dimensions,      it threatens to make victims of us all.                                  ____               [From the Collegiate Times, Apr. 25, 2000]              Victims' Rights Bill Violates Others' Rights       Although the victims' rights amendment, set to receive      Senate vote at the end of the month, sounds like it has all      the makings of noble piece of legislation, its true colors      shine through as potentially endangering to the rights of the      accused.       The bill finds bipartisan support, primarily bolstered by      the efforts of Senators Jon Kyl (R-Arizona) and Dianne      Feinstein (D-California.)       The measure would provide victims with the right to      notification of public proceedings, which emerge from the      alleged offense against them.       In addition, it provides the right of presence at hearings      and capacity to testify when the topics of parole, plea-     bargaining or sentencing are concerned. Further, victims      would be privileged with orders of restitution and attention      to their interests in the initiative of speedy trials      (Washington Post, April 24).       On a state level, many of these provisions already exist.       But does the Constitution, the ultimate framework of our      nation's concept of justice, deserve this slap in the face      legislation?       Certainly, when anything is under consideration of      amendment to the Constitution, a thorough analysis should      occur to both ensure the delicate balance of the Constitution      between the accused and the accuser remains intact and that      justice remains the focus at all times.       Upon examination, this measure is exposed as a travesty to      both. Any right the accused has under the Constitution would      be grossly usurped by the passing of this bill into law.       For example, a defendant's constitutional right to a fair      trial would rest on the victim's concern in pursuing justice      swiftly for their own sake. Another ramification of this bill      includes the inevitability of prosecutorial hold ups.       By integrating the emotional response of victims into the      proceedings of plea-bargaining and sentencing where      prosecution once exercised discretion as given to them by      law, fairness in sentencing and swiftness in sentencing seem      harder to come by.       On the most basic of levels, the sheer label of victim      conflicts with the very sentiment for which the Constitution      stands.       The use of the word victim violates the premise of      innocence until guilt has been proven in a court of law. By      labeling the accuser as a victim, guilt has been assigned to      the accused.       It prematurely uses terminology that assesses a situation      in light of allegations rather than legally submitted      evidence.       The rights of all victims remain preserved in the      Constitution.       The fact that courts are fully prepared to issue a denial      of all freedoms to the accused, should they be found guilty,      guarantees, on the behalf of victims as well as society at      large, justice will be served.       Justice will be served by the end processes and not      prematurely.       For this reason, the interests of victims are under      constant consideration. This piece of legislation threatens      to disrupt the balance the Constitution maintains and tip the      scale in favor of victims.       This bill, should it be made into law, promises an      undemocratic approach to dealing with the accused in a manner      which jeopardizes their rights and liberties.       The court system pursues prosecution on behalf of victims.       To undermine these efforts in the name of victims' rights      seems the most forthright ruin of what the Constitution truly      intended as safeguards for the accused as well as the      accuser.                                  ____             [From the Herald, Everett, WA, Apr. 19, 2000]            Amendment to Aid Victims Could Cause More Damage       The U.S. Senate is nearing a vote on a constitutional      amendment that seeks to enact a good idea. Like many fine      concepts, however, the proposed victims' rights amendment      could cause enormous trouble. The Senate has been looking at      the proposal seriously since last year. Good arguments have      been made on both sides of the amendment, which has      bipartisan sponsorship from Sens. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., and      Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.       As amendment supporters argue, the level of crime in      American society should cause us to look more carefully at      protecting the rights of victims and their families. Too many      court decisions have protected criminals' rights without a      corresponding development of the law to assure victims'      interests are respected. Indeed, the whole area of      prosecution has changed so much in the past 200 years that an      amendment could be a reasonable addition to the Constitution.      When the Founding Fathers wrote the Constitution, for      instance, it was common for victims themselves to bring a      criminal case.       Still, a constitutional amendment ought to be a matter of      last resort. The amendment simply fails to meet that      elemental test. In fact, portions of what the amendment seeks      to ensure are already required in existing federal law.       Unfortunantely, members of Congress have failed to provide      the appropriations necessary to ensure that victims are      notified of hearings and to make sure that prosecutors have      the time and resources to be in regular contact with them. An      amendment to the Constitution requiring such actions would do      little to remedy such neglect. Indeed, unless followed by      better funding, the amendment might put even more strain on      prosecutors' time and budgets, making them more reluctant to      take on difficult cases. That would work decidedly in the      favor of criminals, not society.       Many prosecutors and victims' groups have concerns about      the potential for unintended harm from the amendment. Their      arguments make enormous sense. During the past two decades,      America has begun to address its crime problem more      seriously. From local offices to the federal government,      prosecutors and lawmakers are doing better in addressing the      needs of victims and society. The step-by-step approach is      showing results in reduced crime. Methodical, painstaking      improvements should be strengthened, rather than being      shunted aside in favor of a constitutional amendment that, at      best, promises more than it would deliver.                          ____________________
