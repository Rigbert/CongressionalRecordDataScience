President, I recall when times were different. I recall when charges were raised against Clarence Thomas and the Judiciary Committee held several days of additional hearings after that nomination had already been reported by the Judiciary Committee to the full Senate. There was a tie vote in committee on the Thomas nomination, which would not have even been reported to the Senate had we not also voted virtually unanimously, with six Democrats joining seven Republicans, to report the Thomas nomination to the floor without recommendation. Of course, ultimately the nomination of Judge Thomas to become Justice Thomas was confirmed by the Senate.  Over the last decade and one-half Republicans have pioneered and developed procedures whereby the Judiciary Committee has reported to the Senate for its consideration nominations on which the committee had come to a tie vote and even, in the case of Judge Bork's nomination to the Supreme Court, an overwhelmingly negative vote.  I recall for example the nomination of Daniel Manion which was reported to the Senate after a tie vote and was ultimately approved by the Senate. I recall, as well, the nomination of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court which was reported after a tie vote and ultimately approved by the Senate.  Time after time during the Reagan and Bush years the Republicans on the Judiciary Committee urged that the full Senate be permitted to decide these questions. Senator Thurmond argued in favor of reporting an executive branch nomination on which the committee had voted negatively, noting:       As long as I am a member of this Committee, I will give an      opportunity, whether it is majority or minority, to send the      nominations to the Senate. I think the Senate is entitled to      the recommendation [of the Committee], and you made the      recommendation by the vote just taken. But I think the Senate      is entitled to a vote on this matter, I think the President      is entitled for the Senate to vote, and I think the country      is entitled for the Senate to vote. I would hope it would be      sent to the Senate and let the full Senate act.  I have been one, frankly, who has not always supported such action. It took a while to bring me around. But I joined in voting to report the Thomas nomination after a tie vote.  It remains my hope that we will find a way to show Bill Lee the same fairness that we showed Clarence Thomas and allow his nomination to be debated and voted upon by the U.S. Senate. It would be ironic if, after the Senate proceeded to debate and vote on the Thomas nomination--one that included charges that he engaged in sexual harassment, the Republican leadership prevented the Senate from considering a nominee because he has worked to remedy sexual harassment and gender discrimination.  I feel confident that this nomination, the first Asian-American to head the Civil Rights Division, would be confirmed by the majority of the Senate. I believe that when the facts and record are reviewed fairly and dispassionately he will be confirmed. When the country has had an opportunity to focus on this important nomination and Senators have had a chance to consider how their constituents feel, I am confident that a positive outcome will be assured.  From all that I have seen over the past week, it appears to me that the Republican leadership is intent upon seeking to kill this nomination and determined to kill it in this committee and never give the Senate an opportunity to consider it. I do not think that it is fair or right or right for the country. We need Bill Lee's proven problem-solving abilities in these difficult times.  No one can argue that the President has sent to us a person not qualified by experience to lead the Civil Rights Division. Bill Lee's record of achievement is exemplary. He is a man of integrity and honor and when he said to this committee that quotas are illegal and wrong and that he would enforce the law, no one should have any doubt about his resolve to do what is right. The Senate should be given the opportunity to debate and vote on this outstanding nominee and then give Bill Lee the chance to serve the country and all Americans.  I think the Senate has committed a great wrong to him in blocking his nomination, that is absolutely wrong.                               Exhibit 1                                              City of Los Angeles,                                          Office of the Mayor,                                  Los Angeles, CA, March 20, 1997.     Erskine Bowles,     Chief of Staff, Office of the President,     The White House, Washington, DC.     Re: Bill Lann Lee, Candidate for Assistant Attorney General,          Civil Rights Division, United States Department of          Justice.       Dear Mr. Bowles: I am writing to support the appointment of      Bill Lann Lee to the United States Department of Justice      position of Assistant Attorney General, Civil Rights      Division. Throughout his distinguished career as a civil      rights lawyer, Mr. Lee has worked to advance the civil rights      progress of the nation and of our richly diverse city of Los      Angeles.       In my opinion, Bill Lee is an astute lawyer who is superbly      qualified to enforce our national civil rights laws. Mr.      Lee's candidacy offers the President an excellent opportunity      to reaffirm his strong support of women's rights and civil      rights laws.       Mr. Lee first became known to me as opposing counsel in an      important civil rights case concerning poor bus riders in Los      Angeles. As Mayor, I took a leading role in settling that      case. The work of my opponents rarely evoke my praise, but      the negotiations could not have concluded successfully      without Mr. Lee's practical leadership and expertise.       I know that his expertise is the result of working twenty-     two years in the ``All Star'' leagues of civil rights      litigators. His track record is nationally renowned and      speaks for     itself. Beyond the many victories, what makes his work      special is that he has represented clients from every      background, including poor whites, women and children      suffering from lead poisoning. His admirable ability to win      the trust of so many communities is evident in the broad      coalition of civil rights and women's rights experts who are      backing his candidacy for this position.       Mr. Lee has practiced mainstream civil rights law. He does      not believe in quotas. He has pursued flexible and reasonable      remedies that in each case were approved by a court.       Mr. Lee is an outstanding citizen of Los Angeles. He has my      enthusiastic support and strongest recommendation for the      position of Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights.           Sincerely,                                               Richard J. Riordan,     Mayor.                                                                    ____                                Los Angeles Police Commission,                                Los Angeles, CA, November 5, 1997.     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Hatch: As Vice-President of the Los Angeles      Police Commission, and a Governor Wilson appointee to the      California Fair Employment & Housing Commission (the state's      civil rights enforcement agency), please allow me to clarify      the record and give my unqualified support for Bill Lann Lee      to be Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. The      clarification involves a case entitled Tipton-Whittingham, et      al. v. City of Los Angeles, wherein allegations of sexual      harassment and sex discrimination in the Los Angeles Police      Department (``LAPD'') have been asserted. This case appears      to have become an issue in the nomination of Mr. Lee.       The allegations in Tipton-Whittingham, while disputed in      some respects, are serious matters that the LAPD are      committed to addressing. Issues of gender bias and harassment      have been raised not only by these plaintiffs but also by      independent and respected voices such as the Christopher      Commission. The parties engaged in arms length negotiations      for more than a year before a proposed partial consent decree      was submitted for approval to the Los Angeles City Council      and then the Court.       The proposed decree was presented to the federal magistrate      only after being vetted by the Police Commission, the Mayor's      office, the City Council and the City Attorney's office.      While members of the Police Commission, including this      Commissioner, and the Mayor's office initially objected to      specific provisions of the proposed consent decree, those      objections were fully heard and addressed before the decree      was presented.       As you know, that proposed consent decree has not been      approved by the Federal Court. In the meantime, the parties      are engaged in mediation before Charles G. Bakely, Jr. in the      hopes of reaching a complete settlement of the lawsuit.      Hopefully, any settlement will ensure that the LAPD of the      future is free of racial and gender bias and sexual      harassment, and any consent decree will neither on its face      nor in operation require or induce unlawful preferences. I      hasten to add, however, that the proposed partial consent      decree previously submitted to the Federal Court had that      same objective.       As a final matter, in my role as Assistant General Counsel      for Hughes Electronics responsible for labor and employment      law matters, I have opposed Mr. Lee in employment litigation.      I was then and continue to be impressed by his balance,      ethics, intelligence and commitment to reaching practical      solutions. In my view, he would be an outstanding addition to      the Department of Justice.       Should you have any questions regarding the above, please      do not hesitate to call me.           Sincerely,                                                T. Warren Jackson,     Vice-President.                                                                    ____                                  Office of the City Attorney,                                Los Angeles, CA, October 29, 1997.     Hon. Trent Lott,     Senate Majority Leader, Washington, DC.     Re: Bill Lann Lee Confirmation.       Dear Mr. Majority Leader: As an Assistant City Attorney for      the City of Los Angeles--and opposing counsel to Bill Lann      Lee in recent federal civil rights litigation--I read with      concern the October 27 letter to you from the Speaker of the      House of Representatives. I believe the Speaker has been      misinformed about many of the facts set out in that letter,      and therefore the conclusions he reaches about Mr. Lee's      fitness for public office, and in particular for the position      of Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, are      unwarranted.       The Speaker's letter begins by asserting that Mr. Lee      ``attempted to force through a consent decree mandating      racial and gender preferences in the Los Angeles Police      Department.'' This assertion is erroneous. In the course of      representing the City of Los Angeles, I have for the past      seventeen years monitored the City's compliance with consent      decrees affecting the hiring, promotion, advancement, and      assignment of sworn police officers. I have negotiated on the      City's behalf two of those decrees. Of those two, Mr. Lee was      opposing counsel on the first, and was associated with      opposing counsel on the second. None of these decrees      mandates the use of racial or gender preferences. In fact,      each of them contains provisions forbidding the use of such      preferences.       For the same reasons, the Speaker's statement that the use      of racial and gender preferences ``would have been a back-     door thwarting of the will of the people of California with      regard to Proposition 209 (the California Civil Rights      Initiative)'' is inapposite. Because the decrees with which      Mr. Lee was associated do not call for racial or gender      preferences, and in fact forbid them, these decrees do not      violate the requirements or the intent of Proposition 209.       Of particular concern to me is the Speaker's reference to      ``the allegation that Mr. Lee apparently employed dubious      means to try to circumscribe the will of the judge in the      case.'' Thus allegation is wholly untrue. The case being      referred to is presently in litigation in the district court.      Mr. Lee was not at any time a named counsel in the case, but      was associated with opposing counsel because of his      involvement in the negotiation of a related consent decree.      Neither Mr. Lee nor any opposing counsel attempted in any      fashion to thwart the will of the judge supervising the      litigation. The matter had been referred by the court to a      magistrate judge appointed by the court to assist in the      resolution of the case. Each counsel had advised the district      judge at all points about the progress of the matter. Upon      reconsideration, the district judge elected to assert direct      control over the litigation. Nothing in Mr. Lee's conduct      reflected any violation of the court's rules, either in fact      or by appearance.       Bill Lann Lee and I have sat on opposite sides of the      negotiating table over the course of several years. Although      we have disagreed profoundly on many issues, I have      throughout the time I have known him respected Bill's candor,      his thorough preparation, his sense of ethical behavior, and      his ability to bring persons holding diverse views into      agreement. He would, in my view, be an outstanding public      servant and a worthy addition to the Department of Justice.           Very truly yours,                                                    Robert Cramer,     Assistant City Attorney.                                                                    ____                                                City Attorney,                                Los Angeles, CA, November 4, 1997.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senator, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: As City Attorney of the City of Los      Angeles I feel compelled to correct the inaccurate and      defamatory allegations in the October 27th letter from      Speaker Newt Gingrich about Bill Lann Lee.       The Speaker's letter charges that Mr. Lee ``attempted to      force through a consent decree mandatory racial and gender      preferences in the Los Angeles Police Department.'' That      assertion is wrong. Mr. Lee participated in two lawsuits      against the Los Angeles Police Department several years ago      that were resolved by consent decrees, but neither decree      mandates the use of racial or gender preferences. In fact,      each of them contains provisions forbidding the use of      preferences.       What is most outrageous about Mr. Gingrich's letter is his      reference to ``the allegation that Mr. Lee apparently      employed dubious means to try to circumscribe the will of the      judge in the case.'' There is simply no truth to this      allegation. The facts are these. This case, known as Tipton-     Whittingham, is presently in litigation in district court.      There are serious allegations of discrimination and      harassment being made by the plaintiffs in this case who are      women police officers in LAPD. Mr. Lee was not at any time a      named counsel in the case, but was associated with opposing      counsel because of his involvement in the negotiation of a      related consent decree. Neither Mr. Lee nor any opposing      counsel attempted in any fashion to thwart the will of the      judge supervising the litigation. The matter has been      referred by the court to a magistrate judge appointed by the      court to assist in the resolution of the case. Each counsel      had advised the district judge at all points about the      progress of the matter. Upon reconsideration, the district      judge elected to assert direct control over the litigation.      Nothing in Mr. Lee's conduct reflected any violation of the      court's rules, either in fact or by appearance.       Bill Lann Lee and I have been on opposite sides of the      negotiating table over the years and we have not always      agreed. Yet I respect him for his keen intellect, his      profound sense of ethics, and his ability to negotiate an      outcome that achieves justice and fairness.       The United States Senate should not countenance the kind of      character assassination based on erroneous information that      has occurred in this confirmation process. I'm glad I can      help clear the record in this regard.       Bill Lann Lee is an outstanding lawyer who embodies the      highest ethical traditions of that profession and will be      vigilant in his defense of the Constitution and the laws of      the United States. He should be confirmed as Assistant      Attorney General for Civil Rights.           Very truly yours,                                                    James K. Hahn,                                                    City Attorney.
