President, today the Senate has passed the bipartisan Need-Based Educational Aid Act of 2015, which will extend for another 7 years the anti-trust exemption permitting colleges and universities to collaborate on issues of need-based financial aid. I worked on this legislation with Senators Grassley and Lee. Together we crafted an approach to reauthorize this exemption which earned the unanimous support of the Judiciary Committee just last week. This anti-trust exemption allows colleges and universities that admit students on a need-blind basis to collaborate on the formula used to determine how much families can pay for college. Without congressional action, this exemption will expire at the end of September.  Congress first enacted this exemption in 1994 and this will be the third time we have acted to reauthorize it. It is important for Congress to carefully review anti-trust exemptions to ensure that they continue to serve the public interest. In this case, our review led us to conclude that one particular provision should sunset because it has never been used by colleges and universities. The need for this slight modification underscores why I am skeptical of permanent anti-trust exemptions. Requiring those who benefit from exemptions to the anti-trust laws to come to Congress and justify renewal ensures that they do not become a blank check for anti-competitive behavior.  I would contrast the limited renewal the Senate has passed today with the McCarran-Ferguson Act, a permanent anti-trust exemption that the insurance industry has enjoyed since 1945. Ihave worked for years on a bipartisan basis to repeal that law precisely because marketplace conditions can change significantly over a 7-year period, not to mention the 70 years since McCarran-Ferguson was enacted. We should learn from our experience with today's bill.  Our bipartisan and bicameral bill serves an important goal--allowing covered universities to focus their resources on ensuring the most qualified students can attend some of the best schools in the country, regardless of income. I am proud that Middlebury College in Vermont is one of those covered schools. I also appreciate the efforts of the bill's sponsors in the House, Congressmen Smith and Johnson. I urge the House to pass our bipartisan bill this week.                          ____________________
