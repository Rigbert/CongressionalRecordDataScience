I thank my friend for his very powerful testimonial to our late colleague.  Mr. Speaker, for Bob's surviving wife, Fran and their three daughters, Kelly, Sara, and Abigail, his mother, June; and sister, Judy; and the rest of the family, this is a tragic season of excruciating loss and bereavement. While Bob Franks was a politician's politician in the best sense of that concept, he was husband, father, son, and brother first. Nothing compared to his love for and devotion to his family.  For everyone who has ever had the privilege of knowing him and calling him ``friend,'' Bob epitomized noble public service. He was honest, hardworking, extraordinarily effective, and absolutely determined to make a positive difference for his constituents, the State, and the Nation. An indomitable optimist, Bob was ever gracious and stubbornly kind to all, even with those with whom he disagreed. He treated all with respect, civility, and empathy.  I know my colleagues on the floor today will attest to the fact that Bob Franks was enthusiastic almost to a fault and always greeted you with a great big smile, firm handshake, and warm greeting--a reflection of his great big heart. You usually left any conversation with Bob, well, smiling.  Bob Franks devoted 21 years of his life to elected public service--13 years in the New Jersey Assembly, 8 years as a Member of Congress, and he served 4 years as State GOP chairman. In both Trenton and Washington, Bob was a consistent, powerful voice for a limited government and reduced taxes.  In the assembly, he was elected twice by his peers to serve as conference leader. Among his notable achievements, he wrote the State law creating the transportation trust fund.  In Congress, he served with distinction as chairman of the Economic Development, Public Buildings, Hazardous Materials, and Pipeline Transportation Subcommittee.  A master strategist, Bob pushed hard to expand the economy, create jobs in the private sector, pass tax cuts, enact welfare reform, and ensure that our military was second to none.  As cochair of the Missing and Exploited Children Caucus, Bob helped win passage of legislation to protect our children from Internet predators and impose life imprisonment for persons convicted of killing a child. A true friend of law enforcement, Bob took the lead in 1998 and won passage of a congressional resolution demanding the Clinton administration undertake the extradition of cop killer Joanne Chesimard, a fugitive who fled to Cuba after being convicted of murdering New Jersey State Trooper Werner Foerster in May of 1973.  Bob helped create the bipartisan Northeast-Midwest Congressional Coalition to maximize both regions' political clout in Congress and played the leading role in promoting fair electrical power policy in New Jersey.  As my colleague, Leonard, noted a moment ago, he ran for the United States Senate. He lost. He ran for Governor, and he lost that, too. But you would never know that from talking to Bob. He was always upbeat and very positive.  After leaving the Hill, Bob served as the president of the Health Care Institute of New Jersey, a trade association for the research-based pharmaceutical and medical technology industry in the State of New Jersey.  Mr. Speaker, at the Basilica of the Sacred Heart in Newark, New Jersey, on Saturday, Governor Chris Christie was joined in moving remembrance by several former Governors, including Governor Jon Corzine, Christie Todd Whitman, and Tom Kean, as well as the three godfathers to Bob and Fran's kids, Roger Bodman, Alfred Fasola, and Congressman John Kasich.  Governor Chris Christie spoke eloquently at the memorial service and told those assembled, ``Bob Franks' life was grand and glorious. As Fran and his daughters know better than anyone, what Bob cared first and foremost about, despite all of the passions in his life, was family . . . no matter whether we were talking about politics or business, because it was something he knew full well: the demands of a public life, the demands of a private life, and the rewards of paying attention to both.''  Governor Christie went on to say, ``Bob Franks was enthusiastic in everything I saw him do. Whether it wasrooting for the Indianapolis Colts--something that I still do not fully understand from a guy from New Jersey--whether it was some of the deepest and most significant policy issues that have faced our country for over the last 25 years, or whether it was counseling and encouraging even the smallest of potential leaders for our State.'' Always that enthusiastic Bob Franks.  The Governor went on to say, ``The loss that each of us feel from Bob's death is significant in the life of our State, significant in the life of our country, because he served so ably and so well . . . In the end, I think, that's what we all hope for out of our public officials: that they care deeply, that they think deeply, that they act passionately with the ability to inspire. He checked all the boxes.''  Governor Corzine said, in brief part, that this was a ``celebration of a great life, a good man, a very good man, someone that all of us, as you have heard, believed in, learned from, and grew from.  ``A man of credible character, conviction, courage, but probably the most defining thing that any of us can say about Bob is he was a man who loved. He loved politics, loved all of his friends, the folks who are here, but most of all, most notably he loved his family.''  Governor Tom Kean said, ``Politics for Bob was an honorable profession which meant responsibility and opportunity for achievement and very much an exciting adventure. After all, what is the use of living,'' Governor Kean went on to say, ``if not to strive for great causes and perhaps make this muddled world of ours a little better place. Bob did that. He cared about that.''  ``We are all better people for having known Bob,'' he went on. ``I think of him smiling. I think of his cheerfulness. I think of his enthusiasm, and today,'' Governor Kean concluded, ``I envy the angels.''  Governor Christie Todd Whitman said, ``You know a lot of people who are involved in the rough-and-tumble of politics get characterized as either being really good at the political side of it, the background, the fierce fighting, or they're the policy wonks, that's what they care about. Bob was both. He was a fierce, fierce partisan. He was a Republican. He never made it personal, because he always knew it was about policy, about doing right by the people of the State. And that's what made him such a special person.''  Our former Budget Committee chairman here in the House, John Kasich, who was godfather to one of Bob and Fran's children, summed it up well when he said, ``Our friendship was forged in the battles of trying to improve America. That's what it's all about. It was never about politics. It was always about what we could do to make the world a better place for our children and their children . . . I don't think I've ever met a more insightful man than Bob Franks. He could look at something that everybody else saw and he would see it differently. He could see twists in it. He could take advantage of it and move the ball forward.  ``How about his cutting-edge humor? Always a little cutting-edge humor no matter where you were. Sometimes Bob was even good at gallows humor. You know, when there was not even a speck of light shining in the room, Bob could make us all laugh. He'd remove the pressure. He'd have a little quip, and we'd all get the belly laugh going. It would happen when there was no humor in sight.''  And on loyalty, John said, ``You know what the kids today say, 'You got my back.' Well, Bob Franks had your back. He didn't care if you were a Republican or a Democrat, a liberal or a conservative. It didn't mean anything. When you were his friend, he had your back.''  John Kasich concluded, ``I would like to call him a foxhole guy. And I measure people, `Are they a foxhole guy.' In other words, can I get into a foxhole with this guy in the middle of the worst battle you can imagine and know not only would he not jump out of that foxhole to run and preserve himself, but he would jump outta that foxhole and fight to help you. Oh, he was a great foxhole guy,'' he said.  John said, ``In all of the years that I've known him, I've never heard him say a bad thing about anybody,'' and I know Mr. Frelinghuysen and others in our delegation can back that up a hundred percent. And finally Kasich said, ``There is no question he left the world a better place.''  So, Mr. Speaker, there is no question Bob Franks left New Jersey, he left the Nation and the world a better place, and we will deeply miss him.  I would like to yield to my good friend and colleague, Mr. Frelinghuysen.                              {time}  1930
