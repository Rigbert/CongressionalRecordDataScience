 First, this is an issue I think is not only important but at a level where it is not just a detail of reporting. I think it goes to the heart of the accountability, not just for our committee but for the whole Senate.  Frankly, all of our colleagues have to be able to answer the question to their constituents: How much protection are we getting for these resources?  I understand the Missile Defense Agency, as so many Department of Defense organizations, is required to submit reports. But they certainly have the resources to do these reports.  What I find striking--again, it is a reflection, too, of the previous years--we have in the past tried to get this information. We required goal setting and a GAO assessment. I was, frankly, amazed--and this amazement came about in the preparation, not only for the committee markup but also coming to the floor--that the GAO simply sort of threw up its hands because the Missile Defense Agency says we really don't have any goals; we can't tell you; they are too imprecise.  So I think this is an issue that should be engaged by the entire Senate. There was no intention on my part to undermine the procedures on the committee, the Armed Services Committee or the subcommittee. I was not aware in order to bring a matter to the floor one had to offer it first in subcommittee or full committee.  I think this is an issue that is of a magnitude and of a degree of clarity that Members of the entire Senate can make a judgment and should make a judgment. That is my response.
