Mr. Chairman, the amendment I am offering today makes a few clarifications to the underlying bill.  It modifies language in the bill allowing for the use of graduate students in the collection of recreational fishing data. The fields of science the graduate students are studying is expanded, and when the students can be used is clarified.  The amendment also clarifies that guidance prepared by the National Academy of Sciences regarding the economic benefits of commercial and recreational fishing within the mixed-use fisheries is to be given to the south Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico councils.  The amendment will also modify the provisions in law regarding the council review of limited access programs to include not only the benefits of the program, but also any adverse impacts.  Lastly, the amendment includes language to allow stock assessments to include information from universities, fishermen, fishing communities, and research institutions, in addition to State and Federal fisheries data.  It will also require a schedule for when stock assessments should occur and allows for a waiver if certain stocks don't need assessments.  These are good additions to the legislation, and I urge the Members to support the amendment.  I yield back the balance of my time.
