Speaker, I had the honor and the privilege of serving in this house with Carrie Meek for ten years. The granddaughter of a slave and a daughter of sharecroppers, Carrie has always held in her heart a deep and abiding concern for the rights and the welfare of others. She made public service a life's calling, and her time as a member of this body was but one chapter in a lengthy career doing what she loves most: fighting for justice and the advancement of those who have something to contribute but are not given the chance.  When Carrie was determined to pursue a graduate degree, the high obstacle of segregation was the first of many she would overcome. Her fourteen years of service in the Florida legislature, in both the House and Senate, helped make Floridians safer from crime, opened new opportunities to Florida's students to achieve higher education, and provided affordable housing to those facing financial difficulty. Her historic election in 1992 as the first African American to represent a Florida district in Congress since Reconstruction began a decade of distinguished service here in Washington.  In Congress, Carrie championed economic development, housing, education, and access to affordable health care. Her relentless advocacy on behalf of her constituents in the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew brought over $100 million in assistance to rebuild communities across Miami-Dade County and South Florida. Since her retirement from Congress in 2003, Carrie has continued her work at the helm of the Carrie Meek Foundation, a charitable venture committed to improving the lives of Americans by supporting programs in housing, education, health care, and community development.  I am grateful to call Carrie my friend, and I join with my colleagues in celebrating her service to the people of Florida in Congress and her continuing commitment to her fellow Americans across the country.                          ____________________
