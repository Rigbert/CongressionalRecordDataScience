President, today, I sent a letter to President Bush. In it I urged him to cease and desist from what has become an abuse of Presidential signing statements. I first began drawing attention to these matters 4 years ago, in 2002. I hoped they would end at that time; instead, the abuses have mounted. Outstanding reporters, such as Charles Savage of the Boston Globe, have taken note of this important matter.
