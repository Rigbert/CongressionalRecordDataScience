 President, I rise today to recognize an exceptionally talented country music duo from my home State of Kentucky. Kris Bentley and Nick Jamerson have vaulted their band, Sundy Best, from the small bars and music halls of eastern Kentucky into the national spotlight. The story of their rise is remarkable, and one that is far from its conclusion.  Nick and Kris first met in elementary school in Prestonsburg, KY, where they both grew up in music-loving families. The two started a band together in high school but parted ways when Nick went to play football at Pikeville College and Kris enrolled in Centre College, where he played basketball. Nick's passion for music never subsided, though, and after college he contacted Kris to inquire about purchasing a drum set. As it happened, Kris's passion for music remained as well--he didn't have a set to sell, but he would gladly come play with his old buddy Nick. The two friends picked up right where they left off, and the very next night they were playing their first gig together.  The band's big break came in November of 2010. Nick had just moved to Lexington with Kris, and the two landed a gig at Redmon's, a classic Lexington live music establishment. Previously the two had played just as ``Nick and Kris,'' but for a venue like Redmon's they needed a name that they could promote. The two settled on one that reflected their musical roots in Sunday church services. As Kris tells it, ``It was originally going to be Sunday's Best but then we said, `No, Sundy Best.' '' The duo dropped the ``a'' from Sunday because, ``That's the way we talk.''  The show at Redmon's was an enormous success, so much so that they began to play a regular gig there. This consistent venue for their music was instrumental in establishing the band's fan base and name recognition. Kris acknowledges that this was when ``people started taking us seriously . . . because that's a premier music venue.''  Things have been looking up for Sundy Best ever since. In 2013 they re-released their first album, Door Without a Screen, and watched it climb into the iTunes Top 10. The video for the hit song from the album, ``Home (I Wanna Go),'' helped drive the album's success and is a fixture on Country Music Television.  As a fellow Kentuckian, I am proud of the success seen by Sundy Best. Nick and Kris are not only talented musicians, but they are also outstanding ambassadors for the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Although theirmusic is spreading further across the country each day, their roots remain grounded in eastern Kentucky.  I ask that my Senate colleagues join me in recognizing the success of Sundy Best and wishing them well with the recent release of their new album, Bring Up the Sun.  Kentucky Monthly recently published an article chronicling the rise of Sundy Best. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows:                 [From Kentucky Monthly, Feb. 25, 2014]                            The Best Men Win                          (By Tricia Despres)       When kids grow up with something to prove, they can become      stubborn and a bit hardheaded. But when those kids grow up to      be adults who want to make a living as musicians . . . well,      they just might become superstars.       So goes the story of Sundy Best.       Blending an eclectic mix of acoustic guitar with the beat      of the cajon drum and the compelling vocals of Nick Jamerson      and Kris Bentley, Sundy Best looks as if they are about to      embark on a career many others are often left to dream about.      Just last year, the Kentucky-based duo released a deluxe      version of their album Door Without a Screen and watched as      it landed in the Top 10 on iTunes. The video for their single      ``Home (I Wanna Go)'' reached the top of CMT Pure's fan-voted      poll for multiple weeks. A brand-new album in 2014 is sure to      help the duo prove to the rest of the world that, sometimes,      the underdogs win.       ``Growing up, I always seemed to have a chip on my      shoulder,'' says Jamerson. ``As a kid who loved playing      sports, I was smaller than anyone else, so I always had      something to prove in everything that I did. It was the      attitude I would ultimately have with everything in my life.      I was just always super competitive.''       It was an attitude Jamerson seemed to inherit from his      close-knit family. ``Three of my grandparents had a college      degree, which, coming from a small mining town in Kentucky,      was not at all common,'' he recalls. ``I mean, my grandmother      could build anything. Being around those kinds of people all      my life and seeing how driven and successful they were . . .      it definitely made an impression on me.''       As a 5-foot-10 kid basketball player from Prestonsburg,      Bentley also was up against his share of obstacles, none of      which he hadn't learned to conquer during his childhood years      growing up within the sacred walls of the church, hence the      name Sundy Best. ``I would play drums every Sunday with my      dad and brother,'' recalls Bentley, describing himself as a      good kid who ``put Mom through the wringer . . . church      really was the only outlet to get out there and do music,      especially in eastern Kentucky.''       Besides sports and a childhood spent within the church, the      two also shared a musical foundation formed within their      homes, often spending countless hours listening to a diverse      mix of rock, pop, and bluegrass. ``Everyone would get      together at my grandparents' house and play the old bluegrass      standards,'' recalls Jamerson. ``The doctor up the road would      come over and play the fiddle, Grandpa played the banjo,      Grandma played guitar, and my great-aunt played the      mandolin.''       First meeting in elementary school, Jamerson and Bentley      would go on to form a firm foundation of friendship through      their teenage years, which continues to benefit them to this      day. ``When you know someone as long as we have, you know      each other's dynamics,'' says Jamerson. ``He is like a      brother to me. It's gratifying to do this whole music thing      alongside someone you have known for so long.''       After high school, the pair's goal to play sports often      competed with the draw they shared to ultimately pursue a      music career. ``Music was the one passion that I always had,      but looking back, I am glad my parents talked me into getting      a college degree,'' says Jamerson, who was on the Pikeville      College football team. ``The people I met and the experiences      I had in college made me the person I am now. That's where      songs come from. You need perspective and life lessons as a      writer.''       The end of college (Bentley attended and played basketball      for Centre) brought the beginning of the duo's quick, yet      organic, ascent to musical success. After their joint move to      Lexington and a brief stint working at the local cable      company, the two began performing at patio parties,      restaurants and clubs, often playing four-hour sets each      night. A regular gig at Lexington's Redmon's helped the two      establish a growing fan base eager to find out more about the      band.       ``Thank goodness for social media,'' says Bentley, who cut      his musical teeth trying to emulate the songs of artists such      as Bob Seger and Tom Petty. ``Good ol' Facebook was the only      way to connect to our fans and tell them where we were going      to be every night. We would always have 20 or 30 people from      eastern Kentucky who knew us from when we played sports drive      up on a weeknight to see us perform. Seeing that kind of      support when we were just out there playing cover songs was a      huge boost to our confidence.''       Then, Sundy Best recorded the song that would change their      career: ``Home (I Wanna Go).'' ``That song took off right      around the same time when the winter had set in and the patio      gigs had shut down,'' recalls Bentley. ``Once people heard      that song, the whole thing just grew. People knew we were      serious about doing music.''       In 2012, the duo recorded some of their songs that they      self-produced with friend and filmmaker Coleman Saunders, and      independently released Door Without a Screen.       Last year, they were asked to play the jewel of all venues:      the Grand Ole Opry. ``As a musician and performer, I don't      think I will ever be the same,'' says Jamerson. ``I cried      when I found out we were playing there. It was like being at      church and feeling something on your heart and you don't know      what it is. We had been touring all year, so sharing it with      our families was an unbelievable feeling. I mean, what else      could top that? I was watching Netflix the other night and      they were doing a two-day concert special on Neil Young and      were showing this concert he did at the Ryman Auditorium, and      I mean, he was walking through the same doors we did when we      were playing there for the Grand Ole Opry. Every time we get      the chance to play there, it ends up being quite the      spiritual experience.''       The year 2014 brings Sundy Best fans the much-anticipated      new album Bring Up the Sun, a collection of songs that just      might take their longtime fans a bit by surprise. ``Our first      album was quite Kentucky-centric,'' says Jamerson, who spends      any spare time he has at home in Lexington with his two dogs      and cat. ``The music just feels good in our bones. It's a      really broad album, which everyone we work with has a hard      time explaining. But everyone will find something different      in it. It's good music, but it's coming from a bit of a      different angle now, so I suppose people are going to be      surprised. Some people want every record to sound the same,      but once your fans think they know you, you are done. You      won't grow as musicians if they think they have you figured      out.''       ``We definitely have a vision of where we want to be,''      says Bentley, who with Jamerson played more than 190 dates      out on the road in 2013. ``I would never have expected to be      where we are today just one year ago. I think 2014 is going      to be another growth year for us. A lot of people still don't      know who we are, so we want to definitely continue to play      new markets. We are excited to see what happens with this new      record and then determine what happens next.''       No matter where their musical journey might still yet lead      them, one thing is for sure: These two will continue to give      credit where credit is due.       ``You hear people all the time talking about how they are      Texas proud or Georgia proud or even Tennessee proud,'' says      Bentley. ``When you are from eastern Kentucky, you are      automatically proud. You can be anywhere in the world, and if      you meet someone from eastern Kentucky, you are immediately      friends. Plus, they are the craziest fans ever. We love      Nashville and all, but we would just rather stay right here      in Kentucky. The people here have been the biggest driving      factor in our career, and we can never be too thankful.''       ``Before I moved to Lexington, my whole life had been spent      living in eastern Kentucky. I had never had a chance to miss      living in the country. And as we have begun touring more, I      now know it was something I myself took for granted,'' says      Jamerson. ``We love Kentucky and will always want to carry      that flag . . . but we can't wait to spread the word to      everyone else, too.''                          ____________________
