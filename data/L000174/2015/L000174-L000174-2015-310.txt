Lynch testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee for nearly 8 hours. She has now responded to nearly 900 questions for the record. I have been here 40 years and I have a hard time remembering somebody who has answered so many questions. The witnesses invited by Republicans to speak on this, not a single one of them actually opposed her nomination. In fact, I asked all of the outside witnesses: If anybody here opposes her nomination, would you please raise your hand. Nobody did.  Despite this, some voted no--some Republican Senators voted no on her nomination in committee. Some of these Senators opposed her because she would not renounce the President's Executive action to keep immigrant families together. They are attacking her for this. They blame this on her. But they fail to acknowledge that if the Republican leadership in the House had just allowed a vote on the immigration reform that passed the Senate, then the President would not have been compelled to act.  Very hard-working Republicans and Democrats came together in this body to pass by a 2-to-1 margin an immigration bill. Most people felt it would pass the House of Representatives had it been allowed to come to a vote. But the Speaker determined not to let it come to a vote. You cannot then say: We are not going to vote on anything, but, oh, by the way, we are not going to let the President do what Presidents have always done in the absence of legislation, take executive action.  Now we all agree that we have problems in our immigration system. We all agree that we need legislation to fix it. The President is not going to do that. Congress has to do it. We have to stand up and vote for or against changes. But to blame the Attorney General nominee for this is simply unfair. To blame her because the House of Representatives will not vote on immigration is not fair. Ms. Lynch played no part in the President's decision to set the prosecutorial priorities of the administration.  As a Federal prosecutor in New York, no one has claimed that Ms. Lynch has failed to enforce the law. There is no legitimate reason to delay her vote any longer. In fact, there are a whole lot of people in prison today who wish that she had not enforced the law. But if they were guilty of crimes, she enforced it, whether Republicans, Democrats--no matter who they were--and with quite a few terrorists--she enforced the law. She put them in prison.  So we should examine Loretta Lynch's nomination based on herrecord, her accomplishments, her extraordinary character. I call on the Republican Leader to schedule an immediate vote on Loretta Lynch's confirmation. Vote yes or vote no. But this confirmation has been pending for 116 days--116 days. We have had several breaks--some of our constituents call them vacations--during that time. Let's take a day or so and vote on her.  Let's not deprive the American people of even one more day of having Loretta Lynch as their Attorney General. Let's vote to confirm this superb woman, this superb nominee for Attorney General, this nominee who believes that justice is an ideal, that all of us, no matter what our political party, should ascribe to.  I told her father how moved I was to watch his pride as she was before our committee for confirmation, I said, the pride was well earned because of the example he set to her as a child, to face up to all obstacles and overcome them. Well, let's not have the Senate set an obstacle that she cannot overcome. Let's have a vote. Let's put her in there as Attorney General, for the good of the country, not of any political party, but for the good of the country.  This is not the Attorney General of the President. This is not the Attorney General of the Members of this body. This is the Attorney General of the United States. It is the Attorney General for 300 million Americans. Let's give 300 million Americans the Attorney General they deserve.  I yield the floor.
