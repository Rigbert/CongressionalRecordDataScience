President, we will try our best. We are, of course, under the same limitation as everybody else trying to get a lot of work done. I had planned in the next week or so to do a number of judicial hearings. I suppose we can spend the time doing this. It probably would make some sense.  We do not define terrorism, but we say we are adding that. I guess some kid who is scaring you with his computer could be a terrorist and you could go through the kid's house, his parents' business or anything else under this language; it is that broad.  Again, the Senate can vote for whatever it wants. I certainly hope we would put in, and I will support the money for the liability insurance. The problem, I suspect, is with several hundred million dollars. But if that is what we want, we should do it. Let us make sure we know. I will try to get the time for people to work on this during the next couple of weeks to try to answer the questions.  The Senator from Michigan asks a legitimate one. We will set aside virtually everything else in the Judiciary Committee to get an answer. Had I or our staff been asked about this, we probably could have had those answers, but I saw it about 30 minutes ago, about the same time the Senator from Michigan did.  I tell my friend from New Hampshire who asked a question earlier, I have no objection to voting any time the Senator from New Hampshire desires to vote.
