Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute.  Mr. Chairman, I would, in the same tone that my friend, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), just spoke, I would like to say to him and to all the Members that if we wanted to be political about this what we would have done would be to have all the checks delivered to those offices of the Members who voted for the tax cut and let them send out the checks with a little message to their constituents. Now that would have been political.  The way we are doing it now is really not political, and I think it is important that people understand in plain English what this is all about.
