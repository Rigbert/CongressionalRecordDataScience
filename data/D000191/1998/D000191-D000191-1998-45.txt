Chairman, let us revisit where we are at with this amendment. It does not eliminate this demonstration user fee program, but what it does do is say it will not be extended for 2 more years beyond 1999. Beyond October 1st of 1999.  What it says is we will receive a report, as required by the original demonstration fee program, on 3\1/2\ years of data in March of 1999. Then we will know. We will know how much is going to overhead, we will know how well this is working, we will know where the money is being spent, and then we can make decisions.  If, indeed, the authorizers are incapable of acting, and I would question if it is this popular, knockdown popular as everybody says it is, that people are just thrilled to pay this money and they know it is going to a good cause, why would the authorizing committee have any problem in moving a bill? I know the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young) would be happy to do that, if it is so popular.
