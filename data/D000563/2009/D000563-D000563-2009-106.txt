 First, he suggested that these detainees would be freed in Illinois. Not so. The plan of this administration is not to free them; the plan is to imprison them in the most secure prison in the United States of America. It is in Thomson, IL, 150 miles from Chicago. I was there a few weeks ago. It is a supermax prison built 7 years ago and never fully occupied. Now they are going to build an additional fence around it. It will be more secure than any prison in America. They will be freed into the most secure prison in America and they are not coming out until such time as there is a resolution of whatever their issues may be or they pass away.  I might also say that the current law in the United States prohibits the President of the United States from releasing these detainees in the United States. Those statements by the Senator from Georgia are just flat incorrect.  He is entitled to his position--and others share it--that we should not close Guantanamo. I believe we should. On my side of this argument would be the following people who have called for the closure of Guantanamo: President George W. Bush; Secretary of State and former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Colin Powell; Secretary of Defense under President Bush and under President Obama, Robert Gates; former Secretary of State and domestic policy adviser Condoleezza Rice; GEN David Petraeus, and 33 other generals, in addition to President Barack Obama.  This argument that closing Guantanamo endangers the United States ignores the obvious. The people entrusted with the responsibility of protecting the United States have called for the closure of Guantanamo. Yesterday, Robert Gibbs, press secretary to President Obama, was asked about this decision to transfer. He said that on more than 30 occasions--I am not sure of the timeframe, whether it was this year or a longer period of time--but on more than 30 occasions, they have found direct linkage of terrorist recruitment activity and the use of Guantanamo as an illustration of why people needed to convert to terrorism around the world. It is still being actively used for recruitment.  If the Senator from Georgia would go back a few weeks and read Newsweek magazine, one of their reporters was captured in Tehran and held in captivity for almost 4 months. He told a story of how he was first incarcerated in a prison in Tehran. As he arrived, his jailer said to him: Welcome to Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo, American.  So for us to believe that the rest of the world does not have a negative image of Guantanamo and it is not being used against our troops is to ignore the obvious.  There are some in this body who are hidebound to keep Guantanamo open at any costs. I will tell you, the cost is too high. If the continuation of Guantanamo means danger to our troops, we owe it to them to close it. Presidents have reached that conclusion, people in charge of national security have reached that conclusion, and we should as well.  Then there is this notion about the danger of incarcerating terrorists in the United States. For the record, over 350 convicted terrorists are currently imprisoned in the United States, all over the United States. In my home State of Illinois, 35 convicted terrorists are in prison today. The most recent incarceration involves a man arrested shortly after 9/11 in Peoria, IL, an unlikely hotbed of terrorism and spy activity, but, in fact, this man going to school in Peoria, IL, through his communications was linked with al-Qaida. He served time in a Navy brig in South Carolina, if I am not mistaken, and eventually was tried in the courts of Peoria, IL, convicted and now incarcerated in Marion, IL, in southern Illinois.  I heard not one word of criticism when this took place under the previous administration. The belief was this man had to answer for the crimes he was charged with and serve time in our prison system as a result of it. Never--not once, not one time--did I ever hear any Congressman of either political party say: Boy, it is unsafe to try him in Peoria or it is unsafe to incarcerate him in southern Illinois. It has never been said.  What happens to these people when they go into our supermax prisons, where no one has ever escaped? They disappear, as they should. They are where they ought to be--isolated and away from causing harm to anyone.  When President Obama was looking for an alternative to Guantanamo, we came forward. One of the mayors of a small town in Illinois--Thomson, IL--with just several hundred people living there, wrote to the Governor of our State and to me and said: I have a big old prison the State built and never opened--built it in 2001. It has the capacity of several thousand prisoners, and the State could never afford to open it. We had hoped that this prison would create a lot of local jobs for us. Can you find a use for it at the Federal level?  The Obama administration took a hard look at this for a long period of time. Part of it was done confidentially, and then they came out publicly and said: We are seriously interested.  The Senator from Georgia said earlier: Well, the people of Illinois are against this.  Well, I would say to my friend from Georgia, come on down to Thomson, IL. Come down and see the people who are overwhelmingly supportive--and not just Democrats, believe me. Local State representative Jim Sacia is a Republican and a former FBI agent. He said we would be idiots not to take this offer from the Federal Government. He is right. Three thousand jobs. I don't know that there is a Senator here if you said to him: Would you be interested in 3,000 jobs in the midst of a recession, who wouldn't stand up and say: Let's talk.  Well, we did. So it is 3,000 new jobs at this prison when it is opened as part of the Bureau of Prisons and part of the Department of Defense.  How many Guantanamo detainees will be sent there? Fewer than 100. We have 35 in our prisons already. Life has not changed in my home State of Illinois, nor has it changed in any other State where they are incarcerated. It would not change in Thomson, IL. These people can be held safely and securely. I trust our men and women in the military to do that, and the Members of the Senate should do so as well.  These 3,000 jobs are going to be a Godsend to an area with 11 percent unemployment. First, there will be a lot of construction jobs, and we can use those. Those are good-paying jobs for Americans right here at home. Then those who work for the Bureau of Prisons are going to be paid a good salary and receive good benefits, the kind of salary you can use to build a family, a community, a neighborhood. These will be people who will be buying homes--3,000 of them. They will be buying homes, cars, shopping for appliances, and going to the local shopping malls. Is that going to be good for the economy? You bet it is. It is just what we need, and it is just what this area of the State wants. This argument that we somehow will oppose it is just wrong.  There is a local Congressman, who is a friend of mine--a Republican Congressman--who opposes it. We have talked about it. We just don't see eye to eye on it. But even in Rockford, IL, the largest city in his district, which is northeast of Thomson, the city council in Rockford passed a resolution of approval of this Thomson prison, 12 to 2. In county after county, State and local governments--I should say local county governments are coming out in favor of this Thomson prison. Those who come to the Senate floor and argue otherwise don't know the facts. When they know the facts, they will realize we are prepared to do this.  Now the question is whether the Senate will stand behind the President, stand behind our security advisers who believe this is in the best interest of the United States. I think it is. It isn't the first time Illinois has been called on to do something extraordinary for our country. The first supermax prison in our Federal system was built in Marion, IL, years and years ago. There was controversy. This was the most secure prison in America. But I will tell you, the people of southern Illinois rallied behind it. It has been a prison with a lot of great professionals who have worked there. They have done their jobs and done them well.  When I go down to Marion, IL, and talk to them about Guantanamo detainees, they say: Senator, listen. Send them here. We will take care of them. We can point out among those who are incarcerated at Marion prison those who were engaged in al-Qaida terrorism, Colombian drug gangs, Mexican drug cartels, some of the meanest, toughest most violent gang bangers from the cities in the Midwest--and they are held safely every day.  I will tell you, when I hear people say they do not trust our prison system to hold a handful or 50 or whatever the number may be--less than 100--of these Guantanamo detainees, they ought to meet the men and women who do it every single day in America, and do it well. They should realize these detainees will be held by our military, the Department of Defense employees. Those are the ones we can trust to do it.  So I would urge my friends and others who have spoken earlier--Senator McConnell came to the Senate floor earlier. It has become, unfortunately, a party position now that it is a bad idea. Earlier, Senator McCain and Senator Graham on the Republican side of the aisle didn't argue against the transfer of these detainees. They understand these prisoners aren't larger than life. They have been in prison for 8 years. Frankly, I don't know how much longer they will stay there. But as long as they are a threat to the United States, they will.  Madam President, I would like to at this point address an issue which came up earlier on the Senate floor.  Something unusual happened on the floor of the Senate today, Madam President. It happens but rarely. Under the rules of the Senate, amendments and bills can be read, if a Member requests, and we usually ask unanimous consent to dispense with the reading. And, routinely, that is done. It is done every day on scores of different things.  Today, Senator Sanders of Vermont offered an amendment near and dear to his heart on single-payer health care reform, and it turned out to be a voluminous amendment--800 pages long. When the time came to ask consent that it not be read, there was an objection from Senator Coburn of Oklahoma. He insisted that it be read. Our poor clerking staff up here--the clerks of the Senate--started reading this bill, and they read on for almost 2 hours or more.  As they were reading it, it came to our attention that Senator Sanders of Vermont had authority under the Senate rules to withdraw his amendment and to stop the reading of the amendment.  I wasn't aware of that because I can't recall that has ever happened since I have been here. But I made a point--since many years ago I was a parliamentarian of the Illinois State Senate and tried to at least read the rules from time to time--to turn to rule XV, section 2, in the Standing Rules of the Senate, and here is what it says:       Any motion, amendment, or resolution may be withdrawn or      modified by the mover at any time before a decision,      amendment or ordering of the yeas and nays, except a motion      to reconsider, which shall not be withdrawn without leave.  In other words, until action was taken on the Sanders amendment, he had the authority under rule XV, paragraph 2 to withdraw his amendment, which he did.  Some have come to the floor and protested and said this was extraordinary, and it can't be backed up by the Senate rules. But I refer them to this rule, which is explicit, and that no action had taken place on this amendment other than the introduction of the amendment and reading. So, as it says here, ``any time before a decision, amendment, or ordering of the yeas and nays.'' I think that is a clear case.  I have since read an earlier ruling by the Chair relative to the same rule that goes back several decades, so the ruling of the Chair today, or at least the finding of the Chair, was consistent with the rules of the Senate. But the strategy that came out in the ordering of this amendment to be read is pretty clear when it comes to health care. The Republican strategy is clear to anyone who is watching the debate: They do not want amendments. In fact, they just don't want us to vote on health care reform. There comes a time when people make the best arguments they can and the Senate makes a decision, and that is what we are facing. That is what we want. We would like to do that in a timely fashion.  Members here believe we can do that in a responsible way and move this health care reform bill to a point of a vote--a cloture vote, with a 60-vote requirement--and do that in a way that we can find the sentiment in the Senate on this important measure and just maybe go home for Christmas, which a lot of us would like to do. We have been away from our families for quite a while.  During the course of this debate, we have been spending a lot of time on the bill itself. I usually like to give people an idea by holding up this 2,074-page bill. It took a lot of work to get to this point. The managers' amendment to this will be several hundred pages, I imagine.  People say: Why is it so big? It is big because we are changing the health care system in America, which is one-sixth of our economy. You can imagine all the different moving parts in this complicated health care system that we address with this bill.  During this period of time, the Republicans have not offered any alternative or substitute. I thought that would be their first motion, to come forward and say: That is the Democratic plan to change the health care system in America, but you should see the Republican plan, how much better it is. They didn't do that because there is no Republican alternative. There is no Republican substitute.  Last week, when I went to the Senate Republican Web site--and I invite people to do the same--I found there was only one bill printed there on health care reform. It was the Democratic bill, not any bill that has been offered by the Republican side. The reason is this is hard work. Putting a bill like this together, getting experts to look at it and decide whether it is going to save money or cost money, it takes time. We have taken that time to do it, and do it right, and they have not. So they are either not up to the challenge of preparing an alternative bill, or they are content with the current system.  I guess some people are content with the current system. Among those who are content with it are the CEOs of health insurance companies. They like this system. They make a lot of money. They do it at the expense of a lot of people who need health care and end up being turned down. So, unfortunately, the Republicans have no constructive proposals to improve our bill. Each and every amendment, almost without exception, has been to send the bill back to committee; to stop working on it, and let's do this another day. All they want to do on the bill is to delay it, as they tried to do today with the reading of the Sanders amendment.  Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire is a friend of mine. He and his wife Kathy and my wife Loretta and I have traveled together on official business of the Senate. I like him. He is a smart guy. He is going to retire, and he, in his wisdom, decided to leave a playbook for the Republican side of the aisle, which they shared. It is page after page of ways to slow down and stop the Senate from acting. Senator Gregg is entirely within his rights as a Senator to do it. What I read in his memo was accurate, but the intent and motive are clear: He wanted to stop this bill from moving in order, and that became the real cause on the Republican side of the aisle. They took a page out of Senator Gregg's playbook today with Senator Coburn's demanding the amendment be read. But it didn't work.  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a colloquy between former Senators Adams and Packwood on the floor of the Senate on September 24, 1992.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                        Tax Enterprise Zones Act              (Senate--September 24, 1992), [Page: S14919]       The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.
