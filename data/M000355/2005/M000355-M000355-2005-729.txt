 President, let me add, we are going to finish the bill tonight. We hope to finish it late this afternoon. We have made good progress on this side of the aisle in whittling down the number of amendments. We would like to talk to anyone remaining on the Republican side who has an amendment they may want to offer, and Senator Leahy, of course, is open for business on the Democratic side.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
