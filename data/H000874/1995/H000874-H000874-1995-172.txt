Speaker, as the peace negotiations between the warring parties in the Bosnian conflict continue in Dayton, an American journalist continues to be incarcerated and held hostage by the Bosnian Serbs.  David Rohde, a journalist for the Christian Science Monitor, was responsible for exposing the killing fields near Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia. He is now being held in captivity, detained by those responsible, the Bosnian Serbs. They have charged him with, and I quote, ``Illegal border crossings and falsifying documents.'' He has been tried and convicted by what our own State Department has called, rightfully, a kangaroo court. He has, Mr. Speaker, become a pawn of the Serbs in their peace negotiations.  I suspect that Milosevic and his gang think they can use David Rohde as a bargaining chip in order to have us reduce our demands that the Serbs remove war criminals Karakzic and Mladic from their commands as part of any peace agreement. They are wrong.  Mr. Speaker, I am today urging the Clinton administration to demand that David Rohde and other noncombatant personnel, including all U.N. military and civilian personnel, be immediately released.                          ____________________
