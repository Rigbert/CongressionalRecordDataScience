 We can talk about all these other things, these social areas in which to invest our money. But if we do not stay on line and finish what we have started, what we have paid for, to develop a national missile defense system, I believe we will regret it. I agree with Jim Woolsey--and certainly Jim Woolsey is not a Republican; he was the CIA Director appointed by President Clinton--when he said our intelligence confirms there are between 20 and 25 nations that currently have, or are in various stages of developing, weapons of mass destruction, either chemical, biological, or nuclear, and are working on the missile means to deliver them.  The Senator from North Dakota is fully aware that such technology is out there, and that many of those countries who want to sell that technology may do so and we might not have any way of knowing what is going on.
