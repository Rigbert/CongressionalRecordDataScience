 1416. A bill to amend Federal election laws to repeal the public financing of national political party conventions and Presidential elections and spending limits on Presidential election campaigns, to repeal the limits on coordinated expenditures by political parties, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.              the presidential campaign reform act of 1997  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Governmental Affairs hearings investigating the 1996 Presidential election affirmed what knowledgeable observers have contended for years--that the Presidential campaign finance system of spending limits and taxpayer funding is a fraud.  Not soon forgotten will be the seamy videos of the White House coffee fundraisers in which the President was caught on tape extolling the virtues of circumventing the Presidential system's contribution and spending limits, via soft money contributions to the DNC--that once proud institution hijacked by the Clinton-Gore campaign bent on reelection in 1996. The 1996 Clinton-Gore reelection campaign took campaign finance chicanery to new heights, or lows, depending on your perspective.  Mr. President, I am no fan of spending limits so am not without sympathy for those who must campaign under them. The Presidential system, while technically voluntary, presents a Hobson's choice to those contemplating a campaign. Candidates can choose between compliance with arbitrary and severe spending limits, burdensome regulatory requirements, and the prospect of years of FEC audits or trying to mount a credible campaign under the severe constraints of outdated contribution limits.  It's difficult enough to mount a statewide Senate campaign with individual contributions limited to $1,000 a pop. Conducting a nationwide effort under the same contribution limits must be a nightmare. It requires, at the least, a Herculean effort, unless a candidate has the good fortune to have a fortune sufficient to bankroll their own campaign out of their own pocket. So I might be inclined to cut the President and Vice President some slack for this particular malfeasance--they have so many fundraising misdeeds to account for this one got lost in the shuffle until recently. I might cut them some slack if they were not such shameless hypocrites, portraying themselves as victims of the system and America's biggest fans of reform, when they aren't pleading incompetence.  ``William J. Clinton'' signed a letter, addressed to the Chairman of the Federal Election Commission, on October 13, 1995, in which the President agreed to comply with the Presidential system's limits in exchange for which the Clinton-Gore campaign would receive taxpayer dollars. All told, the Clinton-Gore campaign received $75 million for the primary and general elections in 1996. The Democratic National Committee received over $12 million for its convention extravaganza in Chicago. It was a lie.  The Clinton-Gore campaign took the money--$75 million from the U.S. Treasury--and never had any intention of confining their campaign to the spending limits. The Presidential system, from its inception, has been a bad joke on the American taxpayers, limiting neither spending, nor so-called ``special interests,'' as its creators--self-styled reformers--said it would.  Unwilling to concede that their utopian reform vision has become a taxpayer-funded debacle worthy only of dismantling, the inside-the-beltway reform industry agitates instead for even more restrictions--on the party committees and independent groups. It would be like putting band-aids on the Titanic, and unconstitutional, to boot.  The reform dream is the taxpayers' nightmare. Over $1 billion has been squandered on the Presidential system. It is an entitlement program for politicians. And a boondoggle for the likes of fringe candidates such as Lenora Fulani and Lyndon LaRouche who have flocked to the Presidential campaign entitlement program, like moths to a flame.  Even Ross Perot's Reform Party has gotten into the act--as the Texas billionaire received $30 million from the U.S. Treasury last year for his campaign. An irony is that the Perot Reform Party's partaking of taxpayer funds from the Presidential system coffers will be the straw that breaks the camel's back in 2000. The Reform Party is going to bleed the reform dream dry if it takes what it will be entitled to in primary matching, convention, and general election funding. This is the gist of a recent FEC staff report on the fund's prospects for the 2000 campaign.  At the outset of the 2000 Presidential primaries, the Presidential fund will be so near bankruptcy that candidates will be able to receive only a tiny fraction of what they are entitled to. FECstaff predict this dearth of funding will prompt some candidates to opt out of the Presidential spending limit system altogether. Where would such an exodus leave the competitive field? The candidates would still be stuck with the quarter-century old contribution limits, bestowing a tremendous advantage on those select few who have a huge donor base from which to draw or the wherewithal to fund a campaign out of their own pocket.  This is a very real campaign finance crisis--a Presidential system on the edge of oblivion and a wide-open contest looming in the year 2000. So I rise today to introduce a bill to reform the Presidential system--the object of so much scandal and scorn. This reform legislation would repeal the Presidential system's spending limits and taxpayer funding. It would save the American taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars every election. To compensate for the loss of taxpayer funding and make the system more realistic, the contribution limit for Presidential candidates would be adjusted to $10,000, up from the current $1,000. The PAC limit would also be adjusted up to $10,000.  It would also strengthen the political parties by updating the hard money contribution limits regulating donations to them. These limits are a quarter-century old and long overdue for adjustments. Candidates and political parties should not be shackled in the year 2000 with circa-1970's contribution limits. The bill would also do what the Supreme Court talked about doing in the 1996 Colorado decision and is likely to do in the near future: abolish the coordinated spending limit. This arbitrary restriction on what parties can do in coordination with their nominees is absurd. The parties prefer to operate in hard money over soft money. These reforms would facilitate that activity.  Mr. President, these are commonsense reforms that would enhance competition and increase accountability in Presidential elections. In the interest of heading off a complete breakdown of the Presidential system in 2000, I urge Senators to step away from the traditional reform paradigm and join me in this effort.                                 ______                                       By
