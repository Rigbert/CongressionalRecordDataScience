Mr. Speaker, I submit for the benefit of the Members a copy of the cost estimate prepared by the Congressional Budget Office for H.R. 3986, a bill to provide for a study of the engineering feasibility of a water exchange in lieu of electrification of the Chandler Pumping Plant at Prosser Diversion Dam, Washington.                                                    U.S. Congress,                                  Congressional Budget Office,                               Washington, DC, September 20, 2000.     Hon. Don Young,     Chairman, Committee on Resources, House of Representatives,          Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has      prepared the enclosed cost estimate for H.R. 3986, a bill to      provide for a study of the engineering feasibility of a water      exchange in lieu of electrification of the Chandler Pumping      Plant at Prosser Diversion Dam, Washington.       If you wish further details of this estimate, we will be      pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact if Rachel      Applebaum, who can be reached at 226-2860.           Sincerely,                                                 Barry B. Anderson                                   (For Dan L. Crippen, Director).       Enclosure.     Congressional Budget Office, Cost Estimate, September 20, 2000     (H.R. 3986: A bill to provide for a study of the engineering    feasibility of a water exchange in lieu of electrification of the     Chandler Pumping Plant at Prosser Diversion Dam, Washington, as   reported by the House Committee on Resources on September 19, 2000)                                SUMMARY       The Kennewick and Columbia Irrigation Districts in      Washington use water diverted from the Yakima River. H.R.      3986 would authorize the Secretary of the Interior to conduct      a feasibility study, prepare an environmental assessment, and      acquire right-of-way areas necessary to divert water from the      Columbia River rather than the Yakima River to meet the needs      of these irrigation districts.       Based on information from the Bureau of Reclamation, CBO      estimates that implementing H.R. 3986 would cost $6 million      over the 2001-2003 period, assuming the appropriation of the      necessary funds. Enacting H.R. 3986 would not affect direct      spending or receipts; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures      would not apply. H.R. 3986 contains no intergovernmental or      private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates      Reform Act (UMRA) and would impose no costs on state, local,      or tribal governments.                ESTIMATED COST TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT       The estimated budgetary impact of H.R. 3986 is shown in the      following table. The costs of this legislation fall within      budget funding 300 (natural resources and environment).------------------------------------------------------------------------                                          By fiscal year, in millions of                                                     dollars                                        --------------------------------                                          2001   2002   2003  2004  2005------------------------------------------------------------------------                    SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION Estimated Authorization Level..........      6      0      0   0     0Estimated Outlays......................      1      2      3   0     0------------------------------------------------------------------------                           BASIS OF ESTIMATE       Based on information from the Bureau of Reclamation, CBO      estimates that the feasibility study and the environmental      assessment authorized by the bill would cost $4 million, and      that the acquisition of right-of-way areas for this water      diversion project would cost $2 million.       Current law authorizes the appropriation of $4 million for      an electrification project at the Chandler pumping plant.      Although H.R. 3986 authorizes the exchange of water as an      alternative to this electrification project, appropriated      funds for the electrification project have already been spent      by the bureau to study this project and on other activities.      Consequently, H.R. 3986 appears to provide new authority to      study the exchange of water from the Yakima to the Columbia      River and for the acquisition of right-of-way areas.       Pay-as-you-go considerations: None.              INTERGOVERNMENTAL AND PRIVATE-SECTOR IMPACT       H.R. 3986 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector      mandates as defined in UMRA and would impose no costs on      state, local or tribal governments.       Estimate prepared by: Federal Costs: Rachel Applebaum (226-     2860); Impact on State, Local, and Tribal Governments:      Marjorie Miller (225-3220); Impact on the Private Sector:      Lauren Marks (226-2940).       Estimate approved by: Peter H. Fontaine, Deputy Assistant      Director for Budget Analysis.                               ____________________
