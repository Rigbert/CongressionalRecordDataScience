 Speaker, I would like to have printed in the Record statements by high school students from my home State of Vermont, who were speaking at my recent town meeting on issues facing young people today. I am asking that you please insert these statements in the Congressional Record as I believe that the views of these young persons will benefit my colleagues.                   Workers' Rights and Welfare Reform             (On behalf of Daniel Peyser and Jenn Donohue)       Daniel Peyser: I'm going to be covering workers' rights,      and specifically minimum wage, and maybe health care, and      Jenn is going to be doing welfare reform, which will tie into      it.       A key issue regarding the basic rights of workers is a      livable wage. There was a minimum wage increase that was from      $4.25 to $5.15, but it is still not livable. It is nice to      have the wage increase, but it is not significantly helping      us out. I make minimum wage, and it's a pain when you are not      making enough money that you feel that you would deserve more      for the work that you put in. But, over the past two decades,      the minimum wage, with that one exception of that increase,      has largely, for most people, stagnated or declined, and      combined with inflation, the real value of the minimum wage      hasn't increased very much since around 1955 to 1970.       It used to be, after World War II, that when productivity      went up in companies that the workers got cut into the action      and everyone prospered. But between 1983 and 1989, we have      seen that, as companies reach record profits, that workers      aren't getting cut in any more. And between 1983 and 1989, 99      percent of the new wealth that was accumulated went to the      top 20 percent of the income groups.       America is now the most economically stratified country in      the industrialized world. So there's a lot of issues that      also tie in with livable wage. I mean, you have welfare,      which is one issue. And one of the incentives perhaps for a      lot of people who are on welfare would be a higher minimum      wage. I think the answer to the problem would be to require      companies to, first of all, raise the minimum wage to      something that is easily livable. Ideally, I would have said      $9 an hour or so. Cut back working hours, so require      companies, based on how much money they make, to hire a      certain number of workers, also based on their expenses,      which would help unemployment rates.       Other issues that tie in are, a large part of having an      unbalanced budget can be attributed to having stagnated      wages. College education prices have gone up 80 percent over      the past two decades, I think, as far as the cost of real      value. And it is going to be harder and harder for people who      are making minimum wage now to send their kids to college or      to support their families.       Congressman Sanders: Jenn?       Jenn Donohue: As a senior in high school, the time is      coming where I have to go out and find a job and employment.      And, as Dan was saying, it bothers me in both respects, that      there are people out there who are making minimum wage,      trying to feed their kids, trying to buy necessities, basic      things that people need, and they are getting welfare; and      there are other people out there who don't work, who wait for      the check to come every month, and that's what they live on,      they have no initiative to get up, get out, and get a job.       Welfare was established for people in need, to help them      get back up on their feet until the time came where they were      okay, and they were all set, and they didn't need it as much      as they did before. But now, I think, there is a problem      where people are using it as their basic income. They have no      desire to get up and get a job. And it is not the case with      all people who are on welfare. Some people need it intensely.      They are working two jobs, their spouse is working two jobs.      Their kids are going to school, they need food and products      all kids need.       I just think that something has to be done to change the      way that welfare is going, because it is unfair to deprive      people who really need the welfare of the money, when it is      going to people who are just using it--I mean, there are      women who get pregnant so they will have more money coming in      the door. It is sick and it's twisted, and something needs to      be done to reform welfare, so that the people who need it are      getting it, and the people who need it and aren't doing      anything to get it do something about that.       Congressman Sanders: Thanks for tackling a very, very      important issue.                                       ____                       Zero Tolerance for Alcohol                     (On behalf of Laura Megivern)       Laura Megivern: My name is Laura Megivern, and I'm from      South Burlington High School.       In all 50 states, it is illegal for anyone under 21 to      purchase and possess alcoholic beverages. Following this      logic, it should therefore be illegal for anyone under the      age of 21 to have a blood alcohol concentration of anything      over .00. However, this is not the case. In Vermont, anything      under a .02 alcohol level is legal for someone under 21 years      old, who cannot legally purchase or possess any alcoholic      product.       It is required that all states have a zero tolerance law      for people under the legal drinking age. A zero tolerance law      is defined as any law that states that persons under 21 are      not allowed to have a blood alcohol level of anything more      than .02, .01 or .00. In 1994, according to the National      Highway Safety Administration, motor vehicle traffic crashes      cost the United States more than $150 billion in economic      costs. Crashes involving 15- to 20-year-olds cost the United      States years more than $21 billion in 1994.       Although they may be effective, there is a bit of a      discrepancy in the fact that, although youth are not      permitted to purchase or possess alcohol, it is all right for      them to have some alcohol in their blood. One reason why the      legal limit is set above zero is because of problems with the      calibration of instruments, and because of the margin of      error that may exist in the use of a Breathalyzer.       Other reasons brought up while the law was being created      were that some foods may raise the alcohol level in breath,      and that wine consumed in church as part of communion may      raise the blood alcohol to an illegal level. The amount of      wine ingested during communion would most likely be      immeasurable, unless the Breathalyzer test was administered      just afterwards. Also, an average high school student taking      one dose of NyQuil would be under this limit, as the alcohol      level would barely be measurable--although, in my opinion, if      you feel bad enough to take NyQuil, a cough syrup advertised      as helping someone get to sleep, you probably shouldn't be      driving anyway. Some yeast products may also raise the      alcohol content, but not to a measurable level, according to      Dan Steinbar of the Day One Program, an outpatient      rehabilitation program. He also says that, a beginning      drinker without a high tolerance to alcohol, like a teenager,      would be showing signs of impairment, especially of slurred      speech and impairment of judgment, at a .02 blood alcohol      concentration.       To get to a .02 blood alcohol concentration, you would need      to drink a can of beer, 12 ounces, or 6 ounces of wine. In      fact, for a 150-pound male, one can of beer, 5 ounces of      wine, or 1.5 ounces of hard liquor puts the blood alcohol      concentration above the legal limit even for someone over 21.      However, if the male waited two hours to drive, he would be      below it.       The rationale for zero tolerance is clearly understandable.      According to the National Highway Traffic Safety      Administration, 21 percent of 15- to 20-year-old drivers      involved in fatal crashes had some alcohol in their blood in      1996. In the same year, an estimated 846 lives were saved by      the minimum-age drinking laws, and an estimated 16,513 lives      have been saved by these laws since 1975.       Although there is a discrepancy in the legal limit and what      one would hope would be the legal limit, I see the reasoning      behind it, although I hope that, one day, equipment will be      in use in Vermont that has no margin of error, so that we can      have an actual zero tolerance law, rather than a .02      tolerance law, because zero should mean zero.                               ____________________
