Speaker, can the gentleman tell us how long you anticipate the debate on the bill itself would be? Obviously, I am asking that in the context of when can Members believe that we may be concluding tomorrow's business?  Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  It is our anticipation to be done in the afternoon, but the gentleman may know better how long it will take based upon as we move through during the day.
