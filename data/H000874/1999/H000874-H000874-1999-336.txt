Speaker, I rise today to address an issue I have raised in this Chamber many times before: the Czech citizenship law. For 5 years, as a member of the Helsinki Commission, I have argued that the law adopted when the Czechoslovak Federal Republic dissolved, on January 1, 1993, was designed to and had the effect of leaving tens of thousands of former Czechoslovaks de jure or de facto stateless. I have argued, and as Czech officials eventually admitted, all of those people were members of the Romani minority. And I have argued that to have a law with such a narrow and discriminatory impact was no accident. Most of all, I have argued that this law needed to be changed.  In 1996, the law was amended in an effort to placate international critics of the law, but that amendment was mere window dressingand the Czech citizenship law still left tens of thousands of former Czechoslovaks stateless, every one a Rom. Moreover, there was an important principle at stake: citizenship laws in newly independent states which discriminate against permanent residents who were citizens of the former state on the basis of race, language, religion or ethnicity are not compatible with international norms. That failure to uphold this principle in the Czech Republic could have critical reverberations in every former Soviet Republic and, more to the point, every former Yugoslav Republic.  Many people working on this issue believed that the 1996 amendment was all that was politically possibly; that we would simply have to resign ourselves to a generation of stateless Roma. The leadership of the Helsinki Commission, including the current Chairman, Congressman Chris Smith, held our ground and insisted that the Czech law should be amended again, to bring it into line with international norms.  Meanwhile, throughout this first post-Communist decade, the number of violent attacks against Roma climbed, year after year. By the fall of 1997, some 2000 Czech Roma had requested asylum in Canada. By 1998, NGO's reported that there had been more than 40 racially motivated murders in the Czech Republic since 1990, more than the number of racially motivated murders in Bulgaria, Romania, and Slovakia combined--countries with much larger Romani populations. Midway through 1998, the city of Usti nad Labem announced plans to build a wall to segregate Romani residents from ethnic Czechs--a ghetto in the heart of Europe.  Fortunately, the Czech Government elected last year appears to take the human rights violation of Czech Roma much more seriously. Early after taking office, Deputy Prime Minister Pavel Rychetsky announced that amending the Czech citizenship law would be a priority for his government. Acting on that commitment, the Chamber of Deputies adopted an amendment on July 9 that will enable thousands of Roma to apply for citizenship.  This amendment must still be passed by the Czech Senate and signed into law by President Havel--both steps are expected to take place this year. More critically, it will be necessary to ensure that there is an active campaign to reach all those who have been denied citizenship, to make sure this right is fully exercised. But for now, the Czech Chamber of Deputies has upheld an important principle and, even more importantly, upheld the rights of the Romani minority.                          ____________________
