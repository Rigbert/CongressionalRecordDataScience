Speaker, reclaiming my time, I also have a statistic. There used to be 6,700 working families in the First Congressional District. They are not going to be benefited by this resolution, and not because of the reasons that the gentleman from California (Mr. Matsui) stated, that this is meaningless for the next 8 years. It is because they have lost their job since George Bush became President and the 107th Congress began; 6,700 people do not have a paycheck. They do not have to worry about this resolution.  I must tell my colleagues that last week, under similar circumstances, I suggested I was tired. Today, I am surprised, with the record of the majority over the last 2 years of getting things done. My Republican colleagues have turned a surplus of $237 billion into a deficit of $165 billion; they have turned economic growth into a recession.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average was at 10,646 at the beginning of this Congress. Under Republican leadership, yesterday it closed at 7,863. My colleagues have also been able to turn median household income around. It has declined. It has declined from $43,100 to $42,200. Maybe they do not quite need as much help.  The resolution today talks about making permanent a tax change. Hopefully, by 2010, these aberrant facts will have changed. But two things have become permanent under my colleagues' leadership. I have people who have permanently lost their jobs in the domestic steel industry, and they are never going back. Many of those people permanently lost their health insurance. They are never getting it back. Many of those people at LTD, who permanently lost their job, permanently lost their health care, permanently, forever, the rest of their lives, lost part of their pension.  We ought to be voting on 4646 to provide people who used to have a job with some real health care protection. That is what we ought to be doing today.
