 President, I rise today to join my esteemed colleagues in the introduction of the Small Business Liability Reform Act of 1999.  Over the last 30 years, the American civil justice system has become inefficient, unpredictable and costly. Consequently, I have spent a great deal of my time in the United States Senate working to reform the legal system. I was particularly pleased to help lead in the efforts to pass the Volunteer Protection Act, which offers much-needed litigation protection for our country's battalion of volunteers. America's litigation crisis, however, goes well beyond our volunteers.  Lawsuits and the mere threat of lawsuits impede invention and innovation, and the competitive position our nation has enjoyed in the world marketplace. The litigation craze has several perverse effects. For example, it discourages the production of more and better products, while encouraging the production of more and more attorneys. In the 1950s, there was one lawyer for every 695 Americans. Today, in contrast, there is one lawyer for every 290 people. In fact, we have more lawyers per capita than any other western democracy.  Mr. President, don't get me wrong--there is nothing inherently wrong with being a lawyer. I am proud to be a graduate of the University of Kentucky College of Law. My point, however, is simple: government and society should promote a world where its more desirable to create goods and services than it is to create lawsuits.  The chilling effects of our country's litigation epidemic are felt throughout our national economy--especially by our small businesses. We must act to remove the litigation harness that constrains our nation's small businesses.  Small businesses are vital to our nation's economy. My state provides a perfect example of the importance of small business. In Kentucky, more than 85% of our businesses are small businesses.  The Small Business Lawsuit Abuse Protection Act is a narrowly-crafted bill which seeks to restore some rationality, certainty and civility to the legal system.  First, Title I of this bill would offer limited relief to businesses or organizations that have fewer than 25 full-time employees. Title I seeks to provide some reasonable limits on punitive damages, which typically serve as a windfall to plaintiffs. It also provides that a business's responsibility for noneconomic losses would be in proportion to the business's responsibility for causing the harm.  The other Title in the bill includes liability reforms for innocent product sellers--which are very often small businesses. These businesses are often dragged into product liability cases even though they did not produce, design or manufacture the product, and are not in any way to blame for the harm that the product is alleged to have caused. Title II would help protect product sellers from being subjected to frivolous lawsuits when they are not responsible for the alleged harm.  Now, let me explain what this bill does not do. It does not close the courthouse door to plaintiffs who sue small businesses. For example, this bill does not limit a plaintiff's ability to sue a small business for an act of negligence, or any other act, for that manner. It also does not prevent a plaintiff from recovering from product sellers when those sellers are responsible for harm.  Mr. President, this is a sensible, narrowly-tailored piece of legislation that is greatly needed to free up the enterprising spirit of our small businesses. I look forward to the Senate's consideration of this important legislation.                          ____________________
