Speaker, it is my distinct honor to recognize Carl B. Stankovic and the men of the Eighth Armored Division Association. These brave men served in Company ``B'' of the 78th Medical Battalion during World War II.  The men of Company ``B'' will be celebrating their 48th Annual Convention Reunion in King of Prussia, PA. Along with their families, they will be engaging in a week of festivities, taking them through the Fourth of July weekend. The 78th Medical Battalion acquired the reputation for excellence in their assistance and treatment of the wounded during World War II. The battalion is proud that not one life was lost while tending to the injured and evacuating them from the front lines.  This unique group of veterans should take pride in their versatility at having been able to transfer their successes from country-to-country, as they traveled through England, France, Belgium, Holland, Germany, and Czechoslovakia. They coined themselves ``The Thundering Herd,'' which undoubtedly refers to their unfaltering strength while traversing vast country sides.  The great sacrifices made by those who served in World War II have resulted in the freedom and prosperity of our country and in countries around the world. The responsibility rests within each of us to build upon the valiant efforts of these soldiers, so that the United States and the world will be a more free and prosperous place. To properly honor the heroism of our troops, we must make the most of our freedom secured by their efforts.  We will be forever indebted to our veterans and their families for the sacrifices they made for our freedom. Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my colleagues to join me in saluting the men of the 78th Medical Battalion, Company ``B'' as they observe the 48th anniversary of their battles for freedom.                          ____________________
