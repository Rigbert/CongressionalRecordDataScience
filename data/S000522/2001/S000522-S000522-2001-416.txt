Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  First of all, let me just again thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Evans) and all the Members who have helped fashion this legislation.  I especially want to thank our staff: Pat Ryan, our general counsel and staff director; Kingston Smith; Jeannie McNally; Darryl Kehrer; Paige McManus; John Bradley; Sarah Shigley; Michael Durishin; Debbie Smith; Todd Houchins; Beth Kilker; Susan Edgerton; Mary Ellen McCarthy; Sandra McClellan; and Jerry Tan. I hope I did not miss anybody, but it really does make a difference to have staff and Members working so well together.  These two pieces of legislation, in all candor, would not be possible without the good work of our very professional staff, and I want to thank them very deeply; all the veterans are better served because of the expertise, as well as the compassion of our staff. I want to thank them for their work.
