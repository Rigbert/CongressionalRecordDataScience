President, I rise today to introduce a bill to apply the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) for a State for fiscal year 2005 for fiscal years 2006 through 2014. Oklahoma is one of the hardest hit States receiving a 2.27 percent reduction in our FMAP funds for 2006, resulting in a loss of approximately $65 million, along with 21 other states that will suffer more than a 0.5 percent reduction. I would like to introduce with unanimous consent the text of a chart created by the Oklahoma Health Care Authority that lays out the 2006 FMAP reduction.  Federal law states that the FMAP is based on the three most recent calendar years with acceptable data available from the Department of Commerce. Every four to five years the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis performs a comprehensive revision of its calculation of per capita income. They performed a revision in 2003 which revises the data for the previous years as well. Therefore, when the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) calculated the FMAP for fiscal year 2006, they used the revised data from 2001, 2002 and 2003. A reduction of 2.27 percent would be disastrous for the state of Oklahoma.  My legislation purposes to keep the fiscal year 2005 percentage levels for 2006 through 2014, while we take an in depth look at revising the formula so states do not continue to get hit with such drastic reductions. Please join me in supporting this important legislation.  There being no objection, the chart was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                             OKLAHOMA HEALTH CARE AUTHORITY
