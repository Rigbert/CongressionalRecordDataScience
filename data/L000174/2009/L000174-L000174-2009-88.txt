President, I have been privileged to meet so many people in my 35 years in the Senate. One who will always stand out is Clara Kircher, who stayed with me in my office for over a quarter of a century, leaving as deputy chief of staff when she retired.  She is a remarkable woman who, on her own, raised her family, giving them the best example of a strong, talented, and loving woman. She did the same in my office, mentoring so many, and showing by example that she could keep a 50- to 60-hour week and still go back to college.  Marcelle and I consider her one of our dearest friends, and we were privileged to be with her when she was inducted into the hall of fame at Elizabeth Seton High School in Bladensburg, MD. I ask unanimous consent that the statement they made about her at that induction be printed in the Record as an example to everybody in the Senate family.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:           Elizabeth Seton High School Hall of Fame Induction       Clara Smiley Kircher was born on May 3, 1945 in Washington,      D.C., the daughter of Ann and Golden Smiley. She grew up in      Mt. Rainier, MD, and attended Saint James Elementary School.      She was accepted into the first freshman class at Elizabeth      Seton High School in 1959 and graduated from Seton in June      1963. At Seton, she was a member of the Glee Club, Masque and      Gavel, basketball team, Future Nurses Club, Student Council,      Louise de Marilacs and Honor Society. She attended Saint      Joseph's College in Emmitsburg, Maryland, where she      majored in business, from 1963-1965. She married Walter      Kircher from Riverdale, Maryland, at Saint     James Church in April 1965. Her Maid of Honor was Monica      Kircher Brady, her best friend at Seton since their      sophomore year. Clara and Walter had five children--Anne,      Walter, Eric, Anthony and Aaron. Their marriage ended in      1978, and Clara had to raise their five children as a      single parent.       Clara went to work in the office of U.S. Senator Patrick      Leahy (D-VT) in October 1981. She served as the assistant to      the Chief of Staff and the Press Secretary. After twenty-six      years in the Senate, she retired in October 2007 as Deputy      Chief of Staff to Senator Leahy. While working for Senator      Leahy, she returned to college to complete her degree. In May      1996, she graduated summa cum laude from Bowie State      University with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Public      Administration. As Deputy Chief of Staff to Senator Leahy,      Clara helped establish the Leahy Women's Economic Opportunity      Conference which is now in its 13th year. The Leahy Women's      Conference focuses on the career and business development of      Vermont women and is open to all women free of charge. Women      learn the skills of running their own business, writing a      financial plan, and sharpening their computer and personal      skills for a new job or career change. She was the intern      coordinator for the Leahy College Internship Program, which      offers young women and men the opportunity for a close-up      view of their government and the workings of a Senator's      office. Clara also served as the Chief Financial Clerk for      the Senate Judiciary Committee where she helped with the      administration of the Committee and prepared committee      budgets for Chairman Leahy.       In November 2008, she temporarily returned to the U.S.      Senate to help start up the office of the newly-elected      Senator Mark Warner (D-VA). In March 2009, she went back to      her retirement life and is now enjoying time with her      children and eleven grandchildren. Two of her granddaughters      have followed their Grandmother's footsteps in attending      Seton. Clara Bannigan graduated in May 2009, and is a      freshman at Christopher Newport University studying music;      and Alice Bannigan is a sophomore this year.       Clara and her family live in Bowie, Maryland, since 1971      and are members of St. Pius X Church. Clara is an active      member of the Seton Alumna and is proud to be a member of the      first graduating class of Elizabeth Seton High School, the      Class of 1963.                          ____________________
