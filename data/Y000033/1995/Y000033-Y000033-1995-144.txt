Mr. Chairman, I regret that the gentleman from California [Mr. Miller] raised the point of order. It may be, in fact, subject to a point of order. But this amendment is an example of what should be done.  No one gave DOT the authority to which they are proving today. By duplicating what NEPA is doing, to slow up the process of issuing a launch site or launch vehicle; now that is an example of, I must say so, of why this Congress has allowed the agencies to run this country and why the people are upset. And if we cannot, in fact, and if the gentleman from Illinois would like to speak to me, I will speak to him, too, if in fact we cannot interpret what is in reality wrong in this Government by this body, then we are not doing our jobs, and I would withdraw the amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment.
