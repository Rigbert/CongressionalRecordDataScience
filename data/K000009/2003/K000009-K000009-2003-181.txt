Speaker, I submit the following article to be included in the Record:                [From the New York Times, Jan. 30, 2003]      What the World Hears When the President Speaks; Remember Us?                          (By Enrique Krauze)       Focused on its enemies, the Bush administration has      forgotten its friends. Only one world region went entirely      unmentioned in the State of the Union speech: Latin America.      In another, far distant age--five days before terror struck      New York and Washington--President Bush pledged a new      alliance with President Vicente Fox of Mexico, on the grounds      that a strong Mexico makes for a stronger United States.      After 9/11, however, everything changed.       All of Latin America now seems aware that the United States      has returned to an essentially reactive diplomacy that seems      to come to life only when there are missiles pointing at its      shores, Marxist guerrillas in the jungles, or revolutionary      governments in the old banana republics. This is unfortunate      because Latin America (with the exception of Cuba) has for a      decade been abandoning its old grievances, drawing closer to      the United States, opting for democracy and rejecting      militarism, statism and Marxism. What is needed to make      Washington take this Copernican shift seriously and support      it in tangible ways? Maybe what is needed is for the miracle      to end. And it may indeed end, if, in the face of American      neglect, Latin Americans turn toward the biggest specter of      the past: populism, the age-old temptation to put power in      the hands of a heaven-sent strongman--yesterday in Alberto      Fujimori's Peru, today in Hugo Chavez's Venezuela, and      tomorrow perhaps in a charismatic Mexican politician.       Unfortunately, populist sentiment has been reinforced by      Washington's mistakes. It lost democratic credibility by not      condemning the coup against the populist but democratically      elected Mr. Chavez. There was the scolding of Brazil and      Argentina by Paul H. O'Neill, the former Treasury secretary,      which sent their currencies tumbling. And there is the      supreme shortsightedness of the economic blockade of Cuba.       More worrisome still is the administration's attitude      toward its neighbor. The shelving of the 2001 immigration      agreement was a mistake that has been compounded by new      subsidies for American farmers, which fly in the face of the      reforms required of Mexican agriculture under Nafta. Mexico's      rural regions are its most sensitive. It was peasants who      fought the Mexican Revolution 90 years ago, and it is from      rural Mexico that the next explosion would likely come.       I agree with Mr. Bush that if Saddam Hussein is not evil      ``then evil has no meaning.'' But to combat evil, one must      find strength in friendship. In dealing with the south,      George W. Bush should try a different doctrine: pre-emptive      cooperation.                          ____________________
