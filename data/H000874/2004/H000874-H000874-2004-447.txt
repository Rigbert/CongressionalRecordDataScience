Speaker, today, I pay special tribute to Maryland State Trooper Anthony Jones who was killed last week while on duty assisting another trooper. Trooper First Class (Tfc.) Jones every day exemplified the service and sacrifice that we honor in our law enforcement officers. As the recipient of awards for his valor and bravery, and as the anticipated recipient of the ``Top Cop'' award from the College Park Barracks this month, Trooper Jones demonstrated a commitment to public service and a sincere dedication to protecting and serving our community.  Tfc. Jones joined the state police after retiring from the U.S. Air Force in 1998. He spent his entire police career working as a road patrol trooper. He was on patrol when he stopped shortly after 2 a.m. to assist another trooper working at the scene of a single-vehicle crash in Prince George's County. Investigators said Jones crossed the four-lane highway on foot to remove a tire that was part of the accident debris and was making his way back across the road--using a flashlight to warn oncoming traffic--when he was struck and killed.  Every day, law enforcement officials like Trooper Jones risk their lives in dangerous situations on our highways and roads to protect the citizens who travel along our roadways. Last week we joined together in commemorating Trooper Jones and all of the law enforcement officers whose brave deeds led them to make the ultimate sacrifice, or left them disabled.  Trooper Jones is the 39th Maryland trooper to die in the line of duty, and we say a special prayer for his family, friends, and fellow officers of the Maryland State Police. The Joneses must know that a grateful nation mourns their loss and shares their pain.  We honor Tfc. Jones for his service to our country and to his community. I am confident that he will long be remembered with the utmost gratitude and respect. He willingly answered the call to duty, sacrificing his own safety for the safety and security of his community. We shall never forget that sacrifice and will bear witness to future generations the honor and courage Tfc. Jones exhibited as he served the State of Maryland.  Although we don't often thank them for it, officers like Trooper Jones help protect our most cherished rights as laid out by Thomas Jefferson in the Declaration of Independence: the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. We owe these fine and hard working people a great deal for their contribution to our freedom and security.  The words of John F. Kennedy strike a chord this week, ``a nation reveals itself not only by the men it produces but also by the men it honors, the men it remembers.'' As these valiant men and women died because they made it their duty to protect and serve, it is our duty to honor and remember them for their selfless contribution to our communities.                          ____________________
