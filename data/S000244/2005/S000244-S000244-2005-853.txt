Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment and thank the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Hart) for yielding to me and for introducing this amendment.  Let me say that this amendment makes important improvements in the financial provisions of the PATRIOT Act with regard to those who try to prevent terrorists from financing their operations. First of all, I think that trying to disrupt the terrorism operation is a legitimate issue to add to the list of predicate offenses covered under the RICO statute.  I am particularly pleased that there are some changes in the law to attempt to get at the informal money-changing operation called hawalas when those hawalas are used to finance terrorist organizations, and more and more money seems to be transferred through the hawalas system; and I am awfully afraid that that is not being done for legitimate purposes, but for the fact that the regular banking operations are under increasing scrutiny when money transfers take place.  So I would strongly support the gentlewoman's amendment, and I would urge the Committee to adopt it. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding to me.
