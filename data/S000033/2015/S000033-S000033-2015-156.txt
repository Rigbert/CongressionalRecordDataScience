 I am glad to see that this is, in fact, a stronger amendment than what my Republican colleagues have offered in the past. However, this amendment still does not go far enough.  In my view, Senator Mikulski's amendment is a far better alternative. It is not enough to ban retaliation about discussing salary information. This amendment would not allow women to act on any information they discovered. It would not give women their day in court and the opportunity to get money owed to them after sometimes months--sometimes years--of discrimination.  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.  I yield the floor.
