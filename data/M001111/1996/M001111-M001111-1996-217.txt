 President, there are proposals afoot--generated by foreign-flag shipping interests and foreign corporations--to repeal the Jones Act. This 1920 Act, named for Senator Wesley Jones of my State, mandates the use of U.S.-built, U.S.-crewed, U.S.-flagged vessels for voyages between two U.S. ports and on our Nation's inland waterways. Similar laws have been on the books since the 1790's, and nearly 50 nations have similar requirements for shipping in their own domestic commerce.  This law should not be repealed.  Mr. President, the domestic waterborne trades of the United States contribute more than $15 billion to the American economy, including more than $4 billion in direct wages to U.S. citizens. The economic impact of that income is multiplied by the thousands of additional jobs in cabotage-related businesses, the Jones Act employers and employees pay $1.4 billion in State and Federal taxes.  The Jones Act is critical to the State of Washington and other coastal and inland waterways' States, and indirectly, it generates American jobs, tax revenues, and economic activity, in all 50 States.  Unlike our international waterborne trades which are also the shipping lanes of our trading partners, the Jones Act trades are strictly a family trade--the commodities and the vessels move exclusively between American ports. So our trading partners have no reciprocal economic interest at stake in these trades. Indeed, our trading partners understandably have no interest in furthering the national interest objectives which the Jones Act is intended to enhance--jobs for Americans and a fourth arm of defense in times of national emergency.  It seems to me that it makes no more sense to invite foreign shipping interests into our domestic trades, than it does to invite a stranger to intervene in a family matter. In either case, there is no necessity for doing so, and the results can be disastrous.  Nevertheless, Mr. President, that is precisely what those who advocate repeal of the Jones Act would do, have outsiders intrude in the family's business.  The needless risk of permitting this was recently detailed by Stanley H. Barer in his remarks before the American Association of Port Authorities.  Mr. Barer is cochairman and CEO of Totem Resources Corp., a Jones Act operator which is headquartered in Seattle, WA, and which runs high-speed, roll-on, roll-off liner vessels between the lower 48 contiguous States and Alaska. At one time, he was also the Merchant Marine Counsel to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. So his considerable knowledge and expertise have been acquired in the real world of ocean shipping and regulation. What Mr. Barer had to say to the AAPA is, in my view, very instructive and illuminating because it offers a realistic view of the worth and importance of the Jones Act to our economy and national security.  Mr. President, I ask that Mr. Barer's remarks be inserted in the Record.                      Remarks of Stanley H. Barer       Thank you very much. It is a pleasure to be here at this      convention. I hope I can set the record straight for you      about the U.S. merchant marine and, in particular, the Jones      Act.       The Jones Act requires that America's domestic waterborne      trade must be reserved for carriers owned by Americans,      aboard vessels that fly the U.S. flag and were built in this      country, and that are crewed by American citizens. Reserving      U.S. water transport for American companies and crews is what      our cabotage system is all about. And it's a pretty easy idea      to understand.       With its extraordinary land mass and diversity, the United      States is in substantial part bound together as one nation      because of our ability to travel from place to place, thus      assuring that all parts and all people of our nation have      access to the goods and services that give us the highest      standard of living in the world. We would be quite foolish,      with a nation of our size, diversity and transportation      requirements, to turn our domestic transportation over to the      mercy of foreign carriers. Let us never forget that when you      talk about the Jones Act, you are talking about      transportation services that take place within the United      States involving only the movement of goods or people from      one part of the country to another.       This national policy of self-sufficiency in domestic      transportation is also reflected in rail, trucking and      aviation. It has been a consistent policy of our nation and      nearly every other advanced nation on the face of this earth.      And, when you think about it, it is not unusual to have such      a transportation policy. Under our immigration laws, work in      virtually every industry of our country is reserved for our      own citizens. It is the rule, not the exception, that nations      reserve the job opportunities inside their own borders to      their own citizens, so long as their own citizens have the      capacity to do the work.       Thanks to this policy, today the U.S. has a Jones Act fleet      of over 44,000 vessels, which provides direct employment for      124,000 American workers. And those workers earn more than      $3.3 billion in wages a year.       Opponents of the Jones Act point out that U.S. labor costs      on our ships, tugboats, barges and shipyards run two to three      times the so-called ``world labor rate.'' This is true. Of      course, you could make the same statement about virtually any      industry in this country. And, in fact, the merchant      seafarers of Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Holland and Japan all      earn higher net wages than their American counterparts. Jones      Act opponents say that, by bringing foreign ships and foreign      crews into our coastal and intercoastal trades we can lower      wage operating costs by up to 50 percent.       Let's look at those world wage rates. Under the      International Transport Federation standard, the average wage      for the captain of a tanker or large container ship is $12 an      hour, and the other officers are just slightly above the U.S.      minimum wage of $5.25 an hour. The entire rest of a ship's      crew under the ITF guidelines would be paid less than the      U.S. minimum wage. And the ITF requires no payments for      health, pension or other benefits. Ultimately, I believe, the      issue is not whether Jones Act maritime workers carrying our      domestic cargo make more than the ``world standard,'' the      real issue is whether those workers are being paid a fair      American wage, with respect to the other transportation      modes.       Each of our domestic transportation modes--water, rail,      trucking and air cargo--employs Americans at American wage      levels and none of them faces domestic competition from      foreigners. For example, a tanker captain earns about $80,000      a year, which is $30,000 less than a pilot flying a domestic      cargo plane. A tugboat captain might earn $50,000, about      the same as a railroad engineer. A deck hand on a Jones      Act ship makes about the same pay as a domestic flight      attendant, about 25,000 to 30,000 a year. Compare that to      a long-distance, line-haul truck driver, who might make as      much as $75,000 a year.       And it is also important to keep in mind the hours worked      by our merchant mariners. While the air cargo pilot averages      83 hours in flight time, or about 20 hours a week, a tanker      or tugboat captain works at least 12 hours a day and is on      duty 24 hours a day on the vessel. This goes on seven days a      week, sometimes for weeks and sometimes for months. Our      captains on our big roll-on, roll-off liner vessels to Alaska      are on their vessels 24 hours a day, seven days a week for      months at a time. They are away from their families, and      their work is dangerous.       Now, Jones Act opponents are arguing for getting rid of our      domestic maritime workers and bringing in foreign ships with      foreign crews. Let's think about what would happen if that      came true.       I assume that the truckers who compete directly against      water carriers would come storming to Congress and say: ``You      have upset the competitive balance between water, rail, truck      and air cargo. We can't compete against the water carriers      with our high-priced U.S. truck drivers.'' Truckers will say,      to keep the balance fair we need to bring in foreign, below-     minimum-wage truck drivers. And they would have a good      argument--what would Congress say? And if you let the water      carriers and truckers use foreign labor, the railroads and      then the air cargo carriers are going to demand the same      ability.       At this point, we have thrown hundreds of thousands of      Americans out of work. What would happen next? I have an      idea.       Companies outside domestic transportation, companies that      compete on a daily basis in the global economy, will demand      the right to fire Americans and bring in low-cost, below-     U.S.-minimum-wage foreign workers. After all, if we are going      to do this for domestic transportation, which is currently      immune from foreign competition,      why shouldn't we do this for those American companies who face foreign      competition for their products and services every day in the      marketplace?       I want to point out a few more things about what Jones Act      opponents are proposing.       Their draft legislation assumes that the foreign workers      brought into our maritime coastal trades will pay no federal      or state income taxes, nor will the owners of those vessels      under foreign flag pay any U.S. taxes. And that would be the      case.       As I read the proposal, these companies under foreign flag      and their crew members are not only exempt from U.S. taxes      and U.S. minimum wage laws, but also the National Labor      Relations Act, federal hours-of-service regulations, child      labor laws, Coast Guard safety regulations, the U.S. civil      rights laws, our national laws relating to health insurance,      pensions and other benefits, and all other state and federal      legal requirements.       Jones Act opponents say these foreign vessels and crew      members should meet ``international standards.'' Does that      mean that the navigation and safety crew members must be able      to speak English, so they can communicate with environmental      and rescue workers, or Coast Guard authorities? I guess not.       And nothing in the proposal talks about how our nation      would deal with all those Americans left unemployed by the      repeal of the Jones Act, or how we would compensate American      vessel owners whose investment in modern, U.S.-built ships      would be destroyed.       Let me tell you a little about my own situation. I am      management. I am an owner. I risked capital to be in this      business. I have negotiated with labor unions. My company has      more than 2,000 employees whose fathers and grandfathers and      uncles have all worked for our tug and barge company over the      106 years it has been in business.       We don't want to fire these people. Who wants us to do      this? Is this what America is about?       If we can do this in the transportation sector, I guess we      can do it anywhere--manufacturing, communications, health      care, education, and I guess we could even fire all of our      government workers and bring in low-cost people to work in      government and man our armed forces. I submit this is not a      sound idea.       I was very curious as to who was financing these people who      are calling for repeal of the Jones Act, and who was      supporting them. I was pleased that not one of our customers      in Alaska or the West Coast was among their supporters. But I      did find that over 90 percent of those supporting him were      trade associations representing wheat or grain producers. I      would just like to note that, while Jones Act carriers      receive not a dollar in federal subsidies or handouts, $5.5      billion in federal subsidies goes to wheat and feed-grain      farmers each year. I am not here to argue against the farm      program but I think it should be recognized that the people      who want to get rid of U.S. citizens in domestic transport      are the same people who are taking $5.5 billion dollars a      year for their own industry from the taxpayers, but they are      not advocating that foreign grain companies and foreign grain      workers come in and take over their jobs and companies in the      United States. All these farm executives and their corporate      staffs and trade organizations and employees make good wages.      I think that's fine--I am not against that. I am not even      against the farm program. But I do have a problem with that      industry trying to destroy my industry without first getting      their own financial house in order.  So, please, in considering these public policy issues, think about those you represent--the taxpaying American citizens. If you do that, I think you will have no trouble telling the Jones Act Reform Committee that they should go out of business rather that telling my industry that we should go out of business.                          ____________________
