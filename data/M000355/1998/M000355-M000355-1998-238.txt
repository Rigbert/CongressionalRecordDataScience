 President, the general counsel might achieve the votes of two of one party and two of another. In other words, four votes to achieve a 4-year term, after which the general counsel, if he or she wanted to continue--and many of them might not--would have to be able to reach across party lines, which is, of course, the spirit of the Federal Election Commission, in order to achieve a 4-year term.  There is really nothing else to say about this amendment. It continues the reform process.  Mr. President, how much of my time do I have remaining?
