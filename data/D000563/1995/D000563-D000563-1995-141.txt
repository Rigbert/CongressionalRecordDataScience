Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute, the balance of my time.  Mr. Chairman, the Zimmer-Schumer amendment is nothing short of unilateral disarmament in the world trade war. They have replaced the peace-at-any-price crowd with the Zimmer-Schumer unemployment-at-any-price, because the Zimmer-Schumer amendment is a job killer. One million Americans work in businesses which have a direct interest in ag exports, and these are generally good-paying jobs. What the gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. Zimmer] and the gentleman from New York [Mr. Schumer] want to do is to cut out those jobs, reduce them, make it more difficult for us to sell overseas, while every major exporting nation in the world is pumping up its export efforts.  Zimmer and Schumer and all of their friends would have the United States throw in the towel. Zimmer and Schumer just do not get it. They should sit down in Tokyo and Seoul and learn the realities of world trade competition.  American products can win the trade war overseas if we are willing to fight.  The Market Promotion Program is a proven success. For $110 million we leverage $50 billion in ag exports, creating jobs and farm income across America, and that is a great investment.
