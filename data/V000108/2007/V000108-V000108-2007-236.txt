Cindy Carlson upon her retirement from her position as Secretary for Sub-District 5, District 7 of the United Steelworkers. I have known Cindy for many years, and she is one of the most involved citizens I have ever known, especially when it comes to her service to the United Steelworkers. Cindy has been a member of the staff at District 7 for an astonishing 31 years, and her contributions to the organization are immeasurable. For her efforts and many contributions to Sub-District 5,District 7 and the United Steelworkers, there will be a retirement celebration in Cindy's honor on Friday, April 20, 2007, at Andorra Banquets in Schererville, Indiana.  Cindy Carlson was born and raised in Saint John, Indiana. She began her career with the United Steelworkers of America in 1976 as Staff Secretary in what was then Sub-District 2 of District 31. From there, Cindy moved up to become the Secretary for the SubDistrict 2 Director, a position she held from 1981-1988. Then in 1988, recognizing Cindy's skills and abilities, Director Jack Parton assigned Cindy to the position of Secretary for the Assistant Director and the Civil Rights/Safety and Health Coordinator. Though these new responsibilities would have been enough for most people, Cindy also took on the position of Secretary for the District 31 Steelworkers Organization of Active Retirees (SOAR). From there, Cindy went on to become Executive Secretary to the Director of District 31 in 1995. After redistricting took place in 1996, and District 31 changed to District 7, Cindy was reassigned to the Organizing Department. During this time, her experience and expertise was fully utilized, as she served in many secretarial capacities with District 7. Finally, in 2004, Cindy was awarded the position of SubDistrict 5 Secretary, which she held until her retirement on March 1, 2007. During this time, she also served as Secretary for the District 7 Women of Steel and for the Contracting-Out Coordinator, Mike Mezo.  In addition to the impressive career Cindy has had with District 7, she has also served as a dedicated member of the International United Steelworkers Clerical Union, Local 3657, where she once again utilized her many talents as a member of several committees. Cindy's knowledge of the Union and her field, along with her complete commitment to improving conditions for the steelworkers in her district, has made her one of the most well-respected individuals the First Congressional District has produced. While she will remain in contact with those with whom she has worked, her daily presence will surely be missed by all of her colleagues.  Now retired, Cindy is committed to spending her time with those closest to her, her family. A devoted wife, mother, and grandmother, Cindy's commitment to the United Steelworkers and its members is surpassed only by her dedication to her family. Cindy and her husband, Lyle, remain in Northwest Indiana. They have been blessed with one daughter, Heather, and her husband Chad, as well as Cindy's loving grandson, Alex, whom she truly adores. While Cindy will be enjoying her retirement with them, and with her mother, Ellen Hogan, there is no doubt that Cindy will remain committed to several organizations, including the Tri-Town Labor/Democratic Organization, which she founded in 2005, the Saint John Junior Women's Club, the VFW Post 717 Ladies' Auxiliary, and of course, SOAR.  Madam Speaker, Cindy Carlson has given her time and efforts selflessly to the members of the United Steelworkers for the past 31 years. At this time, I ask that you and all of my distinguished colleagues join me in wishing her the best upon her retirement and commending her for her lifetime of service and dedication.                          ____________________
