When I was elected to this body in 1994, his office was next door to me. I confess right now before all these people, when the bells rang for a vote, I would go and look down the hall and wait until Daniel Patrick Moynihanwas coming up so I could walk and talk with him on the way over. He was just a remarkable person. There is a lot of dedication to him in what we are doing today.
