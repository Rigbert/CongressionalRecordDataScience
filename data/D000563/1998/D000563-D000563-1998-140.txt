President, I submit an article to be printed in the Record. I thought it would be beneficial for my colleagues to learn about the success that the AmeriCorps program has had among my constituents in Illinois. These are only a few stories about the positive impact that this program has had on people who live in often under served communities in the Chicago area.  The article follows:               [From the Chicago Sun-Times, July 3, 1998]                       Harnessing American Ideals                          [By Michael Gillis]       In Uptown, they teach Asian immigrants English and help      them adjust to life in the United States.       In Ford Heights, they help low-income parents become better      teachers of their own children.       In neighborhoods throughout the Chicago area, they teach      adults how to read, tutor students after school, counsel      battered women, teach first aid and help communities right      themselves.       Four years after President Clinton's Americorps project was      launched amid a flurry of publicity, its workers are toiling      away in relative obscurity. While some still criticize the      program for its cost, supporters say it is changing the city      in small, but important, ways.       ``We never say we're going to change a community in a      year,'' said Craig Huffman, executive director of City Year      Chicago, which employed about 50 Americorps workers last year      and this week received funding to hire about 55 workers      starting in the fall.       ``But far too many people use the excuse that problems are      insurmountable. . . . You have to think about solving a      problem, even when everyone else is saying it can't be      solved.''       Americorps workers say they're more than worth the money      they're paid.       ``I realized the impact that one person can have in a lot      of lives,'' said Lisa Novak, 23, of Flossmoor, who taught CPR      and first aid to thousands of Chicago public school students      in the last year as one of the 13 Americorps workers for the      American Red Cross of Greater Chicago.       That's the kind of idealism Clinton sought to harness when      he proposed the Americorps program during his 1992      presidential campaign. Lawmakers passed Clinton's pet project      in 1993, and Clinton signed the bill using the pens Franklin      D. Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy used to create the Civilian      Conservation Corps and the Peace Corps.       Under the program, which is run by a public-private      partnership called the Corporation for Public Service,      students earn $4,725 to apply toward college tuition or      student loans by completing a year of community     service work. They also earn living allowances of about      $7,400 a year and health care and child day care benefits.       About 90,000 people have served in the program since it      started in 1993. More than $1.7 billion has been spent on or      committed to the program so far, including $400 million set      aside for education awards.       This year, Illinois has about 500 Americorps workers. About      450 are expected next year.       According to the Corporation for National Service,      Americorps workers last year tutored more than 500,000 youth,      mentored 95,000 more, created 3,100 safety patrols, built or      rehabilitated 5,600 homes, placed 32,000 homeless people in      permanent housing and recruited more than 300,000 volunteers.       Many Republicans, including House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-     Ga.), oppose the national service program. Gingrich told      Newsweek magazine in 1995 that he was ``totally,      unequivocally opposed to national service. . . . It is      coerced volunteerism. It's a gimmick.''       Critics also question whether the program is worth the      expense, but officials at the corporation say they try to      fund programs that get the most bang for the buck. The      program uses strict standards to ensure funded programs      produce results that can be measured--say, the number of      children tutored or the number of homes rehabilitated.       And they argue that the program represents a way for      Washington to help communities help themselves--an argument      tailor-made for Republicans who advocate decentralizing      government.       ``Right now there is a consensus in Washington that      Washington cannot solve every problem and that we have to      look at ways to strengthen local communities so they can take      on the needs that are specific to their communities,'' said      Tara Murphy, the director of public affairs for the      corporation. ``That's exactly what this program does.'' Two-     thirds of the funds go straight to state commissions, made up      of members appointed by the governors, she said. Those      commissions decide which agencies get the money, and the      agencies recruit and deploy the workers, she said.       Agencies that were awarded grants this week to hire      Americorps workers don't question whether the program is      worth the expense.       ``It's definitely worth it,'' said Pat Clay, the director      of the program at the Aunt Martha's Youth Services Center of      Park Forest, where 10 Americorps workers teach low-income      parents how to instruct their preschool children.       ``To see the smile on a child's face, to hear a parent say,      `My child tested very well in a preschool screening test'--     that makes it worthwhile. You are investing in a child's      future for life.       Aunt Martha's hires its Americorps workers from the      communities the program serves--in this case, Ford Heights      and Chicago Heights.       The Uptown-based Asian Human Services agency, which will      hire about 14 workers to aid Asian refugees and immigrants      this year, does the same.       Ralph Hardy, the director of programs at Asian Human      Services, said he believes the program is inspiring      Americorps workers to a career in public service.       ``The outcome of the program will be best seen down the      road, say 10 or 15 years from now, after a whole generation      has gone through it,'' he said, ``We've seen it here--we have      workers who will go into some sort of community-based      career.''       That's what Trina Poole, 25, plans to do. Poole, one of six      Americorps workers at Family Rescue, a community service      agency in South Shore for victims of domestic violence,      answers the agency's crisis line and helps arrange services      for callers.       A victim of domestic violence herself, Poole said she hopes      to be hired for a permanent position to continue providing to      women and children the services she never received.       ``It's a healing process for me to help as many women as      possible,'' she said. ``I'm not doing this for the money. I'm      doing it to help the community.''       Becky Nieves, 21, of Hanover Park, an Americorps worker for      City Year who helped run an after-school program on gardening      and environment, said she learned how much she meant to her      students at the end of the year.       ``When it's over and you say your goodbyes, and the kids      tell you what they learned, that's when you know you've made      a difference,'' she said.                          ____________________
