1, I can't tell my dear friend from Nevada how much what he has said has meant. He has told me similar things in private as well as in public. He and I have been close friends for well over 20 years, and he knows of my huge respect and affection for him.  I chuckled as he put his finger on the issue, as he always does--the man from Searchlight shines the light on what happens--and talked about this kabuki show we saw this morning on the floor, criticizing me especially for moving judges. It kind of reminds me of what happened in February where we had markups to confirm judges and the Republicans would not show up. We wondered, why wouldn't they show up for their own judges? Why wouldn't they show up when they were given a chance to get out these judges? And then I find out. They were all giving speeches saying it is terrible we are not getting out judges. Well, if they had shown up, of course, the speeches could not be given. It is kind of damned if you do and damned if you don't.  I said when I became chairman the first time and again the second time I would not do to them, or to President Bush, what they did to President Clinton and to us, and I have not. I do not intend to. I told the President that. But I would like to see a little bit of cooperation from the White House in working with home State Senators and in working with us not to getidealogues that fit well in a fundraising letter, but instead to nominate people who are good for the Federal court.  So I can't tell the distinguished leader enough how much I appreciate his constant support throughout this whole thing.
