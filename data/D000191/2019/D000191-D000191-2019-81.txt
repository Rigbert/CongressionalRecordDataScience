Chair, may I inquire as to how much time I have remaining.  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Oregon has 1 minute remaining.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chair, I yield myself 10 seconds.  Again, this has potential for massive explosions. This has not been done before.  This is not natural gas. It is liquefied natural gas, 600 times as dense, and, if punctured, this is the blast zone. I hope the President is watching.  Mr. Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Price), the subcommittee chairman.
