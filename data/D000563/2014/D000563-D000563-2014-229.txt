He has announced his retirement at the end of this year. That is a loss for our great institution and for our country.  Tom Harkin, more than any other Senator today, as much as any other Senator, has been a clarion voice for the disabled across generations and across country borders for decades. He has changed America and he has changed the world. There are not many people who serve in this Chamber who can say that. But when he joined with Bob Dole, a Republican World War II disabled veteran from Kansas--when this Democratic Senator from Iowa, a Navy veteran himself, joined with Bob Dole and passed the Americans with Disabilities Act, it held America to a higher standard. It guaranteed that our values we express so often would be values we live by.  Now he is calling on us to join a family of nations that have admired our leadership in disability rights and wonder why we have not approved this basic treaty or convention on disabilities. I was honored today to vote for that in the Foreign Relations Committee again. We had bipartisan support. We are going to continue to strive for it.  I thank the Senator for his unmatched contribution when it comes to speaking out for the disabled across America and around the world.                              The Tax Code  Dickens wrote ``A Tale of Two Cities.'' I come to the Senate floor this evening to tell a tale of two Illinois corporations. One of them is a corporation which I visited recently called Wheatland Tube in Chicago. It is a division of JMC Steel. It employs about 2,000 people nationwide, 600 in Chicago, which I represent. JMC Steel is a good company. It is more than good; it is a great company. The average starting wage at Wheatland is $15 an hour. The company offers generous health care benefits with low deductibles. It offers various retirement benefits. Newer employees get a 401(k) with a company match up to 6 percent.  I tell this story because I want to salute a company that takes its mission seriously and treats its employees fairly. I believe a company such as JMC Steel and Wheatland should be encouraged and rewarded when it comes to our Tax Code and our laws.  We are hearing a lot from our Supreme Court across the street. They have come up with a new theory about businesses and corporations in America. Time and again they have told us that they now view corporations to be virtual flesh-and-blood citizens entitled to constitutional rights. They decided corporations have freedom of speech under the Bill of Rights and that corporations could spend unlimited amounts of money in an effort to elect or defeat candidates. They even went so far to say closely held corporations had religious freedoms that needed protection to the point where the owner of a closely held for-profit corporation could determine the contraception and birth control programs available to the employees of that company under their health insurance plans.  So we are told over and over by this Supreme Court that we should view corporations in a human context. Well, I am going to stick with that chain of thought for a moment and talk about another company that is much different from Wheatland Tube, which I have just described. It is a company known as AbbVie. That is the new name; it used to be known as Abbott Labs. It is roughly the eighth largest pharmaceutical company in America. It is headquartered in Illinois, in the city of North Chicago. AbbVie recently made the news because its board of directors sat down and made a decision about the future of this company.  First, let me tell you a little bit about AbbVie as a pharmaceutical company. AbbVie is a company which, like virtually every other pharmaceutical company, relies a great deal on our Federal Government. The National Institutes of Health--the leading biomedical research agency in the world--does basic research that our pharmaceutical companies use to develop new drugs and products. We pray that they will. When they find these drugs and products, pharmaceutical companies such as AbbVie go to the patent office run by our Federal Government to protect their property rights in their discoveries and their drugs. When they turn around to sell these drugs in America, after approval by a Federal agency, the Food and Drug Administration, they by and large sell them to programs such as Medicare and Medicaid--government-supported insurance programs.  The reason I tell this background is that AbbVie recently made a decision that they were going to renounce their American corporate citizenship and, in fact, at least on paper, move their corporate headquarters to an island off Ireland. Why would a great American corporation, the eighth largest pharmaceutical company, want to pick up and move to an island off Ireland? To avoid paying U.S. taxes. To avoid paying U.S. taxes, AbbVie is engaging in something known as inversion--in other words, relocating their corporate headquarter offices and declaring themselves to no longer be an American corporation. Does it not strike you as strange that a company that makes billions of dollars in profit based on America and the strength of our own system of government now is deserting America?  This inversion is not unique to AbbVie. We estimate that 50 or 60 corporations are doing the same. I think it is time for us as Members of Congress to put an end to this. These companies that are deserting America and heading overseas to avoid paying U.S. taxes have to be stopped.  Allan Sloan, whom I have heard a lot on radio and other places, is a writer for Fortune magazine. On July 7 he published an article in Fortune magazine entitled ``Positively un-American tax dodges.''  I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record after my remarks.  Let me quote one paragraph from Allan Sloan about these ``Positively un-American tax dodges,'' such as the inversion planned by AbbVie of North Chicago. Here is what Sloan writes:       Inverters don't hesitate to take advantage of the great      things that make America     America: our deep financial markets, our democracy and rule      of law, our military might, our intellectual and physical      infrastructure, our national research programs, all the      terrific places our country offers for employees and their      families to live. But inverters do hesitate--totally--when      it's time to ante up their fair share of financial support      for our system.  Exhibit A: AbbVie, a company that has been profitable and made billions of dollars in America, now wants to lessen its American tax bill by moving overseas--on paper.  I think this has to come to an end. I think that when we sit down and make decisions about a tax code and tax policy, we need to be rewarding companies such as Wheatland Tube. Wheatland Tube, with 600 employees in Chicago, is an American corporation and proud of it. They are not planning on moving overseas. They are not trying to cut corners when it comes to their employees. They are treating them fairly. They are getting a good work product for it.  What I propose is called a patriot employer's tax. If you have a corporation that is, in my view, patriotic, with its headquarters in America, that has not moved employees overseas, that pays its employees at least $15 an hour--why did I pick $15? Because at $15 an hour, most American workers would not qualify for government benefits.  Perhaps the WIC program is one exception, but the only one I can think of. But these are employees who are paid enough in the workplace that they don't qualify for food stamps to supplement their income. So we chose $15 an hour. We said if the company goes on to provide good health insurance, a good retirement plan, where the employer contributes at least 5 percent of an employee's income toward retirement, and the company will give a preference to hiring veterans, I think that company is entitled to a patriot employer tax credit. Wheatland Tube isn't the only company in Illinois that would qualify nor the only company in this country.  So should we be bending our Tax Code today so AbbVie and the other corporate deserters get a break by moving overseas or should we be changing our Tax Code to encourage good companies, such as Wheatland Tube, to stay in America, to pay a fair wage, to make a good product and make us proud. It seems a pretty simple choice as far as I am concerned. We are going to start debating that on the floor of the Senate this week--at least we are going to try.  There is going to be a bill coming before us that has been offered by Senator John Walsh of Montana and Senator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan called the Bring Jobs Home Act. It is a variation on the theme that I just spoke of, but the bottom line is the same--to create Tax Code incentives for companies to bring jobs back into the United States. I can't think of a higher priority than to create and keep good-paying jobs in America.  We are going to vote on moving forward on this bill, creating an incentive to bring jobs home.  Here is what it will do. If a company moves a production line, trade or business outside of the United States back into the United States, it is eligible for a tax credit under the Walsh-Stabenow bill--a credit for the cost of moving the jobs back home.  To pay for it, companies that ship jobs overseas--jobs going in the wrong direction--will no longer be allowed to deduct the costs associated with outsourcing U.S. jobs from their tax bill.  Why would we want to incentivize a company to ship American jobs overseas? Why would we want to create a deduction to make it easier and cheaper to do that? It defies common sense.  The Walsh-Stabenow bill reverses it and says we will no longer incentivize shipping jobs overseas; we are going to incentivize shipping jobs home from overseas. It is pretty simple.  I would like to take that basic question to any town meeting in any town in my State and ask the folks sitting there whether they think that makes sense. I am very confident they will agree that it does. This is a commonsense approach to reward companies that are doing the right thing and eliminate tax breaks for companies that are doing the wrong thing.  The patriot employer tax credit I hope I can offer as an amendment. I want to give a break to those companies that pay a good wage, keep the jobs in the United States, and don't ship their headquarters overseas. I think they deserve an incentive to stay.  I guess I am old-fashioned, but a lot of Americans are old-fashioned the same way.  I like walking into the store and seeing products that say ``Made in the U.S.A.'' Sure, I buy things made overseas. It is hard to avoid them. And I don't consciously avoid them. But given a choice, I would love to see the ``Made in the U.S.A.'' label on these products so I have a choice to make this country stronger. That is what the Walsh-Stabenow bill does. That is what the Patriot Employer Tax Credit Act does. And that is what we need to do when it comes to these inversions.  There was an article that was printed in Fortune magazine after Allan Sloan's article on July 15 the following week. It quoted a man whom I have come to know and once worked with in Chicago. His name is Jamie Dimon. Jamie Dimon is the CEO of JPMorgan Chase.  It turns out JPMorgan Chase is the investment adviser to AbbVie, the company I mentioned earlier. They have been advising them about moving overseas to avoid tax liability.  Mr. Dimon, in this Fortune magazine piece said: `` . . . it was inappropriate for anyone to moralize against deals in which U.S. companies seek lower tax rates through mergers.''  And then he went on to say ``an inversion.'' He characterized moving your corporate headquarters overseas to avoid taxes as basically saying it is an acknowledgment how bad our Tax Code is today. It is a way of protesting what the Tax Code is doing to corporations.  Our Tax Code today has resulted in the highest corporate profits in history. Our Tax Code today has resulted in paychecks for Mr. Dimon and other CEOs unparalleled in the history of the world. For Mr. Dimon and the corporate CEOs to argue about this unfair Tax Code as a reason or rationale for picking up and deserting America doesn't square with the reality of corporate compensation or corporate profits.  Some people critical of what I have spoken to today will say: Well, now, don't go picking winners and losers in the Tax Code.  I have news for you. The Tax Code is all about picking winners and losers. Sadly, the losers too many times are working families in this country and the winners are the people in higher-income categories and the largest corporations.  Look at what the Tax Code incentivizes. It incentivizes drilling for oil, building wind turbines. It incentivizes holding stock for a longer period rather than a shorter period. It incentivizes saving for your retirement. It incentivizes buying health insurance. The Tax Code is full of incentives.  So let's rewrite that Tax Code. Let's create an incentive to keep jobs in America. Let's create an incentive to make sure that companies which pay a fair wage and make sure their operations are good for working people get a tax break, and let's disincentivize the effort to move American jobs overseas and to move American corporate offices overseas.  That to me is a Tax Code with the right incentives for building not only a strong American economy with good-paying jobs here at home but building our middle class and our working Americans into a strong entity, a strong force for progress and economic growth.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the articles I referred to earlier.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 [From @FortuneMagazine, July 7, 2014]                   Positively un-American Tax Dodges                            (By Allan Sloan)       Bigtime companies are moving their ``headquarters''      overseas to dodge billions in taxes . . . that means the rest      of us pay their share.       Ah, July! What a great month for those of us who celebrate      American exceptionalism. There's the lead-up to the Fourth,      countrywide Independence Day celebrations including my town's      local Revolutionary War reenactment and fireworks, the      enjoyable days of high summer, and, for the fortunate, the      prospect of some time at the beach.       Sorry, but this year, July isn't going to work for me.      That's because of a new kind of     American corporate exceptionalism: companies that have      decided to desert our country to avoid paying taxes but      expect to keep receiving the full array of benefits that      being American confers, and that everyone else is paying for.       Yes, leaving the country--a process that tax techies call      inversion--is perfectly legal. A company does this by      reincorporating in a place like Ireland, where the corporate      tax rate is 12.5%, compared with 35% in the U.S. Inversion      also makes it easier to divert what would normally be U.S.      earnings to foreign, lower-tax locales. But being legal isn't      the same as being right. If a few companies invert, it's      irritating but no big deal for our society. But mass      inversion is a whole other thing, and that's where we're      heading.       We've also got a second, related problem, which I call the      ``never-heres.'' They include formerly private companies like      Accenture, a consulting firm that was spun off from Arthur      Andersen, and disc-drive maker Seagate, which began as a U.S.      company, went private in a 2000 buyout and was moved to the      Cayman Islands, went public in 2002, then moved to Ireland      from the Caymans in 2010. Firms like these can duck lots of      U.S. taxes without being accused of having deserted our      country because technically they were never here. So far, by      Fortune's count, some 60 U.S. companies have chosen the      never-here or the inversion route, and others are lining up      to leave.       All of this threatens to undermine our tax base, with      projected losses in the billions. It also threatens to      undermine the American public's already shrinking respect for      big corporations.       Inverters, of course, have a different view of things. It      goes something like this: The U.S. tax rate is too high, and      uncompetitive. Unlike many other countries, the U.S. taxes      all profits worldwide, not just those earned here. A domicile      abroad can offer a more competitive corporate tax rate.      Fiduciary duty to shareholders requires that companies      maximize returns.       My answer: Fight to fix the tax code, but don't desert the      country. And I define ``fiduciary duty'' as the obligation to      produce the best long-term results for shareholders, not      ``get the stock price up today.'' Undermining the finances of      the federal government by inverting helps undermine our      economy. And that's a bad thing, in the long run, for      companies that do business in America.       Finally, there's reputational risk. I wouldn't be surprised      to see someone in Washington call public hearings and ask      CEOs of inverters and would-be inverters why they think it's      okay for them to remain U.S. citizens while their companies      renounce citizenship. Imagine the reaction! And the punitive      legislation it could spark.   WATCH: Inversion: How some major U.S. companies are dodging taxes       Fortune contacted every company on our list of tax avoiders      and asked why they incorporated overseas. Four of them--     Carnival, Garmin, Invesco, and XL--said they were never U.S.      companies. In other words, they are never-heres. Five more--     Actavis, Allegion, Eaton, Ingersoll Rand, and Perrigo--said      they inverted mainly for strategic purposes. The tenth,      Nabors, refused to respond to our multiple requests.       Companies that have gone the inversion or never-here route      but that act American include household names like Garmin,      Michael Kors, Carnival, and Nielsen. Pfizer the giant      pharmaceutical company, tried to invert this spring, but the      deal fell through. Medtronic, the big medical-device company,      is trying to invert, of which more later. Walgreen is talking      about inverting too--it's easier to boost earnings by playing      tax games than by fixing the way you run your stores.       Then there's the ``Can you believe this?'' factor.      Carnival, a Panama-based company with headquarters in Miami,      was happy to have the U.S. Coast Guard, for which it doesn't      pay its fair share, help rescue its burning Carnival Triumph.      (It later reimbursed Uncle Sam.) Alexander Cutler, chief      executive of Eaton, a Cleveland company that he inverted to      Ireland, told the City Club of Cleveland, without a trace of      irony, that to fix our nation's budget problems, we need to      close ``those loopholes in the tax system.'' Inversions, I      guess, aren't loopholes.       Before we proceed, a brief confessional rant: The spectacle      of American corporations deserting our country to dodge taxes      while expecting to get the same benefits that good corporate      citizens get makes me deeply angry. It's the same way that I      felt when idiots and incompetents in Washington brought us to      the brink of defaulting on our national debt in the summer of      2011, the last time that I wrote anything angry at remotely      this length. (See ``American Idiots.'') Except that this is      worse.       Inverters don't hesitate to take advantage of the great      things that make America America: our deep financial markets,      our democracy and rule of law, our military might, our      intellectual and physical infrastructure, our national      research programs, all the terrific places our country offers      for employees and their families to live. But inverters do      hesitate--totally--when it's time to ante up their fair share      of financial support of our system.       Inverting a company, which is done in the name of      ``shareholder value''--a euphemism for a higher stock price--     is way more offensive to me than even the most disgusting      (albeit not illegal) tax games that companies like Apple and      GE play to siphon earnings out of the U.S. At least those      companies remain American. It may be for technical reasons      that I won't bore you with--but I don't care. What matters is      the result. Apple and GE remain American. Inverters are      deserters.       Even though I understand inversion intellectually, I have      trouble dealing with it emotionally. Maybe it's because of my      background: I'm the grandson of immigrants, and I'm      profoundly grateful that this country took my family in.      Watching companies walk out just to cut their taxes turns my      stomach.       Okay, rant over.       The current poster child for inversion outrage is Medtronic      Inc., the multinational Minnesota medical-device company that      once exuded a cleaner-than-clean image but now proposes to      move its nominal headquarters to Ireland by paying a fat      premium price to purchase Covidien, itself a faux-Irish firm      that is run from Massachusetts except for income-taxpaying      purposes. For that, it's based in Dublin. That's where the      new Medtronic PLC would be based, while its real headquarters      would remain on Medtronic Parkway in Minneapolis. Of course,      the company is unlikely to return any of the $484 million      worth of contracts the federal government says it has awarded      Medtronic over the past five years.       If the Medtronic deal goes through, which seems likely, it      will open the floodgates. Congress could close them, as we'll      see--but that would require our representatives and senators      to get their act together. Good luck with that.       Now let's have a look at some of the more interesting      aspects of the proposed Medtronic-Covidien marriage. I'm not      trying to pick on Medtronic--but its decision to become the      biggest company to invert makes it fair journalistic game.       Medtronic is one of those U.S. companies with a ton of cash      offshore: something like $14 billion. That's money on which      U.S. income tax hasn't been paid. Medtronic told me it would      have to pay $3.5 billion to $4.2 billion to the IRS if it      brought that money into the U.S.: That's the difference      between the 35% U.S. tax rate and the 5% to 10% it has paid      to other countries. Among other things, inverting would let      Medtronic PLC use offshore cash to pay dividends without      subjecting the money to U.S. corporate tax.       I especially love a little-noticed multimillion-dollar      goody that Medtronic is giving its board members and top      executives. Years ago, in order to discourage inversions,      Congress imposed a 15% excise tax on the value of options and      restricted stock owned by top officers and board members of      inverting companies. Guess what? Medtronic says it's going to      give the affected people enough money to pay the tax.       We're talking major money--major money that I'm glad to say      isn't tax-deductible to Medtronic. The company wouldn't tell      me how much this would cost its stockholders. So I did my own      back-of-the-envelope math, starting with chief executive Omar      Ishrak. Using numbers from Medtronic's 2014 proxy statement      and adjusting for its stock price when I was writing this, I      figure that his options and restricted shares are worth at      least $40 million, and the ``equity incentive plan awards''      that he might get are worth another $23 million. Allow for      the fact that Medtronic will ``gross up'' Ishrak et al. by      giving them enough money to cover both the excise tax and the      tax due on their excise tax subsidy, and you end up with $7.1      million to $11.2 million just for Ishrak. And something more      than $60 million for Medtronic as a whole.       Why does Medtronic feel the need to shell out this money?      The company's answer: ``Medtronic has agreed to indemnify      directors and executive officers for such excise tax because      they should not be discouraged from taking actions that they      believe are in the best interests of Medtronic and its      shareholders.''       But you know what, folks? These people are fiduciaries, who      are legally required to put shareholders' interests ahead of      their own. If they believe that inverting is the right thing      to do (which, it should be obvious by now, I don't) they      ought to pay any expenses they incur out of their own      pockets, not the shareholders'. It's not as if these people      lack the means to pay--the directors get $220,000 a year (and      up) in cash and stock for a part-time job, and Ishrak gets a      typical hefty CEO package.       One more thing: Normally, a company's shareholders don't      have to pay capital gains tax if their firm makes an      acquisition. But because this is an inversion, Medtronic      shareholders will be treated as if they've sold their shares      and will owe taxes on their gains. However, the deal won't      give them any cash with which to pay the tab.       The company asked me to mention that its executives and      directors, like other holders, will be subject to gains tax      on shares that they own outright, and Medtronic won't      compensate them for it. Okay. Consider it mentioned.       Second, the company contends that this deal will be so good      for shareholders that it will more than offset their tax cost      triggered by the board's decision to invert. Well, we'll see.       A major barrier to inversion used to be that companies      moving offshore were kicked out of the Standard & Poor's 500      index. Given that more than 10% (by my estimate) of the S&P      500 stocks are owned by indexers, getting tossed out of the      index--or being added to it--makes a big, short-term      difference in share price. In 2008 and 2009, S&P, which has a      few never-heres, tossed nine companies off     the 500 for inverting. But four years ago, S&P changed      course, for business reasons. Companies were angry at being      excluded, and index investors wanted to own some of the      excluded companies. Moreover, S&P feared that a competitor      would set up a more inclusive, rival index.       So in June 2010, S&P changed its definition of American.      Now all it takes to be in the S&P 500 is to trade on a U.S.      market, be considered a U.S. filer by the Securities and      Exchange Commission, and have a plurality of business and/or      assets in the U.S.       The result: S&P now has 28 non-American companies in the      500.       How much money are we talking about inverters sucking out      of the U.S. Treasury? There's no number available for the tax      revenue losses caused by inverters and never-heres so far.      But it's clearly in the billions. Congress's Joint Committee      on Taxation projects that failing to limit inversions will      cost the Treasury an additional $19.5 billion over 10 years--     a number that seems way low, given the looming stampede. But      even $19.5 billion--$2 billion a year--is a lot, if you look      at it the right way. It's enough to cover what Uncle Sam      spends on programs to help homeless veterans and to conduct      research to create better prosthetic arms and legs for our      wounded warriors.       Rep. Sandy Levin (D-Mich.) and his brother, Sen. Carl Levin      (D-Mich.), have introduced legislation that would stop      Medtronic in its tracks by making inversions harder. Under      current law, adopted in 2004 as an inversion stopper, a U.S.      company can invert only if it is doing significant business      in its new domicile and shareholders of the foreign company      it buys to do the inversion own at least 20% of the combined      firm.       The Levins propose to require that foreign-firm      shareholders own at least 50% of the combined company for it      to be able to invert and also that the company's management      change. This would really slow down inversions--but the      chances of Congress passing the Levin legislation are      somewhere between slim and none.       Conventional wisdom holds that companies are inverting now      because they've despaired of getting clean-cut reform that      would widen the tax base and lower rates. But John Buckley,      former chief Democratic tax counsel for the House Ways and      Means Committee, has a different view. Buckley thinks that      we're seeing an inversion wave not because there's no      prospect of tax reform but because there is a prospect of      reform. If reform comes, he says, there will be winners and      losers--and it's the likely losers-to-be that are inverting.      ``Even minimal tax reform would hurt a lot of these companies      badly,'' he says.       For example, Buckley says, a company that inverts before      reform takes effect will be able to suck income out of the      U.S. to lower-tax locales much more easily than if it were      still a U.S. company. ``A revenue-neutral tax reform requires      there to be winners and losers,'' Buckley says. ``But by      inverting, the companies that would be losers are taking      themselves out of the equation . . . They're taking advantage      of both U.S. individual taxpayers and other corporations.''       If you're a typical CEO who has read this far, about now      you're shaking your head and thinking, ``What a jerk! Just      cut my tax rate and I'll stay.'' To which I say, ``I wouldn't      bet on it.'' In the widely hailed 1986 tax reform act,      Congress cut the corporate rate to 34% (now 35%) from 46%,      and closed some loopholes. Corporate America was happy--for      awhile. Now, with Ireland at 12.5% and Britain at 20% (or      less, if you make a deal), 35% is intolerable. Let's say we      cut the rate to 25%, the wished-for number I hear bandied      about. Other countries are lower, and could go lower still in      order to lure our companies. Is Corporate America willing to      pay any corporate rate above zero? I wonder.       So what do we need? I'll offer you a bipartisan solution--     no, I'm not kidding. For starters, we need to tighten      inversion rules as proposed by Sandy and Carl Levin, who are      both bigtime Democrats. That would buy time to erect a more      rational corporate tax structure than we have now--bolstered,      I hope, by input from tough-minded tax techies.       We also need loophole tighteners along the lines of      proposals in the Republican-sponsored, dead-on-arrival Tax      Reform Act of 2014. One part would have imposed a tax of      8.75% a year on cash and cash equivalents held offshore, and      3.5% a year on other retained offshore earnings.       Another thing we need to do--which the SEC or the Financial      Accounting Standards Board could do in a heartbeat, but      won't--is require publicly traded U.S. companies and U.S.      subsidiaries of publicly traded foreign companies to disclose      two numbers from the tax returns they file with the IRS:      their U.S. taxable income for a given year, and how much      income tax they owed. This would take perhaps one person-hour      a year per company.       That way we would know what firms actually pay instead of      having to guess at it. Then we could compare and contrast      companies' income tax payments.       What we don't need is another one-time ``tax holiday,''      like the one being proposed by Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.), to      let companies pay 9.5% rather than 35% to bring earnings held      offshore into the U.S. It would be the second time in a      decade we've done that, and would signal tax avoiders that      they should keep sending tons of money offshore, then wait      for a tax holiday--presumably not on the Fourth of July--to      bring it back.       Until--and unless--we somehow get our act together on      corporate tax reform, companies will keep leaving our      country. Those that try to do the right thing and act like      good American corporate citizens will come under increasing      pressure to invert, if only to fend off possible attacks by      corporate pirates--I'm sorry, ``activist investors''--who see      inversion as a way to get a quick uptick in their targets'      stock price.       Now, two brief rays of sunshine: one in England, one here.       Starbucks, embarrassed by a 2012 Reuters expose showing      that it paid little or no taxes in England despite telling      shareholders it made big profits there, has recently      apologized and now makes substantial British tax payments.      And eBay, God bless it, decided to bring $9 billion of      offshore cash into the U.S. and pay taxes on it.       So I'm feeling a bit better about July than when I started      writing this. In any event, a happy summer to you and yours.                                  ____      Jamie Dimon: Companies Should Feel Free To Bail on the U.S.                          (By Stephen Gandel)       The JPMorgan CEO gave a thumbs up to inversions, the      growing practice where American companies buy smaller foreign      companies to relocate overseas and avoid paying U.S. taxes.       JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon says he's okay with      companies using a hot tax dodge that could cost the U.S. tens      of billions of dollars over the decade.       Dimon's public thumbs up for inversions--the growing      practice where American companies buy smaller foreign      companies to relocate overseas and avoid paying U.S. taxes--     came in response to a question from Fortune on a media      conference call after JPMorgan JPM 0.74% released its second      quarter results. He said the real problem was the tax code,      not CEOs trying to shirk their responsibilities.       ``You want the choice to be able to go to Wal-Mart to get      the lowest prices,'' Dimon said on a conference call with      reporters on Tuesday morning. ``Companies should be able to      make that choice as well.''       Dimon did not elaborate on the difference between choosing      where to buy your underwear and where a corporation calls      home. In a recent cover story for Fortune, Allan Sloan argued      that U.S. companies are ``positively unpatriotic'' when they      move their corporate headquarters overseas to pay lower taxes      because of the benefits they receive by being (except for tax      purposes) American companies. What's more, Sloan argued      undermining the U.S. tax base will be bad for all      shareholders in the long run.       Dimon seemed to brush aside those concerns. He said it was      inappropriate for anyone to moralize against deals in which      U.S. companies seek lower tax rates through mergers. No large      U.S. bank has proposed an inversion deal. Since the financial      crisis, there has been a debate about the size of the      subsidizes that large banks like JPMorgan receive from U.S.      taxpayers.       At least for now, inversions are good for Dimon and his      shareholders. The firm has been an advisor on 19 inversion      deals that have been announced since last year. The bank is      advising drug maker AbbVie on its $53 billion bid for Dublin-     based Shire, which was announced on Monday.       ``I love America. I'm just as patriotic as anyone,'' said      Dimon. ``But we have a flawed corporate tax code that is      driving U.S. companies overseas.''
