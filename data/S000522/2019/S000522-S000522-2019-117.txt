Mr. Chair, much of what we have argued about for a quarter of a century has now been scientifically validated by the Working Group, including the fact that massive numbers of people are getting seriously ill from ticks and that the Federal response has been woefully inadequate.  Let me point out to my colleagues that this amendment very simply boosts the amount of money that CDC will have to spend. Again, it was the Working Group that pointed out that in terms of prevalence, the number of diseases that are charted, no other disease, no other disability gets less funding for CDC or for NIH. I would say that is because there has been such a culture of denial by certain organizations about the prevalence of Lyme over the years, and that has really prevented the necessary work from happening.  We are talking about, in 2017, $11 million for CDC and $28 million for the National Institutes of Health. That is a drop in the bucket for this infectious disease.  CDC has recognized that there are 18 tick-borne pathogens in the U.S., and researchers and healthcare practitioners continue to discover emerging agents.  The Working Group's report was able to underscore a fact many of us have believed to be true, and now it is further validated, that 10 to 20 percent of patients suffer from persistent symptoms, which are chronic and disabling--in other words, chronic Lyme.  The diagnostic tests--and this is, again, where the research dollars can make a difference--are also often inaccurate. The report points out that in about 50 percent or more of the cases, when people do blood tests they are told they don't have it. Those are false negatives. They do have it.  There are other tests that go deeper into the bands to discover this. It is very expensive. We need a world-class diagnostic tool.  Mr. Chair, I would point out to my colleagues that the disproportionate number of people who are infected--mal infected, to be more accurate--are children who are out in the backyard. This report points out that most people get Lyme in their own backyards. Of course, if people play sports, are hikers, or are out in the wilderness, they are also further at risk.                              {time}  1700  So this amendment increases CDC's funding it by $1 million for Lyme. It is a modest amount but a step in the right direction.  I have also introduced legislation with Collin Peterson, and I would ask my colleagues to take a look at it. It is called the TICK Act, H.R. 3073, and it would create a national strategy like we have done with Alzheimer's and like we have done with other diseases to bring the needed Federal resources to the fight against Lyme.  Mr. Chairman, I do ask Members to support the amendment and take a look at the TICK Act.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, although I do not oppose the amendment.  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentlewoman from Connecticut is recognized for 5 minutes.  There was no objection.  Ms. DeLAURO. I support this amendment, Mr. Chairman. I know the gentleman is a longtime supporter of increased funding for the CDC's Lyme disease program. I commend him for his continued efforts to address this issue, and I thank him for appearing before this subcommittee on Member Day to talk about the importance of this issue.  I have a particular interest in this effort as well as the Lyme disease was discovered in Lyme, Connecticut, so I know all about the illness.  The underlying bill does include a $1 million increase. It is a total funding level of $13 million for the CDC to intensify efforts to develop better diagnostics and to bolster critical prevention and surveillance networks, which are critically important as Lyme disease is being reported in every single State. This amendment would increase the program by an additional $1 million. And I do know from reviewing the amendments that are coming up in the next several hours that there, in fact, is another Lyme disease amendment.  So, Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith).  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it.
