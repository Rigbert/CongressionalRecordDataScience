President, I commend the distinguished acting majority leader for the number of nominations that have been cleared. I hope my side of the aisle will work with the majority leader to clear some more before we go out, especially among the judges. We have a number that have been pending and are noncontroversial and should be cleared.  I also hope that on Wednesday we will go to the conference report on the satellite bill. It passed the House, I think, 411-8, which shows the enormous support it has. I hope we get it out of here; otherwise, we run the risk of hundreds of thousands of satellite dishes and TV sets around this country going black on a number of their channels on December 31. This has enormous importance.  As I said, the House passed it 411-8. They are showing more unanimity than on just about anything they have done this year. We passed it, I believe, unanimously. That, and the attendant Hatch-Leahy patent bill--which I thinkis extremely important--I hope we get through before we go out.  I mention that, but I also did want to commend the Senator from Iowa, both in his capacity as the Senator from Iowa and in his capacity as acting leader, for the number of nominations that have gone through. I hope my side of the aisle will be as diligent in clearing the rest.
