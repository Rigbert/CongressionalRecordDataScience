As the house and senate in South Carolina expressed its opinion, it surely is appropriate for this House of Representatives, representing the values of our country, sworn to uphold our Constitution that stands for equality of all, that we can express ourselves and take appropriate action. I appreciate the gentleman's view.  I have great respect for Mr. Woodward. Mr. Woodward, shortly after that book came out, I called him. He came into my office. We had a discussion about that representation. I will tell the gentleman that I believe Mr. Woodward was incorrect. He did not have information I gave him. I don't mean that he necessarily says he is incorrect.  But there is no doubt, when you want to talk about history, you passed a bill 5 days before the suggestion was made by Jack Lew, which was, presumably, coming out of the White House, to Mr. Reid, the majority leader. Five days before that, you passed, on this floor, a bill which was called Cut, Cap, and Balance, which had sequester as your fallback policy.  So you are right. You can't change history. That is history. I have said that a number of times. The gentleman has not corrected me. I presume that, therefore, he believes that I am accurate in that representation of the timing.  But very frankly, that history is irrelevant. What is relevant, as the gentleman and I, I think, both agree, if we don't get to an agreement on a number that is as we did in Ryan-Murray--we have done this before. We have done this before. Now, my view is we did it because you didn't want to have your Members vote on legislation that had numbers that were draconian before the election, but that may be only my personal perspective.  But the fact of the matter is the American people expect us to get their work done. Getting their work done, at minimum, means funding the government at appropriate levels. And, again, I would say that Mr. Rogers does not believe the sequester--I agree with you. It is the law of the land. I think it is wrong. I think it is a bad law. It was not a law that was intended to go into effect. It went into effect simply because the supercommittee that was established in that same legislation couldn't come out with a solution.  In 13 months, the Congress couldn't come out with a solution, and, therefore, on January 1, 2014, we were confronted with these draconian, ill-conceived numbers, according to Mr. Rogers. Let's not be confronted with those numbers 60 days from now on October 1 where we are unable to do our business. So I would urge my friend, and I would be glad to work with him toward that end.  We just passed a bill, Mr. Leader, which I voted for. We passed it on a bipartisan basis--the majority of my Members voted for it; the majority of your Members voted for it--a highway bill. It was, however, I know on our side, and I know that in discussions with you, your feeling as well, that it is not what we ought to be doing.  What we ought to be doing is passing a long-term, at least 6-year reauthorization bill for the highway program so that Governors, mayors, county executives, local officials, contractors, and construction workers would all have some confidence that there would be a revenue stream to fix our roads, repair our bridges, and build roads where they are needed.  Can the gentleman tell me whether he believes that there is a plan to get to the--and I know he and I have discussed it--but a plan to get to, before the December 18 date that the present bill calls for, a long-term highway reauthorization?  I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank him for his work and help on passing the highway bill this week.  As the gentleman knows, nobody in this House wants to pass a short-term highway bill. We want certainty. We want to make sure the money goes the furthest and in the most efficient and effective way.  The reason why we are going to a short-term, December 18, is because it is our plan and our intention, together, to be able to find the resources to have a highway bill that can be 5 years.                              {time}  1300  It is our intention to be able to have that.  We have a plan, I believe, we are working towards, and the first step was extending highways to the December 18 date. All we have next is to pass the Senate.  If they pass our highway bill, we will be in the right place, prepared to have it done before December, a 5-year that we could all work together in a bipartisan manner to have done.
