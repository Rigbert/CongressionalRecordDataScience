 Mr. Chairman, I want to rise to make an observation with respect to what is happening in the Congress and in the United States of America regarding how we spend our money and how we make decisions on spending our money.  The chart to my right shows that in 1962, 70 percent of the Federal budget was so-called discretionary spending. Discretionary spending is decisions that we make about where we want to invest our money to make our country stronger and more viable as a Nation, to make people more secure and more able to compete. That has now dropped down to less than 36 percent.  Half of that is for our national defense. I am one of those Democrats that supports the national defense, and I have done so since 1981 when I first came here. We added $12 billion to defense this year when it passed this House. Why did we do so? We did so on the premise that to freeze defense was in fact a cut. In fact, I think that rationale was correct. But I am not so sure why that rationale does not apply to the defense of this Nation as it relates to the education of our children and the security of our families.  In 1983, the Department of Education issued a report. It was a stark and compelling report, and it was entitled ``A Nation At Risk.''  What did it say? I am quoting from that report, issued under the imprimatur of Secretary Terrence Bell, who recently passed away. He was a fine Secretary of Education, a member of the Reagan Cabinet. The report said this:       If an unfriendly foreign power had attempted to impose on      America the mediocre educational performance that exists      today, we might well have viewed it as an act of war. As it      stands, we have allowed this to happen to ourselves. We have      dismantled essential support systems which helped make these      gains possible. We have in effect been committing an act of      unthinking unilateral educational disarmament.  Mr. Chairman, I will oppose this bill because it sounds retreat, and America ought not to retreat. In a time when we need to have families first in our focus, at a time when we need to strengthen education and strengthen children, sounding the bugle of retreat is not a proper policy.  We will have a very substantial increase in the numbers of children going to our schools over the next 6 years. Next year, in fact, we will have more children in school than in any year in our history.  What does that mean? That means there will be a greater burden on local and State governments. As the previous speaker said, the Federal Government contributes only 6 percent of the educational resources available to our families and to educate our children. But that 6 percent is a critical part. In fact, it is the part which deals with some of the most vulnerable children in America, those who have economic, cultural, and educational deprivations in their families, and who therefore start out behind the others with whom they will go to school.  This chart shows that we are going to have 3.4 million more children entering school from 1997 to 2002. It also shows that the Republican budget's freeze at $14.4 billion for elementary and secondary education is essentially a retreat, because it will effectively be, in 2002, $12 billion in real dollars, in resources available. In an atmosphere where the need is growing, our investment is decreasing.                              {time}  1845  That does not make sense for our families or for our children. I said that the numbers of children were increasing, and I showed Members on the chart where the budget goes from $14.4 billion to approximately $12 billion in real terms by 2002. Now, that is when we will be experiencing an addition of 3.4 million new young people in our school system.  Those children do not disappear. Those children will not have another chance at being 3 or 4 or 5 years old. This is not something that we can catch up on tomorrow, when perhaps, as George Bush says, our wallet will match our will. I believe that we ought to have the will, and I clearly believe we have the wallet. As a matter of fact, as a Democrat for a balanced budget, I voted for the coalition budget. The coalition budget, in fact, balanced the budget, cut more spending than the Republican or the President's alternative, and provided an additional $47 billion for education. How did it do that? Because we did not pretend that we could cut taxes, balance the budget, and make sure that families were secure in the knowledge that their children would receive the kinds of education that they need.  Under the President's budget, there would have been $7.05 billion for title I. Title I is for economically deprived children who need some additional help to be competitive, so that they can join our workforce in competing with an increasingly able workforce around the world. A freeze in real terms would serve 6.8 million children in 2002. The chairman suggests a freeze in 1997 but in point of fact, that policy will result in an actual decrease to 5.8 million children who will be served in 2002. This is opposed to the President's budget, which will serve 6.8 million children. That is 1 million American children that will have no seats for title I assistance in the schools of our Nation because of this Republican budget. I believe that policy is inconsistent with our desire to compete in the global marketplace, with our desire to pledge to families that they can be secure in the knowledge that their children will have the kind of education, Head Start, and title I assistance that they need.  Now, I want to tell my friends in the House that my children have had great advantages. Their father and their mother earn substantial incomes. Their father and their mother had the advantages of higher education. But let me tell Members something that all of us, I am sure, know, and that every family in America knows: Our children will be affected by the ability to participate and contribute of every other child in their generation. Therefore, I say to my friends that this budget, which calls us to retreat, is a budget we ought to reject.  I talked about title I. Today in America, in a program that President Reagan, President Bush, and President Clinton supported and funded, we serve 53 percent of the children who are eligible. That means we do not serve 47 percent. I think that is a problem. I think what we ought to do is increase the percentage that we serve. Why? Because it makes us more competitive and makes us a more viable society.  But this Republican budget, as I said, sounds retreat and moves from 53 percent of children served today by title I to 42 percent of the children served in 2002. That extrapolates into those 1 million children that I told Members about. Those are real children from real families in a country that, increasingly in a global marketplace, knows that it has got to have better skills for its children.  This next chart shows in very specific terms what will happen in the cities and towns of America. Let me give some examples. In Dallas, TX, a freeze in title I as proposed by the chairman will mean 29 teachers lose their jobs and 726 students lose help next year. S. 726 students next year in Dallas, TX, as a result of this bill will not get the kind of help that they need. The Miami-Dade area will lost 40 teachers and 1,011 students next year. It will lost 255 teachers and 6,386 students over the next 5 years.  Ladies and gentlemen of the House, in order to stay even, just this year, we would have to add $2.6 billion to this bill for education.  Now, recall with me my opening statement that we added $12 billion to the defense bill so that we could stay even and remain the strongest Nation on the face of the earth. My Republican colleagues pointed out that if we did not have that additional $12 billion, if we froze funding at last year's level, that we would in fact be putting at risk the Nation by underfunding our defense. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, let us not underfund the defense of America by underfunding the children, the education of America. I urge a ``no'' vote on this appropriation bill.
