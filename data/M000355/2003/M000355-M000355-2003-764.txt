 President, today the Senate will begin consideration of S. 1, a prescription drug benefits bill, for debate only. There will be no votes during today's session. Today is an excellent opportunity for Senators to deliver their opening statements. We encourage all Senators to participate in this debate. Hopefully, Members will take the next day or two and deliver their opening remarks. The next vote will occur during Tuesday's session of the Senate and Members will be notified when that vote is scheduled.                          ____________________
