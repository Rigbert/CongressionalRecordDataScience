Brian and Connie Vermeulen are dedicated public servants, fully committed to improving the quality of life in the City of San Juan Capistrano for both neighbors and visitors. I was happy to learn that their selfless commitment to the values, ideals and traditions that this country was founded upon has earned them recognition from the San Juan Capistrano Chamber of Commerce as Man and Woman of the Year.  Brian and Connie both moved with their families to the Capistrano Valley in the early 1960s. They also both attended the parish grammar school and have remained members of the San Juan Mission parish ever since. Over the years, while busy running a business and raising children and grandchildren, they have never missed an opportunity to get involved with the community.  Together, Brian and Connie have become champions for a number of cherished local organizations, such as the Boys and Girls Club and the Fiesta Association. They have logged countless hours as yearly volunteers for the San Juan Historical Society and the Capistrano 4-H Rangers. Aside from their joint ventures, the Vermeulens also pursue their passions individually. Brian volunteers his time and talent as a Little League Coach and Connie is involved with religious education programs at the Mission parish.  The Vermeulens are the kind of citizens that this country can be proud of; humble and hardworking, they truly represent the heart of America. I want to thank Brian and Connie Vermeulen not just for their tremendous sacrifice and remarkable accomplishment, but for providing us all with a glowing example of what it means to be an American.                          ____________________
