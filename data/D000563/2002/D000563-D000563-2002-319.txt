The idea was to improve the quality of education across America, to make certain, with accountability, that schools were graduating students who had the basic wherewithal to succeed in society.  One of the linchpins was to improve teachers in the classroom.  I would like the Senator from Massachusetts to tell me if I recall this correctly. Are we moving through President Bush's bill to a point where more and more teachers have to be certified in that they are going to teach in schools? In other words, you cannot be the gym teacher who says, I will teach biology. You have to stand in front of the classroom with students.  We are passing bills saying, teachers, we want you to stay in school, get more advanced degrees, and be more valuable in the marketplace but come back to the classroom. And now the Bush administration, months later, comes in and increases the cost of education for those who aspire to be those quality teachers. There is a disconnect.
