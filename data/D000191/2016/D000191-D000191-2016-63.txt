It is actually--it is quite definitive language. ``Where Federally owned and operated levees increase flood risk and compromise the accreditation of community-owned. . . . it shall be the policy of the Corps of Engineers to act expeditiously with actions required to authorize, fund, identify, and implement improvements to reduce and negate negative impacts to community-owned flood protection system accreditation.'' It seems to me that it is pretty definitive with the ``shall'' part there.  I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Shuster).
