 I want to take a moment to clarify a few things. My position hasn't changed. Like I said in November of last year, I intend to honor the blue-slip courtesy, but there have always been exceptions.  First, the blue slip has always been a Senatorial courtesy. It is premised on the idea that home State Senators are in a very good position to provide insights into a nominee from their State for the Federal judiciary. It is meant to encourage consultation between the White House and home State Senators about judicial nominations. That is why I value the blue-slip tradition and ask for the views of Senators on all nominees to courts from their respective States.  Throughout its history, the many chairmen of the Senate Judiciary Committee have applied this blue-slip courtesy differently. That is a chairman's prerogative.
