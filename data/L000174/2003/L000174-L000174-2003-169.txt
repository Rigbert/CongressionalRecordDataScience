REID. I am requesting an annual appropriation of $1.25 million dollars each year for the next 3 years. This funding would be used to develop an administrative structure, identify potential collaborators and projects, initiate ``seed'' projects, educate and train American students in water security, launch research initiatives, and develop and implement a plan for continued center activities without the need for additional Congressional appropriations. The funding would be administered by the University of Nevada Chancellor's office, and made available to scientists and researchers throughout the University System. The Chancellor's office has a long tradition and expertise in administering federal, state and non-profit research grants.
