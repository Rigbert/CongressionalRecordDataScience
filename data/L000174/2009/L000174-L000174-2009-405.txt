President, I have been in discussions with the distinguished Republican deputy leader, Senator Kyl. We do not have a formal agreement but what we are looking toward doing, in the next 10 minutes or so, is having acceptance of the managers' technical amendment and then going to a rollcall vote on Senator Kyl's amendment, which I will support.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
