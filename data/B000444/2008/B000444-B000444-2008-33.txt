 I wanted to make sure Senator Lugar has copies of them.  The first one relates to the Sessions amendment. Then the second relates to wrapping up the entirety of the bill, all remaining amendments. With the Senator's permission, I will proceed.  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order for Senator Sessions to substitute an amendment on promoting blood safety for the amendment he currently has listed under the agreement with respect to S. 2731, with no second-degree amendments in order to the amendment; that the Sessions amendment be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; that the Sessions amendment on the list be deleted, and that no point of order be in order to the bill based on section 305.
