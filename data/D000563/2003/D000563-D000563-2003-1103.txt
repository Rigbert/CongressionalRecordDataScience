President, I express my gratitude to my colleague and cosponsor of this amendment, Senator DeWine from Ohio. It has been a bipartisan effort from the start, and we would not be at this successful moment without him. I thank him from the bottom of my heart for his dedication to this cause. I particularly thank the Senator from Alaska. He led the effort to fund the first effort to deal with the AIDS epidemic. I salute him for his leadership.  I call up amendment No. 127.
