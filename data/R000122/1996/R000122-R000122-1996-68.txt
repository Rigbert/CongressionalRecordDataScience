Speaker, I rise today to recognize the superb performance of the Ponaganset Wind Ensemble at the 1996 International Youth and Music Festival in Vienna, Austria.  The Ponaganset Wind Ensemble, instructed by Mr. Nedo Pandolfi of Ponaganset High School in Rhode Island's Foster/Glocester Regional School District, met all expectations by taking first place in the festival's band competition--a feat never before achieved by an ensemble from the Ocean State.  Chosen as one of only three bands to represent the United States, Ponaganset, which placed third at the 1982 Vienna Festival, showed the world how countless hours of practice and dedication can produce brilliance. So impressive was Ponaganset's performance that the student's were awarded the Cup of Vienna, an accolade not given every year and awarded only when the festival panel recognizes exemplary musical performance.  The Ensemble's 46 young musicians, ages 14 to 18, not only successfully competed on an international stage, but also found boundless opportunities to receive a priceless musical education. The Wind Ensemble performed for numerous crowds at local fairs and open air arenas throughout Vienna's historical downtown area, and also visited the memorials to some of the world's most legendary composers such as Mozart, Beethoven, and Strauss.  Mr. Pandolfi established the Ponaganset Wind Ensemble program in 1960, the same year that Ponaganset High School was founded. Thirty-six years later, both the instructor and the pupils should be praised for their momentous achievement, which is an experience whose memories will last a lifetime.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the following members of the Ponaganset Wind Ensemble, who have clearly illustrated what we can achieve when we follow our dreams.
