President, thank you.  Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support the compromise amendment offered by our distinguished colleague, the senior Senator from Maine, and the Senator from Vermont.  Mr. President, I am confident that the original language in the McCain-Feingold bill relating to the issue ads would have withstood constitutional scrutiny. But the careful work of the Senator from Maine and the Senator from Vermont certainly removes any doubt on that score. They have done an artful job in crafting this language, and I hope it will receive the support of every Senator.  Thank you, Mr. President.
