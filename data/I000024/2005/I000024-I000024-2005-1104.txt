President, we are now on the substitute. I understand there are some amendments that are either on their way down or are going to be presented at this time. If not, we will talk a little bit about the bill and where we are today. We are prepared now to go ahead and accept amendments. We are going to ask Members to bring their amendments to the desk. The majority and minority leaders have agreed to give us the floor time to consider these amendments. The sooner we get the amendments, the sooner we can get this passed and sent to conference. I would think the minority leader would agree with me that this is one of the three most significant bills of the year.  I yield the floor.
