Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Shimkus) for authoring this legislation. It sends a clear, unmistakable message to the Lukashenko dictatorship, and a message of solidarity and concern to the people that hopefully there will be a brighter day for this important country. But it is only because of ongoing, dogged determination on the part of the pro-democracy advocates inside that country and their friends outside, like Mr. Lantos, Mr. Hyde, Mr. Shimkus, and others; that we keep the pressure on from without so that someday human rights and democracy will flourish in Belarus.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
