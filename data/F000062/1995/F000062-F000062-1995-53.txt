 President, I would like to thank the Senator from North Dakota for his comments. I believe they are right on. They are helpful, and I think they are positive.  It is my belief that the budget debate could be settled in 20 minutes, if both sides really sat down and did it. I think the Senator from North Dakota clearly gave the main kernel of a solution. The tax cuts that are in the bill--no one benefits from those tax cuts more than my own family does. My husband is an investment banker. The capital gains clearly benefits him. He would love to have those benefits. It would be a nice thing to have, and many Americans feel that way. However, to have those benefits by making deeper cuts in Medicare and Medicaid--in my own State the Medicaid Program pays half a million of the poorest Californians' premiums and copayments whose Medicare would be done away with. We do not need to do that in this bill. You do not need to have the depth of the cuts to balance the budget in 7 years.  The issue is not balancing the budget in 7 years. We have all agreed that is now going to be the case. The issue is do we need to have a major tax reduction benefiting largely upper-income people by taking those dollars, by making the cuts deeper in Medicare and Medicaid and social programs that are important to the well-being of this Nation? I think the answer to that, for anyone that looks at this from a moral perspective, clearly has to be no. So my own view is that this thing can be settled very quickly, and that the Senator from North Dakota clearly put forward a kernel of that solution.                          ____________________
