Mr. Leader, I am not sure. I want to understand. They upheld their word. Ninety people voted against the bill you are saying supported the military, 90 of your people voted against that. The majority of Democrats voted for it. Are you telling me those 90 Republicans who voted against it were against the military? That is my question to you.  Mr. McCARTHY. May I ask the gentleman if I may finish my answer before the gentleman reclaims his time.
