Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I wish the gentleman would stay for a moment to understand one thing. He is talking about yesterday, not today. Our bill changes all those things, and by the way, the International Brotherhood of Police Officers supports my bill. The best law force group in the country, they support my bill.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Traficant).
