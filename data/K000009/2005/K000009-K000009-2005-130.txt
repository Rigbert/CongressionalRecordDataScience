Speaker, President Bush invited the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, Prince Abdullah, to his ranch in Crawford, Texas, and met with him yesterday. Here is a photo that has been on the White House Web site and in many newspapers around the country showing the President and the Prince holding hands. That is a sign of friendship over there in that part of the world.                              {time}  2000  But I was struck by the fact that the focus, of course, was the subject of oil.  As we watch what the President said, or at least what was reported, our President is in a position of begging. America begging. America begging a dictatorship to ease up on oil prices.  My colleagues might recall the President asked the Saudi prince to take it easy before the election in November, kind of keep prices down a bit, but since the election, they have just skyrocketed. In California, people are paying over $3 a gallon. In Ohio I can tell my colleagues I have paid $2.50, $2.57. The average price they tell us is about $2.24 nationally, with a 43 percent increase since a year ago, and crude oil prices were up Monday about $54 a barrel, up $37 from a year ago.  Now, the United States consumes about $7.1 billion worth of petroleum, and two-thirds of it is being imported, Saudi Arabia being the largest supplier. In essence, America is totally dependent. People have to understand this, because until the American people really understand this, we will not change. Every time we buy a tankful of gas, two-thirds of the money we spend goes somewhere else, and it goes to places that are undemocratic.  The New York Times reports today, and it has this picture in the paper, about the President's meeting, and it also has an article about Venezuela, which I will submit to the Record. Venezuela provides about 15 percent of the oil that we consume. In fact, I have a chart here that shows from the Middle East where we get about 30 percent of the total supply, with Saudi Arabia being the largest supplier, along with Kuwait, Iraq, United Arab Emirates, and then Venezuela about 15 percent; nearly half of what we consume comes from those regions of the world. America has to understand this, because until the people of the United States understand, this place will not change.  If we look at the sad energy bill that passed this Chamber last week, without my support, it lives in the past. It lives in the 20th century, not the 21st century. There is a theory: If you just put more holes in the ground, all problems will be solved. Well, that is not going to happen. We have to think in a different way.  Now, Venezuela, as the article in The New York Times today confirms, has become a bit antagonistic toward the United States because we have an administration who is trying to get rid of the President of that country's government. Now, whether you like Venezuela or not, the facts are we get 15 percent of our oil from there, and without that 15 percent, we have to get it from somewhere else, and the prices are going to go up. Now, the President of Venezuela believes that the United States is planning an invasion of his country, and he has threatened to cut these oil sales. It is not a very pretty picture when we look around the world, whether you look at Colombia, Nigeria, Venezuela, the Middle East. So it is not surprising that the President is holding hands with the prince.  What is truly dangerous and tragic about this trend is America is not independent. We had a Declaration of Independence at the beginning of the Republic to cut our umbilical cord to Britain for political and economic reasons. But imagine an America that was energy independent; again, where we put all of this money, that is making others rich, in the pockets of producers in this country, starting with the farmers of America who today, within 5 years, could displace 25 percent of our imported petroleum with the use of clean, burning biofuels based in biomass, in ethanol, in biodiesel, soy diesel, fuels that we can produce today on the fields that are lying fallow across this country. Imagine what biogenetics can do to produce greater BTUs per ton of what we can produce. We do not need a new hydrogen age right now; we can use what we have today to displace these purchases. We are not doing it.  Imagine, imagine an America that was energy independent; again, where when you went to the gas pump, you enriched your own community, the farmers that live around the communities that you live in, and that the gas pump that you drove up to, you could buy ethanol at E85, or you could buy 100 percent soy diesel. Do my colleagues know, in Ohio you cannot do that. Minnesota has seen the future, Iowa has seen the future. There are some places in this country who have seen the future, but the majority of our people have not seen the future.  Renewable biofuels, domestically produced, could directly displace imported petroleum, and our energy bill last week should have done that. Some of us want to live in the 21st and 22nd century; we do not want our President to be holding hands with the crown prince and begging.                [From the New York Times, Apr. 26, 2005]     Bush and Saudi Prince Discuss High Oil Prices in Ranch Meeting                       (By Richard W. Stevenson)       Crawford, TX, April 25.--President Bush discussed the surge      in oil prices with Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia on      Monday, but focused on a plan by the Saudis to increase their      oil-pumping capacity over the next decade rather than on any      short-term efforts to bring prices down.       The two leaders talked for three hours here at Mr. Bush's      ranch, trying to restore some normality to a relationship      that has been tense since the emergence of the role of      terrorists from Saudi Arabia in the Sept. 11 attacks. They      discussed a variety of issues, including the Arab-Israeli      conflict, terrorism, trade and Mr. Bush's call for more      democracy in the Middle East, and the men made every effort      to portray the relationship as back on track.       Mr. Bush even held the crown prince's hand, a traditional      Saudi sign of friendship, as he guided Abdullah up the steps      through a bed of bluebonnets to his office, the very picture      of Saudi-American interdependence.       But the focus was on oil prices. Officials from both sides      emerged from the meeting to say there was agreement on the      value of Saudi Arabia's signaling to global markets that it      would push down prices over the long run as demand for energy      increased. American officials said they hoped the Saudi      policy might put immediate downward pressure on oil prices,      even though the expansion plan has been public for weeks.       ``A high oil price will damage markets, and he knows      that,'' Mr. Bush said as he waited for his guest to arrive.       Officials said there was no explicit request by Mr. Bush      for short-term steps to bring     down rising oil and gasoline prices, which are threatening to      take a toll on the economy in the United States and are      already pulling down the president's approval ratings. They      said that Mr. Bush and other officials had already signaled      to the Saudis that they wanted a commitment to pump more oil      in the short run, and that last week the Saudi oil minister      had publicly expressed a willingness to do so.       The officials said the Saudis used the meeting to detail      for Mr. Bush the steps they intended to take to cushion the      global market from future increases in demand from fast-     growing economies like China and India, and from the United      States and other industrial nations.       Saudi Arabia's plan, which it began discussing publicly      weeks ago, calls for spending up to $50 billion to increase      its maximum sustainable production capacity to 12.5 million      barrels a day by 2009, and to 15 million in the subsequent      decade, from about 10.8 million barrels now. The Saudis are      currently pumping about 9.5 million barrels a day.       Asked whether that plan would have any effect soon on      gasoline prices in the United States, Stephen J. Hadley, Mr.      Bush's national security adviser, told reporters, ``It's hard      to say.''       Mr. Hadley added that increasing capacity ``can't help but      have a positive downward effect on prices and deal with some      of the volatility in the market by assuring people that      supply will be available as the economies grow.''       A Saudi official said that Mr. Bush had not requested a      short-term production increase and that such an increase      would not have any effect on gasoline prices in the United      States in any case. The high price of gasoline in the United      States, the Saudi official said, was mostly a result of a      lack of refining capacity here.       ``It will not make a difference if Saudi Arabia ships an      extra million or two million barrels of crude oil to the      United States,'' said the official, Adel al-Jubeir, a senior      adviser to the crown prince. ``If you cannot refine it, it      will not turn into gasoline, and that will not turn into      lower prices.''       The national average price for a gallon of regular unleaded      gasoline last week was just under $2.24, up 43 cents from a      year earlier. Crude oil prices on Monday were about $54 a      barrel, up from $37 a year ago.       Saudi Arabia's plans to increase production capacity are      politically and geologically sensitive. In the Middle East,      the Saudis have been criticized for increasing production to      help the United States; the most extreme of those critics has      been Osama bin Laden.       Some experts, including past and present officials of Saudi      Aramco, the state-owned oil company, have said the plan may      be too optimistic because of geological complexities in the      oil fields and challenges in finding enough technology and      labor.       The crown prince arrived at the Bush ranch late Monday      morning from Dallas, where he had met Sunday with Vice      President Dick Cheney, who was briefed on the Saudi      production plan. Reflecting the importance of the meeting to      the administration, Mr. Bush was joined for the meeting here      by Mr. Cheney; Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice; Mr.      Hadley; Andrew H. Card Jr., the White House chief of staff;      and Fran Townsend, the White House's homeland security      adviser.       The atmosphere was considerably less tense than during      Abdullah's last visit, three years ago to the day, and the      two sides cited progress on a variety of fronts.       Saudi officials said only technicalities remained in      negotiating a trade deal with the United States, a big step      toward Saudi Arabia's goal of joining the World Trade      Organization. The two governments agreed to work toward      making it easier for Saudi students and military officers to      study and train in the United States.       Mr. Hadley said the Saudis had made ``real good progress''      in fighting terrorism.       Ms. Rice said that the Saudis and the United States had a      ``common agenda'' when it came to promoting peace between the      Israelis and Palestinians and that she had discussed with      Abdullah the need for the Saudis to provide financial support      for the Palestinians in Gaza once the Israelis pull out this      summer.                                  ____                [From the New York Times, Apr. 26, 2005]           U.S. Considers Toughening Stance Toward Venezuela                            (By Juan Forero)       As President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela veers toward greater      confrontation with Washington, the Bush administration is      weighing a tougher approach, including funneling more money      to foundations and business and political groups opposed to      his leftist government, American officials say.       The Bush administration has already begun to urge      Venezuela's neighbors to distance themselves from Mr. Chavez      and to raise concerns about press freedoms, judicial      independence and the Venezuelan government's affinity for      leftist groups abroad, including Colombian guerrillas.       But it has found no allies so far in its attempts to      isolate the Venezuelan leader, and it has grown more and more      frustrated by Mr. Chavez's strident anti-American outbursts      and policies that seem intended to fly in the face of      Washington. On Sunday, Mr. Chavez ended a 35-year military      cooperation agreement and ordered out four American military      instructors he accused of fomenting unrest.       The accusation, which American officials denied, was the      latest blow to relations that had been bitter since the      United States tacitly supported a coup that briefly ousted      Mr. Chavez in April 2002. Since then his strength has grown.      He won a recall election last August, and record high oil      prices have left his government flush with money as it      provides 15 percent of American oil imports.       American officials, who had chosen to ignore Mr. Chavez      through much of last year, now recognize the need for a      longer-term strategy to deal with a leader who is poised to      win a second six-year term in elections next year.       A multiagency task force in Washington has been working on      shaping a new approach, one that high-ranking American policy      makers say would most likely veer toward a harder line.      United States support for groups that Chavez supporters say      oppose the government has been a source of tension in the      past. Under the plans being considered, American officials      said, that support may increase.       ``The conclusion that is increasingly being drawn in      Washington is that a realistic, pragmatic relationship, in      which we can agree to disagree on some issues but make      progress on others, does not seem to be in the cards,'' said      an American official who helps guide policy in Latin America.       The official added, ``We offered them a more pragmatic      relationship, but obviously if they do not want it, we can      move to a more confrontational approach.''       Already counternarcotics programs have suffered, American      officials noted, and meetings among high-ranking officials      from the two countries are minimal.       ``What's happening here is they realize this thing is      deteriorating rapidly and it's going to require some more      attention,'' said a high-ranking Republican aide on Capitol      Hill who works on Latin America policy. ``The current look-     the-other-way policy is not working.''       The United States, he said, is particularly concerned      because Venezuela is one of four top providers of foreign oil      to the United States. ``You can't write him off,'' the aide      said of Mr. Chavez. ``He's sitting on an energy source that's      critical to us.''       A main problem for the United States is that Washington has      little, if any, influence over Caracas. The high price of oil      has left Venezuela with no need for the loans or other aid      that the United States could use as leverage.       Nor does the Bush administration have much support in Latin      America, where left-leaning leaders now govern two-thirds of      the continent. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is      expected to raise concerns about Venezuela in a four-country      tour through the region this week. Political analysts say she      will have a hard time finding support.       Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, on a recent trip to      Brazil, publicly raised concerns about Mr. Chavez. Days      later, President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of Brazil, in a      meeting in Venezuela with Mr. Chavez and the leaders of      Colombia and Argentina, pointedly said, ``We don't accept      defamation and insinuations against a companero,'' meaning a      close friend.       ``Venezuela has the right to be a sovereign country, to      make its own decisions,'' he added.       For his part, Mr. Chavez, who is famous for his rambling,      often outrageous speeches, has grown more belligerent, using      his anti-American posturing to bolster his popular support.      He has accused the United States of planning an invasion,      prompting a threat to cut oil sales, and has hurled sexually      tinged insults at Secretary Rice.       While other Venezuelan officials stress that oil sales to      the United States would never cease, Venezuela's new energy      ties with China have worried Washington, as did Mr. Chavez's      recent meeting with President Mohammad Khatami of Iran, which      he declared ``has every right'' to develop its atomic energy      program.       Mr. Chavez is also forming a popular militia that he says      will eventually have two million members and has plans to buy      100,000 AK-47 assault rifles from Russia and fighter jets      from Brazil.       ``All governments recognize the democratic character of the      Venezuelan government, its peaceful vocation, and they want      to establish relations with Venezuela, with just one      exception, the United States,'' Ali Rodriguez, the Venezuelan      foreign minister, said in an interview. ``It has gone to      great lengths to isolate Venezuela, but no government is      playing along. It has failed, and that's because there is no      reason to isolate Venezuela.''       Indeed, many of Latin America's largest countries see      little benefit in colliding with Mr. Chavez, nor do they      support the isolation of Cuba. Venezuela provides oil at      below-market prices and has numerous lucrative economic      agreements with dozens of nations. Many also do not want to      antagonize their own leftist constituencies, who are partial      to Mr. Chavez.       ``The other countries don't want to be drawn into a polemic      between Venezuela and the United States,'' said Jennifer L.      McCoy, a Venezuela expert at Georgia State University who      headed the Carter Center's election observer mission in      Caracas last year. ``It's a counterproductive strategy that      could result in a negative Latin American reaction if they're      forced to take sides.''       Many influential Democrats in Congress also oppose a more      aggressive approach.       ``I think it creates further estrangement,'' said      Representative Bill Delahunt, a Massachusetts Democrat and a      member of the House International Relations Committee who has      met many times with Mr. Chavez. ``One cannot get around the      fact that Hugo Chavez is a democratically elected      president.''       But Bush administration policy planners say that efforts to      patch up relations with Venezuela have largely failed.       The American ambassador, William Brownfield, who took over      in Caracas in September, spent fruitless months before      getting a meeting with Mr. Rodriguez. Requests for meetings      with other ministers and even midlevel officials are      routinely ignored, and Venezuela has canceled dozens of      routine exchange programs with the United States.       The one option that administration officials increasingly      believe they have is to respond much more assertively and      publicly to Venezuelan policies the United States does not      like, ideally with the help of other countries and respected      institutions like the Inter-American Commission on Human      Rights.       ``We shouldn't be afraid to say when he's taking away      liberties, not at all,'' Robert B. Zoellick, now the deputy      secretary of state, told the Senate Foreign Relations      Committee in February.       Venezuelan Foreign Ministry officials say they still hold      out hope that relations will improve. ``There is one      condition for us to have healthy relations with the United      States,'' said Vice Minister Mari Pili Hernandez, who handles      relations with Washington. ``It's called respect.''
