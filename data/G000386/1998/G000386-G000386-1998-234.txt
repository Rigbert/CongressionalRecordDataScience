 Lorance established an unworkable system for filing claims under the employment discrimination laws. It held that when a seniority system was allegedly adopted with a discriminatory purpose, the time limit for challenging that system begins to run on the date the system is first adopted--not the date it begins to apply to the individual employee. This could be a ``catch-22'': by the time an employee is harmed and has standing to bring a claim, the statutory time period for challenging the policy will often have expired. Indeed, in some cases, no current employee would ever be able to challenge a long-standing, but discriminatory employment policy or system.  This is clearly contrary to the purposes of the age discrimination laws. There is no justification for unfairly closing the doors of justice to victims of age discrimination.
