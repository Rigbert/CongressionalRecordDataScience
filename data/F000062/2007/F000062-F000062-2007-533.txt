 President, last November, John York, the owner of the San Francisco 49ers, announced his intention to move the team to Santa Clara.  The 49ers have been an integral part of San Francisco for the past 60 years. The team was founded in 1946 as part of the All-American Football Conference and joined the National Football League in 1950, when the two leagues merged.  The team's name is derived from the city's history, celebrating the miners who rushed to San Francisco in search of gold in 1849 and helped build the city.  The team has been a part of San Francisco for so long, and is such a central part of its culture, that the prospect of the team leaving concerns many of the people of San Francisco.  In response, I am introducing the Football Fairness Act that provides a new and limited antitrust exemption that is designed to slow the frequent movement of National Football League teams and prevent communities from suffering the financial and intangible costs of these moves.  As Mayor of San Francisco, I had the pleasure of witnessing several 49ers' Super Bowl victory parades.  What I remember most about those victories is the way the team's success brought the city together. I've also seen other cities unite in celebration of their teams' championships.  Our football teams are more than just businesses. They are a common denominator that cut across class, race, and gender to bond the people of a city. They are a key component of a city's culture and identity.  There are instances where a city cannot support a team, but it is disheartening when a city that can--and does--support a team is nevertheless abandoned and the loyalty of the fans discarded.  In 1985, then 49ers owner Eddie DeBartolo explored the possibility of moving the team to San Jose. As Mayor of San Francisco, I worked with the 49ers and we were able to reach an agreement to keep the team in San Francisco.  Today, I remain hopeful that an agreement to keep the team will be reached that will benefit the people of San Francisco and the 49ers' organization.  However, this situation highlights a broader trend of NFL teams abandoning cities after those communities invested substantial funds and good will into a team.  This persistent movement is bad for our cities.  In the last 25 years, National Football League teams have moved 7 times: Oakland Raiders to Los Angeles in 1982, Baltimore Colts to Indianapolis in 1984, St. Louis Cardinals to Tempe in 1988, Los Angeles Rams to St. Louis in 1994, Los Angeles Raiders to Oakland in 1994, Cleveland Browns to Baltimore in 1996, and Houston Oilers to Nashville in 1997.  However, during that same time period only 1 Major League Baseball franchise moved. In 2004, with the approval of Major League Baseball, the Montreal Expos became the Washington Nationals.  Why has there been stability in baseball, while National Football League teams have moved so frequently?  Unlike the NFL, Major League Baseball has an antitrust exemption which gives the league and its owners control over the movement of its teams.  When the Oakland Raiders sought to relocate to Los Angeles in 1982, the National Football League's owners voted to prevent the move. However, the courts found that the NFL's intervention was a violation of antitrust laws, and the League could do nothing to prevent the Raiders from moving.  Just 12 years later, the Raiders left Los Angeles to return to the same city and stadium it had abandoned.  If a city is incapable of supporting a team, it is understandable that a franchise would move. However, of the six cities that have seen National Football League teams leave in the last 25 years, five of those cities later received another NFL franchise.  It is clear that NFL teams are not moving because cities cannot support teams.  To address the real costs imposed on communities by the persistent and unnecessary franchise movement that wehave witnessed, I am introducing the Football Fairness Act.  The Football Fairness Act is straightforward and it is limited.  It would permit the National Football League to review and restrict its teams' movement. This should help keep the fans who support the NFL from being left out of the equation.  The Act is targeted. It limits the exemption from antitrust laws solely to the National Football League's ability to prevent the movement of its franchises. Consequently, the Act will not diminish competition.  I urge my colleague to support the Football Fairness Act and help prevent the damage done to fans and communities by frequent NFL franchise movement.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 249       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Football Fairness Act of      2007''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       The Congress finds that--       (1) National Football League teams foster a strong local      identity with the people of the cities and regions in which      they are located, providing a source of civic pride for their      supporters;       (2) National Football League teams provide employment      opportunities, revenues, and a valuable form of entertainment      for the cities and regions in which they are located;       (3) there are significant public investments associated      with National Football League facilities;       (4) it is in the public interest to encourage the National      Football League to operate under policies that promote      stability among its member teams and to promote the equitable      resolution of disputes arising from the proposed relocation      of National Football League teams; and       (5) National Football League teams travel in interstate to      compete and utilize materials shipped in interstate commerce,      and National Football League games are broadcast nationally.     SEC. 3. CLARIFICATION OF ANTITRUST LAWS RELATED TO                    RELOCATION.       It shall not be unlawful by reason of any provision of the      antitrust laws for the National Football League to enforce      rules authorizing the membership of the league to decide that      a member club of such league shall not be relocated.     SEC. 4. INAPPLICABILITY TO CERTAIN MATTERS.       (a) In General.--Nothing contained in this Act shall--       (1) alter, determine, or otherwise affect the applicability      or inapplicability of the antitrust laws, the labor laws, or      any other provision of law relating to the wages, hours, or      other terms and conditions of employment of players in the      National Football League, to any employment matter regarding      players in the National Football League, or to any collective      bargaining rights and privilege of any player union in the      National Football League;       (2) alter or affect the applicability or inapplicability of      the antitrust laws or any applicable Federal or State law      relating to broadcasting or telecasting, including section 1      of Public Law 87-331 (15 U.S.C. 1291), any agreement between      the National Football League or its member teams, and any      person not affiliated with the National Football League for      the broadcasting or telecasting of the games of the National      Football League or its member teams on any form of      television;       (3) affect any contract, or provision of a contract,      relating to the use of a stadium or arena between a member      team and the owner or operator of any stadium or arena or any      other person;       (4) exempt from the antitrust laws any agreement to fix the      prices of admission to National Football League games;       (5) exempt from the antitrust laws any predatory practice      or other conduct with respect to competing sports leagues      that would otherwise be unlawful under the antitrust laws; or       (6) except as provided in this Act, alter, determine, or      otherwise affect the applicability or inapplicability of the      antitrust laws to any act, contract, agreement, rule, course      of conduct, or other activity by, between, or among persons      engaging in, conducting, or participating in professional      football.       (b) Antitrust Laws.--As used in this section, the term      ``antitrust laws'' has the meaning given to such term in the      first section of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 12) and in the      Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 41 et seq.).                                 ______                                       By
