 President, we have an understanding with the distinguished Senator from Connecticut that at whatever point the two democratic Senators who are requesting an opportunity to be heard on the McCain amendment arrive on the Senate floor, we can go back to the McCain amendment and dispose of that. With that understanding with the distinguished Senator from Connecticut, I have no objection to temporarily laying aside the McCain amendment.
