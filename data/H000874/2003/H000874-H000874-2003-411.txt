Speaker, no poor Republican member of the Committee on Rules who was given this assignment has risen to defend this rule. Certainly the chairman of the Committee on the Budget has not.  This started out as a House joint concurrent resolution. ``Concurrent'' meant that it would be agreed upon by both sides. They have dropped the ``current'' and it is now just a ``con,'' a con on the American people, a con on this institution.  Tonight, they sound the death knell for the policy of fiscal discipline, and are poised to drive our Nation into spiralling and historic debt. They put us on the path to increased debt by more than $5.5 trillion, and then to $12 trillion.  Here is the real kicker: There will be no debate on this stealth action and there will be no vote; there will only be a swelling sea of debt that promises to drown our future prosperity.  Yes, it is a con job. Let us remember the unequivocal words of the majority leader, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay), which still reverberate throughout this Chamber. Ten years and 12 days ago, here is what he said: ``Here we are being asked to raise the debt ceiling so this government can go on borrowing money to take care of its spending habits. I think that is outrageous,'' said the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay). ``I hope the Members of this House will vote against raising the debt ceiling,'' said the gentleman from Texas, ``and I hope the American people will contact the Members of this House, Mr. Speaker, and urge them to vote against raising the debt ceiling.''  Where is the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay)? Where is he when we raise the debt by $860 billion this year and $5 trillion over the next 10? Where is the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay)?  They claim this is an economic growth package. They claimed it in 2001. We lost 2.6 million private-sector jobs, 4 million more Americans without health care, real business investment has fallen by 5.7 percent, and 2 million Americans have moved from middle class to poverty. Where is the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay)?  Have the integrity to stand up and vote for America's children and America's future. Vote down this rule. Vote down this budget.
