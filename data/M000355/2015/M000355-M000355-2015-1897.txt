 President, I would like to remind everybody these are supposed to be 10-minute rollcall votes. To the extent that you do not make it in the 10 minutes, you inconvenience everybody else. I would hope people would be respectful of their colleagues and stay close to the floor and vote during the 10 minutes.  We have actually reached a milestone here that I think is noteworthy for the Senate. We just cast our 15th rollcall vote on an amendment on this bill, which is more votes--more rollcall votes on amendments than the entire Senate in all of 2014.  I particularly want to commend Chairman Murkowski and Senator Cantwell for their fair and open process that has been engaged in. This is the way the Senate ought to work.  Now the question I know on everyone's mind is: What do we do next? Right? It is Thursday night. We have a current tranche of amendments. We are having a little difficulty getting our friends on the other side of the aisle to offer their amendments so they can be considered.  In order to consider amendments, they need to be offered. So here is where we are for the evening: We are going to finish this tranche. Chairman Murkowski is interested in setting up an additional tranche of amendments tonight. Once she has been able to set up an additional tranche of amendments for tonight, we will be able to announce the way forward for later.
