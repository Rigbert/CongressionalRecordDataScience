 In his 28 years of service with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, John Rabun has saved literally thousands of lives and averted tragedy for thousands of families.  As the very first employee of the national center since its creation back in 1984, he has been the heart and the soul of that organization. His dedication and passion for the issue will continue to shape the national center long after he leaves it. Frankly, for John, saving children was not just a job, it was his mission. That is why it is such a blow that after 28 years of service, John Rabun will retire from his work at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children this Friday, March 9. I cannot say enough how much this man will be missed.  John and I have a history that stretches back almost four decades, dating to his time as a social worker in Jefferson County, KY. Of course, Jefferson County contains the city of Louisville, my hometown, and in the late 1970s and early 1980s, I served as the judge-executive for Jefferson County. What that is, I say to the Presiding Officer from New York, is like the county executive for the county. It was in this capacity that I got to know John Rabun.  John earned his bachelor's degree from Mercer University in Macon, GA, and his master of science in social work from the University of Louisville. As a social worker, John managed the company's group home for kids and was one of the first in town to identifythe growing crisis of child abduction and sexual exploitation. Working in those foster homes, John saw the problem firsthand and saw what local police and social services were not seeing. He saw that information between social service workers and law enforcement was not being shared as it should have been. He realized a lot more could be done.  So John, along with a friend and fellow social worker, Kerry Rice, approached Ernie Allen, who at the time was the director of the Louisville-Jefferson County Crime Commission. Ernie is now known as the director and CEO of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which he helped build alongside John. But way back then, the issue of missing and exploited children had yet to receive the national focus it deserved.  It was John who proposed to Ernie that the county create a special unit bridging the traditional barriers between social services and law enforcement to try to combat this serious problem. They came to me--as the CEO of the county--with this idea, and together we created what I believe to be the first police-social services team in the Nation dedicated to working child abduction and sexual exploitation cases. Eventually, we created Jefferson County's first exploited and missing child unit, with John as its manager. Under John's leadership, almost immediately the unit began to solve cases, rescue victims, and put some very good news on the front pages.  John became famous nationwide as a leading expert on missing and exploited child cases. In 1980, the U.S. Department of Justice asked me to send John and Ernie to Atlanta to consult on a grisly child murder case. John is now so recognized as a leader in this field that he has provided expert testimony to Congress seven times on child abduction cases and has instructed for the FBI Law Enforcement Satellite Training Network. John has provided consultation at nearly 1,000 hospitals and for over 62,000 personnel in America, Canada, and the United Kingdom on the abduction of newborns in hospitals. He is the author of the book ``For Healthcare Professionals: Guidelines on Prevention of and Response to Infant Abductions.'' Thanks in large measure to his efforts, what was once a recurring problem is now all but eliminated.  John has been recognized by the FBI as 1 of only 27 investigators nationwide with the highest expertise in the investigation of cases concerning missing and exploited children. He has appeared on television shows such as ``20/20,'' ``Primetime,'' ``Good Morning America,'' ``Larry King Live,'' and, of course, ``America's Most Wanted'' with his friend and my friend, John Walsh.  In 1984, John signed the lease for office space for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children right here in Washington. He began working as that organization's executive vice president and chief operating officer. It is a post he has held ever since. As the National Center's executive vice president and COO, John manages a staff of 350 and a budget of $42 million a year. He is the hub of the wheel for all interagency communication between the center, the Justice Department, the State Department, the Secret Service, the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, as well as State governments.  When I say John Rabun has a great passion and drive on this issue that has animated his entire career, I mean it. He is absolutely dedicated to rescuing children who would otherwise fall through the cracks.  Back when he was running the Jefferson County Crime Unit, John led the effort to successfully identify and prosecute the pastor of a major local church for sexually abusing over one dozen children in his congregation. After this pastor's conviction, the judge shockingly sentenced him merely to probation with a community service requirement. John leapt from the prosecutor's table and cried: ``Your Honor, will you at least stipulate that this community service not be with children?'' The judge held John in contempt of court. Luckily, the prosecutor quickly scurried John out through a side door before he could be taken into custody and after a few days the heat died down. But this story goes to illustrate how John will stop at literally nothing to see justice is done for those who are weakest among us, our children.  John's lifetime of service to children has directly led to the rescue of over 80,000 kids. Let me share with my colleagues just one success story. About 1 year ago, a Los Angeles police detective contacted the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children for information on a 10-year-old boy who had been missing for many years. In 2004, the child's parents separated, and although the mother received custody, her son was abducted from their home. A search began for the boy and his father, which continued for 7 years. Law enforcement had no leads on the child's whereabouts, suspecting the father may have abducted him back to his native country of Guatemala. Upon receiving the call from that Los Angeles detective, the National Center's case management team began coordinating the center's resources with the child's mother and detectives in the Los Angeles Police Department. A missing child poster was created and disseminated around California, and detectives were provided with detailed public database searches throughout the National Center's case analysis division.  Just a little over 1 month ago, the center received a lead from a school official who believed he had recognized the boy as a fifth grader at a Los Angeles elementary school. This official had searched the center's Web site, saw the missing child's poster, and contacted the center's 24-hour hot line. The center passed this lead along to police, and I am pleased to say that on January 31 of this year, 8 years after his abduction, this boy was reunited with his mother, and his father was arrested.  Imagine that mother's relief and then multiply that feeling by literally thousands. Only then can we begin to appreciate the immense service John Rabun has done for his country. So that is why we are all going to miss John so much. No one can say he could have done more; however, neither could anyone say his retirement is not extremely well deserved. I am sure he is looking forward to being able to spend more time with his lovely wife Betsy, a retired schoolteacher, and their two children and five grandchildren.  A national movement on behalf of America's most precious resource, our children, was launched because one social worker in Louisville, KY, saw that too many children were at risk and not enough was being done. If every family impacted by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children's work could thank John Rabun personally, it might take another 28 years, and he would never get to retire. But on behalf of a grateful and safer America, I hope the recognition of this Senate and the thanks and friendship of this Senator will suffice instead. So thank you very much, John Rabun.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
