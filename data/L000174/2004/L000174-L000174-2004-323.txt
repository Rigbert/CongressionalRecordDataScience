President, the dedication of the long overdue World War II Memorial is a moment in time that we will always remember.  I am so pleased that many Vermont veterans from the WWII will be on hand for this solemn, and triumphant, occasion.  No monument--even one so grandly placed as this gleaming tribute in stone is, between the Washington and Lincoln Monuments--can fully capture the full enormity of the service and sacrifice of the 16 million soldiers, sailors, airmen and others who served in uniform during those 5 years of war and struggle. Yet with its marble expanse, majestic pillars, and carefully chiseled engravings, this memorial will forever stand as a symbol of the Nation's appreciation for those who served and for those who made the ultimate sacrifice.  World War II was truly an epic struggle. It was a struggle that would determine the very direction of humanity, whether militarism and Nazism would supplant freedom and democracy. Every American soldier understood the purpose and the stakes of that war. They unwaveringly answered the call to duty, they won the war, they returned home, and then the greatest generation soldiered on further to also win the peace.  We in Vermont often pride ourselves on our healthy skepticism of centralized government. Yet we are early and arduous in rallying to the Nation's defense in disproportionate numbers to our relatively small population, from the Civil War onward. In World War II nearly 50,000 men from the State of Vermont fought the axis powers. More than 1,200 Vermonters lost their lives in the war. At home and overseas, Vermont women also made great contributions to the war effort, and 1,400 of them served with our armed forces.  Today a new generation of veterans is being minted. I have had the honor of meeting many of the young men and women who are serving in Afghanistan and Iraq. These soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines tell me time and time again that they look over their shoulders to take pride and courage in the examples set by our World War II veterans, as well as our veterans from more recent wars.  On behalf of all Vermonters, as an American citizen, and as a member of one of several grateful generations, I welcome our proud veterans to Washington on the occasion of the dedication of the World War II Memorial. We thank you for all that you have done, and our Nation will forever honor your sacrifices.  We cannot thank you enough, but we can, and we will, always remember.                          ____________________
