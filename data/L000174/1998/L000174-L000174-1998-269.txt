President, parliamentary inquiry. There may have been another unanimous consent request when I was off the floor.  If somebody had sought recognition and yielded time for that person to speak, they do not call the quorum call, and nobody else seeks recognition subsequent to their speaking, does the time continue to run against whoever had been yielded time?
