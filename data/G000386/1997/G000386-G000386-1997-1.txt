 President, I would like to acknowledge the accomplishments of J. Gary Mattson, of Waterloo, IA. Gary is an individual who has shown a great dedication to supporting people with disabilities, strengthening families, and serving his community.  Gary is a leader in the field of helping people with disabilities, especially during his 29 years of service with Exceptional Persons, Inc. Exceptional Persons is a private, nonprofit organization in Waterloo, IA that provides a wide range of services to those with disabilities including residential and family services, as well as child care. For the last 14 years, Gary has served as its executive director.  Gary brings a deep passion to his work, reflected by the fact that the people served by Exceptional Persons always come first.  Black Hawk County and its communities and people, especially those who have disabilities and their families, have benefited from his caring commitment. I salute the work Gary has done on behalf of disabled individuals and his community. I wish him the best and I encourage those who know Gary to use his years of dedication as a role model for public service.                          ____________________
