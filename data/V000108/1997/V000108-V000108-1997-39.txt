Speaker, it is my distinct pleasure to congratulate The Times newspaper as it celebrates its receipt of two first-place and two third-place honors in the Hoosier Press Association's 1996-97 Ad Award Contest. The Times has also been named the Hoosier State Press Association's ``Blue Ribbon Newspaper of the Year'' for 4 consecutive years.  In the highly competitive field of newspaper advertising, garnering two first-place and two third-place honors serves as a testament to the outstanding quality of The Times, its close-knit relationship to the community, and the high caliber of its staff. The award winning Times staff includes: Betty Durochik, Lisa Tatina, Dan Lavin, Kathy Campbell, Mary Alexander, Cindy Carstenson, and Mike Scamihorn. Betty Durochik and Lisa Tatina took first-place honors in the miscellaneous category of the Hoosier Press Association's contest for their work on the ``Home for the Holidays'' advertisement section. Dan Lavin and Kathy Campbell received first-place honors in the Special Projects, Promotion or Special Sections that have one common theme category for ``Calumet City's Retail Dining Directory.'' Cindy Carstenson and Mike Scamihorn received third-place honors for ``Taste of Chocolate'' Recipe Cards in the best Non-Inserted Promotion category. Betty Durochik, Lisa Tatina, and Mary Alexander placed third for ``Welcome to Schererville'' in the Downtown Council, Shopping Center or Community-wide Group of Merchants category. The Times was judged in the division for newspapers with a circulation of greater than 10,000 by members of the Ohio Newspaper Advertising Executives Association.  The Hoosier Press Association's 1996-97 Ad Award Contest demonstrates a continuation of the proud and outstanding journalistic tradition upon which The Times was founded. The newspaper's maintenance of this strong tradition is especially evident in its receipt of the Hoosier State Press Association's ``Blue Ribbon Newspaper of the Year Award'' for 4 consecutive years. Earning this award has given The Times the distinction of being one of Indiana's finest newspapers.  Founded in June of 1906, The Times was established by Canadian stock and grain operations industrialist, Sidmon McHie, to serve as a vital source of local information for Northwest Indiana. Originally called the ``Lake County Times,'' the newspaper was based in downtown Hammond on Fayette Street and Hohman Avenue. The paper grew and prospered over the years, and its name was changed to The Hammond Times in 1933. In 1967, with the addition of a bureau in South Lake County, the paper's name was changed to The Times. Ownership of The Times continued in the McHie family trust until May, 1962, when the paper was sold to Robert S. Howard, President and founder of Howard Publication, Inc. Under the direction of Howard Publication, The Times relocated to Munster, IN, in 1989, and currently publishes seven uniquely zoned editions.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other esteemed colleagues join me in commending The Times on its award winning performance. Through the hard work and dedication of its employees, past and present, The Times has remained true to its mission of being a vital source of information for the communities of Northwest Indiana.                          ____________________
