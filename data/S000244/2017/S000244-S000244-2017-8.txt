Speaker, today I rise along with my colleague, Rep. Gwen Moore, to celebrate the 90th Birthday of Wisconsin State Senator Fred Risser on May 5, 2017. Born in Madison, Wisconsin in 1927, Mr. Risser was elected to Wisconsin's Assembly in 1956 and the Senate in 1962. He is currently the nation's longest-serving state legislator, and shows no sign of slowing down anytime soon.  Born and raised in Madison, Senator Risser is the fourth generation of his family to serve in the Wisconsin Legislature. His father, Fred E. Risser, grandfather, Ernest Warner, and great-grandfather Clement Warner, were all dedicated public servants.  Mr. Risser joined the Navy just prior to his 18th birthday. Trained as a medic, Mr. Risser spent time in Newport, R.I., then in Panama before he returned to the United States. Mr. Risser was educated in the Madison public schools, and then used the GI Bill to attend Carleton College and the University of Wisconsin-Madison (where he earned a B.A.), andthe law school of the University of Oregon. He then practiced law with his father before entering public service.  Wisconsin is fortunate to have a great leader like Fred Risser. Throughout his extraordinary career, he has served his constituents and his community diligently. It is our great honor to join Fred's wife Nancy, children and grandchildren, his many friends, and our colleagues in the House of Representatives, in wishing Fred a happy 90th birthday--and many more years.                          ____________________
