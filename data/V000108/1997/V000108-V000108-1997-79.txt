Speaker, art is the expression of the human spirit throughout its greatest moments of tragedy and triumph. The people of the Republic of Armenia have survived some of modern history's most horrific acts of genocide and repression, yet their spirit survives and their art celebrates that survival.  Two residents of Indiana's First Congressional District, Dr. Raffy and Vicki Hovanessian of Munster, IN, are national leaders in private humanitarian efforts that distinguish the United States and enrich our relationships with modern nations, such as Armenia. Mrs. Hovanessian has recently focused her efforts on the organization of a month-long art show, entitled ``Dreams and Visions,'' which begins tomorrow, April 30, at the Westin Hotel in Chicago, IL. The show will celebrate the talent and resilience of contemporary Armenian artists. Artists, whose works will be exhibited, include: Achot Achot, Garen Andreassian, Caren Arakelian, Arevig Arevshadian, Manuel Baghdassarian, Samuel Baghdassarian, Ashod Bayandour, Mardin Bedrossian, Arman Grigorian, Reuben Gregorian, Sardis Hamalbashian, Samuel Hampartsoumian, Ara Hovsepian, Hovannes Markarian, Garine Matsakian, Arax Nergararian, Arthur Sarkissian, Ararat Sarkissian, Gagig Tchartchan, and Felix Yeghiazarian.  Under the auspices of the Fund for Armenian Relief, the humanitarian aid agency of the Diocese of the Armenian Church, the above-mentioned artists will directly benefit from the proceeds of this show. The proceeds will provide an opportunity for the artists of the Republic of Armenia to participate in the Documenta at Kassel, Germany, in June of this year. The Documenta is an international art show held every five years.  The art show planned by Mrs. Hovanessian is entitled ``Dreams and Visions,'' since the contemporary works symbolize the aspirations of the people of Armenia as viewed through the spectacular imaginative prisms of these artists' talents, as well as show their hopeful vision for a new era of peace in our time. Their art illustrates the unquenchable, creative human capacity for reconciliation and rebuilding.  The art show will demonstrate, in an exemplary manner, the solidarity of the Armenian people for their country and its culture, which is passing through one of its most decisive and crucial periods in history. Currently, Armenia is experiencing the effects of emancipation from the oppressive rule under the Soviet Union and entry into the democratic system of a free and independent republic. Culture is surely one of the most effective ways of enhancing and promoting this positive and radical change in the centuries old life of the Armenian people.  Over the years, the Hovanessians have devoted countless hours and resources toward a variety of charitable works, both in the United States and Armenia, with the goal of improving the quality of life for native Armenians, as well as Armenian-Americans. One of the notable causes for which they have worked is the Saint Neresses Seminary in New Rochelle, NY, which sponsors an exchange program between the United States and Armenia for new seminarians. The Hovanessians have aided in raising $1 million for Saint Neresses. In addition, under the auspices of His Holiness Karekin I, Catholicos of All Armenians and Supreme Patriarch of the Armenian Church, Dr. and Mrs. Hovanessian have recently been appointed by the Armenian Church and government to chair museum exhibitions commemorating the 1700th anniversary of Armenians' acceptance of Christianity.  Mr. Speaker, it is my distinct honor to convey the gratitude and respect I and others have for the leadership of Dr. Raffy and Vicki Hovanessian in devoting themselves to contemporary artistic expression in Armenia and other notable humanitarian causes.                          ____________________
