Leader, it is my understanding there has not been an agreement yet, but if there were an agreement and, from our perspective, if the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey) and our conferees believe that the conference report was something that they could sign off on, it is my understanding that it is possible, if there were agreement, that we would not have to have a vote tomorrow on that piece of legislation; is that correct?  Mr. DeLAY. If the gentleman would continue to yield, it would be beneficial to all Members if we could come to some agreement on the bill. I know that the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey) and the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Young) have worked very, very hard to protect the interests of the House and this institution, and they are remaining firm. And we should congratulate the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey) and the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Young) for the work they have done.  If it works to the satisfaction of those two Members and this body, it would be very preferable to work out some sort of agreement that we could voice the vote; but I must warn Members that it does not guarantee that there will not be a vote.
