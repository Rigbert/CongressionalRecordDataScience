Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 248) honoring the life and work of Simon Wiesenthal and reaffirming the commitment of Congress to the fight against anti-Semitism and intolerance in all forms, in all forums, and in all nations, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:                            H. Con. Res. 248       Whereas Simon Wiesenthal, who was known as the ``conscience      of the Holocaust'', was born on December 31, 1908, in      Buczacz, Austria-Hungary, and died in Vienna, Austria, on      September 20, 2005, and he dedicated the last 60 years of his      life to the pursuit of justice for the victims of the      Holocaust;       Whereas, during World War II, Simon Wiesenthal worked with      the Polish underground and was interned in 12 different      concentration camps until his liberation by the United States      Army in 1945 from the Mauthausen camp;       Whereas, after the war, Simon Wiesenthal worked for the War      Crimes Section of the United States Army gathering      documentation to be used in prosecuting the Nuremberg trials;       Whereas Simon Wiesenthal's investigative work and expansive      research was instrumental in the capture and conviction of      more than 1,000 Nazi war criminals, including Adolf Eichmann,      the architect of the Nazi plan to annihilate European Jewry,      and Karl Silberbauer, the Gestapo officer responsible for the      arrest and deportation of Anne Frank;       Whereas numerous honors and awards were bestowed upon Simon      Wiesenthal, including the Congressional Gold Medal, honorary      British Knighthood, the Dutch Freedom Medal, the French      Legion of Honor, the World Tolerance Award, and the Jerusalem      Medal;       Whereas the Simon Wiesenthal Center was founded in 1977 in      Los Angeles and named in honor of Simon Wiesenthal to promote      awareness of anti-Semitism, monitor neo-Nazi and other      extremist groups, and help bring surviving Nazi war criminals      to justice;       Whereas, in 1978, inspired in part by the work of Simon      Wiesenthal, the Congress enacted a law to deny citizenship      and Federal benefits to former Nazis, and the Office of      Special Investigations of the Department of Justice has since      conducted more than 1,500 investigations, won 101 cases, and      blocked the immigration of 170 individuals, and the work of      the Office continues;       Whereas, in keeping with the efforts of Simon Wiesenthal,      many governments have responded to the growing tide of anti-     Semitism worldwide, elected leaders have spoken out against      anti-Semitism, and law enforcement officials and prosecutors      have aggressively pursed the perpetrators of anti-Semitic      acts; and       Whereas Simon Wiesenthal's legacy teaches that the      perpetrators of genocide cannot and will not be allowed to      hide from their crimes: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate      concurring),  That the Congress--       (1) honors the life and work of Simon Wiesenthal to      memorialize the victims of the Holocaust and to bring the      perpetrators of crimes against humanity to justice;       (2) reaffirms its commitment to the fight against anti-     Semitism and intolerance in all forms, in all forums, and in      all nations; and       (3) urges all members of the international community to      facilitate the investigation and prosecution of surviving      Nazi war criminals and to continue documenting and collecting      information on Nazi war crimes for archival and historical      purposes.
