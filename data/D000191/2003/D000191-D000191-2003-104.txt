Chairman, I do not rise to offer this amendment because I believe that the General Investigations Account is overfunded. In fact, I believe the entire Corps budget is way underfunded when we look at the real infrastructure needs of the United States. I appreciate the fact that the committee and the House have found $288 million more than the President proposed, but it is still $156 million less than last year, and all across the country we have locks and dams and jetties failing.  In particular, in my own district we have a dam at Fern Ridge which is more than 50 years old which is on the verge of catastrophic failure. The Corps has lowered the level of water behind the dam. They say that at any moment they may have to dewater the reservoir. And when the reservoir is dewatered, we lose both the extraordinary recreation benefits of one of the most heavily recreated lakes in Oregon, the revenues that flow from that recreation, but we also lose the flood control. And just a few years ago this dam was vital when we had a wet winter, and they are now predicting that we again are going to have a wet winter. So if the dam just fails a little bit more, we are going to lose all the flood control capability and all of the recreational attributes, and the Corps of my region says they just will not have the money until the year 2006 to fix this dam.  That is not acceptable. We cannot have dams that are failing and say, come back in 3 years and, by the way, if they have a 100-year flood in the interim, they are out of luck. We will have hundreds of millions of downstream damage, and I guess then Federal flood insurance will pay for it out of a different pocket than the pocket out of which we are appropriating this bill.  So my intention in offering this amendment is not to criticize the committee or the Corps or any of these budgets, but to raise the point that the O Account, which goes to issues like the failing Fern Ridge Dam, goes to the dredging of the small ports along the southern Oregon coast, is woefully underfunded.  I also understand that a point of order may lie against this amendment.
