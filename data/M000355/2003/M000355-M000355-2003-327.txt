 Under the previous order, there will be 1 hour of debate prior to the vote on the nomination. The vote on the Leavitt nomination, therefore, will occur at around 10:30 a.m. tomorrow. That vote will be the first vote of the day.  Following the disposition of the Leavitt nomination, the Senate will resume debate on the foreign operations appropriations bill. There are several amendments pending that have been laid aside. As the chairman of that subcommittee, the manager of that bill, it is our hope and expectation--and I know I speak for Senator Leahy when I say this--that we will wrap up the foreign operations bill sometime tomorrow night. There is really not a flood of amendments on either side, and there is no reason we should not be able to march on through that bill tomorrow and finish it up tomorrow night.  Therefore, Senators obviously should expect rollcall votes throughout the day tomorrow.                      ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M. TOMORROW  Mr. McCONNELL. If there is no further business to come before the Senate, I ask that the Senate stand in adjournment under the previous order.  There being no objection, the Senate, at 7:37 p.m., adjourned until Tuesday, October 28, 2003, at 9:30 a.m.                          ____________________
