President, I wish to say a few words about a friend of mine who passed away on Saturday. His name was Jim Jontz. For 6 years, from 1987 to 1993, Jim represented Indiana's fifth congressional district in the House of Representatives. That is where I first met him and worked with him.  In 1991, the Almanac of American Politics described him as:       One of the most incredibly hardworking and gifted natural      politicians who has routinely done the impossible.  Two years ago Jim was diagnosed with colon cancer that had already spread to his liver. We hoped at the time he would find a way to ``do the impossible'' again and defeat this illness. He fought that cancer for 2 valiant years, but he died on Saturday afternoon in his home in Portland, OR.  Jim Jontz defied ordinary stereotypes. He was a progressive Democrat elected three times by one of the most conservative areas in the country to represent them in Congress. People used to wonder all the time how that was possible. I have some ideas. For one thing, Jim had a flair for trademarks. He was famous for riding his sister's rusty blue Schwinn with mismatched tires in parades.  Jim also practiced a very personal style of politics--something he learned from his days as a grassroots organizer. He ran what he called ``shoe leather'' campaigns. His goal in every campaign was to knock on as many doors and speak to as many people as possible. He owned four pairs of shoes that he rotated in and out of at a local repair shop every week. That is how much shoe leather he put into his job. His campaign signs were always shaped like shoes.  Most importantly, Jim Jontz was a bridge builder.
