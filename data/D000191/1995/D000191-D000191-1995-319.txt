Speaker, I rise in this hiatus in the debate for the Balanced Budget Amendment and the unfunded mandates to discuss something that I think is most appropriate. That is the reform of the welfare programs and the hunger programs in our Nation.  Mr. Speaker, I certainly do not rise to say that the current system is perfect. There is a lot of need for improvement and reform. However, the question is, if we look at the Republican Contract for America and we look at their provisions regarding welfare reform and hunger programs, I am afraid that in a rush to enact that contract, that the Republican leadership has targeted a powerless, pretty much nonvoting population: America's hunger, their children, their families.  What they are proposing is not a solution to hunger and poverty, or a better way to do it, but block grants that may ultimately expand hunger problems in America, and in fact shift costs to the States. This is not reform, this is denial. This is shifting responsibilities from the Federal Government to the State government, something I thought we were going to stop doing around here.  I challenge our new leadership to end hunger and poverty, not the programs that feed hungry families and their children. Republicans are passing the burden of responsibility and the price tag to the States. My State alone, Oregon, under their proposal would be handed the programs for poverty and hunger, currently federally assisted programs, with $64 million less than in 1996 to solve the problem. How is that going to help the State of Oregon?  However, the Republicans have a solution for that, too. Their unfunded mandates legislation has an effective date of next October. You know why the effective date is next October? Because they know they have hidden bombs in the Contract for America, huge new unfunded mandates for the States, cuts in successful State programs.  However, they don't want to apply the unfunded mandates legislation before or during the adoption of the Contract on America, particularly those provisions that go to welfare and hunger, because they know this is their intention, to shift costs to the States, not to look at a way of improving these programs so we can better combat this problem.  In a nation number one in the industrialized nations in defense spending, national wealth, and the number of billionaires, I think it is a pretty sad commentary on our priorities that we are also number one in child and elderly poverty and hunger.  Many of our anti-hunger programs were enacted in the 1960's and 1970's in response to a documented wide range of problems of malnutrition. These programs have in good part worked. We have decreased the incidence of infant mortality and low birth weight babies. We have improved necessary nutrition food intake, both for our children and elderly, by 20 to 40 percent.  Mr. Chairman, if we want to take, say, the hardest-hearted green eyeshade view of this issue, there is another way to look at it. These programs save the American taxpayers money. They not only improve the quality of life for the next generation, but they save money. Every dollar that is invested in the WIC program saves up to $4 in Medicaid savings, and a whole lot of other funds for the States in terms of special education programs [[Page H663]] and other things that would be necessary if we were dealing with a new epidemic of low birth weight babies.  If we are really talking about investments that make sense, if we are talking about reforms that make sense, then we should be putting more money into this program, not less. However, that is not in the contract.  We often have these academic debates around here, and it sometimes helps to put a little bit of a face on it. My background is in gerontology. I have worked with senior citizens. I have seen seniors--people who have given their whole lives, raised a couple of generations, their kids, their grandkids, and worked and worked and worked, and are living on a small Social Security--I have seen them cry when I brought them a hot meal, because it was the only hot meal that they had had in days.  Are we going to end these programs? Are we going to turn back the clock? The Contract would, or it will say, ``Well, we are going to give a block grant to the States, but we are going to cut the funding.'' How are the States going to pick up that additional burden? If the Contract is honest, then the Contract will adopt the unfunded mandates legislation tomorrow so we know what costs we are shifting to the States next year.                          ____________________
