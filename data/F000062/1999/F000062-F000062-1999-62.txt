 President. I rise today in recognition of ``National Women's Business Week'' and of the vital role women business-owners play in our economy.  I would also like to recognize the appointment of Vivian L. Shimoyama to the National Women's Business Council. Ms. Shimoyama is the Founder and President of Breakthru Unlimited, a California company that designs and manufactures projects with a message: hand-made glass artwork of jewelry, executive gifts, limited editions, and custom awards. A brilliant sample of her work is her ``Breaking the Ceiling'' line of jewelry that has adorned the lapels of Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Dole. Currently, she serves as the Chair of the National Association of Women Business Owners--Los Angeles. In 1999, she was honored as the Small Business Administration's ``Women Business Advocate of the Year''.  Ms. Shimoyama runs one of the 1.2 million women-owned businesses headquartered in California. According to a study by the National Foundation for Women Business Owners (NFWBO), these businesses employ 3.8 million workers and generate $548 billion in annual sales, a growth of 164 percent in seven years.  Without a doubt, women entrepreneurs have played a crucial part in the growth of our economy. NFWBO reports that between 1987 and 1999, the number of women-owned firms increased by 103 percent nationwide, employment increased by 320 percent, and sales increased by 436 percent. As of 1999, there are 9.1 million women-owned businesses in the U.S., which employ 27.5 million people and generate over $3.6 trillion in sales. To put the sales of these businesses into context, they are twice the size of the Federal budget, and greater than the Gross National Product of every country in the world but the United States and Japan.  An increasing number of these businesses have focused on emerging industries such as high technology. These businesses demand a greater access to capital and information resources than ever before.  Mr. President, I will do all I can to ensure that the women in my state and all over the country have access to the opportunities and resources they need to start new business ventures. However it is also imperative that we invest in the business development resources that will help women sustain and grow these new businesses. This small investment yields big returns in the form of job creation, revenues, and overall growth of the nation's economy.                          ____________________
