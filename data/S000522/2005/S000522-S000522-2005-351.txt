Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time.  Mr. Speaker, we meet tonight under extraordinary circumstances, and I for one am very grateful to the Speaker and majority leader Delay for bringing us back because a much-loved disabled woman in Florida has been ordered to die by starvation and dehydration. We meet tonight because Terri Schiavo's family, including her parents, Bob and Mary Schindler, refuse to allow their precious daughter, who is not in a coma nor is she terminally ill nor is she in a persistent vegetative state, to be killed by starving her to death.  Disabled people deserve no less than everyone else deserves, to have their fundamental human rights protected and properly asserted. We meet here tonight because there are serious questions whether Terri Schiavo's estranged husband, Michael, who has abandoned Terri for another woman and has had two kids with the other woman, could be trusted as a legal guardian for a woman for whom he has sought death for many years.  Let us not forget she has been in a hospice for 5 years. My mother was in a hospice. She had terminal brain cancer and was dying. One goes into a hospice when they are in the process of dying. Terri was not dying.  Mention was made earlier by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Wexler) that everyone agrees that Terri is in a persistent vegetative state. That's not true. Let me remind my colleagues that no less than 14 independent medical professionals, including six neurologists, have said she is not in a persistent vegetative state.  Let me also point out to my colleagues Dr. William Hammesfahr, an M.D., board certified neurologist from Clearwater, Florida has testified, and he has signed an affidavit as recently as March 6 of this year, and he has said Ms. Schiavo is not in a persistent vegetative state. He goes on to point out that she could benefit, and I will include this full statement in the Record, from medical interventions that are available right now as we meet, she could be getting therapies, medical and otherwise, that would make her situation all that much better. All of that has been denied to her. She has sat in a hospice to languish denied these basic medical provisions and procedures that could enhance her life.  I would hope that we would vote for this legislation.  The material previously referred to is as follows:               Declaration of William M. Hammesfahr, M.D.       I, William M. Hammesfahr, M.D. have personal knowledge of      the facts states in this Declaration and, if called as a      witness, I could and would testify competently thereto under      oath.       I declare as follows:       1. I am a Board-certified neurologist in private practice      in Clearwater, Florida. My curriculum vitae is attached to      this declaration.       2. I have previously filed affidavits and testified in the      matter involving Terri Schiavo.       3. I have personally examined Terry Schiavo, reviewed her      available medical records, and reviewed her CT can. When I      last reviewed her CT scan I noted that Ms. Schiavo had      significant brain tissue. She has a large amount of viable      brain tissue in her cerebellum space and cerebral      hemispheres, not just scar tissue or spinal fluid.       4. I have previously testified, and I am still of the      opinion, that Ms. Schiavo is not in a persistent vegetative      state.       5. Further, Ms. Schiavo had the ability to swallow. When I      examined her approximately two years ago, she was not PVS of      MCS, she was in an alert state, able to follow commands, able      to respond to language, and able to swallow.       6. Her condition of hypoxic emcephalopathy is a type of      stroke. It is a condition I routinely treat with therapy,      sometimes 50 and 60 years, after the injury. She is only 15      years past the injury. We routinely see major improvements      within the first six months of treating such patients. Terri      Schiavo deserves to have the benefit of further treatment.       7. There have been new advances in medical evaluation and      treatment for patients like Terri Schiavo even in just the      past few years. For example, in November of 2003. Judge Susan      Kirkland of the Florida Department of Health validated the      treament I have been providing victims of stroke by      identifying me, during her ruling, ``the first physician to      treat patients successfully to restore deficits caused by      stroke.'' With my therapy, there is improvement of blood flow      to the brain.       8. There are other therapies that could benefit Terri      Schiavo, such as Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy, and nutritional      therapy, that all have high success rates, and these should      be tried on Terri.       9. As a patient, Terri Schiavo is not in that bad of a      condition to begin with. We treat many patients who are a lot      worse. There are a lot of therapies out there that will very      likely improve her condition, and they all compliment each      other, so if you do them all in a series, she could get a lot      better.       10. Without a doubt, I observed Terri swallow. At a      previous hearing for Terri, all five physicians who examined      her agreed and testified that she can swallow. We know that      because the body makes approximately 2 liters of saliva and      post-nasal drainage a day and if she can swallow that, which      she can because she swallows her saliva, then she can swallow      food.       11. I believe that it is wrong and medically unethical to      remove Terri Schiavo's feeding tube and derive her of food      and water. At the very least, further swallowing tests should      be done, and swallowing therapy used, so that Terri can feed      herself, without the use of the current feeding tube.       I declare under the penalty of perjury under the laws of      the State of Florida that the foregoing is true and correct.       Executed this 06 day of March 2005, in Clearwater, Florida.                                       William M. Hammesfahr, M.D.     Declarant.                                  ____              Declaration of William Maxfield, M.D., FACNM       I, William Maxfield, M.D., FACNM, have personal knowledge      of the facts stated in this declaration and, if called as a      witness, I could and would testify competently thereto under      oath. I declare as follows:       1. I am a medical doctor and licensed in Florida and      several other states.       2. I have extensive experience in treatment of stroke,      multiple sclerosis, brain trauma, cerebral palsy, other      cognitive diseases and congenital problems such as ataxia-     telangectasia as well as many other diseases that are treated      with Hyperbaric Oxygen     Therapy (HBOT). My experience in imaging and hyperbaric      medicine provide a unique background for my work in      developing protocols to diagnose and treat conditions that      may benefit from hyperbaric oxygen therapy, such as the      current condition of Terri Schiavo.       3. A copy of my 20-page curriculum vitae is attached to      this declaration.       4. In May of 2002, I previously evaluated Terri Schiavo. I      reviewed supplied medical records, personally observed and      evaluated Ms. Schiavo on two separate days at the request of      attorney Pat Anderson, who was involved in the case at that      time.       5. When I evaluated Ms. Schiavo I observed that she was      able to swallow at that time. She swallowed her saliva. She      didn't drool her saliva like a patient would if they could      not swallow.       6. Based on my observation that Ms. Schiavo can swallow, I      believe that she deserves the opportunity to see if she could      sustain her life by swallowing food and water. I recommend      that she receive further swallowing testing, and the right to      sustain her life by eating and drinking on her own.       7. During my personal observation of Ms. Schiavo, I saw her      respond to music and to her family by grimacing, moving and      smiling, and turning her head. She could not move her body      very much at that time, because of stiff joints, but she      turned her head toward her family and looked at them. She      would follow balloons around the room to a great degree.      These behaviors, in my opinion, are not consistent with a      Persistent Vegetative State (PVS), but are those of Minimally      Conscious State (MCS).       8. There have been medical advances in the evaluation and      treatment of patients like Ms. Schiavo even in just the past      several years and since the last time that I examined her.      For example, these advances include further documentation of      the neurological response to HBOT and now the developing      field of Hypoxia Imagining. Having just a normal MRI or CAT      Scan is not enough for a patient like Ms. Schiavo. I would      recommend Ms. Schiavo have a SPECT brain scan before and      after HBOT. There is a data demonstrating an improved SPECT      brain scan after one or a few HBOT sessions can provide a      significant correlation as to response from a full course of      HBOT. We can then determine if there is improvement in the      pattern of her brain, and predict if additional hyperbaric      treatment would produce improvement. Ms. Schiavo deserves to      receive the benefit of this advance in medical evaluation and      treatment. I have worked with many patients who have shown      marked cognitive improvement with HBOT. Documentation is      available upon request.       9. When I observed Ms. Schiavo, I noted that she did not      interact with me, but she did interact with her mother and      father. She does not respond to other strangers. She does      respond to people she knows and this is not something a      person in a PVS state would be able to do. I base this      opinion on my 30 years of practice in radiation therapy, and      as medical director for a hospice program, where I have dealt      with many patients who are in a PVS state.       10. In my opinion Terri Schiavo is MCS, because if she was      PVS, she would not respond to the stimuli around her,      including the music. In my opinion, she is in a vegetative      state.       11. Without out a doubt, Terri does respond and she does      swallow her own saliva. If she can do that, then, in my      opinion, she can swallow liquids.       I declare under the penalty or perjury under the laws of      the State of Florida that the foregoing is true and correct.       Executed this 6 day of March 2005, in Odessa, Florida.                                     Wiliam Maxfield, M.D., PACNM,                                                        Declarant.
