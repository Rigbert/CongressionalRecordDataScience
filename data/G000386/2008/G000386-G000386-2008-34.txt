  Maybe my colleague from Iowa heard that about 2 or 3 days ago, there was an announcement by the FBI that they were investigating four of these institutions. If the FBI thinks something is wrong, you might not be far off that something is bad and needs to be investigated.  I wish to put my remarks this morning in the perspective of what I have been saying since June and July, and then we had the August summer break, and now in September on two previous occasions. So on maybe four or five previous occasions throughout the summer, I have come to the floor to speak about the differences of the tax policies of the two candidates for President. I come for that same purpose today.  But I wish to also say that my purpose in coming is twofold--one, so that people will pay more attention to the tax policies of the two Presidential candidates and consider those tax policies in light of some of the history I have brought to their attention, the history from a couple of standpoints: what had been said in previous elections and then what actually happened after those Presidents were sworn in, and maybe it was not exactly as they said it was in the Presidential election. So take that into consideration during this election.
