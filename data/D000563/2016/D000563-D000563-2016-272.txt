President, southern Illinois lost a legend and one of its brightest lights. Last week, Barbara Brown passed away at the age of 61. Barbara was blessed with every God-given gift one could ask for: intelligence, strength, compassion, kindness--just to name a few. She had it all.  She was a remarkable woman who wore many hats during her political career: vice-chair of the Democratic Party of Illinois, precinct committeewoman, chairwoman of the Randolph County Democratic Central Committee, and treasurer for the Pierre Menard Democrat Club. She also helped found and lead the Southwestern Illinois Democratic Women and the Southern Illinois Democratic Women, two grassroots organizations working toward a more equitable representation of women in all levels of government. Barbara Brown was an exceptional leader.  Born in Red Bud, IL, Barbara spent her life working for the people of southern Illinois. In 1985, she earned her doctorate from Southern Illinois University, at Carbondale, and a love for teaching. Barbara taught political science at SIU for more than 30 years. And when she made a commitment to something, she saw it through. Barbara began playing the organ when she was 14 years old at St. Mary's Catholic Church of Ellis Grove. She became a lifelong parishioner and continued playing the organ for more than 40 years.  The highlights of her life were her family. She and her husband, Dick, had three sons: Jay, Matt, and Nate. The tribute Nate gave to his mother at her funeral service was every mother's dream: a salute to a life of values, caring, support and love.  Even outside her home, Barbara was the quintessential teacher by the book and by her example. She gave up many summers to teach classes in American Government and democracy for international students through a program funded by the U.S. State Department. Her legendary energy made her an inspirational professor and at the same time a tireless public servant. She was a trailblazer. Barbara ran for office when many women held back. She was a two-time candidate for the Illinois State Senate and a nine-time delegate to the Democratic National Convention, including playing key roles in the Presidential campaigns for Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. And from 2000-2012, Barbara Brown was the clerk of courts for Randolph County, IL.  Outside of politics, Barbara was a cofounder and president of the Illinois Women's Institute for Leadership and helped establish the American Cancer Society's Relay for Life in Randolph County. She was a force of nature. Through her many leadership roles, Barbara became a prominent voice for the rights of women, the underprivileged, and the most vulnerable in the community. And that is what public service meant to Barbara Brown. She was driven by a willingness to offer a helping hand and a caring heart.  Barbara had an amazing career and was known for many accomplishments, but I knew her as a friend, a friend to the people of southern Illinois, and an inspiration to us all. Today there is an empty space in the world without Barbara Brown. She will be missed, but not forgotten. Through the love of her former students, colleagues, friends, family, and everyone who was fortunate enough to cross her path, Barbara's spirit will always shine on southern Illinois.                          ____________________
