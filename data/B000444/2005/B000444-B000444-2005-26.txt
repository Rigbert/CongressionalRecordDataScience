 President, I have no debate or disagreement about what the Senator said. I was wondering whether the chairman and the cochair, the Democratic chair, would object to--maybe this is not the appropriate place to do it--a second-degree amendment, or an additional amendment, whatever form it would take, that would require not the intelligence community but the State Department to report to the Foreign Relations Committee on the status of their judgment as to whether we are in compliance with international treaties--their view on that matter.  I don't want to be the skunk at the family picnic. I am not trying to cause any difficulty. But it seems to me that such an approach would not in any way fly in the face of the intelligence community reporting to the Intelligence Committee. The Senator is right--historically, the various committees, including the Foreign Relations Committee, have been represented on the Intelligence Committee. I have no argument with that. I wonder whether any of my friends could respond to that concern I have raised.
