A full discussion. I think that is a worthy discussion.  I do not think the amendment that I offered in any way negates that discussion or negates the importance of having that debate. I agree with the gentleman.  With respect to the source of funding, the staff discussed it. We believe in the $9.1 million in 2007 this sum cannot be spent because of practical reasons, as the gentleman probably knows, and I think his staff agrees because we worked with his staff and with Mr. Skelton and Mr. Spratt to ensure that we were not undermining because as you know, I have been supportive of the defense system.  We believe this is such a critical issue. And as I said, the President raised the addiction. We have to transfer not only the price that the consumer is paying, which is affected by the lack of alternatives to petroleum products, and therefore, those producers of petroleum products throughout the world have us as a captive consumer and we do not have price flexibility, but also in terms of the price at the pump for our consumers.  So both from a national security standpoint and an economic standpoint, I think this was the way to go.
