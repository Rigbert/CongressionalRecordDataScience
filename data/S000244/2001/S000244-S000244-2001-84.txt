Speaker, it would be my hope that because this is the result of a preconference, the body would pass this bill unamended and send it to the Senate. The issues that would have been debated in the conference were debated in the preconference with the participants that I just mentioned. There was compromise that took place between what the Senate passed and what the House passed.  I think that this bill again is better than the bill that we passed on October 12, and I believe that it is deserving of the support of all Members of the House of Representatives.
