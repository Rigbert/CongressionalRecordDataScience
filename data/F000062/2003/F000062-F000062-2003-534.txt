 President, I rise, along with Senator Grassley, Senator Corzine, and Senator Gregg to introduce the Identity Theft Prevention Act.  This bill addresses the growing tide of identity theft cases by requiring banks, credit bureaus, and other financial institutions to take some practical steps to protect sensitive personal information.  What is identity theft? Identity theft occurs when one person uses another person's Social Security number, birth date, driver's license number, or other identifying information to obtain credit cards, car loans, phone plans or other services in the victim's name.  The criminal literally assumes the identity of the victim for illicit gain.  Identity theft has become the number one white collar crime of the new millennium, and Congress needs to make a major effort to protect Americans' personal information.  Hundreds of thousands of Americans are victimized by identity theft each year.  The personal losses as a result of these crimes are major. The average financial loss from an identity theft case is $17,000 and it takes a typical victim 18 months to restore his or her good credit.  In some cases, victims are falsely saddled with criminal records or are denied loans and other valuable financial services.  Identity theft is frighteningly easy to commit. One of my constituents, Kim Bradbury of Castro Valley, knows this too well. Kim reported that an identity thief obtained a credit card in her name through the Internet in less than 60 seconds. The false application only had her Social Security number and birth date correct.  Kim only found out she was an identity theft victim when a representative of a telemarketing company called her at home while she was feeding her one-year child. The representative told her that someone with a different address had applied for a credit card in Kim's name.  In Kim's case, it appears that her Social Security number was stolen by a fellow employee who also had stolen the identities of several dozen company employees. The thief ultimately stole over $100,000 in merchandise, including 20 cell phone accounts, via identity fraud.  All indicators suggest that the crime continues to grow at an alarming rate.  Just two months ago, Federal prosecutors announced the largest single identity theft case in U.S. history. Three individuals allegedly sold the credit and personal information of 30,000 people.  At one national credit reporting agency, consumers requested 53 percent more fraud alerts in fiscal year 2001 than fiscal year 2000.  As of December 2001, the Federal Trade Commission, FTC, Identity Theft Clearinghouse averaged more than 3,000 call-ins per week, a seven-fold increase since the clearinghouse began operation in November 1999.  The Identity Theft Prevention Act offers a series of practical steps to cut-off criminal access to sensitive consumer data.  No. 1, Credit card number truncation on receipts: first, the Identity Theft Prevention Act would require all new credit-card machines to truncate any credit card number printed on a customer receipt.  Thus, when a store gives a customer a receipt from a credit card purchase, only the last five digits of the credit card number will show.  This prevents identity thieves from stealing credit card numbers by retrieving discarded receipts.  Existing machines would have to be reprogrammed to truncate credit card numbers on receipts within four years after enactment of the legislation.  No. 2, Fraud alerts: the bill would give the Federal Trade Commission the authority to impose a fine on credit issuers who issue new credit to identity thieves despite the presence of a fraud alert on the consumer's credit file.  Too many credit card issuers are granting new cards without adequately verifying the identity of the applicant. Putting some teeth into fraud alerts will curb irresponsible granting of credit.  No. 3, Free credit reports: third, the legislation would entitle each consumer to one free credit report per year. Currently six States, Colorado, Georgia, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Vermont, have laws entitling consumers to one free credit report per year from the national credit bureaus.  According to identity theft victim advocates, identity theft is detected much earlier if consumers actively monitor their credit files. The cost of credit reports is a major obstacle to their use by consumers.  No. 4, Change of address: finally, the bill requires a credit card company to notify consumers when an additional credit card is requested on an existing credit account within 30 days of an address change request.  This provision addresses a common method of identity fraud where a criminal steals an individual's credit card number, and then obtains a duplicate card by informing the issuer of a change of address.  The Identity Theft Prevention Act requires financial institutions to implement needed precautions to prevent identity fraud and protect a person's good name.  Verifying a credit applicant's address, complying with ``fraud alerts'', and truncating credit numbers on receipts are all measures that will make it harder for criminals to engage in identity fraud.  It is appropriate and necessary for financial institutions to take these steps. These companies have a responsibility to prevent fraudsters from using their services to harm the good name of other citizens.  Morever, in this complex, information-driven society, consumers simply can't protect their good name on their own.  I strongly believe this legislation will provide desperately needed tools to combat identity theft, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to secure its passage.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 223       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Identity Theft Prevention      Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds that--       (1) the crime of identity theft has become one of the major      law enforcement challenges of the new economy, as vast      quantities of sensitive, personal information are now      vulnerable to criminal interception and misuse;       (2) in November 2002, Americans were alerted to the dangers      of identity theft when Federal prosecutors announced that 3      individuals had allegedly sold the credit and personal      information of 30,000 people, the largest single identity      theft case in United States history;       (3) hundreds of thousands of Americans are victims of      identity theft each year, resulting in an annual cost to      industry of more than $3,500,000,000.       (4) several indicators reveal that despite increased public      awareness of the crime, the number of incidents of identity      theft continues to rise;       (5) in December 2001, the Federal Trade Commission received      an average of more than 3,000 identity theft calls per week,      a 700 percent increase since the Identity Theft Data      Clearinghouse began operation in November 1999;       (6) allegations of social security number fraud increased      by 500 percent between 1998 and 2001, from 11,000 to 65,000;       (7) a national credit reporting agency reported that      consumer requests for fraud alerts increased by 53 percent      during fiscal year 2001;       (8) identity theft violates the privacy of American      citizens and ruins their good names;       (9) victims of identity theft may suffer restricted access      to credit and diminished employment opportunities, and may      spend years repairing the damage to credit histories caused      by identity theft;       (10) businesses and government agencies that handle      sensitive personal information of consumers have a      responsibility to protect this information from identity      thieves; and       (11) the private sector can better protect consumers by      implementing effective fraud alerts, affording greater      consumer access to credit reports, truncating of credit card      numbers, and establishing other prevention measures.
