 CORNYN. Yes.  Mr. McCONNELL. I was listening carefully to my friend's comments about the process by which we react to the President's nominees to the Supreme Court. Did I hear my colleague correctly, in discussing the issue of what is or is not a mainstream nominee, that Ruth Bader Ginsburg, for whom I voted--and I believe the final vote was something like 96 to 3--had at one time speculated that there might be a constitutional right to prostitution? Did she not suggest that at some point in one of her writings?
