President, yesterday I spoke at length about the situation in Bosnia. I spoke about the damage this debacle has caused to NATO, which has acted like a frightened child in the face of genocide on its borders. I said that the status quo is totally unacceptable. I also said that I believe our first responsibility is to NATO, and that NATO should be given an opportunity to redeem itself and act forcefully to protect the remaining safe havens in Bosnia.  I was encouraged by the statements of the NATO leaders after last Friday's meeting in London, when they said that NATO would respond with substantial and decisive air strikes if the Serbs attack Goradze. Then Secretary Perry and Secretary Christopher suggested that there would be a similar response to attacks against the other remaining safe havens, which I support. They also indicated that the dual-key approach, that has been such a disaster, would end. In the future, NATO commanders would decide when to strike, not U.N. bureaucrats. These assurances were major factors in my decision yesterday to oppose unilaterally lifting the embargo.  Yesterday, I said I expected to see NATO display the kind of unity and power that it should have displayed from the very beginning of this conflict. I feared that by unilaterally lifting the arms embargo, we would be undercutting our NATO allies and saying that we do not support a forceful NATO response. I believe such a decision could lead to wider war, greater suffering, and potentially endanger thousands of Americans. I believe that decisive NATO air strikes could not only turn the tide in favor of the Bosnian Moslems, it could also demonstrate the continued viability and strength of the NATO alliance.  I was therefore very concerned by the article in today's New York Times, titled ``NATO Gives UN Officials Veto on Air Strikes in Bosnia.'' That article suggests that the fatally flawed status quo regarding the dual-key policy has not changed.  Mr. President, if that article were accurate I would have had no choice but to reconsider my position on this issue. As I said yesterday, I cannot support the status quo. I needed to be convinced that the failed dual-key policy was no longer in effect, and that NATO is now fully authorized to use decisive force to deter further Serb atrocities.  Because of the questions raised by that article, I prepared to telephone U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali earlier today. I wanted his assurance that future decisions about the use of NATO air power would be made by military commanders, not U.N. bureaucrats. Shortly before I was to make that call, I was informed by our mission to the United Nations in New York that the Secretary General had issued a statement which eliminated any ambiguity about dual-key. His statement goes even further, to address the issue of NATO action to protect Bihac and Sarajevo, as well as Goradze.  It is for that reason that I ask unanimous consent that the statement by U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali be printed in the Record. His statement makes clear that the status quo is no longer in effect. Dual-key is over. A rapid, decisive response is now NATO policy.  There being no objection, the statement was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                            Press Statement        (Attributable to a Spokesman for the Secretary-General)       The Secretary-General and his advisers have concluded their      study of the letter from NATO Secretary-General Willy Claes      about the North Atlantic Council's decisions last night      relating to the use of NATO air power to deter Bosnian Serb      attacks on Gorazde.       As indicated in my earlier statement today, the Secretary-     General welcomes the commitment of the North Atlantic      Alliance to support the United Nations in the implementation      of Security Council resolutions, and looks forward to working      with NATO toward that end. He fully supports the decision      taken by the North Atlantic Council, as conveyed in      Secretary-General Claes' letter, and agrees with its      conclusion that an attack by the Bosnian Serbs on Gorazde      should be met by a firm and decisive response, including      through air strikes.       On the question of the ``dual key'', the relevant Security      Council resolutions call for close co-ordination between the      United Nations and NATO on the use of NATO air power and this      is reflected in the NATO decision. In order to streamline      decision taking within the United Nations chain of command      when the use of air power is deemed to be necessary, the      Secretary-General has decided to delegate the necessary      authority in this respect to his military commanders in the      field. He has accordingly delegated authority in respect of      air strikes, which he has hitherto retained himself, to      General Bernard Janvier, the Commander of United Nations      Peace Forces, with immediate effect. As regards close air      support, which is the use of air power to defend United      Nations personnel, the Secretary-General's Special      Representative, Mr. Yasushi Akashi, after consulting the      Secretary-General, has today delegated the necessary      authority to General Janvier, who is authorized to delegate      it further to the UNPROFOR Force Commander when operational      circumstances so require.       The Secretary-General is deeply concerned by current      attacks on Sarajevo and on the Bihac pocket and notes that      the North Atlantic Council has asked the NATO Military      Authorities, in consultation with the United Nations Peace      Forces, to formulate proposals on the possible use of air      power in these situations also.       The Secretary-General is informing the Security Council of      the measures that he is taking. He again expresses his      appreciation for the continuing close co-operation which he      enjoys with the Secretary-General of NATO. In furtherance of      co-operation between the United Nations and NATO, he has      today instructed the Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping      Operations, Mr. Kofi Annan, and the Force Commander, Gen.      Janvier, to travel to Brussels for consultations with NATO on      the operational modalities for implementing last night's      decision of the North Atlantic Council.
