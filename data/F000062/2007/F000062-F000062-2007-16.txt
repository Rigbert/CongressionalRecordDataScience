 President, I rise today to introduce ``The Emission Allowance Market Transparency Act.''  This legislation would establish necessary market oversight authorities to prevent Enron-type fraud and manipulation in the new greenhouse gas credit markets that are expected to emerge once Congress approves comprehensive climate change legislation.  The goal is simple: To prevent the same type of fraud and manipulation that occurred during the Western Energy Crisis from happening if a new greenhouse market is established.  The bill would establish transparency and anti-manipulation provisions modeled after energy markets protections that were established by the Energy Policy Act of 2005.  Additionally, the legislation includes anti-fraud provisions and limits excessive speculation. The bill would establish strong financial penalties. Each offense would result in a fine of up to $1 million and 10 years in jail.  Simply put, this legislation is a necessary and critical part of any new carbon trading markets approved by Congress.  Specifically, the legislation would require the Environmental Protection Agency to create a regulatory structure to oversee the new carbon credit markets.  This system would be parallel to the system used by the Federal Energy Regulatory Committee FERC for the electricity and natural gas markets.  The EPA would publish market price data in order to increase transparency; monitor trading for manipulation and fraud; and limit the size of speculative holdings to prevent any single trader from being able to set the price.  The bill would also prohibit traders from: reporting false information; manipulating the market; and cheating or defrauding another market participant.  Any trader who violated this Act would pay a maximum $1 million fine and spend 10 years in jail for each offense.  We believe that this will strongly discourage traders from seeking to manipulate the market.  This legislation is the key part of an effort to prevent newly emerging greenhouse gas markets from evolving without rules or regulation. These markets are coming, and we need to have the law in place to receive them.  California has passed legislation and will soon establish a cap and trade system to control carbon dioxide emissions.  Many members of the U.S. Senate support legislation, such as the Electric Utility Cap and Trade Act that I have introduced, to establish a Federal cap and trade system.  Legislation sponsored by Senators Warner and Lieberman to establish a national, economy-wide greenhouse gas cap and trade system will be marked up in the Environment and Public Works Committee this week.  If we don't set up a framework for oversight, the greenhouse gas market could turn into a wild west. The market--estimated to be worth as much as $300 billion annually--would invite the worst kind of manipulation, fraud, and abuse. The resulting volatility would affect consumer energy costs.  This is not a hypothetical. In 2000 and 2001, newly created California energy markets lacked the basic protections in this bill. The electricity and related natural gas markets emergedbefore the law caught up, and much of the manipulation that resulted, shockingly, was legal.  Enron, for instance, ran a market where only they knew the prices. Without market transparency laws, this one-sided market was legal.  Enron manipulated natural gas and electricity prices--but nothing in the Natural Gas Act or the Federal Power Act made this manipulation unlawful.  Only years later, after millions of consumers had been harmed, after billions of dollars had been lost, and after the entire west had endured an energy crisis largely fabricated by traders, did Congress act.  We were able to increase market transparency and prohibiting manipulation in natural gas and electricity markets were adopted.  The provisions finally gave a sheriff the ability to impose oversight and record-keeping.  The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, has put its new authority to good use. It has performed aggressive natural gas market oversight.  This summer it brought its first manipulation case, against Amaranth--a notorious hedge fund that allegedly manipulated natural gas prices month after month.  The Emission Allowance Market Transparency Act would establish transparency and anti-manipulation provisions mirroring the provisions from the Energy Policy Act of 2005.  Markets would be transparent, and manipulation would be illegal.  In addition, this legislation adds anti-fraud provisions and limits excessive speculation. These additional market protections are longstanding principles of the Commodity Exchange Act.  By mirroring proven market oversight mechanisms that protect market participants and consumers, this legislation would slip already broken-in regulatory concepts onto a new market.  This Nation needs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and many economists believe that a cap and trade system with a greenhouse gas market would be the most cost efficient way to guarantee emissions reductions.  The economists also tell us that markets are most efficient when buyers and sellers have complete information, no market participant can cheat another, and prices result from supply and demand, not manipulation.  That is why we need to prevent manipulation, fraud, and a lack of transparency.  So this legislation would provide buyers and sellers with complete information; and prevent manipulation, fraud, and excessive speculation.  Bottom line: this legislation is vital to protecting the market integrity of greenhouse gas emissions markets, and it should be included as part of any cap and trade legislation approved by Congress.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2423       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
