President, 40 years ago, when having a computer in your home was inconceivable and being able to hold a miniature computer in the palm of your hand was the stuff of science fiction, Gordon Moore, then a young engineer with Fairchild Semiconductor, had a revolutionary idea.  In the April 19, 1965, issue of Electronics Magazine, Moore first articulated what would come to be known as Moore's law: that the number of transistors on a computer chip would double in power approximately every 18 months but the price would actually decrease. Moore's law was revolutionary because it said that computer power improves essentially for free. Not only did this mean technology could be accessible and affordable for all Americans, it set the stage for increases in productivity unheard of since the Industrial Revolution.  Today, Moore's 40-year-old prediction is not just the thought of a dreamer, written for the benefit of a few early high-tech pioneers; it is the metronome of the technology industry. The drive to keep up with the drumbeat of Moore's law has meant unparalleled innovation in the high-tech industry. It has resulted in quality, high-paying jobs and contributed to our Nation's economic stability. The growth of computer technology in the U.S. has brought countless benefits to consumers and businesses throughout this country.  We are proud in my home State of Oregon to be part of the high-tech engine that helped build the digital economy. We are happy to be home to companies like Intel Corporation, which Moore helped found in 1974. Intel, which employs 15,500 people and has invested approximately $11 billion in Oregon, is an important contributor to our economy and an example of the impact that leadership in technology can have at the local level.  Oregon's high-tech industry continues to be a vital and growing part of the State's economy, creating jobs, fueling the growth of small and large businesses, and driving the innovation necessary to keep pace with Moore's law today.  The fulfillment of Moore's 40-year-old prediction will continue to lead to advances in virtually every aspect of our lives. It means smaller and more affordable computers, and cameras the size of pills that can be swallowed to explore our insides without surgery. It also means family and friends can overcome great distances, connecting in an instant over the digital airwaves.  Though his prediction has held true, Gordon Moore could not have foreseen the power and influence of his observation. I'm proud today to pay tribute to his contributions and recognize the impact Moore's law has had on our economy and our world.                          ____________________
