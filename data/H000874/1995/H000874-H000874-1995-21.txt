Speaker, I do not know how many Members are listening to WTOP. There is some dramatic music that comes on: ``Capital Crisis, Shutdown 2, Day 6.'' This proposes day 7 through 18, shutting down the Government by recessing from 3 days to 3 days. What kind of Alice in Wonderland are we subjecting our Federal employees and the country to?  Does anybody believe that because we recess without a continuing resolution to have the Government workers on the job, that we have somehow put pressure on the President? Or put pressure on the Congress that is going to be, as the gentlewoman said, going to go home to reality?  Believe me, nobody believes that reality is here. That is for sure. And this resolution is as far from reality as it gets. A simple continuing resolution which adopts exactly this premise but puts people back to work. That is the only difference. No greater or lesser pressure. No more balanced budget or less.  I voted for the coalition budget. I voted for the balanced budget amended. I believe that we need to balance the budget in 7 years with CBO numbers. Period. And I believe we are going to do that.  But why, my friends, do we in that process compound the deficit, destroy the morale of Federal workers, and disrupt the country? It makes no sense. It makes no common sense. As I have said so many times, it is irresponsible. Let us change our minds. Let us do the right thing. Pass a clean continuing resolution.
