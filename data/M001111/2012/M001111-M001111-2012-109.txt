 President, we are here today because unless Congress acts, the interest rate for many of our students--over 100,000 of them in my home State of Washington--is going to double in 55 days.  On July 1, the law we passed that held rates on federally subsidized Stafford loans to 3.4 percent will end, and rates are going to jump overnight to 6.8 percent. That is going to add $1,000 to the cost of loans for these young people, and it is going to be another huge strain for students and families who are already fighting to afford college and still struggling in this tough economy.  This isn't an abstract issue for me. For me it is very personal. Pell grants and student loans were what allowed my six brothers and sisters and me to go to college when my dad got sick and had to leave his job.
