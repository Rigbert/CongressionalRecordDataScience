 John Brademas, delivered an address last month in Rabat, Morocco, at a conference on ``The Dialogue of Cultures.''  The conference, sponsored by the Ministry of Culture of Morocco, focused on the relationships between the West and the Arab world.  John Brademas served in Congress, from the State of Indiana, for 22 years--1959-1981--the last 4 as House majority whip. He established a particular reputation for his leadership in writing legislation to support schools, colleges and universities, libraries and museums, the arts and humanities, and to provide services for children, the elderly, and the disabled.  A graduate of Harvard University, Dr. Brademas was a Rhodes scholar at Oxford University where he earned a Ph.D. Last year, Oxford University awarded Dr. Brademas the honorary degree of doctor of civil law, with a citation that described him as ``a man of varied talents and extraordinary energy, the most practical of academics, the most scholarly men of action.''  On leaving Congress, Dr. Brademas became president of New York University, a position he served from 1981 until 1992, when he became president emeritus, the position he now holds.  Mr. President, in light of the great importance of developments between the United States and Islamic countries, I believe my colleagues will read with interest Dr. Brademas's thoughtful address in Morocco, and I ask unanimous consent to have his remarks printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:  Remarks of Dr. John Brademas on ``Education and Culture: Forces for                       Peace in a Troubled World''       I am for several reasons honored to have been invited by      the distinguished Minister of Culture of the Kingdom of      Morocco, His Excellency, Mohamed Achaari, to take part in      this conference on the theme, ``Is the Dialogue Between      Cultures Possible?''       This is the first time I have been in Morocco, and my wife      and I have immensely enjoyed visiting the famed cities of      Casablanca, Fes and Marrakech and seeing some of the wonders      of this beautiful country.       I have to thank my friend, a brilliant and energetic      Moroccan, Karim Errouaki, for having suggested I join you      even as I am pleased to see here other friends such as Dr.      Federico Mayor, the former Director General of UNESCO;      Professors Edward Nell of the New School University, Bernard      Lewis of Princeton and my New York University colleague, Noah      Feldman.       And I greatly value the opportunity to meet the      distinguished former Prime Minister of France, Michel Rocard,      and so many other eminent political leaders, scholars and      writers gathered this weekend at the Kingdom's Royal Academy.       As an American, I am well aware that Morocco was the first      country, in 1777, to extend diplomatic recognition to the      United States, and our two nations have enjoyed friendly and      cordial relations now for over 200 years. Secretary of State      Colin Powell spoke of this friendship only a few days ago in      Marrakech.       In light of 9/11, the war in Iraq, the ongoing strife in      Afghanistan, the continuing conflict between Israelis and      Palestinians, the attacks in Istanbul and elsewhere, there      could not be a more appropriate subject to bring us together      than ``The Dialogue of Cultures''.       My own modest offering today will focus on the      contributions to a more peaceful world of the institutions      and activities of education and culture.       So that you will understand my perspective, please allow me      some words of personal background.       A native of Midwest America, I am the son of a Greek      immigrant father and an Indiana schoolteacher mother. A      graduate of Harvard University, I spent three years at Oxford      University where I wrote a doctoral dissertation on the      anarchist movement in Spain.       First elected to the Congress of the United States in 1958,      I was ten times reelected, serving, therefore, for 22 years      and during the Administrations of six President: three      Republicans--Eisenhower, Nixon and Ford; and three      Democrats--Kennedy, Johnson and Carter.       In Congress I served on the Committee on Education and      Labor, where I helped write all the laws enacted between 1959      and 1981 to assist schools, colleges and universities;      libraries and museums; the arts and the humanities; and to      provide services for children, the elderly, the disabled.       In my last four years on Capitol Hill, I was Majority Whip,      third-ranking member of the Leadership of the House of      Representatives.       A Democrat, I was defeated in Ronald Reagan's landslide      victory over President Carter in 1980. Shortly thereafter I      was invited to     become president of New York University, now the world's      largest private university, a position in which I served      until 1992 when I became president emeritus.                          New York University       In Congress I was author of the International Education Act      of 1966, to provide grants to colleges and universities in      the United States for study of other countries. On arriving      at New York University or, as we call it, NYU, I continued my      interest in international education.       We established during my presidency the Center for Japan-     U.S. Business & Economic Studies in our School of Business;      an Onassis Program of Hellenic Studies; the Skirball      Department of Hebrew and Judaic Studies; a Casa Italiana      Zerilli-Marimo; and the King Juan Carlos I of Spain Center      for the study of the economics, history and politics of      modern Spain.       Beyond such centers at NYU--and I have not named all of      them--we have also, for example, the Hagop Kevorkian Center      for Near Eastern Studies, a leading center in the United      States for teaching and research about the Arab world; as      well as centers in Florence, London, Madrid, Paris and      Prague, and we hope to set up others in Africa and Latin      America.       I add that 4,400 students from the countries are on our      campus this year while nearly 2,000 from NYU are studying      abroad.       In my judgement, the need for us in the United States to      invest in knowledge of other countries and peoples takes on      added urgency after the war in Iraq.       It is no secret to any of you that the actions of the      United States in Iraq have met--and continue to meet--strong      opposition in many countries, as President Bush personally      observed during his visit to London a few days ago.       Here I could cite the report last summer issued by The Pew      Research Center, Views of a Changing World. Based on a      respected survey, the Pew Report found that ``. . . [I]n most      countries, opinions of the U.S. are markedly lower than they      were a year ago.''       The report continued, ``. . . [T]he war has widened the      rift between Americans and Western Europeans, further      inflamed the Muslim world, softened support for the war on      terrorism and significantly weakened global public support      for the pillars of the post-World War II era--the UN and the      North Atlantic alliance.''       In the United States and Europe, scholars, journalists and      public leaders have engaged in all manner of symposia on the      tensions between the United States and Europe as well as the      sharpened hostility toward America in the Islamic world.       Nor, as you are aware, is public opinion in the United      States overwhelmingly supportive of President Bush's policies      toward Iraq, especially in light of the killing of American      and British soldiers and the failure of the Bush      Administration to plan effectively for the aftermath of the      war.       My own view--and I believe that I reflect the opinions of      scholars, journalists and many political leaders in our own      country and abroad--is that in the war on terrorism and in      meeting the other challenges to civil and democratic      societies, military power, even when exercised by the      strongest nation in history, is not enough.                   ``soft power'' vs. ``hard power''       Not only does the United States require partners in post-     war Iraq as well as in other places of danger but we must      also give far more attention to investing in what my friend,      Joseph Nye, Dean of the John F. Kennedy School of Government      at Harvard, has called, in contrast to hard power, ``soft      power''.       ``U.S. military power is essential to global stability and      is a critical part of the response to terrorism'', Nye      agrees. But it is not enough, he adds: ``Soft power rises      from the attractiveness of a country's culture, political      ideas and policies''.       Nye's words were echoed recently by a powerful essay      published last October in Madrid's El Pais by Fedrico Mayor,      who declared, ``The force of Europe is not the Europe of      force . . . [but] the force of the spirit, of creative powers      . . . of democratic values . . . of education and culture . .      . of conciliation . . . friendship and solidarity among      peoples, of openness, of a culture of peace. . . .''       In view of what I have already said, you will understand      why I was so pleased to have been invited to Rabat for this      conference on the relationship between the West and the Arab      world.       Let me here recall that last year, in New York City,      speaking to a group of Ambassadors from Islamic countries      assigned to the United Nations, I observed that most      Americans had never met a Muslim and that most of us were      quite ignorant of the traditions of Islam.       Accordingly, I told the Ambassadors, unless you want      Americans to think that Islam is represented by Osama Bin      Laden, you must give more attention to teaching the best in      your religious faith while, on the other hand, those of us      who are not Muslims have a similar obligation to listen and      to learn.                    rising interest in u.s. in Islam       In fact, one now finds a burgeoning interest in Islam in      the United States. One cannot go into a serious bookshop in      New York City without seeing new volumes on Islam.       I think, by way of example, of the book Islam: A Mosaic,      Not a Monolith by the distinguished president of the Carnegie      Corporation of New York, Vartan Gregorian, and of After      Jihad: America and the Struggle for Islamic Democracy by Noah      Feldman, a brilliant young scholar on the faculty of the NYU      Law School, from whom you will hear shortly.       And in my country there have appeared in recent months      several significant reports dealing with the subject of      relations between the West and Arab societies. For example,      the Center for the Study of Presidency in Washington, DC last      July published An Initiative: Strengthening U.S.-Muslim      Communications, focusing on failures on the part of the      United States in conducting cultural diplomacy in the Muslim      world after 9/11.       Only last month, an advisory group chaired by a former U.S.      Ambassador, Edward P. Djerejian, submitted to Secretary of      State Colin Powell and our Congress a report entitled      Changing Minds, Winning Peace: A New Strategic Direction for      U.S. Public Diplomacy for the Arab and Muslim World.       I cite two other relevant reports: Arts and Minds: Cultural      Diplomacy amid Global Tensions, based on a conference held      last April at Columbia University and a Council on Foreign      Relations statement, Finding America's Voice: A Strategy for      Reinvigorating U.S. Public Diplomacy, prepared by a task      force chaired by a highly respected business leader, Peter G.      Peterson.       I must, however, draw your particular attention among this      blizzard of reports to one, published only last October by      the United Nations Development Program, the Arab Human      Development Report 2003: Building a Knowledge Society.       This document was written not by Americans or Europeans but      by a group of distinguished Arab scholars and opinion      leaders.       The report, say its authors, is ``once descriptive and      prescriptive, with bold recommendations for change and      detailed analyses of the current state of education,      scientific research, the media, the publishing industry,      culture encompassing religion, intellectual heritage and the      Arabic language, and other building blocks of a `knowledge      society' in the Arab world.''                     an ``arab knowledge society''       The report speaks of the ``five pillars'' of an ``Arab      knowledge society'', including:       Guaranteeing the key freedoms of opinion, speech and      assembly;       The full dissemination of high quality education;       Indigenizing science, investing in research and joining the      Information Revolution; and       Developing an authentic, broadminded and enlightened Arab      mode of knowledge.       The terrible attacks of recent weeks and months--in      Jerusalem, Baghdad, Istanbul and Riyadh--dramatically      demonstrate the need for radical change in the Arab world if      Arab countries are to look to an era of peaceful development      and progress and if we in the non-Islamic world are to live      without the omnipresent threat of terrorist activities.       Allow me then to assert my conviction that it is imperative      that we in the West, and especially in the United States,      learn more about countries other than our own but especially,      after 9/11, about the Islamic world even as we must encourage      Arab societies to take steps to implement the recommendations      in the Arab development report of which I have just spoken.       For further and immediate context for these several      reports, let me cite the eloquent words of His Majesty, King      Mohammed VI, two months ago, on October 10, at the opening of      the Fall session of the Parliament of Morocco. Speaking of      his determination ``to set the democratic process on the      right track'', His Majesty declared, ``[T]here can be no      democracy where there are no democrats. Democracy is a long,      arduous exercise, not some sort of battlefield on which to      wage a war for positions. Democracy implies a keen sense of      commitment to the notion of citizenship.       ``Consolidation of democracy requires that the culture of      responsible citizenship be fostered and enhances, a task      incumbent upon political parties and civil society. . . .''              king mohammed iv on ``the dignity of women''       In the same address, King Mohammed drew particular      attention to the need for steps to respect, in his words,      ``the dignity of women as human beings'', and recalled his      own remarks four years earlier: ``. . . [H]ow can society      achieve progress'', His Majesty asked, ``while women, who      represent half the nation, see their rights violated and      suffer as a result of injustice, violence and      marginalization, not withstanding the dignity and justice      granted them by our glorious religion?''       In his statement of December 3, following his meeting with      His Majesty, Secretary Powell congratulated the King on the      steps Morocco has taken to strengthen democracy such as      elections at the regional and parliamentary level and ``bold      reforms . . . for the family code.''       And as I am quoting the King of the Moroccan people, I note      also his words of October 16th this year, in Malaysia, at the      10th Summit of the Organization of the Islamic Conference,      when His Majesty said: ``. . . [I]n Morocco . . . we have      relied on our strong commitment to democracy and our people's      unanimous condemnation of terrorism, a phenomenon which is      clearly alien to our culture. It is also inconsistent with      the tolerant aims of our religion, which forbids the shedding      of innocent blood, advocates peaceful coexistence and upholds      human dignity. . . .''       This statement of the King of Morocco is in harmony, I      believe, with a comment, also last October, in Amman, Jordan,      of His Royal Highness, Prince El Hassan bin Talal, President      of the Club of Rome and President of the Arab Thought Forum,      who said then: ``. . . [L]et us not forget that we are in a      region inhabited by the so-called `people of the Book/ahl al-     kitab'--Christians, Jews and Muslims--and whether we pick up      the Bible, the Torah or the Qur'an, we will find all of us      are taught to practice and promote peace. . . .''               prince hassan of jordan opposes terrorism       Indeed, only weeks ago, on November 18th, speaking on      behalf of the World Conference of Religions for Peace, of      which he is Moderator, Prince Hassan declared:       ``The despicable attacks this week against two synagogues      in Turkey are brutal acts condemned by all people of faith--     Jews, Christians, and Muslims alike. . . .       ``No religious tradition can or will tolerate these acts.      We are united in rejecting terror, the intentional killing of      innocent people, whether by individuals or states. . . .       ``Muslims, Christians and Jews share a common history. . .      .       ``In the face of terrorism, all people of faith must      redouble their efforts to work together for peace.''       Now everyone here knows that a key question being asked in      the West is this: Is it possible for a country where the      dominant culture is Islamic to have a genuine democracy?       Most of you will be aware of the speech that President      George Bush delivered in Washington, D.C. last month, on      November 6, to mark the 20th anniversary of the founding of      the National Endowment for Democracy, an organization that      makes grants to private groups, including some in Morocco,      that are working for democracy.       I was, I should tell you, for seven years chairman of the      Endowment.       In his speech, President Bush asserted, ``It should be      clear to all that Islam--the faith of one-fifth of humanity--     is consistent with democratic rule'', and the President went      on to quote the words of King Mohammed to the Parliament of      Morocco calling for extending rights to women.       But President Bush also cited the recent report, of which I      have told you, in which Arab scholars warned that the global      wave of democracy has ``barely reached the Arab states''.       What then is to be done?                  STEPS THE UNITED STATES SHOULD TAKE       Even as I urge Arab leaders to act to build an ``Arab      Knowledge Society,'' there are several steps that, I believe,      we in the United States should take.       Let me speak of some.       First, we must strengthen the programs of educational      exchanges between the United States and the Middle East.       A year and a half ago, at a conference on the 50th      anniversary of AMIDEAST in Marrakech, our Assistant Secretary      of State Patricia Harrison observed how many alumni of these      exchanges are heads of state or government or have held other      important positions of leadership in countries of the Middle      East.       Secretary Harrison said that the State Department is      expanding the number of Fulbright scholarships and      fellowships to people from the Middle East to study in the      United States and for Americans to study in the Middle East.       As we meet in Rabat, let me note that the U.S./Morocco      Fulbright program includes faculty and students from both our      countries and that the budget is shared by the two sides.       Moroccan Fulbright students focus on courses in the U.S. to      assist them in their country's economic development.       The U.S. scholars who come here are professors, whose      experience will strengthen their university teaching back      home.       Morocco's Fulbright program, by the way, is a leader in a      new initiative in the Islamic world, Fulbright Foreign      Language Teaching Assistants: young people training to become      teachers in Morocco are teaching the Arabic language and Arab      culture at colleges and universities in the United States--an      exchange positive for both sides.       The Moroccan instructors not only teach in American schools      but also give talks about Islam and North Africa to other      audiences in the United States.       The U.S. Department of State also supports citizen      exchanges of various kinds--to build leadership in sports,      women's and other non-governmental organizations, in      journalism and the media, legal reform, the environment,      democracy and human rights.       Let me add that I think it fortunate that the newly      appointed Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy is      the distinguished former United States Ambassador to Morocco,      Margaret Tutwiler.       Certainly we in the U.S. must substantially increase our      investment in study of the Arab world.            AN NYU CENTER FOR PUBLIC DIPLOMACY AND DIALOGUE       Even as I have mentioned the Hagop Kevorkian Center for      Near Eastern Studies at NYU, I am very glad to say that New      York University has only weeks ago responded to the call of      the Advisory Group on Public Diplomacy for the Arab and      Muslim World in its report, Changing Minds/Winning Peace, by      proposing to create, in consultation with the U.S. State      Department, a Center for Public Diplomacy and Dialogue, a      center my colleagues at NYU believe will be ``an      unprecedented effort to launch a serious and ongoing exchange      with the Arab and Muslim world''.       Let me tell you what the authors of the proposal hope to      do. The Center will offer three approaches.       First, there will be three kinds of conferences. An annual      conference will bring together Arab and Muslim leaders from      the fields of government, business and religion to discuss      such topics as civil society, the rule of law, religion,      media, democratic institutions and human rights.       Second, there will be conferences where U.S., Arab and      Muslim professionals such as health officials, scientists,      educators, and leaders of non-governmental organizations--can      meet for three one-week sessions.       Then we hope to have ``Leaders of Tomorrow'' conferences,      where young individuals, rising as the next generation of      leaders in both the Arab/Muslim world and the United States      can get together twice a year.       A second approach under the Center's sponsorship:      fellowships to bring annually 100 college-age students from      Muslim countries to study at NYU, concentrating on law,      public service, education, journalism, business and science.      Grants of approximately $50,000 per fellow would cover costs.       New York University hopes eventually to establish a      residential presence on campus--to be called ``Dialogue      House''--for some of NYU's finest students and faculty from      all fields, who would live with the exchange students from      Muslim countries.       Because we believe cultural and arts programs are vital to      this public diplomacy initiative, we plan exchange programs      to bring artists and filmmakers from Arab and Muslim      societies to work with their American counterparts. NYU's      Tisch School of the Arts already hosts the world's only      International Student Film Festival.       We want also, in addition to college-age students, to      arrange brief exchange visits from high schoolers from Muslim      countries to be exposed to an American university and to      visit museums, see plays and tour business firms.       The third approach we hope to create under this proposal is      four-fold.       We want to organize, in cooperation with other research      libraries in New York City, a Comprehensive Public Diplomacy      Resource Center, focusing on the Middle East and open to      scholars, students and U.S. government officials, in effect,      a clearing house for information on the Arab and Muslim      world.       We plan, too, a program to preserve and digitize unique      books and texts from the Muslim world as well as explore      making U.S. texts available in translation for Muslim and      Arab countries.       We also intend to coordinate teacher-training programs with      faculty from other colleges and universities as well as high      school teachers to inject components of Arab and Muslim      understanding into their courses.       Finally, NYU will continue to offer foreign language      training in Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, Turkish, Hindi and Urdu.       I hasten to say that NYU is not the only university in the      United States that seeks to enhance knowledge of Arab and      Muslim societies but I have obviously spoken of the      institution I know best.         to improve relationship between u.s. and muslim world       Nor have I begun to exhaust the kinds of activities that      can be undertaken in the educational and cultural fields to      build understanding between the Arab/Muslim world and the      West.       Only last summer, at a ``Partners in Humanity'' conference,      in Amman, under the leadership of Prince Hassan, 60 leaders      convened to produce an action plan to improve the      relationship between the United States and the Muslim world.       Here I should like to make a point I believe it important      for U.S. policymakers to understand. It is not only the words      with which we describe our policy but the substance of the      policy itself, that is to say, the deeds as well as the      message, that will have an impact in the Arab world.       Marc Lynch, a scholar at Williams College, in an essay,      ``Taking Arabs Seriously'', in the journal Foreign Affairs      (September/October 2003), calls for ``a fundamentally      different approach to the United States' interaction with      [this] region--one that speaks with Arabs rather than at them      and tries to engage rather than manipulate''.       Lynch added, ``The goal should be to establish the United      States, through words and deeds, as an ally of the Arab      public in its own demands for liberal reform, rather than      making such reform an external imposition.''       Among the several recommendations from the October      conference in Amman was to bring together ``Christian and      Muslim faith-based development and aid professionals and      religious leaders to discuss issues of `meeting human needs'      ''.                world conference of religions for peace       I may say in respect of this proposal for inter-faith      cooperation that next week I shall be in Rome for a meeting      of the International Council of Trustees, of whom I am one,      of the World Conference of Religions for Peace, or WCRP, at      the Vatican, under the co-chairmanship of Prince Hassan.       The other co-chair is Richard Blum, husband of United      States Senator Diane Feinstein of California.       I add that another trustee of the WCRP is a distinguished      Moroccan diplomat, my friend, Ambassador Mokhtar Lamani,      Permanent Observer of the Organization of the Islamic      Conference to the United Nations.       We shall meet in Rome--Orthodox, Protestant and Roman      Catholic Christians as well as Jews, Muslims and Buddhists to      discuss the Geneva Accord and the search for peace in the      Middle East.       There is one other recommendation form Amman that I      applaud, which calls for bringing together ``Presidents of      American colleges and universities that are developing or      strengthening Islamic studies programs with their      counterparts in predominantly Muslim countries who are      developing American studies programs.''       Ladies and gentlemen, I have not, I realize, begun to touch      on all the ways in which the forces of learning and culture,      of education and the arts, can contribute to building peace      in a troubled world.       But I trust that what I have had to say offers some rays of      hope at a time when we are surrounded by too much darkness.       The distinguished Minister of Culture, Mohamed Achaari, in      inviting us all to Morocco, posed the question: ``Is a      dialogue between cultures possible?''       That we meet here this week in Rabat demonstrates that the      answer to the Minister's question is ``Yes!''       So let the dialogue deepen . . . and continue!                          ____________________
