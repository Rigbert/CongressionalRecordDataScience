 285 out of committee on July 19. The committee-reported bill includes a provision that prohibits Mr. Chukwueke from using his status to sponsor immediate family for benefits under the Immigration and Nationality Act. The language in my amendment is identical to language used in other private relief bills. Similar language was included in bills in 1999 and 2000. Senator Levin, the sponsor of this private relief bill, supported the amendment.  We always consider private relief bills on a case-by-case basis. In the case of Mr. Chukwueke, we were told that he did not have parents or family in the U.S. or in Nigeria. It turned out that was not the case. Those statements were inaccurate. He says he did not mean to mislead ICE agents about his family, but the fact is that he did. He did not tell the whole truth.  As I said, in previous private relief bills, we have excluded private bill recipients from sponsoring immediate family members. That is not to say that the family members are barred from ever entering the country. It simply means they cannot use the private bill recipient's special status to provide them a benefit or to gain derivative status.  There are many worthwhile people who want to come or remain in the United States. However, there are bad actors and people who will perpetuate fraud in order to do so. People will go to great lengths to come to the United States. We need to be worried about individuals who will take advantage of our open door policies and manipulate the system to get a benefit. We need to be watchful for potential fraud and abuse of the system.  If S. 285 passes the House and is sent to the President, Mr. Chukwueke may be able to attend medical school in the fall. He has the support of many upstanding individuals, including SenatorLevin. Mr. chukwueke is also supported by a number of people in his community. We received letters of recommendation from Wayne State University and the Daughters of Mary Mother of Mercy.  I wish Mr. Chukwueke the best of luck in his future endeavors.                               Exhibit #1                Affidavit of Sopuruchi Victor Chukwueke       I, Sopuruchi Victor Chukwueke, swear under penalty of      perjury that the following is true and accurate to the best      of my knowledge and belief:       1. My name is Sopuruchi Victor Chukwueke. I write this      statement in support of S.B. 285, a private bill introduced      on my behalf by U.S. Senator Carl Levin.       2. I was born in Nigeria on February 10, 1986. During my      early childhood, I developed a benign tumor caused by      Neurofibromatosis, which grew on my frontal and right facial      area, subsequently resulting in a very significant facial      deformity.       3. My mother took me to different hospitals for treatment      but we were unable to find a facility or surgeon to treat my      condition. At some point, she heard of a Catholic nun called      Rev. Mother Paul Offiah who ran a handicap (orphanage) center      for orphans, abandoned and neglected disabled children. The      name of the center is called St. Vincent de Paul Handicap      Center located in Umuahia, Abia, Nigeria. My mother took me      there, explained the situation to Mother Offiah, and left me.      I do not remember how old I was at that point, but I felt      abandoned.       4. Rev. Mother Paul Offiah took me in, fed and clothed me      and became my sole parental figure, offering both emotional      and financial support. My mother kept in contact with Mother      Paul Offiah and came a few times to visit me at the center. I      spent all my time there and Mother Paul Offiah started making      arrangements for me to come to United States for life-saving      treatment.       5. Dr. Ian Jackson at Providence Hospital in Michigan      agreed to perform the surgery free of charge. Several      generous Nigerians assisted with the effort to raise funds to      that I could travel to the U.S. for treatment.       6. On August 21, 2001, when I was 15, Mother Offiah brought      me to the United States on a B-2 visa and left me in the care      of Sister Immaculata Osueke and other nuns in Lansing,      Michigan. She then went back to Nigeria. I was authorized to      stay in the U.S. until August 29, 2002.       7. My application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status was      rejected twice, because I could not afford the visa fee at      the time. Also, the evidence submitted was signed by a      clinical social worker instead of a licensed physician. The      delay in filing for the third time was in part because I was      having surgery during that time. I had my second major      surgery on January 14, 2003. That period was a very difficult      and stressful time in my life, because I had to prepare for      surgery, undergo the painful surgery and post-operative      recovery, and at the same time worry about my visa status. I      was just 16 years old at the time.       8. In February 2003, my mother and father signed sworn      affidavits to give up their parental rights, so I could be      adopted here in the United States.       9. In November 2003, I began to study for the GED at home      while receiving treatment for Neurofibromatosis. In January      2004, I took the GED and passed it.       10. A few years later, in 2006, Mother Offiah died of a      brain tumor, leaving me with no parental figure in Nigeria      who could provide for and support me with my medical      condition.       11. In May 2006, I enrolled at the Oakland Community      College in Southfield, Michigan. My education was paid for by      a Catholic benefactor, Mr. Jerry Burns.       12. In August 2008, I graduated from Oakland Community      College with an AA in Science and in September 2008, I      transferred to Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan to      pursue a Bachelor's Degree.       13. I had been abandoned by my family in an orphanage in      Nigeria, and I felt I have no one to care for me there,      especially after Mother Paul Offiah passed away. As I grew up      in the United States and received medical treatment for my      condition, I realized that my mother knew she could not      provide for me and so she had entrusted me to the people who      could take care of me. I realized that she had done the right      thing at the time, given the circumstances. So I decided to      reach out to my family again, especially my mother.       14. Sister Immaculata Osueke reached out to other nuns at      the orphanage in Nigeria to get my mother's telephone number,      so that I could try to reconnect with my family.       15. I was chosen to give the commencement speech at the      Wayne State University graduation in 2011. Dr. Kenneth Honn,      my research professor, said that he want to bring my mother      to witness ``her son's graduation.'' He wrote an invitation      letter for my mother to come visit me, but all of the travel      arrangements were done by a Wayne State administrator, Mr.      Christopher Harris. With the help of Dr. Honn, Mr. Harris,      and Senator Levin's letter to the U.S. Consulate in Nigeria,      my mother came to visit me at my graduation from Wayne State      last year. It was the first time I had seen her in more than      ten years. She arrived a few hours before my graduation and      returned to Nigeria on May 16, 2011.       16. Since my arrival in Michigan in 2001, 1 have been in      and out of the hospital, and ahve had seven major surgeries      between 2002 and 2011 to remove the Neurofibromatosis and      reconstruct my face.       17. In November 2011, I applied and was accepted by the      University of Toledo, College of Medicine, conditioned on      receiving lawful permanent residence in the United States on      or before August 1, 2012.           Respectfully submitted,                                       Sopurucki Victor Chukwueke.
