 Eisner of Walt Disney earning well over I believe $100 million in income a year.  Let me mention something else, because the problem goes well beyond just the United States. There was a study also done recently, when we talk about the world economy, if you can believe this, that 358 billionaires worldwide have a combined net worth of $760 billion, which is equal to that of the bottom 45 percent of the world's population. That is 358 people who could sit, probably not so comfortably, but we could get them into this room right now, own more wealth than several billion people who constitute the bottom 45 percent of the world's population.  Again, in our country the richest 1 percent of the population owns more wealth than the bottom 90 percent.  Now I have not heard too much in the Contract With America about that. Maybe I missed it, but I do not think I heard that. Did the gentleman hear that?
