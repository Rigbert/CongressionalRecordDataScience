 John B. Gaines, president of the Bowling Green Daily News. He passed away last week at the age of 92.  John came by his passion for reporting news and connecting with the community quite honestly. He was born and raised in a newspaper family his grandfather founded the Daily News, and his father ran the newspaper until his passing in 1947 and for half a century, John served as the paper's publisher. When in Bowling Green, I always appreciated the opportunity to sit down for a conversation with John.  I will miss John and wish to extend my heartfelt sympathy to the entire Gaines family--John Pipes Gaines and his wife Susan Leonard Gaines, Mollie Gaines Smith and her husband, S. Russell Smith, Jr., Mary Gaines Dunham and her husband, David Lee Dunham; and grandsons, John Scott Gaines, Stephen Wilson Gaines, S. Russell Smith III and John Brooken Smith and his wife, Katie. While the Bowling Green community has lost a prominent voice, John's legacy will continue. The newspaper is in good hands under the leadership of his son, Pipes, and his grandsons working there.  The paper he so loved and dedicated his life to paid tribute to him on Sunday with an article titled ``Daily News president dies at 92.'' I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record, and that the entire Senate join me in honoring the life of this beloved Kentuckian.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:           [From the Bowling Green Daily News, July 15, 2007]                    Daily News President Dies at 92                         (By Alicia Carmichael)       Daily News president and avid fisherman John B. Gaines      always told his childhood friend John Clagett ``he was going      to live until he got pulled under by a big fish at the age of      90,'' Clagett said Saturday.       On Friday at The Medical Center, 92-year-old Gaines died      quietly, surrounded by family, after a short illness.       ``The big fish got him,'' Clagett said sadly Saturday from      his home in Middleberry, VT.       Still, according to many of those who knew him well, Gaines      lived life to the fullest until his last days.       ``He had much difficulty getting around, walking, but he      came to church most every Sunday'' at Christ Episcopal      Church, said John Grider, who through the years did      bookkeeping, accounting and tax work for Gaines and served      with Gaines on the board of directors at Citizens National      Bank.       Ewing Hines, who worked for Gaines for 40 years as a Daily      News accountant, said Gaines was still talking about fishing      on Friday.       ``I called down at the hospital,'' Hines said. ``(His son)      Pipes took the phone, and I heard him say in the background,      'Tell him it's a good day to flyfish.' And I thought he was      getting better.''       Now Hines can't believe his ``best friend'' is gone.       ``This hurts me about as much as anything that has      happened,'' he said. ``He always had time to talk to me. He      was a great person.''       Michael G. Catlett, who was Gaines' financial consultant      and friend, said Gaines ``was a man who showed you personal      attention. He acted like he really cared for you when he was      talking to you.''       Gaines and Catlett often took walks through Bowling Green,      before walking became difficult for Gaines.       ``I used to tell him, `I enjoy our walks downtown because      it elevates my status in the community,' `` Catlett said.      ``He laughed about that.''       With Gaines' passing, Catlett said, Bowling Green has lost      a ``treasure . . . a great man of integrity, manners and      respect.''       Don Stringer, the former longtime managing editor at the      Daily News, also talked about Gaines' integrity.       ``He always stood behind us'' in the newsroom, Stringer      said, ``and he had no compunction, when we were right, about      saying, `That's what we're going to do.'''       With ``a wonderful dry sense of humor,'' Stringer said,      Gaines took the newspaper business's ups and downs in stride.       Daily News general manager Mark Van Patten said many often      overlooked Gaines' vivid wit because of his usually serious      demeanor.       But that demeanor came from his love for the newspaper,      which was started by his grandfather, also named John Gaines,      in 1882. The younger John Gaines, a graduate of the      University of Alabama, took over the running the Daily News      after his dad, Clarence M. Gaines, died in 1947. For half a      century, he was the paper's publisher.       ``He really loved the newspaper and loved this community,''      Van Patten said, ``and that was always foremost in decisions      he made.'' Van Patten added he has ``never worked for a      publisher that had stronger ethics than Mr. Gaines,'' who      ``just loved newspaper and journalism and the business of      newspapers in general.''       Less than two weeks before he died, Gaines was in his Daily      News office, as he was nearly every work day when he wasn't      ill--or, in his later years, spending 6 weeks each winter in      Florida.       ``I could not believe it,'' Grider said of Gaines' devotion      to his work at a time of life when most have been retired for      decades.       Gaines' mind was kept sharp because of his work, Grider      thinks.       ``We had a lot of nice discussions,'' Grider said, ``and      for his age, his mental capacity was remarkable.''       Gregg K. Jones, who is co-publisher of The Greeneville Sun      in Tennessee, president of Jones Media Inc., past chairman of      the Newspaper Association of America--the largest newspaper      trade association in the United States--and a former      president of the Southern Newspaper Publishers Association,      said Gaines was planning, as recently as two weeks ago, to      attend this year's SNPA meeting in West Virginia.       For two terms, Gaines was director of the association. He      also served as president of the Kentucky Press Association,      as his grandfather had once done, in 1962, and was the 1980      recipient of the Edwards M. Templin Memorial Award, which was      presented by the Lexington Herald-Leader to the Kentucky      newspaper person who performed the most outstanding community      service.       ``He was revered in the Southern Newspaper Publishers      Association,'' Jones said, ``and people were always excited      to see him there, not only to hear what he had to say, but so      they could learn from him.''       Jones, whose family has owned The Greeneville Sun for      generations, said Gaines was as passionate about his family's      ownership of the Daily News as he was about the newspaper      industry in general.       ``He didn't like the idea of newspapers being owned by      impersonal public companies,'' Jones said. ``He cared so much      about his community. He made that very clear, and that's      something our families shared. We've always placed a very      high value on the bond between a newspaper and the community      it serves.''       Gaines especially loved helping small business people grow      their businesses, Jones said.       ``He considered his relationships with his advertisers and      readers to be partnerships,'' Jones said. ``So many people in      Bowling Green have built their businesses through (the)      newspaper in Bowling Green. He loved that and seeing people      succeed, and seeing Bowling Green progress.''       ``At the same time, John was a fiercely independent guy,''      Jones said--a newsman who at one time was a member of the      Calendar Club literary group in Bowling Green, a former      member of the Bowling Green Noon Rotary Club, a member of the      Society of Professional Journalists and a charter member of      the Bowling Green-Warren County Jaycees.       Gaines was also chairman of the boards of News Publishing      LLC, which operates the Daily News, and the Daily News      Broadcasting Company, which operates WKCT-AM and WDNS-FM      radio stations in Bowling Green.       In his free time, Gaines loved fishing, dove hunting,      traveling both domestically and abroad, and good food, said      his grandson, Steve Gaines, who is editorial page editor at      the Daily News.       ``My fondest memories of my grandfather will always be      spending countless hours fishing next to him on the creek      beds or countless hours in the dove field, either shooting      doves or talking about Alabama football,'' Steve Gaines said.       John Gaines was also was loyal to his church, where he had      served on the vestry and was a trustee of the Delafield      Committee.       The Rev. Howard Surface, who was Gaines' pastor at Christ      Episcopal Church for four decades, said that for years,      Gaines came to the church several days a week.       ``For many, many years my office was in the front part of      the church on State Street,'' Surface said, ``and every day      around noon I would see John. He made a habit of walking up      State Street and he would stop at the church's prayer      chapel.''       Gaines' also was devoted to his family, Steve Gaines said.       ``My grandfather said many times the best thing he ever did      in life was marry Mabel Sharp Gaines, and he was right.''       Gaines and his wife raised three children: Pipes Gaines,      who is now publisher of the Daily News, Mary Gaines Dunham,      who is retired from her job as national advertising director      at the newspaper, and Mollie Gaines Smith, now of Louisville.       The couple also had several grandchildren, including Scott      Gaines, who is Steve Gaines' brother and works in the      business side of the Daily News.       Steve Gaines said he now takes solace in the fact that his      grandfather was surrounded by family when he died. He's also      comforted by the fact that his granddad knew the Daily News      would stay in the Gaines family after his death.       ``He wouldn't have wanted it any other way,'' he said.       Stringer said he now thinks one of Gaines' greatest      legacies has been passing down his sense of integrity to his      children, and gave Gaines what he considers ``the highest      compliment you can give'' in the newspaper business.       ``He was a hell of a good newspaper man,'' Stringer said,      ``and I think the community is going to miss him.''                          ____________________
