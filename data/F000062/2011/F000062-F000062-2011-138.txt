 President, I ask that I could briefly respond to the Senator's comments. Senator Coats and I work together on Intelligence. I have great respect for him. I understand the regional issues involved, so I understand the Senator's thinking. My thinking is, we get a strong vote on this today. This is simply a cloture vote. We have 60 votes. We have some time to see if we can work something out.  One thing I have learned in this whole line of pursuit is, if you give your word, keep it. The only thing you have is your integrity, and I give you my word that we will continue to try to bring both sides together.  I know this is a long journey. I know we will be blue-slipped and we have to come back and we will have to have a bill we can put a tax matter on. That is for a later day. I think we are into this, and so many people want kind of a clean vote, that if we have that, I am prepared to give you my word to continue to try to discuss this.  My own view on these things is to do the very best we can, try to reach a compromise when issues are like this, and march on to the next thing. This has become far harder than I anticipated. I think we are relatively close to a solution, to a compromise. Whether Senator Coburn will accept it, I do not know. But I know these discussions are going on, and all I can do is pledge you my best effort to try to get to something that satisfies everybody.  If you come from a large ethanol-producing State, I understand what this means. On the other hand, I also understand this is going to be the first of many coming down the line. We have to change the way we do business if we are going to carry out the mandate of a prudent government, we have to make a lot of changes. None of it is going to be easy, so we might as well get used to it now. But for whatever it is worth, you have my word I will continue to try.
