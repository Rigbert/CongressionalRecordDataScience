President, I rise to urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment offered by the Senator from Kentucky.  Make no mistake about what this amendment would do. It is an 11.4-percent, across-the-board, indiscriminate, meat-ax cut in important programs, and as the chairman of the Appropriations Committee has pointed out, it would violate the bipartisan agreement we just reached earlier this year.  In addition, let me give you just one example of what the impact of Senator Paul's amendment would be. If you look at the section 8 housing program, which helps some of our most vulnerable citizens, this amendment's passage would mean that 275,000 low-income seniors, disabled individuals, homeless veterans, and families with small children would lose their housing assistance and become at risk of homelessness. I don't think that is what we want.  Thank you.
