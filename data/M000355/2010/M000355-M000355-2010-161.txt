 President, later this morning, the President of the United States will sign a financial regulation bill that was sold to the American people as a way of reining in Wall Street. Anyone who believes that did not read beyond the cover sheet because if they did, they would discover instead a far-reaching government intrusion that was endorsed by Wall Street and opposed by Main Street. Citibank thinks it is great. Your local florist thinks it will undermine their business. When you cut through all the talking points about what financial regulation will do, the practical, real-world effect of this bill in the near term will be job loss. That is the real story.  For more than a year and a half, the President and his Democratic allies on Capitol Hill have pushed an antibusiness, antijobs agenda on the American people in the form of one massive government intrusion after another. And then they celebrate. Well, Americans are not celebrating. Three million of them have lost their jobs since the Democrats launched their stimulus.
