 President, I rise to pay tribute to the victims of the Armenian genocide, the first such crime against a people in the 20th century.  On April 24, 1915, 81 years ago today, the Ottoman Turkish Empire began the systematic rounding up and slaughter of Armenian intellectuals, clergy, businessmen, and other leaders of the community. Ultimately the horror claimed 1\1/2\ million lives and resulted in the exile of Armenians from much of their historic homeland in Asia Minor.  I like to think that some good can come from even the most horrifying evil. In this case a large segment of the Armenian diaspora, banished from its ancestral home, reached these shores. They and their descendents have immeasurably enriched the United States of America. In remembering the martyrdom of their fellow Armenians eight decades ago, we are also paying tribute to Armenian-Americans--to their patriotism, and to their many contributions to this land of freedom.  Mr. President, unfortunately there are some who would trivialize the Armenian genocide or even attempt to deny that it ever took place, just as there remain a twisted few who continue to deny the Holocaust that claimed 6 million Jews.  But, Mr. President, there is no denying the undeniable. The Armenians in the Ottoman Empire were not murdered because they were talented businessmen. They were not butchered because their community produced outstanding intellectuals. They were not slaughtered for any socioeconomic reason, however perverted. No, the Armenians were murdered because they were Armenians. This Mr. President, was genocide.  Unfortunately, genocide is a recurring fact of the 20th century. Fifteen years after the Armenian genocide occurred, Stalin began his insane collectivization that decimated the Ukrainian people.  I have already mentioned the Nazis' extermination of 6 million Jews in the Holocaust.  The 1970's witnessed Cambodia's killing fields where a significant proportion of the Khmer people perished.  The 1990's have seen the mass murder of Tutsis in Rwanda and the unspeakable horrors perpetrated upon Bosnian Muslims, cynically given the euphemism, ethnic cleansing.  Mr. President, we must endeavor to ensure that these vile deeds are never repeated yet another time. The first step in that process is to ensure that the memory of genocide is kept alive so that the truth will prevail over the purveyors of historical lies. The Holocaust memorial Museum here in Washington is serving a vital function in that regard.  Similarly, the proposed Armenian Genocide Memorial Museum of America promises to be an important vehicle for preserving and disseminating the truth.  On this solemn day of remembrance, I join millions of other Americans in commemorating the martyrdom of the Armenians and praying that their eternal sacrifice shall not have been in vain.                          ____________________
