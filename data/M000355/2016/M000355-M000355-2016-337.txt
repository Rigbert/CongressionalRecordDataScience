 President, I rise today to extend my thanks and congratulations to a venerable Kentucky business trade association that is celebrating a milestone anniversary of service to its members and its customers. The Kentucky Bankers Association, a nonprofit trade association serving Kentucky's community financial services industry, celebrates its 125th anniversary this October.  Founded in October of 1891, the Kentucky Bankers Association, KBA, represents State and federally chartered banks and thrifts. It has 185 member banks, 167 of which are headquartered in Kentucky. Not only do KBA's member banks provide high-quality service to the people of the Commonwealth, but they also employ more than 23,000 Kentuckians.  The purpose of the Kentucky Bankers Association is to provide advocacy for the financial services industry both in Kentucky and on the national level. The organization also serves as a fount of information to its members on the banking industry and acts as a catalyst for internal debate and action within the industry and among its members. It also publishes an industry magazine to provide news and information to its members. And by providing loans to Kentucky businesses, they enable future business growth and spur the creation of new jobs.  KBA has served its members for 125 years, and many of KBA's member banks have also been serving their customers for a long time. The oldest bank chartered in Kentucky was established in 1835, making it 181 years old. And the average age of Kentucky chartered banks is 84 years old. Kentuckians who bank with KBA's members have counted on and appreciated their high level of service for generations.  I also want to congratulate my friend Ballard Cassady, the president and CEO of KBA, as he has served in that position for 30 years. His dedication to the KBA is equaled only by KBA member banks' dedication to their customers.  Kentucky community banks are integral parts of the local neighborhoods they serve. And the KBA plays a vital role in representing these community financial institutions. I want to extend my gratitude to the KBA, Mr. Cassady, and KBA leadership for 125 years of service to Kentucky's community financial institutions and their consumers. And I wish to thank KBA's member banks across the Commonwealth for their long-standing commitment to the people of Kentucky.                          ____________________
