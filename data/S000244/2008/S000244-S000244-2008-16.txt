Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this legislation.  Yesterday, the other body passed the FISA bill by a vote of 68-29. I don't understand why House Democrats refuse to bring this bill to the floor, sponsored by Senator Rockefeller. It makes no sense to block its consideration for another 21 days. Why do we keep extending the terrorist loophole? It's imperative that the House pass the Senate bill today.  The Rules Committee last night rejected a Republican amendment to vote on the Senate-passed bill, and then the committee refused to allow the Senate-passed bill as a motion to recommit this afternoon. The majority knows that the American people support long-term legislation to keep our country safe. And I guarantee that the Senate bill would pass the House by a wide margin if the Democratic majority would let the House vote on it.  Instead of passing the Senate bill, we continue to waste time on legislation of little consequence. The FISA bill expires on Friday. There is no more time to waste. We passed a temporary fix last summer and another extension earlier this year. There has been plenty of time to review this and to come up with a permanent fix. If we keep on passing these extensions, we're never going to get a permanent bill, and Americans are in jeopardy.  This majority's charade of passing short-term extensions has gone on long enough. President Bush will veto another extension, and the Democrats will have no one to blame but themselves. It's time for the majority to stop playing political games. We have had plenty of time to debate this issue. The Senate finally got it right, and it's time that the House does the same.  Our intelligence community needs the certainty of a long-term bill to protect the Nation. The Senate bill will continue to give our intelligence agencies the tools they need to keep us safe. I urge my colleagues to reject the 21-day extension up now and to pass the Senate's bipartisan FISA bill today.
