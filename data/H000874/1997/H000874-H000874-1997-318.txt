Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a man who dedicated his time, energy, and spirit to bettering his community and the entire senior population of Charles County, MD. George E. Wheeler spent the majority of his adult life serving southern Maryland as an area agricultural engineer with the U.S. Department of Agriculture working on such projects as the Maryland Delaware Watershed Unit and establishing the first resource conservation and development project in Maryland. This work was important in coordinating efforts between the farming and conservation communities to assure the two worked together for their mutual interests.  But it is the work George Wheeler did within his community which we recognize him for today. Always there to lend a hand, George Wheeler became actively involved in advocating and initiating projects to benefit the senior community. Appointed to the Charles County Commission on Aging in 1972 and the Area Council on Aging in 1979, it became Mr. Wheeler's mission to make certain seniors in the community had the resources and programs for each of them to have a fulfilling and meaningful role in making their town and neighborhoods an enriching place to live.  George Wheeler had the dream of having a place where seniors could gather; a place where they could meet their friends and participate in activities and educational programs and work on projects to benefit the entire community; a place where seniors can exercise in the state of the art fitness center and a place where they know they can get some of the best meals in town.  Through hours of discussions, planning, and problem solving, George Wheeler spoke of the interests of seniors and laid out the vision of the beautiful facility called the Richard R. Clark Senior Center. In 1987, as chairman of the building committee for the center, Mr. Wheeler joined in the opening of this wonderful facility and saw his dream become a reality. He was never deterred by obstacles, but maintained a positive attitude, knowing that one way or another he would achieve his goal. And once the center was built, he continued in that spirit to bring in the best of programs and people to enhance the center.  It is George Wheeler's long hours of time, devotion and dedication which the seniors of Charles County benefit from today. We celebrate his tireless efforts in making the Richard R. Clark Senior Center possible and congratulate his wife, Erma and his children, Richard and Chris, as we dedicate this plaque in his honor.                          ____________________
