President, everyone knows that this Sunday is Mother's Day, a day when we honor our moms, step moms, our mothers-in-law, our grandmothers, our wives and all the women who chose to love, sacrifice, and care for a child. It is also a day when we celebrate new moms-to-be. I am happy to report to you that I am just a few days away from having a new granddaughter, which I am really excited about.
