President, I rise today to pay tribute to Francis P. ``Frank'' Stead, who passed away at the age of 90 on January 31, 2005, following an extended illness.  Frank Stead and I were neighbors in Springfield, IL starting in 1969 when I returned home to Illinois after graduating from Georgetown University Law School. He was a good neighbor, a good friend, and he will certainly be missed by the many people whose lives he touched.  Frank was one of the many unsung heroes of an era that journalist Tom Brokaw has dubbed ``The Greatest Generation.'' Coming of age during the Great Depression and serving our country during World War II, Frank shared in the values of a generation that helped make our country what it is today: a sense of honor and bravery, a commitment to service, and above all, a love of family and country.  In 1943, at the height of the U.S. action in World War II, Frank enlisted in the U.S. Navy and was assigned to the Pacific theater, leaving behind his sweetheart, Dorothy Mlaker. While on duty in the Pacific, Frank sent a letter to Dorothy proposing marriage. Later, after receiving her acceptance letter, Frank ordered an engagement ring from the catalog of a Chicago jeweler. He sent payment to the jeweler via money order, with instructions for the ring to be mailed to Dorothy. When he was able to take leave, Frank returned to Springfield and wed Dorothy on July 26, 1944.  Frank was honorably discharged from the U.S. Navy in 1945, having been awarded the Asiatic-Pacific and Good Conduct Medals. Upon his return to civilian life, Frank began his 25-year career as a salesman with several of Springfield's finest men's clothiers, including Robert's Brothers, Arch Wilson's, and Myers Brothers.  Frank again answered the call to serve his country when he joined the U.S. Naval Reserve in 1949. He was called to active duty during the Korean war in 1952, and he was stationed with the Department of Defense in Arlington, VA. In 1979, Frank retired from the Naval Reserve, having served 30 years and achieved the rank of chief petty officer yeoman.  Frank demonstrated his commitment to service not only through his career in the military, but also through his many civic activities. He served the community of Springfield as an active member of AFSCME, as a parishioner of Christ the King Catholic Church and Blessed Sacrament Catholic Church, and as a life member of the Knights of Columbus. In addition, Frank Stead served on the board of directors and was past president of Saint John's Hospital Samaritans. He also served on the board of directors of the Illinois chapter of AARP.  In 1974, Frank Stead was appointed executive director of the Springfield Election Commission, serving in that post for 15 years before retiring in 1989. Later, he would serve as a Democratic Precinct Committeeman in Springfield. I came to know Frank and his wife, Dorothy, well through their involvement in Springfield politics. They volunteered countless hours for my campaign when I was running for the House of Representatives.  Frank and Dorothy Stead shared nearly 60 years of marriage before Dorothy passed away on February 4, 2004. They are survived by their four children: one son and three daughters, along with seven grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.  I am honored to have had the opportunity to know this fine member of our Nation's ``Greatest Generation.'' His military service, civic involvement, commitment to his faith, and love of family have left an enduring impression on those of us who had the pleasure of knowing him. He will be missed.                          ____________________[Page S2143]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                      TRIBUTE TO FRANCIS P.
