President, I am pleased to join with my good friend and colleague, the Senator from Louisiana, Mary Landrieu, in introducing the Access to Affordable Health Care Act. This is a comprehensive seven-point plan that builds on the strengths of our current programs, both public and private, to make quality affordable health care available to millions more Americans.  One of my top priorities in the Senate has been to expand access to affordable health care to all Americans. There are still far too many people in our country without health insurance or with woefully inadequate coverage. An estimated 39 million Americans do not have health care insurance, including more than 150,000 in my home State of Maine.  The fact is, health insurance matters. The simple fact is that people with health insurance are healthier than those who lack coverage. People without health insurance are less likely to seek care when they need it and tend to forgo services such as periodic checkups and preventative services. As a consequence, they are far more likely to be hospitalized or to require costly medical attention for conditions that could have been prevented or cured if caught at an early stage.  Not only does this put the health of these individuals at greater risk, but it also puts additional pressure on our already financially challenged hospitals and emergency rooms. Compared with people who have health insurance coverage, uninsured adults are four times and uninsured children five times more likely to use a hospital emergency room. The costs of care for these individuals are often absorbed by providers and then passed on to covered individuals through increased fees and higher insurance premiums.  Maine is in the midst of a growing health insurance crisis. Insurance premiums are rising at alarming rates. Whether I am talking to a self-employed fisherman or the owner of a struggling small business or the human resources manager of a large corporation, the cost of health insurance is a common concern.  In 1999, the average family premium for employer-based coverage in Maine was more than $6,000, the 14th highest in the Nation at that time. Since then, Maine employers have faced premium increases of as much as 40 percent a year. In fact, my own brother called me recently to tell me that his small business is faced with a 40-percent increase in health insurance premiums on top of a 30-percent increase the year before.  These premium increases are particularly burdensome for smaller businesses, the backbone of Maine's economy. Many small business owners are caught in a real squeeze. They know if they pass on the premium increase to their employees, then more and more employees will be forced to decline coverage and, thus, will be completely uninsured, and yet these small employers simply cannot continue to absorb premium increases of 20 to 30 to 40 percent year after year.  The problem of rising costs is even more acute for individuals and families who must purchase health insurance on their own. Anthem Blue Cross/Blue Shield, the single remaining carrier in Maine's nongroup market, has increased its rates by 40 percent over the past 2 years. Monthly insurance premiums often exceed the family's monthly mortgage payments. It is no wonder that more than 150,000 Mainers are now uninsured. Clearly, we simply must do more to make health insurance more affordable and more available.  The Access to Affordable Health Care Act, which Senator Landrieu and I are introducing today, is a 7-point plan that combines a variety of public and private approaches to make quality health care coverage more affordable.  The legislation's seven goals are: One, to expand access to affordable health care for small businesses; two, to make health insurance more affordable for individuals and families purchasing coverage on their own; three, to strengthen the health care safety net for those who lack coverage; four, to expand access to care in rural and underserved areas; five, to increase access to affordable long-term care; six, to promote healthier lifestyles, and seven, to provide more equitable Medicare payments to Maine providers to reduce the Medicare shortfall.  This shortfall, this lack of fair reimbursement for Medicare services, has forced hospitals, physicians, and other providers to shift costs on to other payers in the form of higher charges. That drives up the cost of health insurance, and it is one of the reasons that Maine's rates are higher than the insurance rates in most other States.  I will discuss each of these seven points in more detail. First, expanding access for small businesses, this legislation builds upon a bill I introduced with Senator Landrieu last year to help small employers cope with rising health care costs. Since most Americans get their health insurance through their employers, it is a common assumption that people without health insurance are unemployed, but that is not accurate. The fact is most uninsured Americans are members of families with at least one full-time worker.  As many as 82 percent of Americans without health insurance are in a family with a full-time worker. Uninsured working Americans are most often the employees of small businesses. In fact, some 60 percent of uninsured workers are employed by small firms. Smaller firms generally face higher costs for health insurance than larger companies, which makes them less likely to offer coverage.  I know from my conversations with small businesses all over Maine that they want to offer health insurance as a benefit for their employees. They know it would help them to attract and retain good workers. The only reason these small businesses are not offering health insurance is a simple one: They simply cannot afford the premium costs.  The legislation we are introducing today will help small businesses cope with rising costs by providing new tax credits for them to make health insurance more affordable. It will encourage those small businesses who are now offering health insurance to continue to do so in the face of escalating premiums. It will encourage them to make the decision not to drop coverage, and it will prompt small employers who want to provide this coverage but have found it financially out of reach, to now offer this important benefit.  The legislation will also help to increase the clout of small businesses in negotiating with insurers. Premiums are generally higher for smaller businesses because they do not have as much purchasing power as large companies. This limits their ability to bargain for lower rates. They also tend to have higher administrative costs than larger companies because they have fewer employees among whom to spread the fixed costs of a health insurance plan.  Moreover, they are not able to spread the risks of medical claims over as many employees as large firms. The legislation we are introducing will help address these problems by authorizing Federal grants to provide start-up funding to States to assist them with the planning, development, and operation of small employer purchasing cooperatives.  I am not talking about association health plans, which are controversial for a number of reasons. I am talking about small employer purchasing cooperatives. They will help to reduce the costs of health insurance for small employers by allowing them to band together to purchase insurance jointly.  Group purchasing cooperatives have a number of advantages for smaller employers. They will, for example, bring an increased number of participants into the group and that helps to lower the premium costs. They also decrease the risk of adverse selection. Our legislation would also authorize a Small Business Administration grant program for States, local governments, and nonprofits to provide information about the benefits of health insurance to smaller employers, including the tax benefits, the increased productivity of employees and decreased turnover. Grants would be used to make employers aware of their current rights under State and Federal laws.  For example, one survey showed that 57 percent of small employers did not realize they could deduct 100 percent of the costs of their health insurance premiums as a business expense.  The legislation that Senator Landrieu and I are introducing would also create a new program to encourage innovation by awarding demonstration grants in up to 10 States to look at innovative coverage expansion such as alternative group purchasing or pooling arrangements, individual or small group market reforms, or subsidies to employers or individuals purchasing coverage.  The States have been the laboratories of reform. For example, some States have looked at providing assistance to employees to help them afford their share of an employer-provided insurance plan.  Second, the Access to Affordable Health Care Act will help expand access to affordable health care for individuals and families who are purchasing coverage on their own. It would, for example, allow self-employed Americans to deduct the full amount of their health care premiums retroactive to January 1 of this year.  Some 25 million Americans are in families headed by a self-employed individual, and of these 5 million are uninsured. So if we establish parity in the tax treatment for health insured costs between the self-employed and those working for large corporations, we will promote equity, and we will help to reduce the number of uninsured by working Americans.  Another step this bill would take would build on the success of the State children's health insurance program,one of the very first bills I sponsored as a Senator. This program provides insurance for children of low-income families who cannot afford health insurance and yet earn too much money to qualify for Medicaid.  We are proposing that we allow, as Senator Kennedy's family care bill would, the option for States to cover the parents of children who are enrolled in programs like Maine's MaineCare program. States could also use funds provided through this program to help eligible working families pay their share of an employer-based health insurance plan. In short, this legislation will help ensure low-income working families receive the health care they need.  Another provision of the bill would allow States to expand coverage to eligible legal immigrants through the Medicaid and SCHIP programs. Maine is one of a number of States that is already covering eligible legal immigrants, pregnant women, and children under Medicaid using 100 percent State dollars. Giving States the option of covering these children and families under Medicaid will enable them to receive Federal matching funds.  Another provision of the bill would give States the option of extending Medicaid to childless adults below 125 percent of the Federal poverty level who cannot afford private insurance and who have been forgotten or overlooked by other public programs. Maine has applied for a waiver to expand its Medicaid Program in this way, and the State estimates this will provide health coverage to an estimated 16,000 low-income uninsured Mainers.  Many people with serious health problems encounter difficulties in finding a company that is willing to insure them. To address this problem, the Collins-Landrieu bill authorizes Federal grants to provide money for States to create high-risk pools through which individuals who have preexisting health conditions can obtain affordable health insurance.  Finally, the legislation in this section would provide an advanceable, refundable tax credit of up to $1,000 for individuals earning up to $30,000, and up to $3,000 for families earning up to $60,000.  This provision, which is similar to that proposed by President Bush, would help to provide coverage for up to 6 million Americans who otherwise would be uninsured for 1 or more months. It will help many more working lower income families who currently purchase private health insurance with little or no government help and finding it increasingly difficult to do so.  Third, the Access to Affordable Health Insurance Act will help to strengthen our Nation's health care safety net by doubling funding over the next 5 years for community health centers. We want to make sure we are reaching individuals who are homeless, individuals who are migrant workers, individuals who are living in public housing. These centers, which operate in underserved rural and urban communities, provide critical primary care services to millions of Americans, regardless of their ability to pay. About 20 percent of the patients treated at Maine's community health centers have no insurance coverage. Many more have inadequate coverage. These community health centers play a critical role in providing a health care safety net for some of our most vulnerable individuals.  The problem of access to affordable health care services is not limited to the uninsured. It is also shared by many Americans living in rural and underserved areas where there is a serious shortage of health care providers. The legislation we are introducing, therefore, includes a number of provisions to strengthen the National Health Service Corps, which supports doctors, dentists, and other clinicians who serve in rural and inner-city areas.  For example, taxing students adversely affects their financial incentive to participate in the National Health Service Corps and provide health care services in underserved communities. Last year's tax bill provided a tax deduction for National Health Service Corps scholarship recipients to deduct all tuition, fees, and related educational expenses from their income taxes. The deduction did not extend to loan repayment recipients however, so loan repayment amounts are still taxed as income. Participants in the loan repayment program are actually given extra payment amounts to help them cover their tax lability which, frankly, is a little ridiculous. It makes much more sense to simply exempt them from taxation in the first place.  In addition, the legislation will allow National Health Service Corps participants to fulfill their commitment on a part-time basis. Current law requires all National Health Service Corps participants to serve full time. Many rural communities, however, simply do not have enough volume to support a full-time health care practitioner. Moreover, some sites may not need a particular type of provider--for example, a dentist--on a full-time basis. Some practitioners may also find part-time service more attractive, which, in turn, could improve recruitment and retention. Our bill will therefore give the program additional flexibility to meet community needs.  Long-term care is the major catastrophic health care expense faced by older American today, and these costs will only increase with the aging of the baby boomers. Most Americans mistakenly believe that Medicare or their private health insurance policies will cover the costs of long-term care should they develop a chronic illness or cognitive impairment like Alzheimer's Disease. Unfortunately, far too many do not discover that they do not have coverage until they are confronted with the difficult decision of placing a much-loved parent or spouse in long-term care and facing the shocking realization that they will have to cover the costs themselves.  The Access to Affordable Health Care Act will provide a tax credit for long-term care expenses of up to $3,000 to provide some help to those families struggling to provide long-term care to a loved one. It will also encourage more Americans to plan for their future long-term care needs by providing a tax deduction to help them purchase private long-term insurance.  Health insurance alone is not going to ensure good health. As noted author and physician Dr. Michael Crichton has observed, ``the future of medicine lies not in treating illness, but preventing it.'' Many of our most serious health problems are directly related to unhealthy behaviors-- smoking, lack of regular exercise, and poor diet. These three major risk factors alone have made Maine the State with the fourth highest death rate due to four largely preventable disease: Cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic lung disease and diabetes. These four chronic diseases are reponsible for 70 percent of the health care problems in Maine.  Our bill therefore contains a number of provisions designed to promoted healthy lifestyles. An ever-expanding body of evidence shows that these kinds of investment in health promotiong and prevention offer returns not only in reduced health care bill, but in longer life and increased productivity. The legislation will provide grants to States to assist small businesses wishing to establish ``worksite wellness'' programs for their employees. It would also authorize a grant program to support new and existing ``community partnerships,'' such as the Healthy Community Coalition in Franklin County, to promote healthy lifestyles among hospitals, employers, schools and community organizations. And, it would provide funds for States to establish or expand comprehensive school health education, including, for example, physical education programs that promote lifelong physical activity, healthy food service selections, and programs that promote a healthy and safe school environment.  And finally, the Access to Affordable Health Care Act would promote equity in Medicare payments and help to ensure that the Medicare system rewards rather than punishes States like Maine that deliver high-quality, cost effective Medicare services to our elderly and disabled citizens.  According to a recent study in the Journal of the American Medical Association, Maine ranks third in the nation when it comes to the quality of care delivered to our Medicare beneficiaries. Yet we are 11th from the bottom when it comes to per-beneficiary Medicare spending.  The fact is that Maine's Medicare dollars are being used to subsidize higher reimbursements in other parts of the country. This simply is not fair.Medicare's reimbursement systems have historically tended to favor urban areas and failed to take the special needs of rural States into account. Ironically, Maine's low payment rates are also the result of its long history of providing high-quality, cost-effective care. In the early 1980s, Maine's lower than average costs were used to justify lower payment rates. Since then, Medicare's payment policies have only served to widen the gap between low and high-cost States.  As a consequence, Maine's hospitals, physicians, and other providers have experienced a serious Medicare shortfall, which has forced them to shift costs on to other payers in the form of higher charges. The Medicare shortfall is one of the reasons that Maine has among the highest health insurance premiums in the Nation. The provisions in the Access to Affordable Health Care Act provide a complement to legislation that I introduced earlier this year with Senator Russ Feingold to promote greater fairness in Medicare payments to physicians and other health professionals by eliminating outdated geographic adjustment factors that discriminate against rural areas.  Mr. President, the Access to Affordable Health Care Act outlines a blueprint for reform based upon principles upon which I believe a bipartisan majority in Congress could agree. The plan takes significant strides toward the goal of universal health care coverage by bringing million more Americans into the insurance system, by strengthening the health care safety net, and by addressing the inequities in the Medicare system.                                 ______                                       By
