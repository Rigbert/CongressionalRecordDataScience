 President, I think it is outrageous that, of all things to choose, this latest temporary spending bill cuts spending for the 100,000 Cops on the Beat Program under the 1994 crime law. I want to make clear that the only reason I'm voting for this continuing resolution is because it is a compromise and would allow States and localities to continue hiring cops for the next 49 days. The alternative is no cops.  But this is a terrible way to implement public policy. This continuing resolution would, if extended over a full year, cut the Cops on the Beat Program by over one-half--over $1 billion promised to the American people for cops on the street. That means that communities across the Nation would lose over 13,000 police officers. That is totally unacceptable.  This continuing resolution funds the Cops Program at 75 percent of the 1995 level for outlays, which was $1.187 billion. Seventy-five percent of that would be $890 million for the year.  In contrast, full funding for the 100,000 Cops Program for 1996 is $1.9 billion. That is what we agreed on in the 1994 crime law. That is what was requested by the President. So this resolution would actually cut over $1 billion from the Cops on the Beat Program--over one-half--if it continued for the full year.  Let no one be fooled. This continuing resolution is a back door attempt by Republicans to reverse the gains of the 100,000 Cops Program and the American people will not stand for this the next time around. We all know the Republicans want to change the crime law now at work. They said so in their Contract With America. We all know the Republicans want to eliminate the 100,000 Cops on the Beat Program.  They would rather see the money squandered away in a block grant that funds virtually anything under the sun than to send the money directly to COPS for the one anticrime measure we know works--community policing. Cops on the Beat.  The Cops on the Beat Program is overwhelmingly supported by the American public as well as every major law enforcement group in the country. I don't know a single responsible police leader, academic expert, or public official who does not agree that putting more police officers on our streets and in our neighborhoods is the best way to fight crime.  Community policing enables police to fight crime on two fronts at once--they are better positioned to respond and apprehend suspects when crime occurs, but even more importantly, they are also better positioned to keep crime from occurring in the first place.  The reports from the field all across the Nation are the same--community policing works. When it comes to anticrime efforts, the one thing we know is that more community police officers means less crime. And we should keep our word to the American people.  The 1994 crime law targets $8.8 billion for States and localities to train and hire 100,000 new community police officers over 6 years.  And as we pass the 1-year mark, it is already clear that the Cops Program is working even beyond expectations. Already, more than 33,000 out of 100,000 cops are funded in every State in the Nation. And because of the way we've set it up--with a match requirement and spreading out the cost over a period of years--the money will continue to work, keeping these cops on the beat and preventing crime in our communities far into the future. In a word, the law is working.  But that progress will come to a screeching halt if my Republican colleagues get their way--either through drastic spending cuts as under this continuing resolution or through block grants with loopholes you could drive a truck through.  What is one to conclude from the efforts of the Republicans to gut the 100,000 Cops on the Beat Program? Is it that tax cuts to a few are more important than protecting the safety of average Americans?  Apparently my Republican colleagues in Washington just don't seem to get the message. So let me make this crystal clear. If they think that they will use their new targeted appropriations strategy to kill the Cops on the Beat Program--to cut $1 billion and thousands of cops--they are sorely mistaken. I will do everything in my power to prevent the Republicans from further undermining the 100,000 Cops Program.  So, although this continuing resolution funds cops at 75 percent of last year's outlays for the next 49 days, this indirect ambush on the 100,000 Cops on the Beat Program--a program demanded by the American people--will not be tolerated for the full year.                          ____________________
