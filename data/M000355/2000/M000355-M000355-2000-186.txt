 President, I rise today to congratulate students at my alma mater, duPont Manual High School, for their victory in the U.S. Department of Energy's National Science Bowl.  I am proud to share with my colleagues that a team of five students from duPont Manual High School in Louisville, Kentucky, are the champions of the 2000 National Science Bowl. These young scholars worked diligently to reach the competition and through their academic excellence and teamwork, prevailed at the end of a tough, four-day challenge held in Chevy Chase, Maryland.  First, and most importantly, I recognize the students on this year's Manual High School team and commend them for their hard work and determination: Mariah Cummins, Marty Mudd, Matthew Reece, Gabe Wood, and Yan Xuan.  I also applaud and thank their teacher, Skip Zwanzig, who taught these students and provided the leadership which brought them to this year's competition.  The National Science Bowl is a rigorous academic competition among teams of high school students. This year is the 10th anniversary of the program, which has brought more than 60,000 high school mathematics and science students from across the country together in competition since its inception in 1991. The program is designed to encourage students and their teachers to achieve educational excellence in science and math. Competing teams are quizzed on topics in biology, chemistry, physics, astronomy, earth science, computer science, and mathematics.  Congratulations, Manual High, on your win and thank you for continuing Louisville's and the State of Kentucky's tradition of excellence in education.                          ____________________
