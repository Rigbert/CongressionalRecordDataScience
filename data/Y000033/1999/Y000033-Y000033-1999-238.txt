Mr. Speaker, today I would like to congratulate and honor two outstanding Alaskan students who have achieved national recognition for exemplary volunteer service in their community. Frank Cyra-Korsgaard and Esther Perman, both of Anchorage, have just been named one of my state's top honorees in The 1999 Prudential Spirit of Community Awards program, an annual honor conferred on the most impressive student volunteers in each state, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.  Mr. Cyra-Korsgaard is being recognized for his organization of ``Run for the Books'' which provided reading materials for homeless teens at Covenant House Alaska. Frank worked with Covenant House, identified adult mentors, solicited sponsors such as Barnes and Noble bookstore, promoted the event and organized the logistics. Eighty-two people ran in the event, including the Mayor of Anchorage and another 40 contributed, resulting in donations of more than 200 books and $3,600. Frank has been invited to speak about community service at a national education conference and wants to host another run next year.  Ms. Perman is being recognized for her organization of replacing the ``Rocket'', a much loved piece of equipment that had been removed from a local playground because it failed to meet safety regulations. Esther learned that the city was going to update the playground, but spend most of the allocated funds on a new parking lot. She was appalled and began to rally the support of other kids and adults. Esther conducted a survey of the city's young people and presented the results, along with the request for a new Rocket, at a city council meeting. Over the course of many meetings, Esther convinced the council to overturn its original plan and spend more money updating the playground and less on the parking lot. The council also agreed to work with the kids in town to design a new Rocket.  In light of numerous statistics that indicate Americans today are less involved in their communities than they once were, it's vital that we encourage and support the kind of selfless contributions these young citizens made. People of all ages need to think more about how we, as individual citizens, can work together at the local level to ensure the health and vitality of our towns and neighborhoods. Young volunteers like Mr. Cyra-Korsgaard and Ms. Perman are inspiring examples to all of us, and are among our brightest hopes for a better tomorrow.                          ____________________
