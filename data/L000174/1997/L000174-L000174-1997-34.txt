President, my friend from Mississippi has raised the issue of the appropriations bills. Senators, as he knows, have been working very, very hard on that--the distinguished chairman of the committee, Mr. Stevens, the distinguished ranking member, Mr. Byrd, and those of us who are either ranking or chairmen of the appropriate subcommittees that are involved, in this case three key ones.  Mr. President, I note, as we have discussed privately, that there will not be a perfect piece of appropriations legislation, I say to my friend from Mississippi, from anyone's point of view. It is not precisely what he would write if he were to write it solely by himself; it is not precisely what I would write if I wrote it solely by myself, and we could say that with the other 98 men and women in this body.  At some point, when you are down to the last few hours of the session, we have to allow the committee system and the leadership system to work, where senior Members, especially of appropriations, where senior Members in both parties, in both bodies have to come together and reach an agreement, realizing that not every single Member on the left or on the right is going to like it. But you have to trust at some point some question of seniority in putting this together.  I didn't care much for the seniority system when I came here 23 years ago, but having studied it for 23 years, I understand it so much better now. I say to my friend, the majority leader, and I think he would agree with me, that in the last few days of the session, especially with appropriations, you are not going to get a bill that is going to please every single Member 100 percent, but we have to get something done because at some point you have to fish or cut bait.  I just mention that because I know the distinguished majority leader has been working as hard on this as anybody else to get us to this point.
