President, when the Senator from Arizona asked to make his unanimous consent request, I was in the process of answering the question of the Senator from Florida, who has spoken to me many times about his interest in these areas.  I appreciate what he has done to strengthen this legislation.  We keep the authority to set sentences where it belongs, with the Sentencing Commission, while remaining deferential, to the discretion of prosecutors.  The provisions from the Senator from Florida make it unmistakably clear that Congress expects this legislation to be used not just to punish spammers but also to dismantle criminal operations that are carried out with spam and other unsolicited bulk e-mail.  I also would note that the Senator from Florida has spoken about spam evolving from being just a nuisance. He is absolutely right. Serious crimes are being committed using this medium, which reaches a large number of people. Senior citizens are more and more often targeted to being bilked out of millions of dollars, and with very little effort on the part of the spammers.  Mr. President, I will engage in a colloquy with Senator Nelson because I think it is important for the purposes of the Record. With all the work the Senator from Florida has done, I want the Record to be very clear.
