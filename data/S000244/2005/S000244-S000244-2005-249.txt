 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1442, which completes the codification of title 46, United States Code, relating to shipping as positive law. The ranking member of the Committee on the Judiciary, Mr. Conyers, and I jointly introduced this legislation on March 17, 2005. The bill was prepared by the Office of the Law Revision Counsel as a part of the program required by title 2 United States Code section 285(b) to prepare and submit to the Committee on the Judiciary, one title at a time, a complete compilation, restatement and revision of the generaland permanent laws of the United States.  This bill, as well as any other bill submitted by the Office of Law Revision Counsel under this program, makes no substantive changes in existing law nor is it intended to do so. Thus, Members should understand that because of the nature of this bill, supporting it does not imply support of the underlying provisions that are being reorganized and cleaned up. This is a necessary bill. I urge Members to support it.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
