 President, I am sorry that I cannot vote for this appropriations bill today. We must move quickly to resolve the issues that still remain from last year's prolonged, confrontational, and, in the end, fruitless budget debates. But this bill will not advance that cause.  This bill, despite the best efforts of the distinguished leaders of the Appropriations Committee, still falls short. I am heartened that a majority of the Senate was moved to approve more adequate funding for our Nation's educational system. There is certainly no higher priority for us than preparing our country's young people for the future.  But that is not the only priority our country has, Mr. President, nor is it our only responsibility here in Congress. And, I am sorry to say, I find that this bill does not fulfill those responsibilities.  Our attempts to provide more support for the infrastructure investments we need for cleaner air and water were an inadequate step in the right direction. And we failed to meet our responsibility to maintain our country's hard-won superiority in high-technology research and development.  It is surely a false economy if we claim that we must sacrifice clean air and clean water, that we must roll back the progress we have made in advanced technologies, to balance the budget.  That is simply not the case. Amendments that provided more adequate support for those key national priorities at the same time specified the savings from other parts of the budget needed to neutralize their impact on the deficit.  Mr. President, we could have met those responsibilities and still kept within the tight spending limits set by this bill. But we chose not to, Mr. President. And if the Senate bill falls short, Mr. President, the version of this legislation passed by the House, I fear is even worse.  But, Mr. President, I must oppose this omnibus appropriations bill for one overriding reason--this bill slashes the effort to add 100,000 more police to our Nation's streets. This is the single-most-important crime-fighting initiative the Federal Government has undertaken in decades and I will not be party to any effort to go back on our word to add 100,000 police officers to the streets and neighborhoods all across America.  I have spoken with the White House and the President agrees that the only course to take on the 100,000 cops program is unequivocal and unwavering support for adding 100,000 cops to our streets--all dedicated to community policing. This program is working--more than 33,000 police have already been funded.  What is more, the results of community policing speak for themselves--more cops mean less crime.  To cite just one specific example--look what has happened in New York City. More police devoted to community policing has proven to mean lesscrime--in the first 6 months of 1995 compared to the first 6 months of 1994: murder is down by 30 percent; robbery is down by 22 percent; burglary is down by 18 percent; and car theft is down by 25 percent.  In the face of that success in fighting America's crime epidemic, it would be folly to go back on our commitment to adding 100,000 cops. ``If it ain't broke, don't fix it''--as a former President used to say.  That, unfortunately, is exactly what the latest continuing resolution proposes to do--instead of fully funding the President's request for the 100,000 cops program, this latest proposal would slash the 1996 request for the cops program to $975 million--about one-half the $1.9 billion request.  Not only is the 100,000 cops program subject to extreme cuts--but the latest continuing resolution also takes nearly $813 million that was supposed to go to the 100,000 cops program to fund a so-called law enforcement block grant program.  What is wrong with this approach?  First, this so-called law enforcement block grant is written so broadly that the money could be spent on everything from prosecutors to probation officers to traffic lights or parking meters--and not a single new cop.  Second, this block grant has never been authorized by the Senate. So, let's be clear on what is being done here. What this continuing resolution does is take a crime bill that has been passed only by the House, whose funds have been authorized only by the House, whose block grant idea has already been rejected by the Senate, and incorporate it into an appropriations bill so it is passed and funded--all in one fell swoop.  Mr. President, if we are going to legislate by fiat like this, then we might as well do away with committees, with hearings, with subcommittee markups, with full committee markups, and with careful consideration of authorizing legislation. We could simply do all the Senate's business on appropriations bills or continuing resolutions.  I, for one, happen to believe that's a terrible way to proceed and I believe that's reason enough to oppose this bill.  If the Republicans want to change the crime bill, they have the right to try--but let's do it the right way and then let's vote on it. Wiping out major pieces of the most significant anti-crime legislation ever passed by the Congress on an appropriations bill makes a mockery of our Senate process. The importance of the programs we are considering, not to mention the perception of our institution, demands better.  Thank you, Mr. President.                 Vote on Amendment No. 3466, as amended
