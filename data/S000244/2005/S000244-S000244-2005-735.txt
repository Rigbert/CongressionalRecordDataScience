Chairman. I believe the Chair has not called for further amendments to title V, and the proposed amendment of the gentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler) is to title VI. I do not think title V has been closed out yet.  The Acting CHAIRMAN. The amendment of the gentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler) proposes to add a new title after title V. The gentleman is correct that the adoption of such an amendment would close title V to further amendment. But the Chair is unaware of any further amendment to title V.
