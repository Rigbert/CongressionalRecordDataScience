President, I see now that my distinguished colleague from Utah has someone to speak on the other side. I am about to yield to him. I hope, though, that those who watch this debate around the world will realize that we are making debate on what is the world's strongest economy, the strongest economy recorded history has ever shown. I worry sometimes when I hear this denigration of our economy and that we need gimmicks to fix it. It is like some of the debate on the military budget during the cold war: Oh, my God, we are falling so far behind, until someone said, well, would we trade our Air Force for the Soviet Air Force or our Navy for the Soviet Navy or our Army for the Soviet Army? And everybody said, Oh, of course not. I ask just one question. Would we trade the U.S. economy for any economy in the world?  I yield the floor.
