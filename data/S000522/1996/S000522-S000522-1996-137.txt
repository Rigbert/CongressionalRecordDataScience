Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Texas [Mr. Bryant] and I have been through a lot on a year-long journey to implement immigration reform legislation. I feel like we are a little like the two characters in Lonesome Dove, Woodrow and Gus. While we may sometimes disagree, I am not going to take any shots at my partner in this endeavor. Instead, I do want to tell my colleagues why this is such a good bill and why it puts the interest of American families, workers, and taxpayers first.  This legislation will reduce illegal immigration and reform legal immigration. It will help secure our borders, reduce crime, and protect jobs for American citizens. It will encourage legal immigrants to be productive members of our communities and ease the burden on the hardworking taxpayers.  For only the fourth time this century, Congress now considers comprehensive immigration reform. I thank my colleagues for their patience, for their interest, and for their support. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the motion to recommit and ``yes'' on final passage.
