 President, in July 1989, Ong Son Sue Chi, leader of the National League for Democracy was placed under house arrest. In spite of her arrest, National League for Democracy representatives swept the elections, held the following May, winning 392 of the 485 seats in Parliament. As we all know, the State Law and Order Restoration Council, SLORC, rejected the outcome and has maintained an iron grip on Burma ever since.  While Sue Chi has now been released, today like all others for the people of Burma marks one more day of ruthless repression. The recent U.N. Special Rapporteur summed up the view of every human rights group and democratic activist I have spoken with. People are fearful that whatever they say or do will risk interrogation or arrest. In cold and dispassionate terms he reported his concern about forced labor, forced porterage, forced relocations, arbitrary killings, beatings, rape, and confiscation of property by the army.  I urge all of you to read the July National Geographic article on Burma. While holding out hope that Burma's rich natural resources will someday offer its people a prosperous future, the article describes how clearly the SLORC enriches itself using fear and intimidation to exploit both the people and the land--an opinion shared by the Wall Street Journal.  Some of you might ask why I am more concerned about Burma than other countries questionable human or political rights records. I am hard pressed to find another regime on earth that I find as insulted, self serving, and repugnant.  This is not a honorable government interested in stability and freedom. It is a dictatorship and signs cease-fires with ethnic leaders then unleashes 10,000 well-armed troops on their camps of supporters. Last December, when Manerplaw was under attack, I offered the view that SLORC would release Sue Chi after annihilating all the groups that actively supported her democracy movement. The fall of Manerplaw generated 80,000 refugees. Today, as we speak, Karenni camps are under siege, in direct violation of a negotiated cease-fire. Twenty thousand civilians have fled the fighting.  SLORC is not a responsible government interested in development--it is a corrupt dictatorship driven to protect its power and wealth. While people starve, this regime has spent 45 percent of its budget on arms.  Unlike China, where I believe economic liberalization is benefiting hundreds of thousands of people and leading to political change, only SLORC officials and their cronies benefit in Burma. I think that is why there is unanimous support for this legislation from Burmese student, ethnic and democratic leaders alike.  Before talking about the bill, I want to take just a minute to discuss why I think it is important to move legislation at this point.  As we redefine our priorities in the post-cold-war world, there is an urgency to transnational threats. I put international narcotics trafficking and crime at the top of my list of concerns.  In 1986, 15 percent of the heroin coming into this country was coming from Asia, now it's 65 percent. Just as important is the purity. National and local law enforcement officials in Kentucky tell me that 10 years ago, heroin on our streets was 2 to 3 percent pure. Today it's anywhere from 25 to 65 percent pure.  Heroin trafficking is a serious national security threat.  In a Foreign Operations Subcommittee hearing I recently asked the Assistant Secretary of State for Asia, Win Lord, several questions on Burma, SLORC, and the narcotics problem. His response offers insight into why I think we should press to isolate the SLORC.  Since SLORC has an enormous security apparatus with a tight grip on the nation, I asked him what were the major impediments to an effective counternarcotics effort. He said,       What is going to solve the problem over the long run is a      popular, representative open government--all other efforts      are minuscule compared to whether you have an open system      there.I agree.  Last November a senior State Department official issued an ultimatum to the SLORC--bilateral relations would only improve if there was progress on human rights, democracy, and counternarcotics. No one disputes, inside or outside the administration, that we have seen a real deterioration on all fronts. Unfortunately, the administration has failed to follow through. A few weeks ago, Ambassador Albright visited Burma. According to news accounts she reiterated the November message--we want to see improvements.  SLORC must be wondering by now--improvements, or what?  What are the real consequences? So far, none.  Which is why I have decided to move forward with this legislation. Let me turn now to the contents of the amendment.  I think we would all agree that unilateral sanctions are not as successful in applying pressure to a government as an international effort. There are several provisions which address U.S. unilateral action including banning investment, trade, imports, aid and support through international financial institutions. I also require the President to initiate negotiations to secure support with our trading partners for international sanctions. Countries failing to reach agreement on an embargo will risk their MFN and and GSP status.  At this point, after years of self-imposed exile, there is very little foreign investment in Burma. I am willing to guess that few nations will be willing to put their existing trading relationship with the United States at risk for potential future financial gain in Burma.  The amendment also requires the executive director at international financial institutions to vote against loans to China if the PRC continues to sell or transfer arms to Burma. The State Department estimates that SLORC spends 45 percent of their budget on weapons--arms used solely to terrorize their own citizens.  The amendment will also suspend United States assistance to Thailand if there continues to be a lack of cooperation in the provision of relief and support to students, refugees, and democratic activists living in exile. Students and leaders have been arbitrarily detained, arrested, had their offices broken into and documents removed. The problems are usually resolved when various officials are paid so-called fees and fines. I am not suggesting that there is a condoned program orchestrated by the Thai Government at work, but I do think there should be a more serious effort to control the conduct of rogue officials.  The amendment also requires several reports among which is one on SLORC's chemical and biological weapons capabilities. In the attacks carried out last year against various camps, thee were a number of eyewitness accounts of the use of some kind of toxic substance. I understand clothing and other items have been turned over to the U.S. labs for analysis. I earnestly hope the report advises us that there is no reason to believe the SLORC has a CBW capability.  Let me conclude with a personal observation made recently by an International Red Cross official with years of experience in Asia. After dragging their feet for 7 years, the SLORC recently rejected the ICRC's request for access to political prisoners. Although they stand ready to return at any point, the ICRC decided to withdraw in July because SLORC will not grant them the simplest of terms, which 59 other countries accept, that being unsupervised, regular access to political prisoners. I think at one point SLORC offered access to Sue Chi, but she courageously declined asking that she not be given any preferential treatment not offered to other political prisoners.  When asked when and why the talks collapsed, this official said,       Last summer when they started to really make money. SLORC      realized they could secure their position and their wealth      without paying any political price.  Shortly after she was released, SUU CHI cautiously welcomed this legislation saying,       These are very tough sanctions. They--the sponsor--have      shown they are interested in how the democracy movement      progresses. I am very grateful for it.  In July she was reluctant to directly call for a ban on investment fearing retaliation by SLORC. Now that months have passed with no progress she has taken a tougher stand. In a recent interview with an Australian journalist she called for a suspension of foreign investment until real progress on the democratic front has been achieved.  I think it is important that we respect and promote that agenda. Keeping the pressure on SLORC will assure that her release is translated from a symbolic gesture to freedom and democracy for all Burmese.  Mr. President, let me conclude by noting this initiative is supported by a wide variety of organizations and individuals including Nobel Laureate Betty Williams and Desmond Tutu, the AFL-CIO, the Democratic Burmese Students Organization, the National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma, the American Baptist Convention, the Asian-American Civic Alliance, and the United Front for Democracy and Human Rights in Burma. I have also heard from ethnic leaders endorsing the approach including ministers representing the Karen, Karenni, and Mon people. I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record letters from some of the these groups.  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma,            Office of the Prime Minister,                                   Washington, DC, March 29, 1995.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     U.S. Senate, Russell Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: I have recently learned of your      intention to introduce a bill to impose US economic sanctions      on Burma. On behalf of the democratically elected government      of Burma, I am writing to give you my wholehearted support as      well as that of my government in your effort.       The imposition of sanctions should never be taken lightly.      Any measure designed to constrict the economy of a country      will cause some degree of hardship to the people. However, I      believe, and the democratic forces working to liberate our      country believe, that foreign investment serves to      strengthen the outlaw State Law and Restoration Council (SLORC). It is      providing SLORC with the means to finance a massive army and      intelligence service whose only job is to crush internal      dissent. SLORC controls all foreign investment into Burma and      channels contracts to the military and its party officials.      Unlike other countries, investment will not serve to create a      middle class of entrepreneurs, only reinforce allegiance to a      regime that has murdered tens of thousands of people whose      crime was the desire for democracy and to live in a free      society. SLORC is in desperate need of foreign currency.      Cutting off access to US funds will be a severe blow to      SLORC.       Your decision to move forward on this issue will not be      popular with the US business community or countries in Europe      and Asia. There are many who place trade and money over      Burma's deplorable narcotics, political, and human rights      record. I applaud your courage and will do everything in my      power to see you succeed.       The United States has a very special place in the hearts of      my countrymen. During the massive democracy demonstrations in      1988, students could be seen marching in Rangoon carrying      American flags and demonstrating in front of the US Embassy.      Supporting us in our struggle is the International Republican      Institute. This organization funds pro-democracy activities      inside Burma. The Burmese people desperately want what      Americans have: the ability to live in peace without fear of      government persecution, respect for human rights, and social      justice. American ideals will always be a symbol for what we      can achieve.       I want to personally thank you for your leadership and      raising your voice to support those who are oppressed. I look      forward to assisting you in any way possible.       With my highest consideration,           Yours Sincerely,                                                       (Sein Win),      Prime Minister.                                                                    ____         American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial            Organization,                                 Washington, DC, February 6, 1995.     Hon. Warren Christoper,     Secretary of State, U.S. Department of State, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Secretary: I write to you to express my strong      concerns about the continuing egregious behavior of the State      Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) regime of Burma.      Directly contradicting its claims that it seeks peace and      national reconciliation, SLORC sent the Burmese army to      viciously attack, capture and sack Manerplaw, the      headquarters of the Karen people and key base area for many      groups, including the Federation of Trade Unions Burma      (FTUB), seeking to restore democracy in Burma.       We believe that the blatant, unprovoked attack on Manerplaw      is a major setback for the cause of democracy in Burma and      merits a strong response from the U.S. Government. In the      ``two visions'' policy laid out by Deputy Assistant Secretary      Hubbard during his visit to Rangoon, the U.S. indicated that,      if progress by SLORC on issues of democracy and human rights      was not forthcoming, the U.S. would renew its campaign to      isolate the regime. In line with this policy, now is the time      for the U.S. to show, by actions, that it is serious.       Accordingly, we urge the U.S. Government to implement a      full trade and investment embargo against Burma. Since most      U.S. investment enters Burma through joint ventures with      SLORC government agencies or entities wholly controlled by      the regime, implementing sanctions would have a direct impact      on the ability of the SLORC to repress its people and conduct      war on groups opposed to this illegitimate government. The      withdrawal of the Commercial Officer from the U.S. Embassy in      Rangoon would further underscore this message. We also renew      our call for the U.S. Government to exert pressure to block      development and aid projects of international institutions      that benefit the SLORC.           Sincerely,                                                    Lane Kirkland,     President.                                                                    ____                                Asian-American Civic Alliance,                                Ft. Lauderdale, FL, July 10, 1995.     Hon. Senator Mitch McConnell,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator: We are very grateful of your great effort      which have contributed towards the release of Aung San Suu      Kyl.       We hope that you will continue to assist bring Democracy in      our beloved country, Burma.       Please continue your most powerful Bill against the      Military Regime in Burma so that the 43 millions Burmese--     every citizen can enjoy the Democracy and human rights in      their life time once again over there.       We support you wholeheartedly.           With Sincerity and respect,                                                    Kyin Ho, M.D.,     President.                                                                    ____         Office of the Supreme Headquarters, Karen National Union,                                    Kawthoolei, September 5, 1995.     Hon. Senator McConnell,     U.S. Congress,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator: We are much impressed and encouraged to hear      that you are to submit the bill as intended in Congress next      month, for imposing trade sanctions on Burma.       Apart from releasing Daw Amg San Sun Kyi from detention,      the SLORC has not taken any step for democratic reform.      Nearly one thousand political prisoners detained unjustly by      the SLORC are still in prison. Forced labor, midiscriminate      killings and human rights violations are still being      committed on a wide scale by the SLORC army troops. Cease-     fire agreements between the SLORC and the ethnic groups,      remain to be a temporary arrangement without any progress      toward agreement for lasting peace and stability. In the case      of Karemi, hostilities have broken out again as the SLORC      troops violated the cease-fire terms.       With regard to us. the SLORC has been avoiding with excuses      the materializing of talks, while it has been massing 101      battalions of troops against our areas. Military operations      have already begun in some of our areas even when the rainy      season is in full force. This shows that the SLORC's so-     called ``policy of national reconciliation'' is only an      expedient measure in its attempt to perpemate the military      dictatorship.       In conclusion, we would like to say that we are firm in our      support for you with regard to your effort to have trade      sanctions imposed on Burma. We pray for your success and send      our best wishes and regards to you and our colleagues.           Sincerely,                                                       Saw Bo Mya,     President.                                                                    ____                                        United Front for Democracy                                    and Human Rights in Burma,                                 North Potomac, MD, July 10, 1995.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     U.S. Senator,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Senator: On behalf of the United Front for      Democracy and Human Rights in Burma and its affiliated      organizations such as Burma America Fund, Burma-Canada      Society and the United States of Burma Relief Fund Committee,      as well as the people of Burma inside and outside the      country, I wish to convey our most sincere appreciation of      the continuing efforts you have been making for the down-     trodden peoples of Burma.       In particular, we would like to express our appreciation of      the bill to impose trade and economic sanctions against the      military regime in Burma. We understand that you will go      ahead with the sanction bill as you said it would be more      important than ever to maintain the pressure on the SLORC to      fully implement the results of the 1990 election, and to      restore democracy and human rights to Burma. We agree with      you entirely that the release of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi alone      would not solve the problems in Burma, Still there are      hundreds of political prisoners being detained and the      military is still continuing its reckless campaign against      the ethnic minorities, in particular the Karennis with whom      the SLORC signed a cease-fire only in March 1995. In      violation of the cease-fire agreement, the SLORC sent four      battalions into the cease-fire designated area and fighting      is now going on between the SLORC troops and the Karennis.       While we welcome with great pleasure the release of Daw      Aung San Suu Kyi, the symbol of Burma's democracy movement,      we feel that this is just a beginning in the long process of      peace-making and restoration of human rights and national      reconciliation in Burma. With the history of the cunning      tactics that has been used by the brutal regime, we have to      wait and see if the SLORC is going to change its ways to      bring about genuine democracy and follow a national      reconciliation process that will lead to the early      establishment of a genuine democratic government by      immediately transferring the administration to the elected      representatives of the 1990 elections and to form an interim      government led by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, who is the only      Burmese national leader loved and respected by all the      peoples of Burma.       Until it is definite that the democracy process is assured,      just as in South Africa after the release of Nelson Mandela,      the sanctions that you proposed should be imposed. We are      confident that the international community would agree with      this approach.       We wish to repeat our wholehearted support of your efforts      and thank you again for your unrelentless efforts for the      cause of democracy and human rights in Burma and elsewhere in      the world.           Yours sincerely,                                                      U Ba Thaung,     Chairman.                                                                    ____                                            Huntsville, Texas,                                                     July 6, 1995.     Senator Mitch McConnell,     Russell Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: I wish to take this opportunity to      offer my support to the initiative you are preparing to      undertake on behalf of my sister laureate Aung San Suu Kyi      and the people of Burma. It has been brought to my attention      that you intend to introduce legislation on July 11, 1995      which will ban all U.S. foreign investment in Burma.       On June 26, 1995, while commemorating the 50th Anniversary      of the United Nations, Bishop Desmond Tutu, Lech Walesa,      Oscar Arias Sanchez and myself presented a letter to the      United Nations which included the signatures of seven other      Laureates asking for the release of Daw Suu. The letter      stated, ``She has endured six long years of solitary      detention without trial at the hands of the military regime.      There is no sign at all of her release. We resolutely oppose      political oppression disguised as criminal detention.''      Bishop Tutu, in a statement to a forum at the UN Anniversary      called for sanctions to be imposed on Burma.       This legislative initiative is long overdue and will play a      critical role in bringing about a transfer of power to the      democratically elected 1990 representatives, allowing them to      take their rightful (and legitimate) seats in parliament.       I offer congratulations for implementing this endeavor and      hope that your colleagues in the Senate will join you in this      worthy effort which I hope will lead to a political dialogue      and settlement of the Burma conflict and, most importantly,      democracy in Burma.           Most sincerely,                                                   Betty Williams,                                              Nobel Laureate 1976.                           amendment no. 2754       At an appropriate place in the bill add the following new      section:     Sec.  . SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THAILAND.       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings--       (1) the Royal Thai Government has had a policy of not      supporting or cooperating with the Khmer Rouge; and       (2) Thailand is host to large numbers of persons displaced      from neighboring countries, including Burma, placing a      significant burden on Thailand's economy.       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate      that the President should--       (1) affirm to the Royal Thai Government the support of the      United States for that Government's policy not to support or      cooperate with the Khmer Rouge and encourage the Royal Thai      Government to prosecute vigorously its efforts to prevent      cooperation between individual members of the Royal Thai      Armed forces and the Khmer Rouge; and       (2) take appropriate steps to assist the Royal Thai      Government in providing and facilitating relief to displaced      persons from Burma and other neighboring countries and to      encourage that Government to fully cooperate in such relief      efforts.
