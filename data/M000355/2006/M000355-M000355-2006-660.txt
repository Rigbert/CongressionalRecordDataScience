 President, for the information of our colleagues, there will be no votes tomorrow, Friday. On Monday, we will begin consideration of the Defense authorization matter. Senators are encouraged to come to the floor to give their opening statements during Monday's session. No votes will occur on Monday, and the next vote will be on Tuesday prior to the policy luncheons.  I remind everyone that on Tuesday at 2:15 p.m., we will have our official photograph taken in the Senate Chamber. Senators should be seated at their desks promptly at 2:15 p.m. on Tuesday.  A few minutes ago, we locked in an agreement for debate and a cloture vote on a Mine Safety and Health nomination. That vote will occur at 3:30 p.m. on Tuesday. Again, I remind everyone that the first vote will occur prior to the policy lunch recess.  In addition to a busy week on the Defense authorization bill, next week we will address the supplemental appropriations conference report which should shortly be available. I know, I just signed it myself.  I will have more to say on Friday regarding next week's schedule.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
