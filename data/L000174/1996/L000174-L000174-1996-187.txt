President, I say to the distinguished Senator from New Mexico, I came to the floor because there was not anybody on the floor at this moment. I notice there that have been some quorum calls. I thought rather than hold up anything later on, as I would take probably less time than it would take now in discussing this, if I could just make a couple of comments about the nutrition aspects of the reconciliation bill.
