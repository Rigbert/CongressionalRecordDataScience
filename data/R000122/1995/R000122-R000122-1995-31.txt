Chairman, I rise in support of the bipartisan deficit lockbox legislation, H.R. 1162.  However, it is unfortunate that H.R. 1162 was not brought before the House of Representatives prior to consideration of this year's spending bills. Regrettably, this means that many of the cuts I voted for this year are not guaranteed to help reduce the deficit.  Mr. Chairman, H.R. 1162 is all about the truth. When Members vote to cut an unworthy project and do not redirect those scarce resources elsewhere, our constituents expect that money to go toward reducing the deficit.  Unfortunately, that is not the way the system works now, but with the passage of H.R. 1162 that will change. Now when the project is cut, those savings will lower the total sum of funds available and the deficit should be reduced by a commensurate amount.  I am pleased to support this truth in budgeting legislation, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote for H.R. 1162. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
