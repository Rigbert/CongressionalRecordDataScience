Madam Speaker, as dean of the Georgia delegation, I rise to welcome a new Member to the United States House of Representatives, Dr. Paul Broun.  Dr. Broun is one of four men of medicine in the Georgia delegation. He succeeds our friend and late colleague, Dr. Charlie Norwood, who also was a physician.  Dr. Broun is a graduate of the University of Georgia in Athens and the Medical College of Georgia in Augusta. He served his country as a United States Marine and as a Medical Officer in the United States Navy. He is married to Niki Bronson Broun. They have two children and two grandchildren.  Dr. Broun comes from a well-known political family in Georgia. His father was a well-respected State senator from Athens for 38 years. I could say, I can say, and I must say, he was a Democrat.  Mr. Broun of Georgia. A conservative one, at that.
