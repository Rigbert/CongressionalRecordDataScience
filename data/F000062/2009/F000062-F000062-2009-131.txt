 President, the managers of the bill are working on an agreement to limit the number of amendments in order to the bill. If an agreement is reached, the cloture vote would not be necessary. However, if we are unable to reach an agreement on amendments, the cloture vote would occur at approximately 10:30 a.m. tomorrow.                          ____________________
