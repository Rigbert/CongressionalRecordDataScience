 President, if I may, I would like to continue the arguments that the Senator from Georgia has made and add some of my own. And, Mr. President, I do not make these arguments lightly, nor do I make them with any sense of pleasure.  It is never easy or pleasant to criticize a friend, a neighbor, and an ally. And Mexico is all of these. The United States and Mexico have a deep and complex relationship that spans every conceivable form of interaction across a 2,000-mile border. And we need to work together to solve problems that confront us.  I have heard many arguments--``Oh, this is all a United States problem.'' Well, Mr. President, the United States is trying to address that problem. Let me give you just two facts to corroborate that. One, in 1998, the U.S. Federal Government has spent or will spend nearly $16 billion fighting drugs. Of that, on demand reduction alone, we will spend $5.37 billion; on interdiction, $1.62 billion; on domestic law enforcement, $8.4 billion. And it all goes up next year.  One interesting fact is in 1985 prisoners on drug charges in Federal prisons were 31.4 percent of the total. Today, almost 60 percent of the Federal prison population is in prison on drug charges. So the number of people in Federal prisons for drug crimes in the United States of America has risen by over 30 percent in this decade.  We are trying. We may fail, but we do try. So this country does make a substantial effort--prevention, education, treatment, all of it.  ``Full cooperation'' means full cooperation. And there were six benchmarks, as Senator Coverdell stated, that comprised the basic part of our concerns of last year: enforcement, dismantling the drug cartels, combating corruption, curtailing money laundering, extraditing Mexican nationals on drug-related charges, and law enforcement cooperation.  I would like to discuss each one of these areas in detail. But I want to make the point that I believe Mexico has fallen short of the mark of full cooperation in each of these areas.  On the day the certification decision was announced, the Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, Gen. Barry McCaffrey, said, ``I would just like to underscore the absolutely superlative cooperation we have received from Mexico.'' I thought a lot about that. What I finally realized is, you know, now I know what the problem is. Mexico's cooperation with the United States focuses primarily on the political level. Tragically, it does so at the expense of the much more important law enforcement level. The degree to which the administration emphasizes this political level of cooperation is evident by the State Department's statement of explanation on the certification of Mexico. The first two paragraphs focus exclusively on meetings held between senior officials, commitments they have made, documents they have signed, and so on.  In other words, the most compelling rationale for certifying Mexico this year that the administration can offer is based on political-level agreements. But if there is one truth about the war on drugs, it is that it is fought on the streets, not in the conference rooms and banquet halls. Handshakes between men and women in suits do not stop drug trafficking. Good intelligence and good police work can and do stop drug trafficking. Law enforcement cooperation, not political-level agreements, is where the rubber hits the road in counternarcotics. Until this exists in Mexico, the administration's certification of Mexico will have all the weight of an inflated balloon--impressive to look at, but hollow at the core and easily punctured.  So with this background, I would like to offer my response to the administration's rationale for its decision to certify Mexico, in hopes that the Senate will act to overturn this decision. And I will rely on the benchmarks we set last year.  The State Department statement of explanation says: ``Drug seizures in 1997 generally increased over 1996 levels.'' Now, this is true, but it is only part of the picture.  Let us begin with this first chart. Yes; this is 1996, and as you can see, cocaine seizures have gone up from 23.6 metric tons to 34.9 metric tons. But look back at the peak in 1991 when it was 50.3 metric tons, look at the drop; look at 1993 when it was 46.2; and then look at it drop back down into the low 20s. Cocaine seizures today are still over 30 percent below where they were back in 1991 when the supply was not nearly as large as it is today.  Let us take a look at heroin seizures. Again, we are told they are much improved. But look at the heroin seizures by Mexico. Beginning in 1994 at 297 kilograms, they go down in 1995 to 203 kilograms, and they go up in 1996 to 363 kilograms; this year they have gone down all the way to 115 kilograms. I think this is very, very dramatic.  Let us take a look, if we can, at methamphetamine seizures by Mexico. 1994, 265 kilograms; 496 kilograms in 1995. It has gone steadily downhill--to 172 kilograms in 1996 and all the way to 39 kilograms in 1997--as the United States of America has been inundated with methamphetamine labs. I am ashamed to say my State, the largest State in this Union, has become a source country for the dissemination of methamphetamine now throughout the rest of the United States--the great bulk of it coming from one cartel, which I will point out. A great bulk of the labs are operated, regretfully, by Mexican nationals in this country illegally.  Let us take a look at ephedrine seizures. Ephedrine is a key chemical without which methamphetamine cannot be produced. Here were the seizures in 1996--6,697 kilograms. Look how high they were. Here are the seizures in 1997--only 608 kilograms, a drop of over 90 percent. This is clearly a great drop.  Now let us look at narcotics arrests of Mexican nationals by Mexico in Mexico.  In 1992, they arrested 27,369 people. Look at it in 1997--10,572 people. That is a two-thirds drop in arrests when we are putting all this pressure on, saying, ``Go after the cartels. Stop the assassinations. Break it up.'' The arrests have actually dropped.  Take the next chart. Now, one of the major tests--not the only test; it is not 100 percent accurate--of supply is what street prices are. In Main Street, prices for drugs drop when the supply goes up. Every single narcotics officer that works undercover or works the streets of America will tell you that. So we went to the Western States Information Network, which surveys the findings of local police departments on the west coast. Let me share with you what we found.  Cocaine in the Los Angeles region has fallen from $16,500 per kilo in 1994 to $14,000 per kilo in 1997. It has leveled off this past year. But this is the drop over that period of time.  Now, let us talk about black tar heroin. Black tar heroin is Mexican heroin. In the Los Angeles area, look at the street prices in 1991. According to DEA, this is nearly the exclusive province of the Mexican family-operated cartels based in Michoacan. In Los Angeles, the price per ounce has dropped two-thirds, from $1,800 in 1992 to $600 in 1997. The price today is one-third of what it was 5 years ago. This is why we see a tremendous increase in heroin addiction in this country. The supply overwhelms the demand, and the prices drop.  In San Francisco it is the same story. Black tar heroin--an average of $3,500 per ounce in 1991. Today it averages $600 per ounce, a dramatic drop in price.  And we see the same pattern with methamphetamine. In Los Angeles, the price per pound for methamphetamine averaged $9,000 in 1991. Today it has dropped down--gone up and down--but dropped down to $3,500 per pound. It is a two-thirds drop in price. That is enormous in the methamphetamine contraband market.  So these street price statistics tell the story of supply. And supply comes mainly flowing across our southern border.  Just this week, the March 23 edition of the San Diego Union-Tribune had an article entitled ``Brazen Traffickers Want Run of the Border: Drug Flow From Mexico Now More Deadly, Frequent.''  So in my view, low seizure figures, low arrest figures, falling street prices in our cities, and inundated Customs and Border Patrol agents are hardly indications of ``full cooperation'' by Mexico's authorities.  Let me speak about what the great danger is now. What I believe to be the biggest criminal enterprise in the Western Hemisphere is developing in Mexico, and that is the cartels.  There are essentially four major cartels: the Juarez cartel, known as the Carrillo-Fuentes cartel; the Sonora cartel, known as the Caro-Quintero cartel; the Tijuana cartel, known as the Arellano-Felix brothers; and the Amezcua-Contreras brothers.  In testimony about a month ago, DEA Administrator Thomas Constantine left little doubt when he talked to the Foreign Relations Committee about Mexico's efforts to dismantle the cartels. He said:       Unfortunately, the Government of Mexico has made very      little progress in the apprehension of known syndicate      leaders who dominate the drug trade in Mexico and control a      substantial share of the wholesale cocaine, heroin, and      methamphetamine markets in the United States.  To me, this is a very telling statement. The State Department would have us believe all is well in the Mexican effort against the cartels--and they will point out some arrests--but every one of these arrests is second and third level cartel participants, not top level. I believe Mr. Constantine's testimony tells the true story--very little progress. I hope my colleagues will take these words into consideration.  Let me begin with the Juarez cartel.  Mr. Constantine stated:       The scope of the Carrillo-Fuentes cartel is staggering,      reportedly forwarding $20-$30 million to Colombia for each      major operation and generating tens of millions of dollars in      profits per week for itself.  Meanwhile, the Carrillo-Fuentes cartel--that is the Juarez cartel--spreadsits tentacles into U.S. cities, where it recruits U.S. gang members to act as its agents. DEA has identified active Carrillo-Fuentes cells in cities around the United States--Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle, Phoenix, Houston, Dallas, Denver, Chicago, and most recently New York City.  Now, this is really interesting, because New York City used to be the preserve of the Colombian cartels who marketed their cocaine directly. But a DEA study in August of 1997 revealed that the Mexican distribution networks were rapidly moving into the east coast markets of New York, New Jersey, and Philadelphia, displacing the Colombians.  This trend was illustrated in a major DEA investigation--Operation Limelight--which uncovered a Chicago-based cell of the Carrillo-Fuentes organization that was delivering hundreds of kilograms of cocaine to a distribution network in New York. I believe my colleague from Illinois will, hopefully, speak to that.  Now, some felt that the death of Juarez cartel's leader--Amado Carrillo Fuentes--during attempted plastic surgery last May, could have set the stage for the weakening of the cartel.  One might even concede that Carrillo-Fuentes' death was as a result of his feeling under some pressure from the Mexican authorities, although this is far from proven.  But instead of getting weaker, the Juarez cartel is now stronger. Mexico didn't take any action whatever to capitalize on the opportunity provided by this death. Today the Juarez cartel continues to operate. This is in spite of a power struggle within the cartel that has produced an orgy of violence--50 drug-related murders in and around Juarez, which is clearly well beyond the Mexican authorities' ability to control.  There has been no effort to arrest the new leaders of this cartel, men such as Vincente Carrillo-Fuentes--Amado's brother--or Juan Esparragosa Moreno, a top aide, or Eduardo Gonzalez-Quirarte, a key manager of the organization's distribution networks along the border.  The other major drug trafficking cartel is the most violent and the most vicious. That is the Arellano-Felix cartel, operating right across the border from California in Tijuana. According to the DEA, ``Based in Tijuana, this organization is one of the most powerful, violent, and aggressive trafficking groups in the world.'' They are active today, this year, in Arizona, California, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington. Once again, no effort to arrest their leaders.  On September 11, the most violent of the Arellano-Felix brothers, Ramon Arellano-Felix, was added to the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List. He has been indicted in San Diego on drug trafficking charges. Why has there been no effort taken by the Mexican authorities to rein in the operations of the Arellano-Felix organization or to arrest its senior leaders?  I would like to talk about one other cartel. The first is the Jesus Amezcua cartel. According to the DEA, ``The Amezcua-Contreras brothers, operating out of Guadalajara, Mexico, head a methamphetamine production and trafficking organization with global dimensions.'' This organization has established links to distribution networks in the United States in locations like California, Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Iowa, Georgia, and North Carolina.  The U.S. law enforcement investigation, Operation META, concluded in December with the arrest of 101 defendants and the seizure of 133 pounds of methamphetamine and the precursors to manufacture up to 540 pounds more, along with 1,100 kilos of cocaine and $2.25 million in assets.  I will go to the last three charts and then wrap up. This is very puzzling. This chart shows outstanding United States extradition requests for Mexican nationals wanted on drug charges. Now we have heard a lot about this, and Mexico has moved to be able to extradite some people, many of them on nonrelated drug charges. The two they have surrendered were deported, not extradited, because they were, in effect, dual citizens. They have not, to date, extradited a single Mexican national on drug-related charges, despite the fact that there are 27 extradition requests by this Government pending.  There is some good news. One reason for delay could be overcome if the United States Senate and the Mexican Congress ratify the protocol to the United States-Mexico extradition treaty which was signed just last November. I don't know why the administration has delayed submitting this protocol to the Senate. Once ratified, it will allow for the temporary extradition to take place for the purpose of conducting a trial while a defendant is serving prison time in his own country.  Extradition is clearly the key to stopping drug traffickers. A good place to start would be Ramon Arellano-Felix, who is wanted on narcotics charges in the United States. Another good start would be Miguel Caro-Quintero, who is head of the Sonora cartel, who last year at this time openly granted interviews to the Washington Post in Mexico. The Washington Post could find him. He has four indictments pending against him in the United States for smuggling, RICO statute, and conspiracy charges, but he cannot be found.  We have heard a lot about corruption. This is deeply concerning to me. This chart shows the Mexican Federal Police officials dismissed for corruption--there have been 870. Now, because of certain features of Mexican law, 700 have been rehired pending their appeals, and there have been no successful prosecutions. So if you are going to terminate somebody, they are going to get rehired, and you are not going to prosecute. Not a lot is accomplished.  Mr. President, to reiterate I rise today to urge my colleagues to vote to pass S.J. Res. 42 to disapprove the President's decision to certify Mexico as fully cooperating with the United States in the effort against drug trafficking. And I ask for the yeas and nays on the resolution.  I do not make these arguments lightly, nor do I make them with any sense of pleasure. It is never easy or pleasant to criticize a friend, a neighbor, and an ally--and Mexico is all of these. The United States and Mexico have a deep and complex relationship that spans every conceivable form of interaction across a 2,000 mile border. And we need to work together to solve the problems that confront us.  But we also must be honest with each other and with ourselves. Section 490 of the Foreign Assistance Act, which is the law of the land, requires the President to judge whether drug producing and drug transit countries, like Mexico, have met the standard of ``full cooperation.''  ``Full cooperation,'' I suppose, can be viewed subjectively. It probably means different things to different people. But there are probably some areas which everyone can agree are essential parts of full cooperation. Let me suggest a few of these areas.  Last year, when the Senate debated this issue, we established essentially six benchmarks for evaluating Mexico's counternarcotics performance. The Administration used these benchmarks to guide its report to Congress last September, and I believed that it would use them to form the basis of its decision on certification.  These benchmarks each comprise a fairly basic part of any meaningful counternarcotics effort. They are: enforcement (such as seizures and arrests); dismantling the drug cartels and arresting their top leaders; extradition; combating corruption; curtailing money-laundering; and, most importantly, law enforcement cooperation.  I will discuss each of these areas in detail, but I can assure my colleagues that in each of these areas, Mexico has fallen well short of the mark of ``full cooperation'', which is the standard of the law.  There has been insufficient progress--and in some cases, no progress at all--on key elements of a successful counternarcotics program in Mexico. Whether due to inability or lack of political will, these failures badly undermine the urgent effort to keep the scourge of drugs off our streets.  Ignoring these failures, or pretending they are outweighed by very modest advances, does not make them go away. We do Mexico no favors, nor any for our country and our people, by closing our eyes to reality. And the reality is that no serious, objective evaluation of Mexico's efforts could result in a certification for ``full cooperation''. Partial cooperation, perhaps. But that is not what the law calls for. The law calls for ``full cooperation.''  On the day the certification decision was announced, the Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, General Barry McCaffrey, said: ``I would just like to underscore the absolutely superlative cooperation we have received from Mexico.''  However, I think I understand his reasoning, and in fact, the reasoning behind the certification decision as a whole. The reason is that the Administration's approach to evaluating Mexico's cooperation focuses primarily, if not exclusively, on the political level. Tragically, it does so at the expense of the much more important law enforcement level. Let me explain what I mean.  There is no question that President Clinton, General McCaffrey, Attorney General Reno, and other senior U.S. officials enjoy positive working relationships with their Mexican counterparts. Presidents Clinton and Zedillo had a cordial exchange of visits. There is a High-Level Contact Group on Narcotics Control that meets two or three times a year. Documents were released, such as the ``Declaration of the U.S.-Mexico Alliance Against Drugs'' and the ``Bi-National Drug Threat Assessment'' and the ``Bi-National Drug Strategy.''  The degree to which the Administration emphasizes this political-level cooperation is evident by the State Department's ``Statement of Explanation'' on the certification of Mexico. The first two paragraphs focus exclusively on meetings held between senior officials, commitments they have made, documents they have signed, and so on.  In other words, the most compelling rationale for certifying Mexico that the Administration can offer is based on political-level agreements.  But if there is one truth about the war on drugs, it is that it is fought on the streets, not in conference rooms and banquet halls. Handshakes between men and women in suits do not stop drug trafficking. But good intelligence and policework can and does stop drug trafficking.  Law enforcement cooperation, not political level agreements, is where the rubber hits the road in counternarcotics. Good intelligence and dedicated and trusting policework is what really makes a difference. Until this exists in Mexico, the Administration's certification of Mexico will have all the weight of an inflated balloon: impressive to look at, but hollow at the core, and easily punctured.  So, with this background, I will offer my response to the Administration's rationale for its decision to certify Mexico, in hopes that the Senate will act to overturn this decision. I will rely on the benchmarks we set last year.                              Enforcement  The State Department's Statement of Explanation says: ``Drug seizures in 1997 generally increased over 1996 levels.'' This is true, but it is just a partial picture.  Well, let's look at the record. It is true that Mexico's marijuana seizures were marginally higher in 1997, and it is also true of cocaine seizures. But the rise in cocaine seizures can only be considered progress as compared with the dismal seizure levels of the previous three years.  The 34.9 metric tons of cocaine seized in 1997 is an improvement over the previous three years, when cocaine seizures had dropped to about half of the 46.2 metric tons seized in 1993 and the 50 metric tons seized in 1991. This is a perfect example of lowering the bar. When we accept a dismal performance, as we did in 1994-1996, any improvement is given undue weight, even if it falls far short of Mexico's own proven capabilities, as the 1991-1993 figures indicate.  In several cases, drug seizures have declined sharply.  Take heroin for example. In 1997, Mexico's heroin seizures declined from 363 kilograms to 115 kilograms. That is a 68 percent drop.  The decline is even more pronounced in seizures of methamphetamine, and its precursor chemical ephedrine. Mexico's methamphetamine seizures fell from 496 kilograms in 1995, to 172 kilograms in 1996, and then to only 39 kilograms in 1997. Over two years, that is a 92 percent drop.  For ephedrine, we see the same pattern. Nearly 6,700 kilograms were seized in 1996. In 1997, that figure, amazingly, drops 91 percent, down to only 608 kilograms.  I am truly at a loss to understand how the State Department can cite increasing drug seizures as a rationale for its decision to certify, when its own statistics show Mexico's drug seizures declining by 60, 70, 80, and even 90 percent!! over the past 6 or so years.  In another important area of enforcement--narcotics-related arrests--we can see that Mexico's performance is getting worse, not better. In 1997, Mexico's narcotics arrests of Mexican nationals declined from 11,038 to 10,572.  This decline in arrests would be disturbing enough on its own. But it is even more so when one sees how far the bar has been lowered. We should be comparing this year's arrest figures not to last year's, which were only slightly less anemic, but to the 1992 level, which was more than double the current number.  While estimates vary, DEA believes that Mexico is the transit station for 50-70 percent of the cocaine, a quarter to a third of the heroin, 80 percent of the marijuana, and 90 percent of the ephedrine used to make methamphetamine entering the United States.  The 1997 seizure and arrest statistics, in my view, offer ample evidence that Mexico's enforcement efforts are simply inadequate. And the result, undeniably, is that more drugs are flowing into our cities, our schools, and our communities.  How do we know this? Just look at the street prices. The street value of cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine are all dropping. According to the Western States Information Network, which surveys the findings of local police departments on the West Coast, the average street value of cocaine in the Los Angeles region has fallen from $16,500 per kilo in 1994 to $14,000 per kilo in 1997.  The drop is even more dramatic in the case of black tar heroin, which DEA has in the past reported to be nearly the exclusive province of Mexican ``family operated cartels'' based in Michoacan. In Los Angeles, the price per ounce has dropped from $1,800 in 1992 to only $600 in 1997. The price today is one-third of what it was five years ago.  In San Francisco, it is the same story. Black tar heroin averaged $3,500 per ounce in 1991. Today, it averages only $600.  We see the same pattern with methamphetamine. In Los Angeles, the price per pound for meth averaged $9,000 in 1991. Today, it has dropped to $3,500. In San Francisco, the average price per pound for meth has declined from a peak of over $10,000 in 1993 to $3,500 in 1997.  These street price statistics reflect in the main, the simple law of supply and demand. We know that demand remains high, unfortunately, so when the price drops, the obvious conclusion is that you have more supply.  So if we look at the beginning of the decade of the 90s, there's now much more cocaine, more heroin, more methamphetamine flowing across our southern border, while Mexico's enforcement efforts decline. In my mind, this combination makes a mockery of the concept of ``full cooperation''.  The evidence of increased trafficking can also be found by following events at the border. Just this week, in the March 23 edition of the San Diego Union-Tribune, Gregory Gross wrote an article called ``Brazen Traffickers Want Run of the Border: Drug Flow From Mexico Now More Deadly, Frequent.''  So in my view, low seizure figures, low arrest figures, falling street prices in our cities, and inundated customs and Border Patrol agents are hardly indications of ``full cooperation" by the Mexican authorities in combating drug trafficking.                                Cartels  Let me speak about the cartels in Mexico. As evidence of Mexico's efforts to combat the cartels, the State Department's Statement of Explanation mentions the arrest of eight ``major traffickers'', including Joaquin Guzman Loera, Hector Luis Palma Salazar, Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo, and Raul Vallardes del Angel.  Not only are these examples of mostly second- and third-tier traffickers, not the cartel bosses, but who the Mexican authorities have failed to capture tells a much more important story. The State Department even admits that two legitimately ``major''traffickers were dealt with lightly: Humberto Garcia Abrego of the Gulf cartel was released from prison--and I would point out this release occurred hours after the President certified Mexico last year--and Rafael Caro-Quintero of the Sonora cartel succeeded in having his sentence reduced.  The simple truth is that after a year of Mexico's so-called full cooperation in combating the cartels, the situation remains completely out of the Mexican authorities' control. Somehow, the State Department construes this effort as sufficient.  But that is not how the United States' drug enforcement officials describe the efforts in Mexico. Let me share with my colleagues what our DEA officials say about it. When DEA Administrator Thomas Constantine testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on February 26, 1998, he described the four major cartels as the most powerful organized crime organizations in the hemisphere--much more powerful than anything the U.S. has ever faced. They are: the Juarez cartel, also known as the Carrillo-Fuentes cartel; the Sonora cartel, also known as the Caro-Quintero cartel; the Tijuana cartel, also known as the Arellano-Felix brothers; and the Amezcua-Contreras brothers.  In his testimony, Mr. Constantine left little doubt about Mexico's efforts to dismantle the cartels. He said: ``Unfortunately, the Government of Mexico has made very little progress in the apprehension of known syndicate leaders who dominate the drug trade in Mexico and control a substantial share of the wholesale cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine markets in the United States.''  To me, this is a very telling statement. While the State Department would have us believe that all is well in the Mexican effort against the cartels, Mr. Constantine's testimony tells the true story: ``very little progress'' in arresting the key figures, who are well-known, and who run the drug trade. I hope my colleagues will take their words into account.  Even more chilling is Mr. Constantine's contention that the cartels are stronger today than they were one year ago. That's right. After a year of what the Administration calls full cooperation, the cartels have only increased their strength.  The most frightening part of the failure to actively confront these cartels is that they are increasingly penetrating into U.S. cities and marketing their drugs directly on our streets and to our kids.  Perhaps the most powerful of these cartels is the Juarez cartel, also known as the Carrillo-Fuentes organization. While trafficking in marijuana and heroin, the Juarez cartel specializes in cocaine. In particular, it has served as the distribution network for large shipments of cocaine arriving from Colombia. From regional bases in Guadalajara, Hermosillo, and Torreon, the cocaine is moved closer to the border for shipment into the United States.  DEA Administrator Constantine testified that: ``The scope of the Carrillo-Fuentes cartel is staggering, reportedly forwarding $20-30 million to Colombia for each major operation, and generating tens of millions of dollars in profits per week for itself.''  Meanwhile the Carrillo-Fuentes cartel spreads its tentacles into U.S. cities, where it recruits U.S. gang members to act as its agents. DEA has identified active Carrillo-Fuentes cells in cities around the United States: Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle, Phoenix, Houston, Dallas, Denver, Chicago, and most recently, New York City.  This is new. New York City used to be the preserve of the Colombian cartels, who marketed their cocaine directly. But a DEA study in August 1997 revealed that Mexican distribution networks were rapidly moving into the East Coast markets of New York, New Jersey, and Philadelphia, displacing the Colombians.  This trend was illustrated in a major DEA investigation--Operation Limelight--which uncovered a Chicago-based cell of the Carrillo-Fuentes organization that was delivering hundreds of kilograms of cocaine to a distribution network in New York.  Now some felt that the death of the Juarez cartel's leader--Amado Carrillo Fuentes--during attempted plastic surgery last May, could have set the stage for a weakening of the cartel. One might even concede that Carrillo-Fuentes' death was the result of his feeling under some pressure from the Mexican authorities, although this is far from proven.  But instead of getting weaker, the Juarez cartel, according to the DEA, is now stronger. Mexico clearly did not take any action whatsoever to capitalize on the opportunity presented by Carrillo-Fuentes's death, and today the cartel continues to operate as usual. And this is in spite of a power struggle within the cartel that has produced an orgy of violence--some 50 drug related murders--in and around Juarez, which is clearly well beyond the Mexican authorities' ability to control.  Yet there has been no effort to arrest the new leaders of the cartel, men such as Vincente Carrillo Fuentes--Amado's brother--or Juan Esparragosa Moreno, a top aide, or Eduardo Gonzalez-Quirarte, a key manager of the organization's distribution networks along the border.  The other major drug trafficking cartel is the Arellano-Felix organization. DEA Administrator Constantine described the cartel this way: ``Based in Tijuana, this organization is one of the most powerful, violent, and aggressive trafficking groups in the world.''  Because of its base in Tijuana, the Arellano-Felix organization--the most vicious and violent of the cartels--has dominated the drug distribution networks in the western United States, and--of particular concern to me--is especially strong in southern California. The DEA believes that the cartel uses San Diego street gangs as assassins and enforcers.  In other cities around the country, it is a similar story. The Arellano Felix organization recruits local gang members, who serve as the distributors and protectors of its drug shipments, which include cocaine, marijuana, heroin, and methamphetamine.  Once again, we can point to little effort on the part of the Mexican authorities to curtail this cartel's activity. Indeed, as Mr. Constantine tells us, the cartel is stronger today than it was one year ago.  Although there have been a few arrests of some second- and third-tier Tijuana cartel members, we would expect a country certified for full cooperation to have made some inroads against the top leaders of this cartel, who are well known, especially given the clear U.S. concern for their capture. On September 11, 1997, the most violent of the Arellano-Felix brothers, Ramon Arellano-Felix, was added to the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List. He has been indicted in San Diego on drug trafficking charges.  But has there been any action taken by the Mexican authorities to rein in the operations of the Arellano-Felix organization or to arrest its senior leaders? Despite the claim of full cooperation, I am unaware of any such efforts.  I will touch more briefly on the other two major cartels. The first is the Amezcua-Contreras organization. I will quote Mr. Constantine's testimony: ``The Amezcua-Contreras brothers, operating out of Guadalajara, Mexico, head a methamphetamine production and trafficking organization with global dimensions.''  Like the larger, more established cartels, this organization has established links to distribution networks in the United States in locations as far afield as California, Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Iowa, Georgia, and North Carolina.  A U.S. law enforcement investigation, Operation META, concluded in December 1997 with the arrest of 101 defendants, the seizure of 133 pounds of methamphetamine and the precursors to manufacture up to 540 pounds more, along with 1,100 kilos of cocaine and over $2.25 million in assets.  And despite this active methamphetamine trade, Mexico has done little to pursue this cartel. Recently, one of the brothers, Adan Amezcua, was arrested on gun charges, but the true masterminds of the organization, Jesus and Luis Amezcua, who are under federal indictment in the U.S., remain at large.  The other major cartel is the Caro-Quintero cartel, based in the state of Sonora. This cartel focuses its trafficking on marijuana, but it also trafficks in cocaine. Most of its smuggling takes place across various points on the Arizona border.  Like the other cartels, the Caro-Quintero organization has been successful because of widespread bribes made to federal officials at all levels. These bribes help explain how the head of the cartel, Miguel Caro-Quintero, was able to have his case dismissed when he was arrested in 1992. He has operated freely since. It also helps explain how his brother Rafael Caro-Quintero, who was implicated in the 1985 torture and murder of DEA Agent Kiki Camarena, recently had his sentence reduced.  The totally insufficient effort by the Mexican authorities to confront the cartels has emboldened them. Today, they are not only more powerful than they were a year ago, they are more brazen. A series of violent incidents on both sides of the border illustrates this new brazenness.  In April 1997 two agents assigned to Mexico's new Organized Crime Unit, who had investigated Carrillo Fuentes, were kidnaped and killed. They had been bound, gagged, beaten, shot in the face, and stuffed in the trunk of a car.  On July 17, 1997, Hector Salinas-Guerra, a key witness in a McAllen, Texas drug case, was kidnapped. His tortured body was found on July 22, and on July 25, the jury in the trial acquitted the seven defendants.  On November 14, 1997, two Mexican federal police officers investigating the Arellano-Felix organization were shot and killed while traveling in an official Mexican government vehicle from Tecate to Tijuana.  On November 23, 1997, a shooting incident at the Nogales point of entry into Mexico left one Mexican Customs official dead, and two defendants and another official wounded.  On January 27, 1998, Mexican federal police officer Juan Carlos De La Vega-Reyes and his brother Francisco were shot and killed in Guadalajara.  Only if they believe that they are able to operate with impunity would encourage the Mexican cartel operators to be so openly violent toward law enforcement officers and witnesses. But that is the reality in Mexico today. It is a far cry from the full cooperation that we seek.  There are other examples of brazen acts by the cartels. A May 1997 report by Operation Alliance, a coalition of federal, state, and local law enforcement officers, found that drug traffickers were involved as the controlling parties in some commercial trade-related businesses in order to expedite their drug trafficking.  According to Operation Alliance, drug traffickers, moving to take advantage of the greater flow of trade occurring under NAFTA, are becoming involved in new transportation infrastructure upgrades, to expand their opportunities to get drugs across the border undetected.  And we now have the first documented case of a cartel attempting to buy control of a financial institution. Just this week, on March 24, 1998, the Wall Street Journal reported that money-launderers with links to the Carrillo Fuentes organization, tried to acquire a controlling stake in a Mexico City Bank, Grupo Financiero Anahuac, for about $10 million in 1995 and 1996. I ask unanimous consent that this article be made a part of the record at the conclusion of my remarks.  Clearly, the prospect of cartels moving into control of otherwise legitimate financial and trading entities is now established. And with each passing year, the cartels will grow bolder and bolder.  But, because of the reach of the cartels into our cities, the State Department's utter denial that the problem is getting worse, not better, is so dangerous. As much as these cartels are destroying Mexico, their reach into the United States is expanding. They have agents in many of our large and mid-size cities. Their drugs reach our children. The gangs they hire kill ruthlessly to protect their turf in our cities.  It is no exaggeration to say that the lives of hundreds, if not thousands, of Americans are literally at stake in the war against the cartels.                              Extradition  The State Department Statement of Explanation says that ``Mexico made further progress in the return of fugitives.''  While it is true that Mexico has extradited non-Mexican nationals to the United States, and has deported dual citizens such as Juan Garcia Abrego who are wanted on drug charges, and has even deported a few Mexican nationals for non-drug charges (such as murder or child molestation), one fact remains undeniable: To date, Mexico has not extradited and surrendered a single Mexican national to the United States on drug charges. Out of 27 pending requests, not one has been extradited.  Now, it is important to be clear what we mean. In five cases, the Mexican Foreign Minister has signed extradition orders for Mexican nationals wanted in the United States on drug charges. These are: Jaime Gonzalez Castro, Jaime Arturo Ladino, Oscar Malherbe, Tirso Angel Robles, and Juan Angel Salinas.  However, none of these fugitives has been surrendered to the United States. In each case, a delay has taken hold of the case for one reason or another. In some cases, appeals are pending. In others, amparos, or judicial writs, are holding things up. In others, the Mexican national is serving a sentence in a Mexican jail.  There is some good news. This last reason for delay could be overcome if the United States Senate and the Mexican Congress ratify the protocol to the U.S.-Mexico Extradition Treaty signed last November. I do not know why the Administration has delayed submitting this protocol to the Senate. Once ratified, it will allow for temporary extradition to take place, for the purpose of conducting a trial, while a defendant is already serving prison time in his own country.  But for now, all of these delays add up to the same end: no extraditions of Mexican nationals on drug charges. With judicial corruption still a major problem, appeals and other judicial mechanisms are highly suspect.  For whatever reason, either Mexico cannot overcome its reluctance, or simply refuses to extradite Mexican nationals to the United States on drug charges. I will be the first to acknowledge the first such extradition when it actually occurs, and the fugitive is surrendered. But to call the half-steps that have been taken ``full cooperation'' is to lower the bar to an unacceptable level.  Extradition is a key to stopping the drug traffickers, because they only fear conviction and incarceration in the United States. To have any deterrent value, it must be shown that it can actually happen.  A good place to start would be Ramon Arellano-Felix, who is wanted on narcotics charges in the United States, and has been named to the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List. Another good start would be Miguel Caro-Quintero, head of the Sonora cartel, who last year at this time was openly granting an interviews to the Washington Post. He has four indictments pending against him in the United States for smuggling, RICO statute, and conspiracy charges.                               Corruption  The State Department's Statement of Explanation describes--again tepidly--Mexico's approach to combating corruption this way: ``The Government of Mexico wrestled with very serious corruption issues in 1997. . .'' Wrestled with them. It is not enough to wrestle with them. Mexico has to show a sustained commitment to rooting out corruption in the government, police, military, and judiciary. This is one tall order that will take decades to accomplish.  Again, it is important to acknowledge the progress that has occurred. Mexico did expose, arrest, and convict their former drug czar, General Gutierrez Rebollo, when it was shown that he was on the take from the Carrillo Fuentes organization. This was a painful move, and President Zedillo is to be commended for taking it forthrightly.  But the problems run so much deeper than a bad apple at the top of the heap. According to the DEA, in addition to the Gutierrez-Rebollo incident, which involve the arrest of 40 other officers, the following cases are indicative of the reach of cartel-funded corruption into the Mexican government:  On March 17, General Alfredo Navarra-Lara was arrested by Mexican authorities for making bribes on behalf of the Arellano-Felix organization. He offered a Tijuana official $1.5 million per month--or $18 million per year.  In September, the entire 18-person staff of a special Mexican military unitset up to intercept air shipments of drugs was arrested for using one of its own planes to smuggle cocaine from the Guatemalan border to a hideout.  Bribery and corruption is believed to have been behind the withdrawal of Baja state police protection from a Tijuana new editor prior to his attempted assassination on November 27, 1997.  In December 1997, the appointment of Jesus Carrola-Gutierrez as Chief of the Mexico City Judicial Police was cut short when his ties to drug traffickers and human rights violations were made public.  The question of judicial corruption is a growing problem. Judges on the payroll of cartels can with the stroke of a pen undo the painstaking work of even the most honest and committed investigators and prosecutors. Yet it is totally out of control. According the testimony of the GAO at a joint House-Senate hearing last week at which I was present, U.S. law enforcement officials believe there is only one Mexican judge, in the entire country, who can be trusted not to compromise a wiretap investigation. One trustworthy judge. That is a devastating indictment of the level of corruption in Mexico.  Mexico has begun to take steps to deal with this problem. It has begun vetting officers for the most sensitive units, probing their backgrounds for hints of possible corruption. There has been some success in this process, but it is painfully slow going. And even some vetted agents have turned out to be corrupt.  But to make the argument that the very beginning of the implementation of a broad-based vetting program warrants the badge of ``full cooperation'' is to set the bar dangerously low. It sends a message to the Mexican government that partial measures are good enough, and it need not worry about carrying the program to its fullest implementation.  Perhaps the best possible measure of Mexico's commitment to combating corruption is how it deals with officials who have been found to be corrupt. Are they dismissed from their jobs? Are they then kept from other official work? Are they prosecuted?  Well, the story is not a good one. In an interview in December 1997, the Mexican Attorney General revealed that of 870 federal police officials dismissed for corruption, 700 of these were rehired because of problems in the Mexican legal system, which requires that the individuals remain at work during an appeal. In a police or military organization, this is a serious problem.  It gets worse. Not only were the vast majority of these corrupt officers reinstated, but not a single one of them was successfully prosecuted. Again, there is no way to read this statistic other than as a lack of seriousness in the fight against corruption. Can we really deem Mexico fully cooperative when it fails to make any serious effort to punish corrupt police officers?  Prosecuting corrupt officials is important because without fear of prosecution, there is little deterrence. Unfortunately, in 1997, there were only three police or military related corruption cases being prosecuted, including General Gutierrez Rebollo. Many more cases need to be brought to trial to have any deterrent effect.                            Money-laundering  Money-laundering is another area in which, by lowering the bar significantly, the Administration has made it Mexico's certification a virtual foregone conclusion. Last year, the simple fact of the Mexican Congress having passed laws that made money-laundering a crime for the first time was enough to satisfy the Administration. It did not matter that the laws were being neither implemented nor enforced.  So this year, the State Department's Statement of Explanation highlights the publication of regulations needed to implement the new laws. It does not mention that there was a significant delay in the publication of these regulations.  But let us accept that the publication of these regulations is an important step that needed to be taken to advance Mexico's anti-money-laundering effort. The question then is, how well are these laws and regulations being implemented? And the answer is, we simply don't know yet.  While some investigations are underway, there has not yet been one successful prosecution on a charge of money-laundering under the new statutes. Perhaps it is too soon to expect such prosecutions to take place. But in that case, pronouncing the laws a success is wholly premature.  This is especially true when we know that there are questions about these regulations. For example, despite U.S. urging to make violations of the new banking regulations criminal offenses, Mexico has decided to make these offenses non-criminal violations, which severely undercuts their deterrent effect.  In addition, the fine to be imposed on banks who fail to report suspicious transactions--10 percent of the value of the transaction--may not be enough to pose a disincentive to cheat. Ten percent of the value of a transaction, and no criminal penalties, may be a pittance compared with the lucrative bribes often offered by the cartels.  My point is simply this: It is too early to look at Mexico's anti-money-laundering effort and declare it a success. There is no problem with acknowledging progress. But to declare full cooperation to have been achieved before there has been even one prosecution under the law, simply lowers the bar to an absurd level.                 Cooperation with U.S. Law Enforcement  As I said before, law enforcement cooperation is where the rubber hits the road in counternarcotics, not in agreements reached at the political level. And this is a source of major concern to me because, unfortunately, law enforcement cooperation from Mexico has been severely lacking.  The State Department's Statement of Explanation is largely silent on the subject of law enforcement cooperation. Well it should be. To describe the extensive cooperation between the two sides, the State Department cites meetings of the High-Level Contact Group, and the Senior Law Enforcement Plenary, and their various technical working groups.  But the truth is that all the high-level meetings in the world do not amount to a hill of beans unless there is cooperation and coordination on the ground between the law enforcement agencies of the two sides. Once again, the State Department's assertion that these meetings are a sign of real progress misses the point. Whether or not our leaders can work together is less important than whether our police and intelligence operatives can work together.  And with few exceptions at the moment, they cannot. Again, I would like to acknowledge progress. In contrast to last year, when DEA testified that there was not a single Mexican law enforcement agency with whom it had a completely trusting relationship, it is encouraging to learn that there are now some Mexican officials with whom DEA believes they can build a trusting relationship.  A key aspect of this institution-building process is vetting, leading to the development and professionalization of the new drug enforcement units in the Organized Crime Unit, and the Special Prosecutor's Office for Crimes Against Health.  This vetting process, if fully implemented, could go a long way toward providing U.S. law enforcement officials with the level of trust in their counterparts necessary for an effective bilateral effort.  But it is still in its infancy, and even some officials who have been vetted have subsequently been arrested in connection with traffickers. So while this effort is critically important, it is not evidence of full cooperation by a long shot.  The small number of officers in the two units with which DEA now has a tentative, case-by-case trusting relationship, is a beginning, but only that.  Take the much-vaunted Bilateral Border Task Forces, for example. These joint U.S.-Mexican units have been widely touted for some two years as ``the primary program for cooperative law enforcement efforts.''  Based in Tijuana, Cuidad Juarez, and Monterrey, each Task Force was supposed to include Mexican agents and two agents each from the DEA, FBI, and the U.S. Customs Service. The Binational Drug Strategy listed these task forces as one of the key measures of cooperation between our two nations.  Today, as this chart indicates and as the Washington Post reported onMarch 9, 1998, this program is a shambles. The Task Forces exist only on paper. Why did this happen?  Unfortunately, as DEA Administrator Constantine explained to the Foreign Relations Committee, these Task Forces never really got started. Several of the Mexican agents who were assigned to these units, including commandantes, were suspected of, and even arrested for, corruption and ties to criminal organizations.  Ignacio Weber Rodriguez, commander of the Tijuana task force, was arrested for his alleged involvement in the kidnaping of Alejandro Hodoyan Palacios, a DEA informant.  In May, the Mexican commander and four members of one of the Task Forces were arrested for their alleged involvement in the theft of a half-ton of cocaine from the Mexican Attorney General's office in San Luis Rio Colorado.  Horacio Brunt Acosta, a Mexican federal police officer in charge of intelligence operations for the Task Forces, was fired last year for allegedly taking bribes from drug traffickers.  Is it any wonder that, despite the creation of two small vetted units, the level of trust between DEA agents and their Mexican counterparts is very low?  After the arrest of General Gutierrez Rebollo, the old Task Forces were dismantled, and have since been rebuilt. But for months, the Mexican government did not provide the promised funding, leaving DEA to carry the full cost, which they did until last September.  Additionally, the issue of personal security for U.S. agents working with the Bilateral Task Forces in Mexico has not been resolved, and, as a result, the task forces are not operational and will not be until the security issue is resolved.  The bottom line is that the task forces cannot function properly without DEA and other federal law enforcement agents working side-by-side with their Mexican counterparts, as is the case with similar units in Colombia and Peru.  This critical joint working relationship is made impossible by Mexican policies that do not allow for adequate immunities or physical security for U.S. agents while working in Mexico. This is an inescapable sign of lack of cooperation.  A related problem for the Task Forces is the low quality of intelligence provided by Mexico. Mr. Constantine testified before the Foreign Relations Committee that he is not aware of a single occasion in the past year when meaningful intelligence leads from Mexican agents to their American counterparts led to a significant seizure of drugs coming across the border. Not one. Intelligence flows in only one direction--south.  U.S. law enforcement officials indicate that Mexico's drug intelligence facilities located near the Task Forces are manned by non-vetted, non-law enforcement civilians and military staff. These units have produced only leads from telephone intercepts on low-level traffickers. To date, none of the electronic intercepts conducted by the Task Forces have produced a prosecutable drug case in Mexican courts against any major Mexican criminal organization.  So when we look at the utter collapse of the primary joint law enforcement effort between our two countries, we see that it fell victim to a lack of trust, lack of concern for the security of U.S. agents, corruption on the Mexican side, and Mexico's insufficient commitment to the necessary funding.  Looking at all this evidence, I am baffled, to say the least, that anyone could describe our law enforcement cooperation with Mexico as ``full cooperation.''  I ask unanimous consent that the Washington Post article of March 9, 1998 be entered into the record following my remarks.                What Happens If We Pass This Resolution?  I know that many of my colleagues are concerned about the prospect of imposing sanctions on Mexico if we pass this resolution of disapproval. Well, let me address this issue head on.  Senator Coverdell and I, and our cosponsors, have no desire to punish Mexico or impose sanctions on Mexico. Indeed, the resolution we would prefer to be debating makes that explicit. S.J. Res. 43 contains a Presidential waiver authority, which allows the President to waive any sanctions that would result from Congress' reversal of his decision.  But some of our colleagues objected to that resolution coming up. They did so because they knew it would stand a good chance of passage. So they have forced us to turn to the only resolution that is guaranteed a straight up or down vote--S.J. Res. 42, a resolution of disapproval no waiver.  I would hope that Senators would vote their concern about drugs in this country. In reality, there is little chance, I believe, that Mexico will actually be decertified.  I believe that a statement from the Congress that we are not satisfied with the level of cooperation we receive, will--after the shouting and posturing--produce a renewed effort to prove that full cooperation is being achieved. I believe that the limited progress that was made this year is due in large part to the outcry in Congress over last year's decision, and the pressure that was kept on by Congress throughout the year.  Some of my colleagues do not like the certification law. They think it antagonizes allies, and that may be true. But I think the law, while perhaps imperfect, serves an important purpose, and I am gratified to be able to add these views to the record.  The New York Times editorial of February 28, 1998 criticized the certification process, but said that ``as long as certification remains on the books, the Administration has a duty to report truthfully to Congress and the American people. It has failed to do so in the case of Mexico.''  Clearly, the best option for Mexico, both last year and this, would have been to decertify but waive the sanctions on national interest grounds, as we did with Colombia this year. That is the appropriate category for an ally with whom we need to work, and who is making progress, but who has not met the standard of ``full cooperation.''  In the meantime, we should make very clear what we expect in the way of improved cooperation:  Improved enforcement and increased seizures and arrests across the board;  A strong and sustained effort to dismantle the cartels, including the arrest of their top leaders;  The actual extradition and surrender of Mexican nationals wanted on drug charges, without undue delays;  A sustained program to root out corruption, including more widespread vetting and prosecutions of corrupt officials;  Full implementation and enforcement of money-laundering statutes, with vigorous prosecution of violators; and  Cooperation at the law enforcement level that inspires trust and confidence in our agents, and includes intelligence sharing and adequate security measures.  If Mexico achieves each of these goals, or even makes significant and consistent strides toward them, the supply of drugs will undoubtedly be diminished. And I, for one, would be an enthusiastic supporter of Mexico's full certification.  While this is not the resolution I had hoped we would vote on, it is the Senate's only opportunity to render its verdict on the decision to certify Mexico. I urge my colleagues to support the resolution, and stand for genuine full cooperation.  I yield the floor at this time. I know others wish to speak.
