Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing a bill to clarify the tax treatment of Settlement Trusts authorized by the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. This legislation is very similar to a bill that I introduced with my colleagues, Congressmen George Miller and J.D. Hayworth, last Congress.  The bill has been further improved from last Congress and a companion measure was introduced in the Senate recently. The bill's introduction in the House before the Memorial Day recess is aimed at expediting consideration of it in Congress and within the executive branch. Once the recess has ended, I am expecting that the original cosponsors from last year as well as additional cosponsors will reintroduce the legislation for consideration in the House.  At the time the bill is reintroduced, those Members cosponsoring it and I will submit for our colleagues' information a detailed explanation of the bill along with background and history relating to it.                          ____________________
