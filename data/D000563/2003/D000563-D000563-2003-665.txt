President, my thanks to the Senators from Virginia and Michigan for accommodating me. I thank the Parliamentarian. I have been in a similar position in another legislative body. It is a tough assignment. I thank them for their courtesy and diligence and the ruling they have offered to us.  (The remarks of Mr. Durbin are printed in today's Record under ``Morning Business.'')
