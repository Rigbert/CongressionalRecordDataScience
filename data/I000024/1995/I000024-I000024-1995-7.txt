President, today there will be a period for morning business until the hour of 10:30 with Senators permitted to speak up to 5 minutes each, with the following exceptions: Senator Wellstone, 30 minutes; Senator Murkowski, 15 minutes; Senator Jeffords, 15 minutes.  At 10:30 this morning, the Senate will begin consideration of the Interior appropriations conference report, H.R. 1977. That conference report is limited to 6 hours of debate. However, some of that debate time may be yielded back.  Following a vote on the Interior appropriations conference report, the Senate may turn to the consideration of the State Department reorganization bill under a previously agreed to 4-hour time limit. Rollcalls can therefore be expected throughout the day today.
