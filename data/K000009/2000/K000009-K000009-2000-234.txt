Speaker, that is the gentleman that denied me the right to offer my amendments on this floor.  Now, I want to say on this oil business that for us to continue foreign dependence is absolutely a military vulnerability to the United States of America. We had an amendment that would have allowed the Secretary of Energy to purchase domestically produced product and put it in the reserve and we have been denied that opportunity here on the floor.  Finally, in the area of farm crisis here at home, low prices across this country, our farmers biting the dust, small and medium-sized farmers; we had an amendment in here that would have permitted the Secretary of Agriculture to offer equity capital in loans to those small and medium-sized farmers trying to reposition in this cruel marketplace today. We were disallowed the ability to do that. This is the year of 2000. They cannot hang on until next year.  I want to say that many of our Members here also went up to the Committee on Rules yesterday. The gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Goodling), who was just here on the floor asking for plum pox which is going to destroy the fruit crop in Pennsylvania and it will spread to other States. The gentleman from New York (Mr. Hinchey) for special crop disasters in New York and California and other places; the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Shays) and the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Mr. DeLauro) on lobster fisheries; the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Stupak), the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Camp), and the gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. Stabenow) on the spread of bovine tuberculosis in the State of Michigan; and the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Wu) and the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Capps) who just appeared on fisheries on the West Coast.  Vote ``no'' on the rule. Too many of our Members have been excluded.
