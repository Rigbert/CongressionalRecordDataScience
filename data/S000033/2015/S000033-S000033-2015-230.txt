The essays follow:             Sam Anglum, Burr And Burton Academy (Finalist)       We marched along for roughly 5 miles, part of which was      right through Times Square. While holding up our signs and      chanting what we wanted to see change in our government's      priorities, I looked to my left and gazed at the skyline full      of skyscrapers atop the canopy of Central Park.       My class and I were marching alongside 400,000 New Yorkers,      Americans, and globally aware citizens at the 2014 NYC      Climate March. Climate change is a very serious issue that      not many people are sensitive enough about. My hopes going      into the march were to be a part of bringing global awareness      to the massive shift in attitude I feel is going to save the      Earth from its imminent doom.       After participating in such a momentous event, I want my      voice to echo further than the streets of Manhattan. I want      the United States government to consider helping by promoting      climate education in schools across the nation so that this      kind of action becomes a part of the everyday agenda. As a      high school student in Vermont, I urge my very own state      senators including Governor Shumlin to consider spreading      this type of education across the State of Vermont. I imagine      the future generations as the key components to setting goals      and battling for solutions to the problems that people are      fighting against today.       Not everyone will be an activist, or even care nearly as      much as they should, but as long as more of the youth is      aware of these pressing global issues, the amount of people      that will create change will no doubt be multiplied. Our      world's economic foundation is based on the over-extraction      of fossil fuels, and because of this one in four carbon      emissions comes from humans. I am aware that Vermont has a      goal of making restrictions on fossil fuels and ultimately      becoming 90 percent renewable by 2050. Every student in      Vermont should be aware of this goal. I strongly urge the      United States government to contribute to that further by      promoting this kind of discussion within classrooms.       New York City Councilman Donovan Richards, a man on the      panel for 350.org, spoke to us the night before the march,      and his words stuck with me. ``Rulership does not coincide      with leadership.'' The streets of Manhattan were full of      leaders on Sunday, September 21, and our desire was to      influence our rulers. However, if our voice is transmitted to      our ``rulers'' such as yourself, our governments can ``lead''      us into a more sustainable and renewable world.    Caroline Arthaud, Champlain Valley Union High School (Finalist)       Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, and      fellow Americans:       Theodore Roosevelt once said, ``This country will not be a      good place for any of us to live in unless we make it a good      place for all of us to live in.'' At this time, it is my duty      to lead this country towards such a place. I stand here today      to address our successes, but also our deficits. Although      Americans have many reasons to be proud of our      accomplishments, it is unrealistic and inaccurate to declare      ourselves flawless. We must muster the courage to confront      the issues that hold us back.       Although the unemployment rate has decreased from 9.7      percent in 2010 to 5.8 percent in November of 2014, there are      still 9 million     Americans without jobs. This is not acceptable.       Beyond this, our precious environment is deteriorating.      What many seem to struggle to understand is that the gradual      warming of the earth is not an issue affecting only polar      bears and penguins, but a growing danger to humans, as well.       To begin to address issues of unemployment and environment,      it is important that we, the American people, do our part to      raise awareness and call for action. America needs to      initiate large-scale production of renewable energy sources.      This will help us in two ways: it will expand employment and      create new jobs, and it will also transition this country      from dependence on pollution-causing energy sources to      cleaner solutions. We can sleep easier knowing that we have      stopped engaging in a process sure to leave our children and      grandchildren with a world too far gone to rehabilitate.       Yet, another issue has escalated severely in recent years.      It is one that has resulted in the violent deaths of 20      innocent six-year-olds in 2012, and that continues to take      the lives of an average of 289 Americans daily. Many of us      don't want to look at the problem of gun violence, but it has      become something we can no longer ignore. We must formulate      legislation that demands the renewal of gun permits on a      regular basis, and work to improve the quality of mental      health treatment. We must insist upon implementing stricter      background checks on anyone wishing to bear weapons.       Change is difficult. It's difficult on an individual basis,      and vastly more difficult on a national one. However, I      believe that the ability to change is a big part of what has      made this nation so great. Americans are resilient and      creative, and I believe that if we set our minds to it, we      can improve the state of our union. I call upon you, all of      you, to help continue the legacy of this remarkable country      by working with me to better the lives of all Americans.      Unemployment, environmental degradation, and gun violence are      a lot to take on; however, we live in a country capable of      anything.       Thank you. God bless you, and God bless the United States      of America.               HAR WA BI, Winooski High School (Finalist)       ``There is a lot that happens around the world we cannot      control. We cannot stop earthquakes, we cannot prevent      droughts, and we cannot prevent all conflict, but when we      know where the hungry, the homeless and the sick exist, then      we can help,'' says Jan Schakowsky, the U.S. Representative      from Illinois. We can't help what nature creates, but being      homeless is not nature. It is produced by humans and only      humans can erase it. It is our nation's fault for letting      people become homeless and live in poverty. We need to help      the homeless and not let the poor become homeless.       According to studentsagainsthunger.org in United States,      each year more than 3.5 million people become homeless. They      are forced to sleep in parks, under bridges, in shelters or      cars. In fact, 35 percent of the homeless population are      families with children, which is the fastest growing segment      of the homeless population. And, 25 percent of the homeless      population suffer from some form of mental illness. According      to the feedingamerica.org, 45.3 percent of the people lived      in poverty in 2013. This included 26.4 million people ages 18      to 64, 4.7 million children under the age of 18, and 4.2      million seniors 65 and older.       I believe poverty happens in the United States because      housing and hospital bills are too expensive. Lower-income      workers cannot afford food and shelter. After we pay for      housing, nothing is left for us. We don't have a higher      income, we have food stamps which are low because the      government cut it off, including for my family. And, my mom      is the only one who works. According to homeaid.org, some      part of the homelessness is caused by the loss of loved ones,      job loss, domestic violence, divorce and family disputes.      Other impairments such as depression, untreated mental      illness, post-traumatic stress disorder, and physical      disabilities are also responsible for a large portion of the      homeless. I want government to help those people who need and      try to stop it from happening, and to make our nation become      better.       I believe only government can decrease homelessness and      help to increase the income, which all poor people need. We      need to decrease the cost of hospitals or anything that costs      a lot. Please help us poor and homeless because the      government is our only hope. We will be waiting for the      results of our government's actions.         Peter Camardo, South Burlington High School (Finalist)       A democracy is a government ruled by the people. In a      democracy, the citizens hold the responsibility of making      decisions. This is why United States of America has been      successful throughout history. A democracy is the most      productive way to run society when its citizens are engaged,      but it loses its superiority when the population is plagued      by ignorance.       In my lifetime, Americans have been fortunate to live on      our homeland without major threat to our national security.      We have grown accustomed to lives of guaranteed safety.      Unfortunately with this privilege, we have begun to feel      entitled and to neglect our responsibility as American      citizens. Issues of great concern are being ignored by the      American population as if they mean nothing. Americans are      sitting back and waiting for others to take action while      grave matters are left undebated by the American public. I      think back to President Kennedy's inaugural speech, and when      he said the famous words, ``Ask not what your country can do      for you--ask what you can do for your country.'' It is      important that we American citizens remind ourselves of these      words in everything we do, and to remember that our      government is built upon the strong, independent voices that      make up a democracy.       I don't believe there is one significant issue concerning      the United States that is more urgent than the rest. Each      issue we face is vital for our nation to address      appropriately. Regardless of which issue we undertake at      which time, the first step to solving it is to become      educated, and to stop ignoring problems just because they are      not affecting us directly. All the members of a democracy      must understand a conflict before it can be solved. In an age      where people have infinite information at their fingertips,      it can be easy to lose sight of important information. We      must be educated before we can solve our issues of today.       The responsibility to educate the public lies with the      elected members of our government. It is important for our      government to be straightforward and honest. It is important      that when there are protests and movements the voices of the      American people are heard and represented. Most importantly,      the United States Congress should set an example for      leadership and communication, and should inspire the people      of the United States through proactive legislation and      positive inter-party communication.       We are the greatest nation on earth. We are far too      experienced and wise to get caught up in a bipartisan      conflict. When we get caught up in a battle with ourselves,      it dejects us. The reason why the citizens of America have      lost a sense of American pride is because our leaders seem to      have lost a sense of purpose. The objective of our government      is to, ``Establish justice, insure domestic tranquility,      provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare,      and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our      posterity,'' and the government should put aside their      personal beliefs in an effort to make that happen.     Taylor Devaney, Missisquoi Valley Union High School (Finalist)       President Obama once said that, ``The nation cannot prosper      long when it favors only the prosperous'', and as a young      Vermonter, I agree with this statement. I am concerned with      the state of our union due to the ever-growing, unequal      wealth distribution. As the rich get richer, the poor get      poorer, and in many situations wealth distribution gets      ignored. The middle class population used to be the backbone      of the nation, but every year it gets harder to make ends      meet, as they slide lower down the economic class scale.      America leads the world in the widest gap between the have      and have nots, making the idea of America being the land of      opportunity seem more of an unlikely dream.       The most recent studies from the Federal Reserve show that      a mere 3 percent of American families own 54 percent of the      wealth in the United States. The unbalanced wealth      distribution is dangerous for the nation as a whole.      Economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman state that in      their research that the wealth distribution has grown to the      same levels as in the 1920's. The top 1 percent owns upwards      of 40 percent of the wealth in the United States. As a      nation, we have experienced the disastrous effects of an      economic crash during the Great Depression, due to unbalanced      wealth. We as a nation have failed to learn from our mistakes      and are continuing down a dangerous path. The middle class is      still at risk for being hurt the most, as they are left to      clean up the mess of the high rollers. An unfair task when      their wages remain stagnant, as the profits and wages soar      for those at the top of the corrupted corporate ladder. The      hard working American people do not deserve to struggle and      something must be done.       The mega-rich are not paying appropriate amount of taxes      for their wealth, making the middle and lower class make up      for the difference. Many of the people who control the tax      rates are also the ones who make the most. Members of      Congress are creating laws to benefit themselves. Big money      and government fit together well, for politicians look for      the wealthy to support them financially.       We can no longer only provide for wealthy men and women who      indirectly control our government. Creating a scaled taxation      system will help balance the wealth in the nation. Making      sure the wealthy are paying their fair share is key to      balancing out our nation's prosperity. The U.S. can take note      from the most famous, and down to Earth business from      Vermont, Ben & Jerry's. This company had a system of a pay      ratio between the highest paid employee and the lowest paid      employee of 5 to 1 in its early years. These numbers are      relatively small, but scaling them could make an impact on      businesses today. Unequal wealth distribution benefits only a      small portion of the country and will be the cause of a      failed economy.             Connor Drown, Winooski High School (Finalist)       America. Home of the brave and land of the free. It is at      its heart known as a free country, with opportunity just      waiting for someone to snatch it up for themselves. It is a      land where one desires the ``American     Dream.'' Unfortunately, this is not remotely possible, and      many citizens of the United States have difficulties living      in this country. The United States of America is a great      country to live in, if not the best, but is also far from      perfect.       Everything in America could be improved in one way or the      other. Education and health care are huge government issues      that need improvement in order to make the United States of      America a more suitable place to live.       Firstly, education in America is one of if not the most      important factors to a successful career and life for US      citizens. Getting a high school diploma is still very      important, but it is now becoming more and more of a      necessity to attend college and get a degree. According to      usnews.com, the value of a college degree is greater than it      has been in nearly half a century, at least when compared to      the prospect of not getting a degree. Among millennials ages      25 to 32, median annual earnings for fulltime working college      degree holders are $17,500 greater than for those with high      school diplomas only. The only problem is that college has      increasingly become less and less affordable.       According to the College Board, the average cost of tuition      and fees for the 2013-2014 academic year was $30,094 at      private colleges, $8,893 for state residents at public      colleges, and $22,203 for out-of-state residents attending      public universities. Most Americans don't even consider      public schools, which are most often referred to as the least      expensive, affordable. According to the Huffington Post, 62      percent said they believe most people are not able to afford      the cost of a public college education. If the majority of      America could afford college to achieve their career goals,      America will be a better and more successful country. If      something such as raising taxes benefits colleges in that it      will be more affordable, America will have more opportunity      to strive for success.       Health care is another issue that I feel should be      mentioned. It is said that President Obama and the United      States in general wants to make healthcare more affordable to      everyone. Government run health care systems, such as      Obamacare, are free and low-cost government run programs that      result in higher costs and everyone receiving the same poor      quality health care. Health care should remain privatized so      that the people who may need better health care and can also      afford it without a huge deductible may receive it.       In conclusion, ensuring that health care remains the same      and reducing the cost of education will undeniably improve      America.         Spencer Eckert, Woodstock Union High School (Finalist)       Remember when you got your first job? I'm sure it was an      exciting and proud moment. It could be that you weren't even      concerned about your hourly pay, but as time went by, I'm      certain that changed and you realized that you work hard and      want to be compensated for that. In today's society, it can      be hard to earn a good living wage from a ``decent'' job. But      for many people, they don't get good pay even when they      should. The low minimum wage today makes it difficult for      people to survive and make a living.       There are a number of compelling reasons to increase the      minimum wage. Let's begin with the economy. It's simple;      raising the minimum wage would have a positive effect on the      economy by giving workers more money to spend. It would be      good to raise the minimum wage to $15 because there would be      more money being pumped into the economy. If workers get paid      more, then they are happier and with a better mood they will      want to spend more. It gives people the confidence to spend      more and when they spend more they are fueling the economy.      ``A raise for minimum wage earners will put more money in      more families' pockets, which will be spent on goods and      services, stimulating economic growth locally and      nationally,'' according to the ``Minimum Wage Mythbusters.''       Increasing minimum wage has a positive impact on the      working family. It helps them to make ends meet, and at the      same time enables them to spend some money. When they spend      money, they are fueling the economy.       Raising the minimum wage would not cause any job loss or      unemployment, and most work places would not go out of      business if they were to raise the minimum wage. In fact      there would probably be less turnover. Therefore, companies      would reduce the amount of money they spend on training. If      companies compensate their employees with better wages than      those employees are happier and more committed to that      company. So raising the minimum wage can have a positive      effect on companies. ``Raising the minimum wage would be good      for our economy. A higher minimum wage not only increases      workers' incomes--which is sorely needed to boost demand and      get the economy going--but it also reduces turnover, cuts the      costs that low-paid employers impose on taxpayers, and pushes      businesses toward a high-road, high-human-capital model.''      (Said T. William Lester, David Madland, and Jackie Odum, in      their article Raising the Minimum Wage Would Help, Not Hurt,      Our Economy)       One reason why the minimum wage should be increased to $15      is because it would help a lot of people get out of the      poverty level. Too many people in the country who work at      minimum wage jobs currently depend on the government for      other help. People subscribe to government programs such as      food stamps and school breakfast and lunch programs, just to      name a few. ``According to a Michigan survey shows that      families who work at fast food businesses are much more      likely to enroll in safety net programs than the workforce as      a whole, such as food stamps.''       Another reason why the minimum wage should be increased to      $15 is because of the positive psychological benefits. It      would raise people's self-esteem and self-worth and would      also allow children in these poverty-level homes to have      better opportunities in the future. If these children are      able to improve their performance in school, then they are      likely to continue education which would allow them to pursue      better paying jobs in the future. If they have better paying      jobs, they are no longer on government programs and they have      the opportunity and confidence to spend money which fuel the      economy. It is a positive cycle. ``A raise in the minimum      wage would not only help many families escape or avoid      poverty, but could also significantly boost their children's      academic performance and future adult earnings,'' said Yannet      M. Lathrop, a Policy Analyst who has conducted studies on      raising the minimum wage.       There really is no downside to raising the minimum wage.      Raising the minimum wage to $15 would be good for employers,      workers, families, and the economy. Raising the minimum wage      would lead to these dramatic outcomes: getting families out      of poverty, giving children a better education and future,      giving employers committed workers, putting more money into      the economy, giving people the confidence to spend more and      making people happy.      Jacob Gallow, Missisquoi Valley Union High School (Finalist)       Jean-Jacques Rousseau stated, ``A man is born free, but      everywhere we are in chains.'' Freedom is something everyone      seeks, but most will never experience it. Given more power,      the government becomes a wolf among sheep. People flock to      the sight of freedom, only to see that even something so      great has its limits. Governments tend to give more things to      the people, things to give them a sense of security, a place      to sleep, somewhere to work, to do as they wish. Those things      come at a price, the price of freedom. The more the people      receive, especially on the topic of security, the more      liberties are contracted.       Are we truly free? America sits in the shadow of threats      every day, for there will always be some person who despises      the place we call home. Security is something we, as      Americans, take for granted. While we sit in the shadows, not      even aware of it, brave men and women risk their lives and      die every day for the security of their homeland, wishing for      a safe place for their friends and family to live. Yet, here      we sit in the symbolic country of freedom, with someone      always looking over our shoulder. That security we take for      granted tends to take away the liberties and freedoms we were      given many years ago. The more of a grip the government has      on its people, the more the people are caged.       Our troops are out fighting for our government, and our      government's wishes, but have we ever stopped to think of      what our own troops went through? According to Veteran's      Inc., around 529,000 and 840,000 veterans are homeless each      year, one in ten veterans are disabled related to war      injuries. According to CNN, 22 veterans take their own lives      each and every day, some resulting from PTSD, a disorder      soldiers get after experiencing the horrors of war. Veteran      unemployment rate is another issue among all of these. What      can we, as Americans, do to help our Veterans. We surely are      not doing enough, and those numbers keep climbing. What about      those families of soldiers, what do they have to go through      each and every day with a spouse, parent, or sibling off at      war, fighting people because our governments wants to be      ``involved.''       We don't need to be caught in everyone else's business,      unless it becomes our business, and if we do get involved, we      need to back up our soldiers first. Our country had to solve      our own problems in 1861-1865, let others do the same.       Freedom isn't really free. Here in America, we are promised      freedom, but the securities we receive and the democracy we      spread binds us in chains, not allowing us to roam free. Sure      there needs to be laws enforced, yes there needs to be      security, but we need freedom too. Our government needs to      focus on our country. Will we as Americans allow the      anaconda, known as the government, to strangle us, the      people, as mice?                          ____________________
