We should be sitting down and rewriting this law that is 127 years old instead of having other environmental riders in an Interior appropriations bill. We should be looking to the royalty question, which is a legitimate question that every taxpayer should be interested in instead of saying we are going to take the limitation of the acreage used by mining companies that dump their waste.  I think that is a legitimate concern. Maybe 5 acres isn't enough. But I also think it wouldn't be unreasonable to say to the mining companies: If we give you additional acres for mill sites, we will also require you to reclaim the land so that you can't leave the mess behind.  That is part of the law when it comes to coal mining on Federal public lands. Why shouldn't it be the case when it comes to hard-rock mining?  How can they step away from this mess and say: Frankly, future generations will have to worry about it, and we will not. Mandatory bonding, detailed permitting reclamation, mandated inspections--things that are part of the law when it comes to mining coal--should be part of the law when it comes to hardrock mining.  I reject the idea that we will come in with this bill and make amendments friendly to the mining industry but not hold them to any new standard when it comes to reclamation or royalties. I think the taxpayers deserve better. I think the environment deserves better.  That is what is necessary in this debate. We have seen it, first, on the emergency appropriations bill, where a similar provision was put forward for one mining operation in the State of Washington. Now, if this amendment goes through, we have literally opened the door for mining operations across the United States to literally use as much acreage as they want for their mill sites.
