 Over the past 50 years, Members of Congress have come and gone, but all the while, Dr. Walter Oleszek has been on hand at the Library of Congress to answer Members' and staff's toughest questions about the inner workings of American government.  Walter arrived in Washington in the summer of 1968 from Upstate New York. He signed on with the Legislative Reference Service, now the Congressional Research Service, and has been serving ever since.  Over five decades, Walter has grown into an institution unto himself. He is not only the longest serving CRS team member but also a dedicated and integral part of its operations, while also finding time to teach and lecture on the side.  Alan Frumin, the former Senate Parliamentarian, was actually one of Walter's students at Colgate University years ago. According to Alan, ``If there's anything about Congress that Walter does not know, then that thing doesn't exist.'' In my experience around here, the Parliamentarian is usually the smartest one in the room. So that is especially high praise, and Walter has earned it.  Today, on behalf of the Senate, I want to thank this scholar, author, internationally sought adviser, and dedicated steward of the U.S. Congress. We congratulate him on his career thus far and look forward to continuing to work alongside him.                          ____________________
