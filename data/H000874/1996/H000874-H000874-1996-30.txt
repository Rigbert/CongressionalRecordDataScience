Speaker, if the gentleman will continue to yield, again, I want to thank him for his serious treatment of this and his concern that, as far as I know, nobody on this side of the aisle has seen the completed bill at this point in time.  I understand Mr. Cox, according to what the gentleman says, has made some modifications of this printed bill. If that is the case, we clearly would like to have, Mr. Leader, as soon as possible, the substance so that we will know what we are considering.
