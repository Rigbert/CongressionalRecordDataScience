Speaker, reclaiming my time, some of us do not believe that is quite as obvious as the gentleman does.  I yield back to the gentleman.  Mr. DeLAY. I appreciate the gentleman yielding.  I do recall that in the last Congress when we approached the energy bill there was I think at least 20, if not more, amendments allowed on the bill. I would anticipate that the same approach, because the bill is very similar to the bill we passed in the last Congress, would be taken.
