 President, I wish to pay tribute to Coach Willie Carl Martin of the University of Alabama. After 42 years of coaching football in the Alabama public school system and at the University of Alabama, Coach Willie Carl Martin is retiring. During his high school playing days, he was such an outstanding athlete that the late Coach Paul ``Bear'' Bryant offered him a full scholarship to Alabama. He was the first African-American to be offered an athletic scholarship to the university. He declined the offer and went to college at Northeastern State University, where he was a second team All-American. He then played professional football in Canada for 6 years. He returned to his hometown, Alexander City, AL; where he began his coaching career as an assistant coach, and then as head football coach at Benjamin Russell High School. In 2001, he led Benjamin Russell High School to their first and only State Championship. After 25 years of a truly outstanding and impressive career in high school coaching, Coach Martin was hired as an assistant coach and for player development by Alabama's new coach, Nick Saban, in 2007. During his 8 years at Alabama, he had an instrumental part in Alabama winning three SEC championships and three national championships.  Willie Carl has demonstrated exceptional academic and professional careers both in teaching and coaching young students. He is a loyal, dedicated individual who has always had time for his students and players. He is generous with his time with others, regardless of their station in life. He is fortunate enough to have a wife, Leslie, as well as two lovely daughters and grandchildren, who have stood by him in all of his endeavors. I know they, along with his other numerous friends and family, will join me in proclaiming May 12, 2015, as Willie Carl Martin Day in Alexander City, AL.                          ____________________
