President, Jerome Holmes has made some troubling statements about affirmative action and the use of race in our society. He has said:       [Affirmative action] policies necessarily divide us along      racial lines, and establish a spoils system based upon skin      color. . . .       [t]he [Supreme] court upheld the affirmative action policy      of the university's law school [in the 2003 Michigan case].      And in so doing, it missed an important opportunity to drive      the final nail in the coffin of affirmative action. . . .       [r]ace-based scholarship programs . . . [are]      constitutionally dubious and morally offensive racial      classifications. . . .       Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson and their ilk have little to      offer me or other African-Americans in the 21st century.
