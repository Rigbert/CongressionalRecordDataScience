Speaker, I want to commend the resolution. I also want to commend the Florida Marlins. They are a terrific team. Their outfield speed, their pitching, their fans, their coach, is really outstanding. I think it is a pretty good deal.  I saw in the paper the other day that they are only a 15 to 1 team to repeat next year. I think that is a pretty good deal, by the way, particularly now that they signed, resigned Jack McKeon.  I just have one question, though, for the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen). And I was a good loser. I helped participate with the Chicago folks in providing Chicago pizza and a few other things for the delegation. I want to ask if there is anything in this resolution, and I admit that I have not read it yet, that either praises that right fielder for the Giants that dropped that ball at the critical point in the play-offs, or Steve Bartman?
