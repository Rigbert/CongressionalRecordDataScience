President, today I am pleased to introduce legislation to designate the United States Post Office at 2105 East Cook Street in Springfield, IL, as the ``Colonel John H. Wilson, Jr. Post Office Building,'' honoring the first African-American to achieve the rank of Colonel in the Illinois Reserves.  Colonel John H. Wilson, Jr., was born on December 28, 1918, in Springfield, IL. In 1942, he enlisted in World War II and served in five battle campaigns in Europe, including in General Patton's advance in France, for which he was awarded the Silver Star Medal.  In addition to his 14 years of active duty service, he served for 17 years in the Illinois Reserves. He served as group commander in Springfield from 1967-1973 and was promoted to Colonel in 1965, making him the first African-American to achieve that rank in the Illinois Reserves at that time. Upon his retirement in 1973, he was awarded the Legion of Merit from the Army.  In his civilian life, Col. Wilson worked for the United States Postal Service for 57 years. From time to time, he would stop by my office in Springfield to share news about our local post office and make sure our mail was being delivered on time. Whenever he could, he would stop by to see me in Washington.  Anyone who knew Col. Wilson also knew of his love for the Reserves. He was a life member of the U.S. Reserve Officers Association, President of the ROA Springfield Chapter from 1960-61 and President of the ROA Illinois Department from 1971-72.  He was also a commercial photographer, member of the Military Officers of America, and lifelong member of Holy Trinity Lutheran Church.  He died on August 30, 2008, in the same home of his birth. He is survived by his wife of 62 years, Lydie, and their two daughters, Shirley Wilson and Chantal Sneed.  Col. Wilson was a distinguished man of service. My hometown of Springfield, IL and our Nation is a better place because of his lifelong commitment to his country.  I am grateful to Springfield Mayor Timothy Davlin, former Illinois National Guard Adjutant General Lou Myers, and the local branch of the American Postal Workers Union for their support of this legislation. I hope my colleagues will join me in enacting this tribute to Col. Wilson.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 234       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. COLONEL JOHN H. WILSON, JR. POST OFFICE BUILDING.       (a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal      Service located at 2105 East Cook Street in Springfield,      Illinois, shall be known and designated as the ``Colonel John      H. Wilson, Jr. Post Office Building''.       (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,      document, paper, or other record of the United States to the      facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be      a reference to the ``Colonel John H. Wilson, Jr. Post Office      Building''.                                 ______                                       By
