Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I reluctantly oppose this amendment for a couple of reasons. I do not think it is workable, and it will cause huge problems on the northern border that will result in a lot of jobs being lost both in the United States and Canada.  First of all, we have got about 20,000 detention beds that ICE has got underits control; and about 80 percent of those detention beds are currently filled by criminal aliens, and they are subject to mandatory detention. If there are more people that are put into the detention system without more beds being created by ICE, the courts will not allow for overcrowding of detention facilities. And all of a sudden, there are going to be criminal aliens that are going to be either released on the street or not being put in detention simply because there are not the slots that are available. And that is going to result in the misallocation of resources.  Now, I certainly am all for internal enforcement, but given the fact that there are a half million aliens that illegally enter the United States every year, the requirements here do not match up with the facilities and the infrastructure available. And the deadlines that the gentleman has in his amendment are going to be simply unworkable, and it is going to end up resulting in the agency shifting its resources from what it is doing now, which is concentrating on the criminal aliens and the drug smugglers and the human trafficking smugglers, to other people.  Now, I would also like to talk a little bit about the northern border. What this amendment does is that it has a requirement that there be a mandatory biometric universal processing through the automatic entry-exit control system, which is the US-VISIT program with the fingerprint scans for aliens. We do not have the facilities on the northern border to do that at the present time.  The amendment says, not later than January 1 of 2008 that this infrastructure will be in place. But what this will require is that everybody who does not prove they are a United States citizen or a permanent resident of the United States get out of their car and have a fingerprint scan and wait for the data to come up on the screen of the immigration inspector on the northern border.  Now, when 9/11 occurred and there were hours and hours of waiting to get across the border between the United States and Canada, there were a lot of businesses, and the auto business simply did not get the goods that they needed to be able to conduct their business on the dock in time for the first shift to be able to use that raw material or to use their parts. And that kind of an obstruction along the northern border is going to mean huge unemployment in those border-sensitive communities where manufacturing, particularly, is intensely reliant on the products arriving on the dock in time.                              {time}  2045  It is not going to be just in our country, but it is going to be in Canada as well. The amendment is a good intention, but it is going to cause all kinds of enforcement problems, as I have described; but it is going to cause a lot of innocent people to lose their jobs along the northern border and should be opposed.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson-Lee).
