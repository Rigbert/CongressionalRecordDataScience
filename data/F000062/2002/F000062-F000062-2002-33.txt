 President, I rise today, along with Senator Boxer to introduce legislation that would name a post office in Los Angeles, CA after Nathaniel Adams Coles, whom we all know as Nat ``King'' Cole.  Nat ``King'' Cole was a great American vocalist and entertainer, and the best selling African-American recording artist of his generation.  Born in 1919 in Montgomery, AL, Mr. Cole proved, at an early age, to be quite musically adept. At the age of four, he gave his first public performance playing the piano and singing at Chicago's Regal Theater.  In 1937, as a struggling young musician, he moved to Southern California.  While in Los Angeles, Mr. Cole was asked to put together a small musical group which was to play at the Sewanee Inn, a Los Angeles nightclub.  The owner of the Sewanee Inn is responsible for the nickname ``King Cole'' because he asked him to wear a golden paper crown. Though the crown was short lived, the nickname stuck and the musical group became known as the King Cole Trio.  In 1943, the King Cole Trio signed with a fledgling record company known as Capital Records. The next year, Capital Records released a song written by Nat ``King'' Cole and recorded by the King Cole Trio called ``Straighten Up and Fly Right.''  The song became a huge hit due to its popularity with audiences of different races. The King Cole Trio went on to have a series of musical hits that include ``For Sentimental Reasons'' and ``The Christmas Song.''  Nat ``King'' Cole went on to sell so many records that Capital Records' headquarters became known as the ``House that Nat built.''  Nat ``King'' Cole's legacy not only encompasses his musical genius, but also his bravery in overcoming racial intolerance. During his career, he played in some clubs where he was the first ever Black entertainer to perform. He also endured an attack from white supremacists while on stage in Birmingham, Alabama in 1956.  Mr. Cole holds a special place in the hearts of Los Angeles residents, as a man who brought down racial barriers. In 1948, Mr. Cole and his family purchased a home in the exclusive Hancock Park section of Los Angeles. His would-be neighbors formed an association to prevent him from moving into the all-white community.  Overcoming these protests and threats, Mr. Cole moved in and became the first family to integrate the community.  In honor of this distinguished former resident, members of the community surrounding the Oakwood Station Post Office, have advocated that the post office at 265 South Western Avenue in Los Angeles be named after Nat ``King'' Cole.  It is my pleasure to introduce such legislation, and I hope that my colleagues will support it.                                 ______                                       By
