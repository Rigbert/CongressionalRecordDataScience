Speaker, my congressional district in Riverside, California is extremely fortunate to have a dynamic and dedicated group of community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give of their time and talents to ensure the well-being of our city and county. These individuals work tirelessly to develop voluntary community action to improve the community's economy, its education, its environment and its overall quality of life. One individual, who is a member of this group, is John Cleghorn. He has been active in so many community groups and activities that it is hard to imagine how he found the time to become a career law enforcement officer with the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) and the City of Corona, a husband and a father of three children.  On the 3rd of March, Mr. Cleghorn will be honored with the Ira. D. ``Cal'' Calvert Distinguished Service Award by the Corona-Norco Family YMCA. The award is given in memory of my father, ``Cal'' Calvert, and his enumerable philanthropic gifts to the community and his efforts to encourage others to serve their community in a similar fashion. The award recognizes Mr. Cleghorn for his exceptional devotion to developing community volunteerism.  Born in Pasadena, California, John Cleghorn developed an inherent love for law enforcement, according to his mother, from numerous ``ride-a-longs'' with the Pasadena Police Department--a result of his youthful desire for adventure in the neighborhoods, where he promptly got lost. He met his wife, Janet Everett, at University High, and married her following his graduation from Los Angeles City College. Intent on a career in law enforcement, John then entered the Los Angeles Police Academy, after which he was inducted in the Army and served for two years.  John's career with the LAPD lasted for an impressive 27 years where he commanded many divisions. During those years, he also worked to obtain a Bachelor of Science in Police Administration from California State University, Los Angeles and a Masters in PublicCommunications from Pepperdine University. After retiring from LAPD in 1985, John was named the interim police chief of Corona, and short time later officially appointed as police chief. Mr. Cleghorn and his wife have a son, two daughters and six grandchildren.  With all of these career and family commitments, John's unselfish giving of time and energy to volunteerism is all the more impressive and serves as a model to his community, neighbors and own children and grandchildren. His strong commitment to the Inland Empire has displayed in his participation in the United Way, Corona Library Foundation, Corona Regional Medical Center Foundation, Alternatives to Domestic Violence and, of course, the Corona-Norco YMCA. He has also served as president of the Rotary Club and the Navy League.  Mr. Speaker, I take this opportunity to thank John Cleghorn for his dedication, influence and involvement in our community. He has aided In developing and maintaining community volunteerism in the Corona-Norco area and the Inland Empire. I know that we will continue to benefit from his longtime experience in the 43rd congressional district and deep commitment to the region. It is a great pleasure for me to congratulate John on his outstanding career with the LAPD and his lifelong devotion to community volunteerism.                          ____________________
