President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Florida for yielding.  Let me first of all say, to clarify the understanding that I have in listening to his presentation, that his request would not necessarily be binding unless the President were to include this as something which he would interpret as an emergency; that is, the funding that is requested by the Senator. Is that correct?
