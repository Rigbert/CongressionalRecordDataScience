 That breach and the one before it were unacceptable, and it is a problem that requires an all-hands-on-deck approach to prevent future cyber attacks to protect those whose information has been accessed.  Madam Speaker, I am proud to represent 62,000 Federal employees in Maryland's Fifth District. They deserve to know--and all our hard-working Federal employees do--that the personal information they submit when they serve our country is safe and secure and that they will be protected against identity theft if their information was accessed.  The resignation of Director Archuleta does not solve the underlying problems that made OPM vulnerable to these kinds of attacks. I intend to work closely with interim Director Beth Cobert to make sure OPM has the resources it needs to upgrade its systems and prevent a reoccurrence of this event. But this breach and the one that preceded it underscore the larger issue of cybersecurity and how we must do more to make America's networks the safest in the world.                          ____________________
