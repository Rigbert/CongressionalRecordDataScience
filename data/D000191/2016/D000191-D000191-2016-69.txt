  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, Congress is leaving town for 53 days, the longest break that anyone can remember for Congress to leave town. But I guess, you know, there are no important issues confronting the country. Zika virus--no additional funding, spreading north into the U.S., don't have time for that. Background checks for firearms purchases, don't have time for that.  But they do have time for a couple of little things here, you know. Every day, Republicans are for states' rights--except, well, maybe, kind of, today.  The State of Vermont passed a law requiring labeling foods produced with GMOs. A number of the major companies are already doing it. Here are some M&Ms. But they are saying it is impossible, impractical, and the American people don't want to know, and even if they did want to know, we don't want them to know.  So, today, they are going to pass a bill to take care of their corporate friends that will preempt any State from having a meaningful labeling law to inform their citizens, something over 90 percent of Americans would like when it comes to GMOs. And they are going to come up with a meaningless proposal to say, oh, well, you can put a QR code on there, and everybody will pull out their iPhone, and you can give them a lot of information.  Instead, we could just do what Mars has already done here: ``partially produced with genetic engineering.'' But there are a lot of big corporations that don't want to do that.                          ____________________
