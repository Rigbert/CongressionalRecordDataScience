 President, Medicare contractor reform will not succeed if contractors are subject to unlimited civil liability in carrying out the payments, provider services, and beneficiary services functions expected of them. The conference agreement would therefore continue the past policy of limiting the liability of certifying and disbursing officers, and the Medicare administrative contractors for whom those officers serve, with respect to certain payments.  In addition, the language contained in section 911 of the conference agreement clarifies that Medicare administrative contractors are not liable for inadvertent billing errors but, as in the past, are liable for all damages resulting from reckless disregard or intent to defraud the United States. Importantly, the reckless disregard standard is the same as the standard the standard under the False Claims Act. This standard balances the practical need to shelter Medicare administrative contractors from frivolous civil litigation by disgruntled providers or beneficiaries with the Medicare program's interest in protecting itself from contractor fraud.  The False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 3729-3733, applies to Medicare fiscal intermediaries and carriers under current law. This legislation makes it clear that the False Claims Act continues, as in the past, to remain available as a remedy for fraud against Medicare by certifying officers, disbursing officers, and Medicare administrative contractors alike and that, among other things, the remedy subjects Medicare contractors to administrative, as well as trust fund, damages.                          ____________________
