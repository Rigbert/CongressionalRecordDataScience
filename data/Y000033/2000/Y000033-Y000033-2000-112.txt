Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, S. 1778 authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to negotiateland exchanges among willing sellers and willing buyers at Cascade Reservoir in Idaho. Several agricultural easements were reserved within 300 feet of the reservoir at the time the Bureau of Reclamation acquired lands for the reservoir. Now the easement holders and reclamation would like to exchange these easements for other Federal lands in the area. The exchanges would help the parties improve and maintain water quality in the reservoir. All parties have agreed to the exchange.  Mr. Speaker, I urge an ``aye'' vote on this bill.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
