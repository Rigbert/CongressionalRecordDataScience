Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to simply comment and thank the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Mrs. Johnson) for her comments. Unfortunately, as she knows and we all know, the problem with the rule is that any one of 435 people can, under the rule, object and strike any matter in the bill that is not authorized, or is so-called legislation on an appropriation bill, which in many instances is absolutely essential to carry out objectives that are generally agreed upon.  The problem with doing that, of course, is that acting reasonably is sometimes in the eye of the actor, and one of our 435 colleagues may well think they are acting very reasonably and responsibly by striking a matter that 434 of us do not. But under this rule, any one of us that sees something as a reasonable action to strike probably a majority of this bill can do so. That was and is the problem with this rule.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 4\1/2\ minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Delahunt).
