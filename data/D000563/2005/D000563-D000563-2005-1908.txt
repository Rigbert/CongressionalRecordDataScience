The story the Senator has told us of Mr. Lucas is nothing short of incredible: This 14-year-old boy performed feats of courage which are almost unparalleled. In fact, as the Senator noted, he is the youngest recipient of the Congressional Medal of Honor, which I am sure is a great source of pride.  The first job I ever had as a college intern in the Senate was for Senator Paul Douglas of Illinois, who enlisted in the Marine Corps at the age of 50 and went through training at Parris Island, fought in Okinawa and was injured, as Senator Bob Dole was injured, with a serious injury to his left arm.  I have always had a special spot in my heart for the men and women who serve in the Marine Corps, and I just want to join the Senator from North Carolina in making certain that this is bipartisan and nonpartisan in our salute to the Marine Corps, all the men and women in uniform, and particularly the great veterans of World War II and Iowa Germany.
