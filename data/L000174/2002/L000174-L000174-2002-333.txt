The pace of consideration and confirmation of judicial nominees in the last 9 months exceeds what we used to see in the preceding 6\1/2\ years. During that 6\1/2\ years under Republican control, vacancies grew from 63 to 105 and were rising to 111. I lay this out so people understand what is happening.  Since July, we have made bipartisan progress. This chart shows the trend lines. During the Republican majority, the vacancies were going up to 111; in the short time the Democrats have been in the majority, those vacancies have been cut down.
