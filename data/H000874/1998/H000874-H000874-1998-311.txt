Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to James N. Woodruff, who has recently retired after a distinguished career with the Office of Personnel Management and its predecessor, the Civil Service Commission.  It may seem unusual for the Congress to honor the service of a long-time Executive branch employee, but I can assure my colleagues that Jim served the Congress effectively for many years. The vast majority of Jim's tenure was devoted, either directly or in his supervisory capacity, to the drafting and analysis of measure addressing many of the most significant and complex Federal personnel issues. He contributed immeasurably to major initiatives such as the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Acts of 1970 and 1990, the Federal Employees' Retirement System Act of 1986, and the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978.  In addition, many members of personal and committee staffs have benefited from Jim's quick and able assistance over the years. Whether on the most arcane technical matters or the broadest constitutional concerns, Jim's expertise and counsel reflected sound judgment and were always readily available.  We would be remiss in allowing only the Executive branch to express regrets at Jim's departure. His career-long commitment to excellence is in the finest tradition of public service and we wish him well.                          ____________________
