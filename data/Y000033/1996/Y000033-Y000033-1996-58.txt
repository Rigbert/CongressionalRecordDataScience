Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2505 is legislation I introduced on behalf of the Alaska Federation of Natives, the statewide organization which serves the interests of the over 90,000 Natives in the State of Alaska. The bill addresses issues of importance to several ANCSA native corporations. I want to thank the Calista Native Corp., the Alaska Federation of Natives, the Department of the Interior and Committee staff for their efforts to resolve many of the difficult issues in this bill. The bill before the House has been amended to reflect this agreement.  The bill, as amended, contains several provisions, I will briefly explain few:  Considerable time has been spent resolving the Calista land exchange issue. Thanks to all parties involved for their commitment to move forward on this important provision. The Calista region in Alaska is one of the poorest and most socially troubled areas in the Nation. This land exchange was authorized to provide Calista with a means of economic self-sufficiency, consistent with the purpose of ANCSA. Under ANCSA, the Secretary of the Interior and Calista were to determine a mutually agreeable value for Calista's lands and interests which are to be exchanged, subject to a maximum per acre value. However, to date, the two parties have been unable to arrive at a mutually agreeable value. The committee feels that the Secretary's appraisals did not comply with previous legislative directives and, as a result, significantly underestimated the value of Calista's lands and interests. Section 5 of this bill would eliminate this impasse by establishing a value for Calista's lands, as Congress has had to do in numerous other instances since 1976. In doing so, Congress is simply providing the figure which Calista and the Secretary of the Interior were unable to determine. There are costs associated with this provision and we have no formal offset for those costs contained in H.R. 2505. However, we have worked with Chairman Kasich and the Budget Commission to also consider the Resources Committee bill to sell the Nation's helium reserves that will more than offset the costs of this bill.  Another provision would make revenues derived by the Native regional corporations from the sale of sand, rock, and gravel exempt from the revenue-sharing provisions of ANCSA. This provision would codify an agreement that was reached between the ANCSA regional corporations in June 1980--after many years of litigation.  Another provision would extend automatic land bank protections to land trades between Alaska Native organizations and Federal or State governments.  Mr. Speaker, all of those provisions have been discussed at length between the majority and minority. The bill was reported by the Resources Committee on a voice vote and I am happy to bring to the floor yet another consensus bill.  I believe this is an excellent ANCSA amendments package and urge my colleagues support.  Mr. Speaker, I include the following for the Record.    Addendum to the Calista Conveyance and Relinquishment Document,                            September 15, 1996       1. Purpose: The purpose of this Addendum is to provide for      the addition of certain surface and subsurface estate lands      owned by The Kuskokwim Corporation, NIMA Corporation and the      Calista Corporation to those lands to be available for      exchange with the United States pursuant to Section 8126 of      P.L. 102-172.       2. Kuskokwim Corporation Tracts: (a) The surface estate      lands (through conservation easements) comprised of      approximately 17,000 acres which are to be available for      exchange from The Kuskokwim Corporation, are those which have      been conveyed to The Kuskokwin Corporation and which are      generally depicted on a map dated September 15, 1996,      entitled, ``Kuskokwim Corporation Parcel, Calista Land      Exchange.''       (b) Upon conveyance of the land or interests in land,      including, but not limited to conservation easements, from      The Kuskokwim Corporation to the United States pursuant to      section 8126 of P.L. 102-172 and this Addendum, Calista shall      contemporaneously assign to The Kuskokwim Corporation that      portion of its property account allocable to the lands or      interest in lands being conveyed from The Kuskokwim      Corporation to the United States. Calista is committed to      reserve the portion of its property account allocable to The      Kuskokwim Corporation and shall maintain its account for that      purpose until the conveyance of the interest in land by The      Kuskokwim Corporation to the United States.       (c) The conservation easement conveyed through this      Addendum shall restrict the use of the land subject to the      easement so as to ensure that it and its resources shall be      conserved in perpetuity, that there shall be no development      of such land, that such lands shall be opened to public      recreational uses compatible with the conservation purposes      of this easement, reserving to The Kuskokwim Corporation and      its shareholders existing rights to the use of the land for      traditional, cultural, customary and subsistence purposes.       3. NIMA Corporation Tracts: The surface estate lands which      are to be available for exchange from the NIMA Corporation,      comprised of approximately 10,000 acres, are those which have      been conveyed to the NIMA Corporation and which are generally      depicted on a map dated September 15, 1996, entitled, ``NIMA      Corporation Parcel, Calista Land Exchange.''       4. Calista Corporation Tracts: The subsurface estates      underlying The Kuskokwim Corporation Parcel and the NIMA      Corporation Parcel are to be available for exchange from      Calista Corporation.       5. ANCSA: For purposes of Section 7(i) of the Alaska Native      Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1606(i)), ``Revenues'' are      only those realized in excess of $20 million from the sale or      generation of income from property received in exchange      for subsurface estate listed in the Calista Conveyance and      Relinquishment Document and the CCRD Addendum.       6.
