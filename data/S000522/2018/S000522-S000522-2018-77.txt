Mr. Speaker, we recently held a hearing on state-run doping to address the corruption and human rights violations that it produces in international sport. Athletic doping is really low--that anyone can cheat in a competition and then take any satisfaction or pride in winning is really beyond comprehension, to say nothing of the profound unfairness to the other competitors and fans and damage to the sport.   But state-run doping compounds these injustices with serious human rights violations--it naturally leads to pressuring athletes to dope, and threatening whistleblowers.   I thank Yuliya Stepanova and Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, represented yesterday by Jim Walden, for their remarkable courage in revealing the Russian government's state-run doping program, as well. It is not only the rest of the world, but Russia itself is indebted to them. In blowing the whistle on what their government was doing to cheat in international sporting events, they acted as true patriots--for any country, it is better to lose a medal than to lose the country's honor. And this state-run doping campaign is totally unworthy of the great spiritual heritage of Russia, and takes something away from every Russian person, as it makes it impossible for them to take an honest and natural pride in their country's performance in sporting events.   Since this hearing addressed globalized corruption in sport, I also mentioned a whistleblower who was not with us yesterday--Dr. Xue Yinxian, a Chinese doctor who worked with China's Olympic team in the 1980s and at one point served as the chief medical supervisor to the Chinese gymnastic team.   Dr. Xue claims that 10,000 athletes were involved in a Chinese state-run doping program during the '80s and '90s. They had to accept the drugs, she says, or ``face punishment or criticism.'' She adds, ``If you refused to dope, you had to leave the team.'' She has also discussed the abhorrent practice of doping young athletes--as young as eleven years old--resulting in devastating physical effects. Given the extent of the program, she concludes that all medals won by China at this time should be returned. Like too many whistleblowers, she has been forced to flee her home for fear of retaliation. She has commented, ``Anyone against doping damaged the country and anyone who endangered the country now sits in prison.''   Dr. Xue is now seeking asylum in Germany. It would be a terrible thing if her claim were to be denied and she is forced to return to China. We were also greatly honored to have had Dagmar Freitag, a German Member of the Bundestag and Chairwoman of the Bundestag's Sports Committee, with us yesterday, and I inquired into where Dr. Xue's asylum claim stands.                          ____________________
