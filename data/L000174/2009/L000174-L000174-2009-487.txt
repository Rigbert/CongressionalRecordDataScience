She is one of the newest additions to the Senate Judiciary Committee. She has already improved the quality of our committee by just being there.  Obviously, having former prosecutors on the committee is something I have searched for and am happy to have. I appreciate what she has brought to us. She was in an era when as a prosecutor she faced things I did not have to, such as the online threats to young people, and she understands what she is saying.  I see my good friend from Tennessee on the floor.  I yield the floor.
