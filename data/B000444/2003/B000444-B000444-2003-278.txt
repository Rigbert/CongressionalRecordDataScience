 President, as you know, yesterday the Senate unanimously confirmed the nominations of John R. Adams to be a judge for the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, S. James Otero to be a judge for the United States District Court for the Central District of California, and Robert A. Junell to be a judge for the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. I was in Delaware meeting with constituents and, accordingly, was unable to attend yesterday's votes. I wish to note for the Record, however, that I would have voted in favor of all three nominees yesterday, having voted to report favorably their nominations from the Judiciary Committee last week.                          ____________________
