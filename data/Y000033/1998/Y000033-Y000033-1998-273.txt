Mr. Speaker, I rise to once again address the issue of international land reserves, particularly World Heritage Sites. I find it necessary to emphasize, for the benefit of those who continue to claim otherwise, that these reserves are designated with little or no input from the public or local government. They are very unpopular.  The Department of Interior, in cooperation with the Federal Interagency Panel for World Heritage has identified a shopping list of 94 sites in 31 States and the District of Columbia that they would like to make World Heritage Sites. This list was compiled by the Department with the assistance of an ``inside'' non-governmental organization, the U.S. National Committee of the International Council on Monuments and Sites (US/ICOMOS). US/ICOMOS is also a principal advisor to the United Nations on the listing of cultural properties as World Heritage Sites. Twenty-two of the sites on the shopping list have been designated World Heritage Sites.  Congress is the ultimate decision-maker in managing public lands. The clear and direct approval of Congress and the input of local citizens and public officials must be required before land can be designated for inclusion in international land reserves. Let's maintain sovereign control over lands in the United States.  I wish to include in the Record the detailed descriptions of the cultural properties on the Department of Interior's list of future choices for World Heritage Sites. The complete list and other information on this important issue can be found on the Committee on Resources website at: http://www.house.gov/105cong/issues.htm.Indicative Inventory of Potential Future U.S. Nominations to the World                    Heritage List--Cultural properties        Prehistory and Living Communities (formerly Archaeology)                        Post-Contract Aboriginal       Taos Pueblo, New Mexico (36 deg. 25' N.; 105 deg. 40' W.).      A center of Indian culture since the 17th century, the pueblo      of Taos, still active today, symbolizes Indian resistance to      external rule. The mission of San Geronimo, one of the      earliest in New Mexico, was built near Taos Pueblo in the      early 17th century. Criteria: (v) An outstanding example of a      traditional human settlement which is representative of a      culture and which has become vulnerable under the impact of      irreversible change.             Post-Contract Aboriginal/Developed Agriculture       Pecos National Monument, New Mexico (35 deg. 35' N.; 105      deg. 45' W.). This site was occupied since before A.D. 900 up      until the 19th century. The archaeological excavations of the      area led to the development of a cultural sequence which in      turn enabled the comparative dating of southwestern U.S.      sites. This classification is the cornerstone of the      understanding of Southwestern archaeology. In addition to the      archaeology at Pecos, there are the foundations of a Spanish      mission, the ruins of an 18th-century church, and numerous      Pueblo Indian structural remains, including restored kivas.      Criteria: (iii) Bears a unique testimony to a civilization      which has disappeared.                         Developed Agriculture       Moundville Site, Alabama (33 deg. 0' N.; 87 deg. 40' W.).      This is probably the site described by De Soto in his      Mississippian expedition. This site demonstrates the      Mesoamerican influence on the culture of the Southeast. It is      a ``ceremonial'' site with over twenty extant mounds and      burial areas. Criteria: (iii) Bears a unique testimony to a      civilization which has disappeared.       Casa Grande National Monument, Arizona (33 deg. 0' N.; 111      deg. 30' W.). Casa Grande is a four-story tower of packed      earthen walls built over 600 years ago by the agricultural      Indians of the Gila River Valley. The site also contains      important Hohokam Indian remains dating from about 900 A.D.      Criteria: (iii) Bears a unique testimony to a civilization      which has disappeared.       Hohokam Pima National Monument, Arizona (32 deg. 55' N.;      111 deg. 30' W.). Hohokam Pima is part of the site of      Snaketown, which was continuously inhabited by the Hohokam/     Pima cultures for over 2,000 years. This site contains      essentially all phases of Hohokam cultural development from      the earliest villages established around 400 B.C. up to A.D.      1450. Subsequently this same site was occupied by the Pima      from the time of contact with the Spanish until around 1940.      The Hohokam Pima site clearly demonstrates the Mesoamerican      influence in the Southwestern U.S. The site is located on a      Pima reservation. Criteria: (iii) Bears a unique testimony to      a civilization which has disappeared.       Ocmulgee National Monument, Georgia (32 deg.50' N.; 83      deg.40' W.). The large mounds and surrounding villages at      Ocmulgee demonstrates the cultural evolution of the Indian      mound-builder civilization in the southern U.S. Criteria:      (iii) Bears an exception testimony to a civilization which      has disappeared.       Poverty Point, Louisiana (32 deg.40' N.; 91 deg.25' W.). An      archaeological site that flourished from 1,000-600 B.C. It      contains a geometric earthwork complex, consisting of 11.2      miles of raised terraces arranged in six concentric octagons,      and Poverty Point Mound, a bird-shaped ceremonial structure.      Criteria: (iii) Bears an exception testimony to a      civilization which has disappeared.       Chaco Culture National Historical Park, New Mexico (36      deg.10' N.; 108 deg.0' W.). This property bears testimony to      the first five periods of the Chacoan variant and one period      of the Mesa Verdean variant of the Pueblo civilization. Chaco      Canyon is a large canyon which contains approximately 1100      ruins including 13 major Pueblo Indian villages. These      villages consist of 3-5 story buildings which often contain      over 1,000 rooms. The ceremonial complex consisting of the      large villages is dated between A.D. 1,110 and 1,300 and      clearly demonstrates the cultural links between the      Mesoamerican cultures and the Pueblo Indians of the      Southwestern U.S. Criteria: (ii) Exerted great influence,      over a span of time and within a cultural area of the world,      on developments in town-planning; and (iii) bears a unique      testimony to a civilization which has disappeared.       Mound City Group National Monument, Ohio (39 deg.25' N.; 83      deg.1' W.). Twenty-three burial mounds of Hopewell Indians      (200 B.C.-A.D. 500) have yielded vast quantities of artifacts      that give insights into the ceremonial customs of the      Hopewell people. Criteria: (iii) Bears a unique testimony to      a civilization which has disappeared.                          Archaic/Paleo-Indian       Cape Krusenstern Archaeological District, Alaska (67 deg.0'      N.; 164 deg.0' W.). Cape Krusenstern consists of a series of      marine beach ridges (and nearby hills) which contain evidence      of nearly every major cultural period in Arctic prehistory      and history. This area is very near the probable route taken      by man's first crossing into North America and is still      inhabited today. Due to land subsidence along the coast a      unique stratigraphy has formed which allows a complete dating      sequence in an area where few dates are available. Each ridge      represents approximately a 200-year time span for a total of      approximately 8,000 years. Criteria: (iii) Bears a unique      testimony to a civilization which has disappeared.       Ventana Cave, Arizona (32 deg.25' N.; 112 deg.15' W.).      Ventana Cave offers a unique history of the hunter/gatherer      cultural development and continuity. This site has been      occupied continuously from 200 B.C. until the present.      Excavations here solidified the stratigraphic sequence dates,      and made a significant contribution to knowledge of the      development of Hohokam culture in this area. Criteria: (iii)      Bears a unique testimony to a civilization which has      disappeared.                              Paleo-Indian       Lindenmeir Site, Colorado (40 deg. 55'; 105 deg. 10' W.).      This site was one of the earliest Folsom sites to be      excavated by archaeologists and was instrumental in      establishing man's presence in North America at its current      early date. The site consists of a kill site marked by      numerous bison bones and a camp a short distance away. This      is one of the few early man sites where both site types were      found, and it gives a more complete picture of the early      hunters' life and cultural adaption. Criteria: (iii) Bears a      unique testimony to a civilization which has disappeared.                                Hawaiian       Pu'uhonua O Honaunau National Historical Park, Hawaii (19      deg. 25' N.; 155 deg. 55' W.) This area (formerly known as      City of Refuge National Historical Park) includes sacred      ground, where vanquished Hawaiian warriors, noncombatants,      and kapu breakers were granted refuge from secular authority.      Prehistoric housesites, royal fishponds, and spectacular      shore scenery are features of the park. Criteria: (v) An      outstanding example of a traditional human settlement which      is representative of a culture and which has become      vulnerable under the impact of irreversible change.              European Exploration and Colonial Settlement       La Fortaleza-San Juan National Historical Site, Puerto Rico      (18 deg. 28' N.; 66 deg. 10' W.). Spanish defenses at San      Juan guarded their sea lanes to the Caribbean; at this site      they founded one of their earliest colonies in the Americas.      La Fortaleza, the first fortification of San Juan (built      1533-40), has     been the residence of the island's governors since the 1620s.      The massive masonry citadel of El Morro was begun in 1591.      Criteria: (iv) An outstanding example of a type of structure      which illustrates a significant stage in history; and (vi)      directly and tangibly associated with events of outstanding      universal significance.       San Xavier Del Bac, Arizona (32 deg. 10' N.; 111 deg. 0'      W.). ONe of the finest Spanish colonial churches in the      United States, having a richly ornamented baroque interior.      (Comparative national and international study will be      necessary before the United States would consider nominating      property representative of this important international      development. For example, the California and Texas mission      systems would be examined.) Criteria: (iv) An outstanding      example of a type of structure which illustrates a      significant stage in history.       Savannah Historic District, Georgia. The first settlement      in the English colony of Georgia, which was founded with      philanthropic intent, Savannah has retained much of James      Oglethorpe's original city plan and possesses many structures      of architectural merit. Criteria: (ii) Has exerted great      influence, over a span of time, or within a cultural area of      the world, on developments in town-planning; and (vi)      directly and tangibly associated with events or with ideas of      outstanding universal significance.                   Architecture: Early United States       Monticello, Charlottesville, Virginia (38 deg. 0' N.; 78      deg. 30' W.). Thomas Jefferson, the third American President,      was a popularizer of the Classic Revival architectural style.      In Monticello, his mansion, he combined elements of Roman,      Palladian, and 18th-century French design with features      expressing his extraordinary personal inventiveness.      Criteria: (i) A unique artistic achievement, a masterpiece of      the creative genius; and (ii) has exerted great influence,      over a span of time and within a cultural area of the world,      on developments in architecture.       University of Virginia Historic District, Charlottesville,      Virginia (38 deg. 0' N.; 78 deg. 30' W.). Includes original      classrooms and professors' quarters housed in pavilions      aligned on both sides of an elongated terraced court, as well      as the doomed Rotunda, a scaled-down version of the Pantheon      which was the focal point of Thomas Jefferson's design.      Jefferson envisioned a community of scholars living and      studying in an architecturally unified complex of buildings.      Criteria: (i) A unique artistic achievement, a masterpiece of      the creative genius; and (ii) has exerted great influence,      over a span of time and within a cultural area of the world,      on developments in architecture.                       Architecture: Modern U.S.       Consideration will be given to the nomination of a      ``thematic'' Chicago School district, including some of the      properties listed in this grouping.       Auditorium Building, Chicago, Illinois (41 deg. 51' 87 deg.      40' W.). Constructed in 1889, this building is one of the      most important works by Chicago School architects Dankmar      Adler and Louis Sullivan. Criteria: (i) A unique artistic      achievement, a masterpiece of creative genius; and (ii) has      exerted great influence, over a span of time, and within a      cultural area of the world, on developments in architecture.       Carson, Pirie, Scott and Company Store, Chicago, Illinois      (41 deg. 52' N.; 87 deg. 40' W.). A commercial establishment      designed by Louis Sullivan in an original and practical form,      Carson, Pirie, Scott and Company was his last large      commercial commission. An iron and steel framwork supports      the structure, which is most notable for its elaborate      ironwork ornament on the first and second floor facades.      Sullivan's designs combine organic and geometric shapes in      intricate and delicate patterns, in a type of ornament that      is the hallmark of his work. The addition was by Daniel H.      Burnham in 1904-6, Criteria: (i) A unique artistic      achievement, a masterpiece of creative genius; and (ii) has      exerted great influence, over a span of time, and within a      cultural area of the world, on developments in architecture.       Leiter II Buiding, Chicago, Illinois (41 deg. 52' N.; 87      deg. 40' W.). Constructed in 1889-91, this building is the      masterwork of architect William Le Baron Jenny. One of the      earliest surviving examples of the Chicago School curtain      wall proto-skyscraper. Criteria: (ii) Has exerted great      influence, over a span of time, and within a cultural area of      the world, on developments in architecture.       Marquette Building, Chicago, Illinois (41 deg. 52' N.; 87      deg. 40' W.). Architects William Holabird and Martin Roche      make their first decisive statement on a new concept in      building--steel framing. Constructed 1893-4. Criteria: (ii)      Has exerted great influence, over a span of time, and within      a cultural area of the world, on developments in      architecture.       Reliance Building, Chicago, Illinois (41 deg. 52' N.; 87      deg. 40' W.). This building (1890-5) by Daniel Burnham and      John Root is a key monument of the ``Chicago School.'' It has      a steel framework and is covered with terra cotta sheating      except on the granite first floor. Windows form continous      bands and are ``Chicago windows'' large single, fixed panes      of glass which fill an entire bay except for narrow, movable,      double hung sash in the project bays. Criteria: (ii) Has      exerted great influence, over a span of time, and within a      cultural area of the world, on developments in architecture.       Rookery Building, Chicago, Illinois (41 deg. 52' N.; 87      deg. 40' W.). One of the last great masonry structures of the      19th century, designed by Daniel Burnham and John W. Root.      Constructed in 1886-88, The Rookery is a transitional      structure which presaged the modern steel frame office      building. It combines skeletal cast-iron columns and spandrel      beams supporting masonry with granite and brick and terra      cotta. Criteria: (ii) Has exerted great influence, over a      span of time, and within a cultural area of the world, on      developments in architecture.       South Dearborn Street-Printing House Row North Historic      District, Chicago, Illinois (41 deg. 52' N.; 87 deg. 40' W.).      This commercial district contains landmark structures in the      development of skyscraper construction and some of the finest      achievements of the ``Chicago School'' of architects: The      Manhattan Building by William Le Baron Jenny, the first      complete steel skeleton building, with wind bracing; the      Daniel Burnham-designed Fisher Building, an early curtain-     wall structure; the Old Colony Building by Holabird and      Roche, using Corydon Purdy's wind bracing system; and the      Monadnock Building, by Burnham and Root (north section) and      Holabird and Roche (south section), one of the largest      masonry bearing-wall structures ever built. Criteria: (ii)      Has exerted great influence, over a span of time, and within      a cultural area of the world, on developments in      architecture.       Prudential (Guaranty) Building, Buffalo, New York (42 deg.      50' N.; 78 deg. 50' W.). The last collaborative effort of      Dankmar Adler and Louis Sullivan, the 13-story Prudential,      constructed in 1895, is a trumpth of early skyscraper design.      It links two skyscraper periods and departs from the earlier      commercial use of elaborate ornamentation in favor of an      emphatically vertical appearance. Although appearing      rectangular in shape, it is actually U-shaped due to light      corridors above the first floor. Criteria: (ii) Has exerted      great influence, over a span of time, and within a cultural      area of the world, on developments in architecture.       Wainwright Building, St. Louis, Missouri (38 deg. 40' N.;      90 deg. 10' W.). Significant prototype of the modern office      building, constructed in 1890-91. This building represents      deliberate attempt to create an historical form expressive of      the new mass of the multistory office block. For Sullivan,      the potential aesthetic quality of the tall building lay in      its unusual height. To emphasize this height to the maximum      degree, he devised a system of closely ranked, pier-like      verticals that give the street elevations their forceful      thrust. Criteria: (1) Represents a unique artistic      achievement, a masterpiece of the creative genius; and (ii)      has exerted great influence, over a span of time, and within      a cultural area of the world, on developments in      architecture.

Criteria: (ii) Has exerted great influence, over a span of      time, and within a cultural area of the world, on      developments in architecture.       Unity Temple, Oak Park, Illinois (41 deg. 52' N.; 87 deg.      50' W.). Wright designed the Temple with a rooftop skylight,      rather than a steeple. Constructed in 1906 of poured      concrete, the Temple is basically a concrete cube with stark      and largely unornamented interior walls. Criteria: (ii) Has      exerted great influence, over a span of time, and within a      cultural area of the world, on developments in architecture.       Robie House, Chicago, Illinois (41 deg. 52' N.; 87 deg. 40'      W.). This brick house, with its low horizontal emphasis, was      designed by Wright in his ``Prairie'' style, utilizing an      open plan focused on a large central chimney mass. He      continued inside walls to the exterior to tie the surrounding      landscape to the house. Constructed 1907-9. Criteria: (ii)      Has exerted great influence, over a span of time, and within      a cultural area of the world, on developments in      architecture.       Taliesin, Wisconsin (43 deg. 10' N.; 90 deg. 10' W.). The      second great center of Wright's activity, this combination of      home, workshop, laboratory, and retreat consists of several      groupings of structures designed individually to suit their      different uses. It is the summer home and studio of the      Taliesin Fellowship. Criteria: (ii) Has exerted great      influence, over a span of time, and within a cultural area of      the world, on developments in architecture.

Criteria: (vi) Directly and      tangibly associated with events of outstanding universal      significance.       General Electric Research Laboratory, Schenectady, New York      (42 deg. 50' N.; 73 deg. 55' W.). A three-building complex      recognized as the first industrial research facility in the      United States. Since its construction in 1900, work at the      laboratory has made many contributions to scientific      knowledge, especially in the areas of physics and chemistry.      Criteria: (vi) Directly and tangibly associated with events      of outstanding universal significance.       Goddard Rocket Launching Site, Massachusetts (42 deg. 12'      N.; 71 deg. 50' W.). At this site, on March 16, 1926, Dr.      Robert H. Goddard launched the World's first liquid      propellant rocket, an event that set the course for future      developments in rocketry. Criteria: (vi) Directly and      tangibly associated with events of outstanding universal      significance.       Lowell Observatory, Arizona (35 deg. 12' N.; 111 deg. 40'      W.). Astronomical research conducted at this observatory,      founded by Dr. Percival Lowell, has greatly enhanced man's      knowledge of the Universe. Most significant of the      observatory's discoveries was the first observable evidence      of the expanding universe, made by Dr. V. M. Slipher in 1912.      The observatory is also noted for intensive studies of Mars,      the discovery of Pluto, and research in zodiacal light and      sunspot phenomena. The 24-inch Lowell refracting telescope,      installed in 1896, is in operation in its original housing.      Criteria: (vi) Directly and tangibly associated with events      of outstanding universal significance.       Pupin Physics Laboratories, Columbia University, New York      (40 deg. 45' N.; 73 deg. 58' W.).

In addition, the uranium atom was split here on      January 25, 1939, 10 days after the world's first splitting      in Copenhagen. The cyclotron control room contains the table      which held the instruments used on that night. The United      States would consider nominating this site only if the      Copenhagen location is no longer extant. Criteria: (vi)      Directly and tangibly associated with events of outstanding      universal significance.       Trinity site, New Mexico (33 deg. 45' N.; 106 deg. 25' W.).      The world's first nuclear device was exploded here in July      1945. Criteria: (vi) Directly and tangibly associated with an      event of outstanding universal significance.                Humanitarian Endeavor and Social Reform       New Harmony Historic District, Indiana (38 deg. 08' N.; 87      deg. 55' W.). Founded by the Rappite religious sect in 1815,      New Harmony was purchased in 1825 by British visionary and      socialist reformer Robert Owen, who sought to alleviate evils      spawned by the factory system. Some 35 structures from the      Rappite-Harmonist period survive. This property will be      compared to Owenite remains in the United Kingdom and to      other communal societies in the U.S. Criteria: (vi) Directly      and tangibly associated with events of outstanding universal      significance.       Chapel Hall, Gallaudet College, District of Columbia. This      large Gothic Revival structure (1867-70) is the earliest      major building at the college, the only institution of higher      learning specifically devoted to the education of the deaf.      Criteria: (vi) Directly and tangibly associated with events      or ideas of outstanding universal significance.       Warm Springs Historic District, Georgia (32 deg. 50' N.; 84      deg. 40' W.). The National Foundation for Infantile      Paralysis, which grew out of the Warm Springs Foundation      established by Franklin D. Roosevelt, became one of the      leading charitable institutions of the 20th century. Warm      Springs Hospital was the major international center for the      treatment of infantile paralysis (polio); the research that      led to the development of the preventive vaccines had its      roots here. Criteria: (vi) Directly and tangibly associated      with events of outstanding universal significance.                         International Affairs       Aleutian Islands Unit of the Alaska Maritime National      Wildlife Refuge (Fur Seal Rookeries), Alaska (57 deg. 30' N.;      170 deg. 30' W.). Originally frequented by the native peoples      of Alaska, these islands have lured Russian, British, French,      Spanish, and American fur hunters since the 18th century. The      seal herds have several times been threatened with extinction      due to indiscriminate hunting, but a notable 1911 convention      between the United States, the United Kingdom, Russia (USSR),      and Japan has provided them with international protection and      management. Today's flourishing herds illustrate the      international application of conservation principles.      Criteria: (vi) Directly and tangibly associated with events      of outstanding universal significance.       Statue of Liberty National Monument, New Jersey-New York      (40 deg. 37' N.; 74 deg. 03' W.). French historian Edouard      Laboulaye suggested the presentation of this statue to the      United States, commemorating the alliance of France and the      United States during the American Revolution. The cooper      colossus was designed by Frederic Auguste Bartholdi and      erected according to plans by Gustave Eiffel. The national      monument also includes Ellis Island, the depot through which      many millions of immigrants and emigrants passed. Criteria:      (iv) An outstanding example of type of structure which      illustrates a significant stage in history, and (vi) directly      and tangibly associated with events of outstanding universal      significance.                               ____________________
