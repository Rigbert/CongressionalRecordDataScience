Speaker, the men and women of America's greatest generation, the generation that saved freedom and defeated tyranny, pass quietly from this life each day. Too quietly, I believe. For this generation of Americans must never forget that we are the beneficiaries of their selfless acts and their sacrifice. They made America what it is today: free, strong, and vibrant.  Today, Mr. Speaker, I want to recognize and salute the many contributions of one member of that great generation, Jerald August Glaubitz, who passed away on April 26 at the age of 84.                              {time}  1700  Jerry Glaubitz was a constituent of mine. He was a friend of mine. In somerespects, he was a mentor of mine. I have known him for almost 40 years. More importantly, he was a trusted public servant, a patriot, and a good personal friend.  A native of Murdock, Nebraska, Jerry was just 18 years old when he joined the United States Navy in 1938. He was stationed on the U.S.S. San Francisco and was present at Pearl Harbor on that day of infamy in December 1941 when 2,300 sailors and civilians lost their lives.  Jerry Glaubitz survived the treacherous Japanese attack at Pearl Harbor and remained determined to honor the memory of those service men and women who were not as fortunate. Jerry served as the president of the Pearl Harbor Survivors Association, and he played a key role during the observation of the 50th anniversary of that attack.  After the war in which Jerry served, he returned home, more than determined than ever to live a life defined by the love of his wife and family, a life marked by his commitment to community and to his Nation. For 43 years, from 1961 to 2004, Jerry Glaubitz served as the mayor of Morningside, Maryland, a town of approximately 1,000 citizens, a small town, a vibrant town, a town where every neighbor knew one another and every neighbor was concerned about one another.  At his retirement, he was the longest-serving mayor in our State, and one of the longest serving mayors in the Nation. Morningside Councilman Jim Ealey said recently, ``Jerry took over the town when it was a one-horse town and nourished it and contributed everything he had to that town.''  Jerry also was a mainstay on the Morningside Volunteer Fire Department, joining the department in 1947 and serving as president, chief, and chaplain over the next 5 decades. He was a past president of the Maryland State Fire Association and the Prince George's County Volunteer Firemen's Association.  I had the great privilege as chairman of the caucus and as a member of the State Senate of Maryland of working closely with Jerry, both in his capacity as the mayor of Morningside, the president of the state fire association, and the county fire association. I can think of few people, Mr. Speaker, who cared more about their family, their community, and their country than did Jerry Glaubitz.  I want to extend my heartfelt sympathy to his beloved wife of 62 years, Jean; his daughter, Carol; his son, Larry, and all of his family and friends. And I hope, Mr. Speaker, that they find comfort in the fact that his was a life well-lived, a life that enriched countless others. A God that is merciful has taken Jerry to be home. He took him from a country that is grateful for his service and a community that is better for his life.                          ____________________
