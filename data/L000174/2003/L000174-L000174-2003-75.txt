As the Senator knows--he serves on the Agriculture Committee--I have been a strong supporter of CRP straight through. It is just that the original farm bill took it out of CCC.  What is happening now is the administration is playing one off against theother with these various conservation programs instead of going to CCC like they are supposed to. All my amendment says is not to take it out of CRP--I am a strong supporter of CRP--but allow the Farm Bill to stand and take it out of CCC as they were supposed to in the first place.
