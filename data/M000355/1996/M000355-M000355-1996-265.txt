 1658. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide improved access to quality long-term care services and to provide incentives for the purchases of long-term care insurance, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.                the family choice in long-term care act Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the graying of America means significant changes for our Nation's families. Traditionally, a family member, most likely a wife or daughter, has cared for an ailing spouse or parent at home. However, today's pressures of work, child-rearing, and family mobility greatly restrict the ability of adult children to administer to the day-to-day needs of a chronically ill parent. In addition, the rigors of home-based care can have a debilitating impact on the health and well-being of a caring spouse.  Few families are fully prepared for the physical, emotional, or financial demands of long-term care. For too many, this difficult journey begins with a unexpected jolt from a sudden accident, the death of a spouse or parent, or the diagnosis of a debilitating, long-term illness.  As America's population ages, the need for long-term care increases. In 1993, almost 33 million Americans were over the age of 65, and by 2011, the elderly population is estimated to number close to 40 million. While the opportunity for a happy and healthy retirement is better than ever, an October 1995 long-term care survey by Harvard/Harris revealed that 1 in 5 Americans over age 50 is at high risk of needing long-term care during the next 12 months.  Today, a variety of long-term care services are available, from help in cleaning one's home and getting groceries to skilled nursing care with 24-hour supervision. However, the means to pay for long-term care are still very limited and the expense can be overwhelming. For example, $59 billion was spent on nursing home care for the elderly in 1993, and 90 percent was covered by out-of-pocket payments and Medicaid.  The cost of paying out-of-pocket for 1 year in a nursing home is more than triple a senior's average annual income. Long-term care expenses put a lifetime of work and investment at risk. To gain Medicaid coverage, seniors must spend down their assets in order to meet State eligibility requirements. While Medicare takes care of hospital costs and home care, it provides only limited coverage for short-term stays in skilled nursing facilities.  The medical side of long-term care has seen enormous advances over the years in new technologies, facilities, treatment methods, and even psychological studies of the effects of long-term care on patients. But the financing side of long-term care has simply failed to keep up, and as a result it is ill-prepared for seniors' future needs. Today, private insurance pays for less than 2 percent of long-term care costs. As Federal mandates for Medicaid coverage have increased, States have attempted to contain costs by restricting services for the elderly. State-imposed caps on the number of Medicaid-sponsored nursing home beds has separated families from their loved ones because the only Medicaid beds available were hundreds of miles away from their community. Most disturbingly, the remaining assets of a deceased elderly couple can be tapped through an estate recovery action to compensate the State for the couple's Medicaid expenses.  Since 1990, Medicaid expenditures for long-term care have been increasing by almost 15 percent annually, causing costs to double every 5 years. Medicaid's service as the sole long-term care safety net for middle class seniors may seriously impair the program's ability to serve the underprivileged. While low-income families accounted for 73 percent of Medicaid's beneficiaries in 1993, nearly 60 percent of expenditures went to nursing home care and other long-term care services. For example, in 1993, Kentucky's Medicaid spending per enrollee for children was $964; while the cost for elderly beneficiaries was $6,540. Without relief, a harsh battle between generations may emerge.  Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Family Choice in Long-Term Care Act, a bill that would alleviate dependence on Medicaid by enabling families and seniors to plan ahead for their long-term care needs. Currently, our tax code does not define long-term care as a medical expense. My proposal would end this discrimination and allow long-term care expenses and policy premiums to be tax deductible.  Like health care insurance, payments under long-term care insurance would not be taxable when received. Children would be able to purchase policies on behalf of their parents. Inaddition, employer-based plans would be treated like accident or health policies. Individuals could convert a life insurance contract in favor of a long-term care policy without suffering a tax penalty. Under my bill, terminally or chronically ill patients could receive accelerated death benefits to pay for their long-term care needs. And my legislation would also permit qualified withdrawals from individual retirement accounts of 401(k) plans for the purchase of a long-term care policy.  Interest in long-term care insurance is growing. According to the American Health Care Association, the average growth rate in long-term care policy sales has averaged 27 percent annually since 1987. In 1993 alone, a total of 3.4 million insurance policies were sold. A study conducted by the research firm of Cohen, Kumar & Wallack found that it is not just higher-income seniors who are interested in long-term care insurance. The study showed that 30 percent of surveyed long-term care policy-holders earned less than $20,000 annually.  While tax clarifications will make long-term care plans more affordable to seniors and families, attention must be paid to assure investment quality and security. My proposal would establish the National Long-Term Care Insurance Advisory Council to advise Congress on the market's development and promote public education on the necessity of long-term care planning and the options available. The bill also outlines consumer protection standards for policies as recommended by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.  Finally, my proposal would require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to develop and distribute a summary of recommended health care practices to Medicare beneficiaries. As always, prevention is the first step in curtailing the demand for high-cost medical care.  While there has been a great deal of rhetoric about tax cuts lately, long-term care tax clarification benefits everyone. Seniors can invest in a quality long-term care plan without fear of losing everything they own, and families will have access to the support they feel is most appropriate for their loved ones.  In addition, Medicaid will continue to provide long-term care services for seniors in need. A 1994 study published in Health Affairs estimates that Medicaid would save $8,000 to $15,500 on each nursing home entrant who held a long-term care policy. Also, the probability of a senior's spending down to Medicaid eligibility would be reduced by 40 percent. Private long-term care insurance would preserve the medical safety net for seniors and benefit other Medicaid recipients, particularly low-income children and the disabled.  Mr. President, in sum, private long-term care insurance translates into quality, flexible care for seniors, more Medicaid funds for low-income families and the disabled, and essential support for families who want their loved ones to be safe and secure. These are priorities that all Members of Congress share. We should not miss this opportunity to help America's families prepare for the challenges of long-term care.                                 ______      By
