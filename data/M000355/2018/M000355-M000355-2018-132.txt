 President, I would like to close by paying tribute to another Member of this body whose retirement in the Senate is fast approaching. This particular Senator, in his own words, grew up on a dry, dusty ranch in Northern Arizona. You might be surprised at that description if you knew only the name of his hometown--``Snowflake.'' But this Navajo County town of a couple of thousand residents wasn't named for its meteorology; it was named for its founding families. It was set up back in 1878 by two wagon train pioneers: Mr. Snow and--that is right--Mr. Flake. It would still be 34 years until Arizona became the 48th State, and 134 years later, that Mormon pioneer's great-great-grandson would be elected to the U.S. Senate.  Jeff Flake is the son of cattle ranchers, so he learned all about ``earmarking'' from an early age. Back when Jeff was serving in the House, he explained in an op-ed that back on the ranch, earmarking was an unsavory way to brand your cattle. Apparently, the practice involves a pocketknife.  Well, Jeff moved on from that cattle pen. He wound up leading a statewide think tank.
