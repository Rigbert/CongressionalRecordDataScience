Chairman, I rise to claim the time in opposition, though I am not in opposition.  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 minutes.  There was no objection.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, this amendment extends an existing exemption established in 1995 by Congress, and I think it is a reasonable and very small adjustment to that. I think it will improve efficiency and lower costs. I have no objection.  I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Lipinski), a cosponsor of the amendment.
