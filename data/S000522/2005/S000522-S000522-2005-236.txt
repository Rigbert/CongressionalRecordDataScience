Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise.  The motion was agreed to.  Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. King of Iowa) having assumed the chair, Mr. LaHood, Acting Chairman of the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 2745) to reform the United Nations, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                          ____________________[Pages H4658-H4671]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]            HENRY J.
