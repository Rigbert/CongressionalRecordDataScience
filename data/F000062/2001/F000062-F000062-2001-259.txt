  Continuing:       Based upon the foregoing, it should be clear that if      Southern California Edison was involved in a bankruptcy      proceeding, the proposed legislation would have significant      impact upon Southern California Edison and its other      creditors.  Mr. President, this is the bankruptcy counsel.  So we know two things: One, from bankruptcy counsel, that this amendment--the Wyden amendment and the Smith amendment--do in fact create two classes of creditors. And they do, in fact, give premier standing to one class of creditors, the Federal subsidized entities. Those entities are given preference in a bankruptcy. Secondly, we know in fact that the amount involved is a good deal more than the amount represented in this Chamber.  We also know that virtually every other power producer and supplier--every single one--believes that if this amendment were to pass, they would have to exercise their rights, which would be to push Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric into an involuntary bankruptcy and most probably in chapter 7, which would mean a dissolution of the companies involved.  This would be tragic because the State has negotiated an agreement with two utilities to buy their transmission lines and to put $7 billion into the purchase of those transmission lines. The result would then be a securitization of that back debt and enable these utilities to pay their debtors and creditors without going into bankruptcy. So a plan to enable the payment of the debtors and creditors is now underway by the State.  Various Members of this body may not like how the State is handling the problem, but the State does have the right to try to redress the debts and in fact is doing so. These amendments can only wreak devastation on that attempt. I strongly oppose the Wyden and Smith amendment.
