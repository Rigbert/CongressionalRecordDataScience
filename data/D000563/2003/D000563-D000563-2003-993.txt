HATCH. I think my record shows I have not only been fair, I have bent over backwards. I will acknowledge that I have had problems on my side, just like your chairman when he was chairman, Senator Leahy, had problems on his side with some who have always wanted to manipulate the system a little bit differently. But I was fair, and I do resent anybody implying that I was not fair.  In the case of Enrique Moreno, he would have had hearings had there been consultation, which I am sure the distinguished Senator from Illinois would be the first to raise if he was not consulted with regard to judges coming from his State.
