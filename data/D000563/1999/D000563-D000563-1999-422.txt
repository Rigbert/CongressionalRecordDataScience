 I point to this chart. I hope this can be seen because the Republican tax cut plan of $1 trillion over the first 10 years leaves nothing for Medicare--not a penny for Medicare, as if the Medicare program itself is self-healing. It is not.  If you were going to deal with the Medicare problems--and they are substantial--you have only two or three options: raise payroll taxes and increase the amount paid by those under Medicare or cut benefits. We may face some combination of those, as painful as they will be. But they will be much worse if, in fact, we don't dedicate a portion of the surplus to the Medicare program.  The Senator is right. If you take a look at this, there is not a penny of the Republican tax cut plan for Medicare and other priorities.
