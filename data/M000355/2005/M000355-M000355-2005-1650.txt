 President, this morning we will immediately resume the bankruptcy legislation. As announced by the majority leader, there will be no rollcall votes during today's session. I understand additional amendments may be offered today. However, we do not expect a lengthy session.  As a reminder, under the order from last night we will have two votes beginning at 5:30 Monday evening. Those votes are in relation to the minimum wage amendments. Senators should be prepared to be here promptly at 5:30. I further announce it is our intention to file cloture on the bankruptcy legislation in a moment. Although we are filing cloture at this time, we are still working on the timing of that vote and the scheduling of Senator Schumer's amendment. We will have more to say on the schedule at the close of business today.  I will send a cloture motion to the desk on the underlying bill.                          ____________________
