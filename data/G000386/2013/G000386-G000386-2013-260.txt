 I take this duty seriously. I am not going away and will continue to vigorously oversee problems at HUD. I urge Secretary Donovan to make executive compensation and all funding data available to the public. It would shed light in an area that has rarely been seen with the light shining in. As some Supreme Court Justice said sometime, sunlight keeps mold from happening, or something to that effect.  Transparency is not the only solution, though. HUD also needs to put controls in place to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse. But transparency may be the quickest and most effective way to curb the worst abuses. The Obama administration could release that executive compensation data today if it wanted to, and it should release that data.  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. King). The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
