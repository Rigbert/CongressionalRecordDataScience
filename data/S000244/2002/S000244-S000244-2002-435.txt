Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay), the distinguished majority whip.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me.  Mr. Speaker, the Child Custody Protection Act is such a needed and necessary step because it closes a destructive loophole in parents' rights to protect their children from that lasting physical, psychological, and spiritual consequence that is caused from abortion.  As things stand today, the abortion industry actually uses ``No parental consent required'' as a marketing tool within neighboring States that empower parents to protect their children from abortions by requiring their prior approval. That is not just wrong, it is immoral.  The CCPA simply makes the act of transporting a minor across the State line for the purpose of performing an abortion a Federal offense. It places parents back in charge of their children, and it issues a warning to those who would actually insert themselves between parents and their daughters to encourage the single most horrendous and emotionally devastating mistake that young women are tragically permitted to make.  We know well that parents are in the best position as observers to counsel and advise their own daughters. The CCPA places those parents back in charge by closing a secret loophole. That loophole facilitates the anonymous destruction of innocent life, and it creates the lasting trauma that haunts every young girl who ends her baby's life.  I just beg the Members to vote yes on this bill.
