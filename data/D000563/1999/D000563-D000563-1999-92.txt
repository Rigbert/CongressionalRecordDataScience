I would be glad to yield to Senator Specter in one moment.  Let me just finish on the D.C. bill, if I might, very quickly, and then yield to Senator Specter. Then we can come back to our side of the aisle for further comment. Let me tell Senators, for perspective, we are talking about a $429 million Federal appropriations bill for the District. The District of Columbia has its own budget of $6.8 billion. That budget is twisted in knots by Members of the House and Senate who have their own political agenda they want to inject into the appropriation for the District of Columbia. They impose standards and restrictions on the District of Columbia they would never consider even suggesting in their home States. The evidence is obvious. Some of the more controversial issues in which we get involved in the D.C. appropriations bill turn out to be programs these Congressmen and Senators don't even talk about in their home States. I think that really tells the whole story about what has happened with the District of Columbia in its spending bill.  I have a number of comments I would like to make about the underlying bill, the Labor-HHS appropriations bill. But in the interest of continuing this debate and acknowledging the presence of the chairman of that Appropriations subcommittee, I yield the floor to Senator Hutchison, if she would like to yield to Senator Specter.
