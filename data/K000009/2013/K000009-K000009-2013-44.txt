Speaker, I rise to congratulate the three recipients of the Nobel Prize in medicine for 2013. All three work at American universities.  Dr. James E. Rothman chairs the cell biology department at Yale University. Dr. Randy W. Schekman works at the University of California at Berkeley. Their German counterpart, Dr. Thomas C. Sudhof, is on the faculty of Stanford.  The Nobel committee has recognized the importance of their lifesaving work. The question is: Why don't the House Republicans?  On the very day that three researchers at American universities won the Nobel Prize in medicine, the House Republicans continue their siege against the Government of the United States, and their siege includes the National Institutes of Health, where the American people through their Federal Government support medical research and path-breaking, basic research in the difficult search for cures.  Mr. Speaker, I should note that Dr. Rothman of Yale received two grants under the Obama Recovery Act for his work in developing a better way to study cells. Of course, he would have received none if the Republicans in Congress had had their way. More to the point, the Republican shutdown has jeopardized hundreds of research projects like Dr. Rothman's, Dr. Schekman's and Dr. Sudhof's. The Republicans have essentially shut down the National Institutes of Health, which has told researchers that they cannot process their grant applications, which eventually will bring federally supported research to a halt.  I count more than 30 research projects underway just in Ohio at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland and at least a dozen more at the Cleveland Clinic and at the University of Toledo Medical University--cutting-edge research, peer-reviewed research, research that could save lives.  Thanks to the Republican Congress, these are ``dark days for medical research.'' So says the Atlantic Magazine.       Between the sequester and the shutdown, repeated hits to      research funding may have serious consequences for scientific      advancement.  That's not something you see in the flash of but one day. But it erodes America's real strength over time.                              {time}  1030  Almost three out of four employees at the National Institutes of Health are sitting at home, thanks to the Republican Congress. They're not allowed to do their work of finding cures and stamping out disease. The Republican Congress locked them out. Two hundred patients at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center were turned away due to the Republican Congress' throwing its little temper tantrum over losing the Presidential election again. Many of those 200 people are cancer patients, and 30 of them are children, paying a heavy, heavy price for Republican intransigence. The Republicans told them, Go away.  Mr. Speaker, even if the Republicans lack any empathy whatsoever, at least you would think they would care about jobs in America. Research and development, including research and development in biotechnology, provides a competitive advantage for the United States. It's a very promising sector for economic development and job growth. Just come to Cleveland to see the new Health Innovation Center, or look at the neuropsychiatric research being conducted at Case and the University of Toledo Medical Center. Look at what it draws around it. Yet The Atlantic magazine says the sequester is killing 20,500 jobs this year in the life sciences field, and the government shutdown threatens to ground medical research into cancer, Alzheimer's, diabetes, and disabling neuropsychiatric disorders.  The Nobel committee gets it. The American people get it. A recent poll showed that 83 percent of the public believes investing in medical research is important for our economy.  So why don't the Republicans get it? As NIH Director Collins told The Atlantic last week:       We will not know what grant that was going to lead to the      next breakthrough in cancer research didn't quite make the      cut. We will not know what brilliant scientists, who were      going to win a Nobel Prize, basically gave up because of the      failure to get support from the current system and decided to      do something else or move to another country, which some of      them are doing already. We won't know. That is the sad tale      that is wrapped up in all of this.  The good news is that three scientists working on the frontier of scientific research--three scientists at American universities--did not give up, and they have captured the Nobel Prize in Medicine for 2013.  The bad news is that House Republicans apparently have given up. They apparently don't care whether the U.S. keeps distinguishing itself by winning such prestigious awards. They apparently don't care whether we support the research that will help humankind and eliminate diseases and save lives. They don't care if the United States remains the global leader in medical and scientific research and enjoys the millions of jobs that it will create in the future--what a shame--and how easy it would be to bring up a clean continuing resolution and put the government of the people of this country back to work.                          ____________________
