Mr. Speaker, hate is too heavy a burden to bear. We have the opportunity, with this bill, to move this Nation one step forward toward laying down the burden, the burden of hate. With this legislation, we can send the strongest possible message that violence against our fellow citizens because of race, color, national origin, religion, sexual orientation or transgender will not be tolerated.  It was the Great Teacher who said, ``As much as you have done it unto the least of these, you have done it unto me.''  During the 1950s and the 1960s, as a participant in the Civil Rights Movement, I tasted the bitter fruits of hate, and I didn't like it. I saw some of my friends beaten, shot and killed because of hate. Hate is too heavy a burden to bear. It also was the Great Teacher who said, ``Love you one another.'' He didn't say hate you one another.  We're one people. We're one family. We all live in the same house. It doesn't matter whether we're gay or straight. We're one people.
