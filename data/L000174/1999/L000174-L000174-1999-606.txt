President, if the Senator could respond on that, he said there are 100 Senators, and they don't all have to put them in.  In 1994 we had the crime bill. It was on the floor for 12 days--over 3 weeks. There were 99 amendments. Maybe there was one Senator who did not have one. I mention that only because of what the Senator from Mississippi said. But there were 99 amendments, a great bulk of them coming from the other side. And in no way did the then Democrat majority seek to cut them down. It took 12 days--over 3 weeks. The predecessor to this is S. 10. The Judiciary Committee, under the distinguished leadership of the Senator from Utah, met in the summertime for over 6 weeks to work on 55 amendments.
