Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson-Lee). I thank her so much for participating, and not only on the march, the journey of reconciliation, the dialogue, but for participating in this Special Order today. I thank the gentlewoman for her leadership.  Now, Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield time to the gentlewoman from the State of California (Ms. Lee).
