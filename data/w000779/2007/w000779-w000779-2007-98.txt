President, I will be very brief. The Senator from Arizona makes the point that he always does eloquently about markets, and I come back to the fact that President Bush has said you don't need subsidies when the marketplace price is over $55 a barrel. So what we want to do is cut back on the subsidies and begin to create the kind of market that I know the Senator from Arizona favors.  I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a Government Accountability Office report of May 1, 2007, which makes it very clear that taxpayers are being ripped off for the drilling by major companies on public lands.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                          United States Government                                        Accountability Office,                                      Washington, DC, May 1, 2007.     Subject: Oil and Gas Royalties: A Comparison of the Share of          Revenue Received from Oil and Gas Production by the          Federal Government and Other Resource Owners     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources,     U.S. Senate.     Hon. Nick J. Rahall II,     Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources,     House of Representatives.     Hon. Stevan Pearce,     Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources,          Committee on Natural Resources, House of Representatives.     Hon. Mary L. Landrieu,     U.S. Senate.       Amid rising oil and gas prices and reports of record oil      industry profits, a number of governments have taken steps to      reevaluate and, in some cases, increase the share of oil and      gas revenues they receive for the rights to develop oil and      gas on their lands and waters. For example, the State of      Alaska has recently passed new oil and gas legislation that      will increase the state's share of revenue received from oil      and gas companies operating state leases. In January 2007,      the Department of the Interior announced an increase in the      royalty rate for future leases granted in the deepwater      region of the Gulf of Mexico. Companies engaged in      exploration and development of oil and gas resources do so      under terms of concessions, leases, or contracts granted by      governments or other resource owners. The terms and      conditions of such arrangements are established by law or      negotiated on a case-by-case basis. One important aspect of      the arrangements is the applicable payments from the      companies to the resource owners--in the United States, these      include bonuses, rentals, royalties, corporate income taxes,      and special fees or taxes. The precise mix and total amount      of these payments, referred to as the ``fiscal system''      varies widely across different resource owners. The total      revenue, as a percentage of the value of the oil and natural      gas produced, received by government resource owners, such      as U.S. federal or state governments is commonly referred      to as the ``government take.'' For example, a government      take of 50 percent means that the government receives 50      percent of the cash flow produced from an oil or gas      field.       In fiscal year 2006, oil and gas companies received over      $77 billion from the sale of oil and gas produced from      federal lands and waters, and the Department of the      Interior's Minerals Management Service (MMS) reported that      these companies paid the federal government about $10 billion      in oil and gas royalties. Clearly, such large and financially      significant resources must be carefully developed and managed      so that our nation's rising energy needs are met while at the      same time the American people are ensured of receiving a fair      rate of return on publicly owned resources, especially in      light of the nation's daunting current and long-range fiscal      challenges.       As requested, this report documents the information      provided to your staffs in March 2007 on the U.S.      government's take and implications associated with increasing      royalty rates. Specifically, this report discusses (1) the      United States' government take relative to that of other      government resource owners and (2) the potential revenue      implications of raising royalty rates on federal oil and gas      leases going forward. To address the government take, our      work included reviewing results of studies done by oil      companies and industry consultants. We also collected and      analyzed various studies generated by MMS, the agency      responsible for collecting oil and gas royalties from federal      lands and waters. In addition, we reviewed results of studies      prepared over the last 13 years by various private and      government sources on government take and interviewed Alaskan      state and private consulting firm officials. In evaluating      the study results we conducted interviews with study authors      and an industry expert to discuss the study methodologies and      the appropriate interpretation of the results. Based on these      interviews and our review of study results, we believe the      general approach that these study authors took was reasonable      and that the study authors are credible. However, we did not      fully evaluate each study's methodology or the underlying      data used to make the government take estimates. Overall,      because all the studies came to similar conclusions with      regard to the relative government-take ranking of the U.S.      federal government and because such studies are used by oil      and gas industry companies and governments alike for the      purposes of evaluating the relative competitiveness of      specific fiscal systems, we are confident that the broad      conclusions of the studies are valid. To address the revenue      implications of raising royalty rates, we gathered      information from reports, studies, and government documents,      and drew from past GAO reports related to oil and gas      royalties. We also discussed the material in this report with      MMS officials and they made helpful suggestions about the      factors affecting the revenue implications of raising royalty      rates. Our work was done from January 2007 through March 2007      in accordance with generally accepted government auditing      standards.                               In Summary       Based on results of a number of studies, the U.S. federal      government receives one of the lowest government takes in the      world. Collectively, the results of five studies presented in      2006 by various private sector entities show that the United      States receives a lower government take from the production      of oil in the Gulf of Mexico than do states--such as      Colorado, Wyoming, Texas, Oklahoma, California, and      Louisiana--and many foreign governments. Other government-     take studies issued in 2006 and prior years similarly show      that the United States has consistently ranked low in      government take compared to other governments. For      example, a study completed in 2006 for MMS showed that the      U.S. federal government take in the Gulf of Mexico      deepwater and shallow water was lower than 29 and 26,      respectively, of the 31 fiscal systems analyzed. In      deciding where and when to invest oil and gas development      dollars, companies consider the government take as well as      other factors, including the size an availability of the      oil and gas resources in the ground; the costs of finding      and developing these resources, including labor costs and      the costs of compliance with environmental regulations;      and the stability of the fiscal system and the country in      general. All else held equal, more investment dollars will      flow to regions in which the government take is relatively      low, where there are large oil and gas deposits that can      be developed at relatively low cost, and where the fiscal      system and government are deemed to be relatively more      stable. Regarding the deepwater areas of the U.S. Gulf of      Mexico, the current size of the government take, the      relatively large estimated amounts of oil and gas in the      ground, and the proximity to the large U.S. market for oil      and gas make this region a favorable place to invest.      However, the high costs of operating in deepwater may      deter some investment.       Increasing royalty rates on future federal oil and gas      leases would likely increase the federal government take but      by less than the percentage increase in the royalty rate      because higher royalty rates would likely reduce some taxes      and other fees and may also discourage some development and      production. For example, the recently announced increase in      royalty rates from 12.5 percent to 16.67 percent on future      leases sold in the deepwater regions of the Gulf of Mexico      will, according to MMS, increase overall federal revenues but      will also cause reductions in some fees and in oil and gas      production. Specifically, MMS estimates that the new royalty      rate of 16.67 percent will increase revenue by $4.5 billion      over 20 years. MMS also estimates that, by 2017, this      increased revenue will be partially offset by revenue losses      of $820 million over 20 years as a result of reduced rental      fees as well as a decline in production of 5 percent. A lower      royalty rate can encourage oil companies to pursue oil      exploration and production and thereby provide an economic      stimulus to oil producing regions. For example, according to      a MMS study issued in 2006, as the industry expands output in      the Gulf of Mexico, employment levels in all Gulf Coast      states-including Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas-     tend to rise to meet industry needs. As part of an energy      strategy to meet the nation's energy needs and balance the      impacts of energy use on the environment and climate, a      healthy domestic oil and natural gas industry is essential,      and that means that the United States must continue to create      a market that is competitive in attracting investment in oil      and natural gas development. Such development, however,      should not mean that the American people forgo a competitive      and fair rate of return for the extraction and sale of these      natural resources, especially in light of the current and      long-range fiscal challenges facing our nation. The potential      trade-offs between higher revenue collections and higher oil      production highlight the broader challenge of striking a      balance between meeting the nation's increasing energy needs      and ensuring a fair rate of return for the American people      from oil production on federally leased lands and waters.                               background       The Department of the Interior, created by the Congress in      1849, oversees and manages the nation's publicly owned      natural resources, including parks, wildlife habitat,     and crude oil and natural gas resources on over 500 million      acres onshore and in the waters of the Outer Continental      Shelf. In this capacity, the Department of the Interior is      authorized to lease federal oil and gas resources and to      collect the royalties associated with their production. The      Department of the Interior's Bureau of Land Management is      responsible for leasing federal oil and natural gas resources      on land, whereas, offshore, MMS has the leasing authority. To      lease lands or waters for oil and gas exploration, companies      generally must first pay the federal government a sum of      money that is determined through a competitive auction. This      money is called a bonus bid. After the lease is awarded and      production begins, the companies must also pay royalties to      MMS based on a percentage of the cash value of the oil and      gas produced and sold. Royalty rates for onshore leases are      generally 12 and a half percent whereas offshore, they range      from 12 and a half percent for water depths of 400 meters or      deeper (referred to as deepwater) to 16 and two-thirds      percent for water depths less than 400 meters (referred to as      shallow). However, the Secretary of the Interior recently      announced plans to raise the royalty rate to 16 and two-     thirds percent for most future leases issued in waters 400      meters or deeper. MMS also has the option of taking a      percentage of the actual oil and natural gas produced,      referred to as ``taking royalties in kind,'' and selling this      energy itself or using it for other purposes, such as filling      the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve. In addition to      bonus bids and royalties, companies pay taxes on corporate      profits. The sum of all these and other payments comprises      the government take. Because different governments set      different levels of taxes, fees, and royalties, the relative      size of any one component of government take generally varies      across different fiscal systems. study results indicate that the federal government receives among the                   lowest government takes in the world       Results of five studies presented in reports or testimony      to the Alaskan state legislature in 2006 indicate that the      federal government receives one of the lowest government      takes among the jurisdictions evaluated. The hearing was held      to discuss a proposed new state tax on oil company profits.      This proposal eventually was adopted and, in 2006, the State      of Alaska enacted a new oil and gas production tax law which      imposed a 22.5 percent tax on oil company profits. Two of the      studies presented were from major oil companies, and three      were from private consulting firms. The five studies had      differing scopes and somewhat different estimates of      government take. For example, one study focused primarily on      comparing U.S. federal, state, and Canadian fiscal systems,      while other studies focused on international comparisons. The      results of the five studies are summarized below and in      more detail in enclosure I.       BP (formerly British Petroleum), one of the world's largest      oil companies. testified that the federal government's take      for leases in the Gulf of Mexico (45 percent) was lower than      9 out of 10 other fiscal systems presented, including      Colorado, Wyoming, Texas, Oklahoma, California, and Louisiana      (between 51 percent and 57 percent).       ConocoPhillips, Alaska's number-one oil producer in 2005,      testified that the federal government's take for leases in      the Gulf of Mexico (43 percent) was lower than all 8 other      fiscal systems presented, including the United Kingdom (52      percent) and Norway (76 percent).       CRA International (formerly Charles River Associates), a      global firm specializing in business consultancy and      economics, testified that the federal government's take in      the Gulf of Mexico--both deepwater (42 percent) and shallow      water (50 percent)--was lower than the 6 other fiscal systems      it evaluated, including Australia (61 percent).       Daniel Johnston and Company, an independent petroleum      advisory firm providing services to the oil and gas industry,      testified that the federal government's take in the Gulf of      Mexico for deepwater (between 37 and 41 percent) was 4th      lowest and for shallow water (between 48 and 51 percent) was      8th lowest among 50 fiscal systems it evaluated.       Van Meurs Corporation--a company which provides      international consulting services in several areas including      petroleum legislation, contracts, and negotiations--reported      that the federal government's take in the Gulf of Mexico (40      percent) was the lowest among 10 fiscal systems it evaluated,      including Alaska (53 percent) and Angola (64 percent).       It should be recognized that the studies presented in this      testimony were done before the recent increase in the royalty      rate for future deepwater leases in the Gulf of Mexico. This      action will, as new leases are added to the mix over time,      cause the average government take in the Gulf of Mexico to      rise somewhat. In addition, 4 of the 5 studies compared      government take based on 11 fiscal systems or fewer. A      comparison of a much larger number of fiscal systems provides      more comprehensive information. In this regard, we found that      other expanded government-take studies have been issued.      These are summarized below and more details are presented in      enclosure II.       A study issued in 2006 and done under contract with MMS by      the Coastal Marine Institute of the Louisiana State      University reported on 31 fiscal systems in 25 countries. The      study showed, out of the 31 fiscal systems, Gulf of Mexico      deepwater, at between 38 and 42 percent, was lower than 29      other systems and Gulf of Mexico shallow water, at between 48      percent and 51 percent, was lower than 26 systems. Three      other offshore fiscal systems were also shown. This included      Trinidad & Tobago offshore with a government take between 48      percent and 50 percent, Australia offshore with a government      take of between 53 percent and 56 percent, and Egypt offshore      with a government take of between 79 percent and 82 percent.      Of the 31 fiscal systems presented, Mexico had the lowest      government take at between 30 percent and 32 percent, and, at      the other end of the spectrum, Venezuela had the highest      government take at between 88 percent and 93 percent.       A second study, issued in 2002 by Wood MacKenzie, a private      consulting firm, analyzed 61 fiscal systems within 50      countries. The study showed that, out of 61 fiscal systems,      Gulf of Mexico deepwater ranked lower than 54 other systems      with a federal government take of about 42 percent, while      Alaska's government take was about 64 percent. Of the 61      fiscal systems analyzed, Cameroon had the lowest government      take at about 11 percent, and at the other end of the      spectrum, Iran had the highest government take at about 93      percent.       A third study, issued by Van Meurs Corporation in 1997,      analyzed 324 fiscal systems in 159 countries. The study      showed that, out of 324 fiscal systems, Gulf of Mexico water      greater than 800 meters ranked lower than 298 other systems      with a federal government take of about 41 percent and Gulf      of Mexico water between 200 and 400 meters ranked lower than      276 systems with a federal government take of about 47      percent. The study also indicated that governments tend to      compete regionally and that the regional average government      take for countries within North America was about 57 percent.       Finally, one of the first expanded, or comprehensive,      studies was completed by Van Meurs Corporation in 1994 for      the World Bank. That study showed that the government take      from federal onshore lands, Gulf of Mexico deepwater, and      Gulf of Mexico shallow, ranked lower than 194, 191, and 180      out of 226 fiscal systems in 144 countries, territories, and      joint development zones analyzed.       The last few years of high oil and gas prices and record      industry profits have been a factor in causing a number of      resource owners to reevaluate their fiscal systems. For      example, and as already discussed, the State of Alaska      enacted in 2006, a new oil and gas production tax law which,      among other things, imposed a 22.5 percent tax on oil company      profits. In addition, at least five states--including New      Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Washington, and Wisconsin--     and Alberta Province in Canada are considering new oil and      gas tax legislative proposals.       The level of government take can influence investment in      oil and gas development and production. Resource owners are      competing to some extent for finite private investment in oil      and gas development, and in considering the ideal      government take, the resource owners must consider that      there may be a trade-off between the magnitude of      government take and the level of investment. From the oil      and gas industry's perspective, government take represents      one of the costs of doing business. As with any industry,      if the costs in one geographic area increase, industry may      pursue locations elsewhere.       In addition to the overall government take, the mix of      taxes, fees, and royalty rates that comprise the government      take may also be important in determining the level of      investment. For example, in commenting on Alaska's then-     proposed revisions to its oil and gas tax law, a BP official      testified that a fiscal system should be equitable to      investors and the government alike and should be profit-     related, that is, with a tax levied on profits not revenues.      Similarly a ConocoPhillips official testified that a balanced      fiscal system is critical for future oil and gas investment      in Alaska and that Alaska must maintain its fiscal system      competitiveness on a global basis.       Further, the size of oil and gas reserves, the costs of      exploration and development, and the stability of the      government and regulatory environment play a role in      companies' investment decisions. In many regards, the United      States is a desirable place to invest in oil and gas      development and production. For example, of non-OPEC      countries, the United States held almost 10 percent of oil      reserves as of 2006. In addition, including the existence of      a nearby market for all that is produced, the United States      is generally considered a stable place to invest, especially      when compared to many countries, such as Venezuela and      Nigeria, that have large oil and gas reserves. For example,      in Venezuela, it was reported last year that the government      had taken a series of steps to increase the government take      as well as take greater control over oil operations in that      country, and in Nigeria, it was recently reported that there      have been repeated instances of oil company employees being      kidnapped or attacked. However, much of the estimated oil      reserves in the United States, such as those in the deepwater      areas of the Gulf of Mexico, and the smaller pockets of oil      remaining in mature oil fields will be more costly to develop      than oil in some other regions, and these higher costs are a      deterrent for investment. In addition, to the extent that      environmental regulations in the United States are stricter      than in some other oil producing countries, this could      increase compliance costs and necessitate to some extent a      lower government take in the     United States. Further, to the extent that labor costs are a      factor in determining the profitability of oil development      projects, the United States may have higher labor costs than      some other oil producing countries, and this would also      necessitate, to some extent, a lower government take.  increasing royalty rates on future federal oil and gas leases would               likely increase the federal government take       Increasing royalty rates on future federal oil and gas      leases would likely increase the federal government take but      by less than the percentage increase in the royalty rate      itself because higher royalty rates will likely reduce some      taxes and other fees and may also discourage some development      and production compared to what it would be under lower      government take conditions. For example, because the federal      government assesses taxes on corporate profits, an increase      in royalty rates would raise oil and gas company costs,      thereby reducing their profits and, consequently,      the corporate income taxes they pay. In addition, an      increase in royalty rates may reduce the amount, in fees      or bonuses, oil and gas companies are willing to pay for      the rights to develop individual leases. Because such fees      or bonuses are determined competitively, this may lead to      lower government revenue. Finally, higher royalty rates      may deter some development or production of oil and gas if      companies can find more profitable investment      opportunities elsewhere and for which other factors, such      as stability and the amount of oil and gas reserves are      comparable.       MMS' analysis that accompanied a recently announced      increase in the royalty rate for new federal deepwater      offshore Gulf of Mexico leases illustrates how the increase      in royalty rates can be offset somewhat by reduced fees and      production. MMS estimates that the increased royalty rate of      16.67 percent--from 12.5 percent--will increase revenue from      royalty payments by $4.5 billion over 20 years. However, MMS      also recognized that this royalty rate increase will likely      cause declines in bonus and rental revenues as well as reduce      oil and gas production compared to what it would have been      under the lower royalty rate. Specifically, MMS estimated a      decline of bonus and rental revenues amounting to $820      million over 20 years and a decline in production of 5      percent, or 110 million barrels of oil equivalent, over 20      years compared to what production would have been at the      lower rate. Nonetheless, MMS estimates that by 2017, the net      increase in total revenue will still be substantial.       In addition to revenue considerations, there are a number      of other considerations that could be considered when      establishing a royalty rate or the overall government take.      These include environmental issues and socioeconomic effects.      Royalties or other fees or taxes may reduce the amount of      investment in oil and gas development and production and,      therefore, to the extent that higher royalty rates reduce oil      and gas development and production in the United States,      could be used as a policy tool to reduce the domestic      environmental impacts of oil and gas development. Regarding      socioeconomic effects of oil and gas development and      production, a 2006 study done under contract for MMS noted      that as the oil and gas industry expands output in the Gulf      of Mexico, employment levels in all Gulf Coast states--     including Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas--tend to      rise to meet industry needs.
