President, Sister Janice Ryan recently announced that she will be giving up the presidency of Trinity College in Burlington next July after 17 years of service. I note this news with sadness, thanks and with hope.  I am sad because the kind of leadership Sister Janice embodies is found in so few people on this Earth. She has committed her life to improving the lot of others. She has been a tireless advocate for the disadvantaged. She has been an inspiring leader in the field of higher education in Vermont. She has been a stirring role model for the thousands of students at Trinity College, most of them young women, who have seen the power and force of a gifted educator and administrator.  Sister Janice has done all this with competence, a sense of humor and the grace that comes from a confidence grounded in logic, reason and faith.  When Sister Janice Ryan speaks, people listen. She does her homework. She is political in the best sense of the word. She understands the complexity of the decision making process, and knows how to work to change the system in ways that will further the interests of those in whose name she speaks.  Sister Janice is not retiring She is moving on to another chapter in her life, which I know will be as challenging and rewarding and fulfilling as the chapter that will soon close.  We need more people like Sister Janice Ryan everywhere. But we in Vermont are especially proud to have been graced by the presence of an exceptional native daughter of our Green Mountain State.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to include a recent article and editorial about my good friend Sister Janice Ryan that appeared in the Burlington Free Press. My wife Marcelle, and I wish her Godspeed.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:          [From the Burlington (VT) Free Press, May 16, 1995]                   Ryan To Retire From Trinity's Helm                            (By Molly Walsh)       After 17 years at the helm of Vermont's only women's      college, Trinity College President Janice Ryan has announced      she will leave the school in July 1996.       ``For Trinity and for me it just feels like the right      time,'' Ryan, a Roman Catholic nun, said Monday. ``We have      truly as a college been blessed.''       Friends, trustees and nuns in The Sisters of Mercy, the      order that founded Trinity and welcomed Ryan as a fresh-faced      farm girl in 1954, praised her vision, determination and      energy.       ``We would have liked to convince her to stay here for      another 17 years,'' said Christopher Weinheimer, Trinity      board of trustees chairman and treasurer of Fletcher Allen      Health Care. A national search for a successor is underway.       During Ryan's tenure, Trinity launched a successful      ``weekend college'' degree program, three new masters      programs and two major capital campaigns. It also established      a model scholarship program to help low-income single parents      receive an education.       It's the students, most of all, who make Ryan proud as she      looks back.       ``I've watched the young women over these 17 years and      honest to goodness, their abilities never cease to amaze      me,'' Ryan said.       Off campus, Ryan has served on dozens of boards and      community service projects, taking a special interest in      mentally retarded people of all ages and children with      special needs.       Ryan is the kind of person who would always find a way to      get un-stranded from the proverbial desert island, said      Trinity trustee Joan Sylvester, who has known Ryan for 20-odd      years.       No problem is too big for her.       ``She's like the little Duracell battery that goes on and      on,'' Sylvester said.       Ryan's resignation is not a surprise. Two years ago, she      declined to sign a fourth five-year contract. Trustees      persuaded her to stay at least through July 1996 to help      oversee a $5 million capital campaign.       To date, $4.4 million has been raised and a $1.9 million      reconstruction of Delehanty Hall, the college's primary      teaching facility, begins today.       One of six children in an Irish-Catholic family, Ryan's      early education in a one-room school house was followed by a      bachelor's from Trinity and a masters at Boston University in      1967.       Ryan's polished, dressed-for-success image is a contrast to      the nun who wore thick glasses with clunky, black frames and      the traditional long, black habit in the 1960s while she      taught at local parochial schools.       And far from the stereotype of a cloistered nun, Ryan is      known as an engaging dinner partner and a skilled fund-raiser      and networker.       Ryan sets a fine example of spirituality in action, said      Sister Lindora Cabral, Trinity trustee and president of the      Sisters of Mercy, Vermont Regional Community. ``To have      people realize that we're part of today's world * * * that's      a very important piece for us.''       Although she will always love Vermont, Ryan is interested      in policy-making work on an international level. ``She will      be missed,'' Cabral said. ``But whether she's in the area or      not, Trinity will always be a piece of her heart.''          [From the Burlington (VT) Free Press, May 18, 1995]                          Mission Still Undone       If Sister Janice Ryan doesn't eventually end up in a front-     line public service job serving Vermont's disadvantaged, her      resignation next year after 17 years as president of Trinity      College in Burlington won't just be a loss to the school. It      will be a missed opportunity for Vermont.       The time couldn't be better for an administrator of her      caliber and an advocate for the needy with her energy to take      a full turn in government service.       Examine the list of citizens likely to suffer the most from      federal budget-cutbacks and cost-shifts to states, and it      reads like a Who's Who of people Sister Janice has helped      before and during her time at Vermont's last remaining      women's-only college. Among them: the under-educated and      physically and mentally disadvantaged in particular; women in      general.       Public-service opportunities ahead become even more obvious      when you look at the enormous task Vermont state government      now faces: implementing welfare reform (whose largest group      is now poor, single women) while absorbing federal budget      cuts; making affordable the same special education law Sister      Janice helped pass in 1972, without undermining its equal-     access intent; and, most important, defending the basic tenet      of modern government now at risk of being forgotten--     retaining a basic level of decency for the disadvantaged, not      as a luxury but as a moral and social imperative.       In short, Sister Janice's quiet, behind-the-scenes work at      both state and national levels on behalf of all such causes      isn't just a legacy for Trinity, it's a job description for      Vermont state government.       As for other women aspiring to leadership--whether within      or outside religious life--there are other secrets to be      found in Sister Janice's example and long tenure.       One: It isn't the loudest voice that wins; more often it's      the most persuasive and persistent. Just ask any Vermont      legislator who remembers the years of struggle by her and      other women to gain equal access to public schools for      Vermont's retarded and other mentally disadvantaged children.      Or any Vermont bishop who's found her on his doorstep ready      to discuss in private her views on controversial church      matters.       It's also testimony to what can happen when the boss--in      this case the Sisters of Mercy--says, both by design and      action, that a religious woman's role is, in fact, ``out      there,'' where the under-educated and the underprivileged      live.       Nor is this more public life without the usual pitfalls.      Sister Janice's predecessor at Trinity, Sister Elizabeth      Candon, found the transition from religious life and academia      a rocky one during her own pioneering tenure as human      services secretary in the contentious `70s. Yet in that      example is another lesson for any political leader today:      that it takes more than good intentions to balance the      fiercely competing interests of taxpayers and the needy; it      also takes an unusually effective mix of political acuity and      toughness.       While on one hand, education has long been one of the few      traditional ways American culture has accepted female      leaders, it's taken women like Sister Janice to take such      leadership to a new, higher level through innovation and      determination.       If the next few years produce the kind of budget restraints      Congress is calling for--Vermont and small states like it are      going to need all the persistent innovators like her they can      get.                               ____________________
