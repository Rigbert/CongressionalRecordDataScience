Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication to the community and to the overall well-being of California's Inland Empire is unparalleled. The Inland Empire has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated business community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give time and talent to making their communities a better place to live and work. Mr. Robert Robie is one of these individuals.  On January 20, 2001, Robert Robie was honored as the outgoing 2000 Chairman of the Inland Empire Economic Partnership (IEEP). Through Mr. Robie's efforts over the past year at the IEEP the Inland Empire has seen: The creation of 1,360 jobs and retention of 390 jobs, which resulted in a $133,039,011 financial investment into the local communities; the implementation of ``CallPoint,'' a one-stop workforce recruiting program that helps employers find and train qualified workers; the implementation of a new Bio-Tech/High-Tech program, which supports the high technology industry; the development of a Tourism Brochure and a Regional Visitor's Guide; the issuance of 306 film permits that resulted in 993 film related projects in the Inland Empire; the addition of twenty-six IEEP members; and the development of an Inland Empire supplement to the May 2001 Forbes Magazine U.S. and Global Issues edition.  As IEEP's 2000 Chairman, Robert brought his 38 years in the banking industry to the table for the Inland Empire. He is currently the Executive Vice President and Chief Credit Officer for the Bank of Hemet in Riverside, Chairman of the Directors' Loan Committee, Director of the Banklink Corporation, Director of the Hemet Service Corporation and Director of Florida Avenue Investment, Inc. Robert Robie's contributions to the nation's positive perception of the Inland Empire as a viable business location has been sizeable.  Robert's activities in the community also include being on the board of the Greater Riverside Chambers of Commerce, the Children's Fund of San Bernardino County Children's Network, and the Riverside Community Hospital Foundation. Additionally, he was the 2000 Chairman of the Executive 2000 Council of the Riverside County Community Hospital Foundation.  His outstanding work to promote the businesses, schools and community organizationsof the Inland Empire make me proud to call him a community member and fellow American. I know that all of the Inland Empire, including myself, are grateful for his contribution to the betterment of our community and salute Robert as IEEP's outgoing 2000 Chairman. I look forward to continuing to work with him for the good of our community in the future.                          ____________________
