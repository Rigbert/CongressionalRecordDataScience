 President, as Chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, I have studied the recommendations of the Judicial Conference regarding the extension of a number of temporary article III judgeships. I am offering this bill along with Senators Durbin, Hatch, DeWine, Warner, and Hagel in response to the Judicial Conference's recommendations.  Much anecdotal evidence and rhetorical commentary have been given, in both the press and from this body, regarding the burdened and overworked state of the Federal judiciary. My experiences do not bear this out. I have been a member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts for a number of years. In past years, this committee was likely to take the Judicial Conference's recommendations as given. Recently, in my role as chairman, I have taken a more hands on approach to the appointment and extension of judgeships in the Federal system. As part of this approach, I have held hearings on this subject and I have made suggestions to the Judicial Conference on ways to improve their surveys. In part, as a result of my input, the Judicial Conference added a question to its Biennial Judicial Survey that asks not only if the circuit or district has need of additional judgeships, but also whether the circuit or district might have too many judgeships for its current caseload. Because caseloads in some districts will inevitably decline, this question addresses a problem not previously considered. The purpose of the question is to help the Judicial Conference decide, when faced with a district that has a declining caseload, whether to reallocate resources to another district or eliminate an unnecessary judgeship.  As I noted, I have studied various judiciary issues and have worked with the judiciary to address some of these issues. From my studies and from conversations I've had with those on the bench, it is obvious that there is no judicial crisis looming on the horizon. However, changing circumstances in some judicial districts do need to be addressed. That is why I am proposing this bill. It addresses the needs of some of these districts in a substantive, rational manner.  Biennially, the Judicial Conference makes judgeship recommendations to Congress regarding the needs of the Federal courts. The Conference sends the chief judge of each district a Biennial Judicial Survey that they are to submit with the caseloads and weighted caseloads of the district and report on the status of the district. This survey includes information on how the district makes use of its senior and magistrate judges and any recommendations that the chief judge may have regarding additional judgeships or extension of judgeships in their district. The Judicial Conference reviews this information and passes its recommendations on to Congress for review.  For the 1996 survey, the Judicial Conference recommended that 12 districts with current or expired temporary judgeships either make or add permanent positions or extend the temporary judgeships for an additional 5 years. The Judicial Conference only made recommendations for those districts which would have weighted caseloads in excess of the 430 maximum recommended caseload per article III judge, should the temporary position expire.  Weighted caseloads are the actual caseloads per district, weighted or altered to reflect the difference in time and attention needed for certain types of cases. For example, criminal cases, in general, are more time consuming and thus are more heavily weighted. However, prisoner petitions are generally easier to resolve because the petition usually addresses issues previously addressed and resolved by the court.  Based on this survey, the Judicial Conference recommended a permanent judgeship position be added to the northern district of Alabama to replace the temporary judgeship Congress allowed to expire last year. In addition, the Conference would like to make the temporary judgeships in the eastern district of California, northern district of New York, eastern district of Virginia, and the southern district of Illinois permanent. The survey indicated that the weighted caseload per article III judge exceeded the recommended 430 maximum caseload per judge. The Judicial Conference also recommended, based on this survey, that the temporary judgeships in the districts of Hawaii, Kansas, Nebraska, eastern Missouri, central Illinois, and southern Ohio be extended for another 5 years. The Biennial Judicial Survey indicated that these districts would be above the recommended 430 weighted cases per article III judge if the temporary judgeships were eliminated.  Based on my studies, most of the districts that currently have temporary judgeships are able to show the need for the extension of these judgeships. I used additional factors, not used in the Biennial Judicial Survey, to arrive at my recommendations for the districts. My investigation takes into consideration the cases handled by magistrate and senior judges. These studies show that when these cases are factored out, some districts fall below the recommended maximum caseload of 430 cases per article III judge, even after expiration of the temporary judgeships. In deference to the Judicial Conference, I have given those districts thebenefit of the doubt on their need for an extension and have recommended an extension of their temporary judgeships. My willingness to accommodate the Judicial Conference recommendations underlines my willingness to work with the judiciary to reach a reasonable compromise when possible.  The Judicial Conference's recommendation for permanent status in the districts of eastern California, northern New York, eastern Virginia, and southern Illinois differs from my recommendation. After my review, I do not believe the Conference's recommendation can be justified. Among the factors I considered for extending permanent status for these districts is whether the district showed a consistent increase in its per judge caseload over the past several years. When plotted, caseloads from most of these districts, show a roller coaster ride regarding the number of cases filed per article III judge. Over the period tracked, caseload increases were inconsistent and filings frequently decreased compared to previous years. Additionally, the Judicial Conference does not take into consideration, in the caseload statistics of each article III judge, how many cases are performed or could be performed by magistrate judges or senior judges. Cases, such as prisoner petitions and Social Security cases could, in most instances, be performed by magistrate judges. When prisoner petitions and Social Security cases are weighted and removed from the weighted caseload total per article III judge, the districts have a lower and much more representative calculation of the actual caseload per article III judge. And these figures don't even adjust for the consent cases the magistrate's handle.  The data I have indicates that prisoner petitions and Social Security cases are included in computing the judicial caseload figures used by the Judicial Conference to calculate each article III judge's caseload. For example, the eastern district of California commenced 1,747 cases dealing purely with prisoner petitions in the fiscal year ending September 30, 1996. In that district, magistrate judges resolved 1828 prisoner petition cases during that period. The difference in the number of cases resolved during that period would be those cases commenced in the prior year, but resolved in the current year.  Additionally, my study indicates that some of the district's surveyed are not utilizing magistrate judges as effectively or efficiently as other districts in the survey. This factor needs to be taken into account prior to granting any additional or permanent article III judgeships to these districts. It is, in part, such considerations that led me not to recommend an additional permanent judgeship in Alabama, contrary to the recommendation of the Judicial Conference. In addition, Congress chose not to extend the temporary judgeship in that district before it expired last year.  In calculating if districts are overburdened, weight must also be given to the effective use of senior judges in those districts. My studies took into consideration the district's use of senior judges. Several districts surveyed make effective use of their senior judges and this was taken into account when drafting this bill. Based on all of the factors I have outlined, I believe this bill will keep the judges in these districts from being overburdened and makes effective use of the taxpayer's money.  Therefore, I recommend that the temporary judgeships in the eastern district of California, the northern district of New York, the eastern district of Virginia, the southern and central districts of Illinois, the eastern district of Missouri, the northern district of Ohio, and the districts of Hawaii, Nebraska, and Kansas be extended for another 5-year period.  Mr. President, I ask for unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1113       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
