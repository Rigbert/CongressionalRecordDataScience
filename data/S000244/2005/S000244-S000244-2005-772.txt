Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 3650) to allow United States courts to conduct business during emergency conditions, and for other purposes.  The Clerk read as follows:                               H.R. 3650       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

(a) Circuit Courts.--Section 48 of title 28, United States      Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:       ``(e) Each court of appeals may hold special sessions at      any place within the United States outside the circuit as the      nature of the business may require and upon such notice as      the court orders, upon a finding by either the chief judge of      the court of appeals (or, if the chief judge is unavailable,      the most senior available active judge of the court of      appeals) or the judicial council of the circuit that, because      of emergency conditions, no location within the circuit is      reasonably available where such special sessions could be      held. The court may transact any business at a special      session outside the circuit which it might transact at a      regular session.       ``(f) If a court of appeals issues an order exercising its      authority under subsection (e), the court--       ``(1) through the Administrative Office of the United      States Courts, shall--       ``(A) send notice of such order, including the reasons for      the issuance of such order, to the Committee on the Judiciary      of the Senate and the Committee on the Judiciary of the House      of Representatives; and       ``(B) not later than 180 days after the expiration of such      court order submit a brief report to the Committee on the      Judiciary of the Senate and the Committee on the Judiciary of      the House of Representatives describing the impact of such      order, including--       ``(i) the reasons for the issuance of such order;       ``(ii) the duration of such order;       ``(iii) the impact of such order on litigants; and       ``(iv) the costs to the judiciary resulting from such      order; and       ``(2) shall provide reasonable notice to the United States      Marshals Service before the commencement of any special      session held pursuant to such order.''.       (b) District Courts.--Section 141 of title 28, United      States Code, is amended--       (1) by inserting ``(a)(1)'' before ``Special'';       (2) by inserting ``(2)'' before ``Any''; and       (3) by adding at the end the following:       ``(b)(1) Special sessions of the district court may be held      at such places within the United States outside the district      as the nature of the business may require and upon such      notice as the court orders, upon a finding by either the      chief judge of the district court (or, if the chief judge is      unavailable, the most senior available active judge of the      district court) or the judicial council of the circuit that,      because of emergency conditions, no location within the      district is reasonably available where such special sessions      could be held.       ``(2) Pursuant to this subsection, any business which may      be transacted at a regular session of a district court may be      transacted at a special session conducted outside the      district, except that a criminal trial may not be conducted      at a special session outside the State in which the crime has      been committed unless the defendant consents to such a      criminal trial.       ``(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in any      case in which special sessions are conducted pursuant to this      section, the district court may summon jurors--       ``(A) in civil proceedings, from any part of the district      in which the court ordinarily conducts business or the      district in which it is holding a special session; and       ``(B) in criminal trials, from any part of the district in      which the crime has been committed and, if the defendant so      consents, from any district in which the court is conducting      business pursuant to this section.       ``(4) If a district court issues an order exercising its      authority under paragraph (1), the court--       ``(A) through the Administrative Office of the United      States Courts, shall--       ``(i) send notice of such order, including the reasons for      the issuance of such order, to the Committee on the Judiciary      of the Senate and the Committee on the Judiciary of the House      of Representatives; and       ``(ii) not later than 180 days after the expiration of such      court order submit a brief report to the Committee on the      Judiciary of the Senate and the Committee on the Judiciary of      the House of Representatives describing the impact of such      order, including--       ``(I) the reasons for the issuance of such order;       ``(II) the duration of such order;       ``(III) the impact of such order on litigants; and       ``(IV) the costs to the judiciary resulting from such      order; and       ``(B) shall provide reasonable notice to the United States      Marshals Service before the commencement of any special      session held pursuant to such order.''.
