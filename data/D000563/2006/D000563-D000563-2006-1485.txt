President, I thank Senator Reid for bringing this sad news to the attention of the Senate family. There are many things that divide us, but there are things that unite us. We are united when Members of our Senate go through personal tragedy. Senator Reid knows better than anyone on our side of the aisle the personal sacrifices Senator Inouye has made over the last months and years as his wife has gone through this serious illness.  It is clear, from what he has given of his life, he took his vow very seriously to stand by her in sickness and in health. It is a tribute to this man, his devotion, and to their love which sustained them for 57 years.  I thank the Senator from Nevada for bringing this to our attention. We all join in expressing our sadness at her loss and will stand by Senator Inouye and his family to ask them to try to remember, at this time of loss, those good memories of times together. We hope those memories will sustain their family.  I thank the Senator from Nevada.
