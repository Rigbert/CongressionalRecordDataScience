Combatting intellectual property offenses can help us save jobs for Americans, increase tax revenues from legitimate businesses, and bolster our productivity, with all the gains that come from that. Some of the provisions in this bill authorize significant resources to the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to better take on the tasks of battling intellectual property crimes. I have confidence in law enforcement, and I also take seriously the obligation we have in the Congress to ensure that the public's money is well and responsibly spent.
