  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I stand in opposition to this Republican tax giveaway.  Mr. Chairman, the legislation before us will not provide meaningful tax relief for the middle class, but instead is merely a giveaway for corporate American and the Nation's wealthiest taxpayers. Most importantly, the Republicans have not come up with enough revenue to pay for the more than $600 billion shortfall over the next ten years. Our first responsibility is to get the deficit under control, not hand out politically popular goodies for multibillion dollar corporations and families that make more than $200,000 a year.  Our country now owes more than $4.6 trillion, and that figure is growing fast.
