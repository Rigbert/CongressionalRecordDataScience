Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in support of the Striped Bass Conservation Act amendments and I compliment the author of the bill, Jim Saxton, for his leadership in moving this important measure.  The Atlantic coast stock of striped bass are found in waters from North Carolina to Maine. They are highly migratory but move primarily along the coast within the 3-mile zone, which is subject to State fishery management.  While striped bass populations have fluctuated dramatically in the past, the population suffered a drastic decline in the 1970s. In fact, striped bass harvests dropped from 15 million pounds in 1973 to 3.5 million pounds in 1983.  In response to this serious problem, Congress approved an emergency striped bass study and the Atlantic Striped Bass conservation Act of 1984. This law requires all affected coastal States to implement management measures to conserve and protect the remaining stocks of Atlantic striped bass.  While the resurgence of striped bass is a major fishery management success, H.R. 1139 will ensure that this remarkable recovery is not compromised in the days ahead.  As reported from my committee, this legislation will reauthorize both the Striped Bass Conservation Act and section 7 of the Anadromous Fish Conservation Act, which funds ongoing striped bass population studies. In addition, the bill focuses attention on stripers in the Delaware River and encourages greater public participation in the writing of management plans.  Mr. Speaker, I urge an ``aye'' vote on H.R. 1139 and again compliment Jim Saxton and Gerry Studds for their outstanding leadership in this major conservation effort. I would hope more of our fishery management efforts prove to be this successful in the future.
