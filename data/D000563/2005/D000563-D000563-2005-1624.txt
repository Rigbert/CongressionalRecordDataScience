It is not simply a matter of getting on an airplane. For our men and women overseas it can be much worse.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have this article printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             The ``REAL ID'' Act--A Real Nightmare for DoD                    (By LTC Margaret D. Stock, USAR)       If you watched or heard the congressional debate over H.R.      418, the ``REAL ID Act of 2005,'' you might have thought this      proposed law--which passed the House of Representatives      Friday, February 11, 2005, by a vote of 261-161--was all      about stopping terrorists from getting on airplanes. But you      would be wrong. This bill--which sets new rules for state      motor vehicle departments (DMVs)--promises to be more of a      nightmare for DoD than a deterrent to any terrorists.       Consider this language, which is found in the section      creating federal standards for state driver's licenses and      identification cards:       ``Beginning 3 years after the date of the enactment of this      Act, a Federal agency may not accept, for any official      purpose, a driver's license or identification card issued by      a State to any person unless the State is meeting the      requirements of this section.''       No state currently meets the requirements of the proposed      law, and it's unlikely that many will be able to comply      within three years. the ``REAL ID'' Act would require, among      other things, that each state create an expensive new      computer system for issuing state driver's licenses and      identification cards; obtain security clearances for its DMV      employees; verify with the issuing agency the validity of      each document offered by an applicant in support of a      driver's license application; put digital photos on all      licenses; print the principal residence of the applicant on      the face of the license; ensure that all prior licenses have      been terminated before issuing a new one; verify the      immigration status of all applicants; and color-code licenses      to show that the state has complied with the law. While all      these goals may be laudable, achieving them any time soon is      almost impossible, particularly within three year. And yet      any license issued in violation of this law cannot be used      ``for any official'' federal purpose unless a special waiver      is granted by the secretary of homeland security.       Here are some ``official'' federal purposes for which state      driver's licenses and identification cards are commonly used      by military members, their families, and their friends:       Enlisting in the military; obtaining an initial military      identification card; Obtaining a U.S. passport; voting in a      federal election; registering a vehicle on a military      installation; entering a military installation; driving on a      military installation; entering a federal building; writing a      check to a federal agency; obtaining federal firearms      licenses; boarding an airplane; boarding an Amtrak train; or      obtaining federal hunting or fishing licenses.       If this law passes, military members and their families      won't be able to do any of these things with their state      driver's licenses and ID cards--unless they are lucky enough      to be residents of a state that manages to meet the three-     year deadline for compliance.       Military personnel will be harmed by this law in other ways      as well: Deployments often prevent soldiers from renewing      their licenses in a timely manner, and many states give them      ``automatic extensions.'' These extensions would be barred.      Many states currently issue licenses to military members that      are ``valid without photo.'' This practice will not be barred      by federal law. The REAL ID Act on its face also bars      military police and other federal law enforcement officials      from using state driver's licenses and ID cards to identify      criminal suspects.       At a time when federal and state budgets are under      tremendous pressure, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO)      estimates the cost of complying with ``REAL ID'' to be in      excess of $120 million--$20 million more than the cost of      complying with the legislation enacted last year in Public      Law 108-458, the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention      Act of 2004. This CBO estimate, however, is probably a vast      underestimate of the true cost of the proposed law. Worse,      Congress has not agreed to pay for the required upgrades to      state DMV systems, making ``REAL ID'' yet another ``massive      unfunded mandate,'' according to both the National      Governor's Association and the American Association of      Motor Vehicle Administrators. If the federal government      isn't going to pay to implement this law, most states      won't be able to pay for it without raising taxes--and all      of their residents will be punished accordingly.       Indirectly, however, DoD will suffer--because this law      threatens to disrupt thousands of routine yet official acts      that occur daily on every military post in the world. Those      who already have military ID cards or who carry a passport      around at all times can avoid some of the problems with this      law--but a US passport or military ID doesn't give a person      the right to drive on a military base. Also, anyone without a      passport or other Federal ID prior to the effective date of      the law will have difficulty obtaining one unless she can      produce some other valid government-issued picture      identification, such as a foreign passport. Strangely, this      law will make it easier for foreigners or naturalized      citizens to travel than native-born Americans: The law allows      the use of a foreign passport, but bars the use of American     state-issued licenses and identification cards.       REAL ID's sponsors claim the law will stop terrorists from      getting on airplanes. The flaw in this logic is that the 9/11      terrorists did not need state driver's licenses to board the      airplanes they hijacked--they could have used their foreign      passports, and at least one of them did. Is meeting a false      ``security gap'' a reason to spend millions forcing the      states to conform to the ``REAL ID'' requirements?       REAL ID's sponsors are seeking support in the Senate. Their      bill, however, goes far beyond the common-sense driver's      license provisions enacted last year in Public Law 108- 458,      the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004.      The ``REAL ID'' Act almost completely preempts state      regulation of driver's licenses and effectively creates a      national ID card by federal fiat. The proposed law threatens      vital functions of the Department of Defense, and promises      unforeseen headaches for military personnel and their family      members. The reforms enacted late last year by Congress were      sensible and worthy, but the ``REAL ID'' Act is a recipe for      chaos.
