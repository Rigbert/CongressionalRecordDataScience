Chairman, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, an energy-hungry world will continue to push up global energy prices and availability. America must not get caught in this ensuing juggernaut. Our liberty and economic security truly are at stake. The world is changing and so America must adapt, and adapt sooner rather than later.  Over a quarter century ago, President Jimmy Carter was not wrong when he equated the struggle for energy independence as the moral equivalent of war. America, since, has been engaged in plenty of fighting abroad in oil-rich, unstable regions of our world. Instead, we must refocus and draw forth the powers of our own land, performing something worthy to be remembered, as Daniel Webster reminds us every day. Energy security is such a calling.  Certainly, this bill leaves unmet opportunities on the table--too much, in my view--but its direction is clear. It aims at liberty. It looks forward to meeting that objective by moving this bill forward.  I want to thank Chairman Simpson, Rob Blair, Taunja Berquam, and our entire staff for their willingness to work together, for preparing a bill that is inclusive and pragmatic. I appreciate Chairman Simpson's gentlemanly reach out to our side of the aisle.  I also want to thank all the staff who helped. Their countless long hours, late nights during holidays and so forth, and their thoughtful insights have been critical to helping us prepare this legislation that is aimed at restoring liberty, creating jobs in America, reassuming economic power here at home, strengthening our energy portfolio and water security for future generations, and, fundamentally, our national security.  I ask our colleagues as we move through the amendment process to help us move this bill forward in America's interest.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
