President, I thank my two colleagues for their kind comments and for agreeing to accept this amendment. I think it is very important to the future of vocational education, which, as the Senator from Massachusetts points out, is so important to so many students and so many adults in this country, and particularly in our section of the country, in New England.  With that, I yield the remainder of my time and I urge the adoption of the amendment.
