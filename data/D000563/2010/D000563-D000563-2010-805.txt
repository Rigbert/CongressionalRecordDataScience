President, I am pleased today to join the Illinois chapter of the American Association of Intellectual & Developmental Disabilities, AAIDD, in recognizing the recipients of the Illinois Direct Support Professional Award 2010. These individuals are being honored for their outstanding efforts to enrich the lives of people with developmental disabilities in Illinois.  These recipients have displayed a strong sense of humanity and professionalism in their work with persons with disabilities. Their efforts have inspired the lives of those for whom they care, and they are an inspiration to me as well. They have set a fine example of community service for all Americans to follow.  These honorees spend more than 50 percent of their time at work in direct, personal involvement with their clients. They are not primarily managers or supervisors. They are direct service workers at the forefront of America's effort to care for people with special needs. They do their work every day with little public recognition, providing valued care and assistance that is unknown except to those with whom they work.  It is my honor and privilege to recognize the Illinois recipients of AAIDD's Illinois Direct Support Professional Award 2010: Gloria Corral, Stacy Howard, Renee Kaye, Mufutau Afolabi, Mary Halloran, Renae Donohoo, Pauline Curran, Denise Smith, Zeola Alston, and Jesse Kelinschmidt.  I know my fellow Senators will join me in congratulating the winners of the Illinois Direct Support Professional Award 2010. I applaud their dedication and thank them for their service.                          ____________________
