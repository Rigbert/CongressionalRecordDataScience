But I want to thank my colleague from Georgia for his comments. We are in different political parties, but I listened to him and I know he is sincere. I think it is that spirit that can lead us to a solution. I hope we can find it. I will address the specifics of it later in my remarks.                             Trying Warsame  But first I wish to address the comments made by the Republican Senate Minority Leader McConnell. It relates to a front-page story across the United States this morning, where we have apprehended the man Ahmed Abduikadir Warsame, a Somali individual who is now being charged with terrorist crimes and going to be tried in the State of New York.  This man apparently was apprehended and held for several months on a naval vessel of the United States where he was interrogated about his involvement in terrorism and then they brought in prosecutors, criminal prosecutors from the United States, who interrogated him about what they thought would be actionable crimes that could be prosecuted in the United States.  He is now being brought to New York for a trial.
