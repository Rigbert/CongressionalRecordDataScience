 That is right, Madam Speaker, Fish and Wildlife wants to mitigate for ongoing safety programs required by the FAA.  All of the mitigation required by Fish and Wildlife on this project were for existing projects, not for new ones. However, Fish and Wildlife Director Jamie Clark stated in that same hearing that requiring retroactive mitigation is not allowed.  Today I will introduce legislation that would prohibit mitigation and extraction for impacts that have occurred in the past. This is just common-sense legislation.                          ____________________
