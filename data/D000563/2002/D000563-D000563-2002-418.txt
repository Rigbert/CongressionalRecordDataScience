 Is it not true in this bill with the Bond exception that we do say to jurisdictions across America that we want them to tell people if they have overvoted and spoiled their ballot, if they have cast other than a paper ballot, a punchcard ballot, or a mail-in central counting system, like Washington or Oregon? So for other methods of voting, the optical scan, the standard lever machines, the direct recording electronic, this bill says: We want to save you from making a mistake. Wewant you to have your vote count. Isn't that true? We have said for those systems that we really want to have this protection, but not the punchcard system.
