President, although I am delighted that the Senate will today be confirming James S. Gwin as a Federal district court judge, the Republican Leader has once again passed over and refused to take up the nomination of Margaret Morrow. Ms. Morrow's nomination is the longest pending judicial nomination on the Senate Calendar, having languished on the Senate Calendar since June 12. The central district of California desperately needs this vacancy filled, which has been open for more than 18 months, and Margaret Morrow is eminently qualified to fill it.  Just last week, the opponents of this nomination announced in a press conference that they welcomed a debate and rollcall vote on Margaret Morrow. But again the Republican majority leader has refused to bring up this well-qualified nominee for such debate and vote. It appears that Republicans have time for press conferences to attack one of the President's judicial nominations, but the majority leader will not allow the U.S. Senate to turn to that nomination for a vote. We can discuss the nomination in sequential press conferences and weekend talk show appearances but not in the one place that action must be taken on it, on the floor of the U.S. Senate. The Senate has suffered through hours of quorum calls in the past few weeks which time would have been better spent debating and voting on this judicial nomination.  The extremist attacks on Margaret Morrow are puzzling--not only to thoseof us in the Senate who know her record but to those who know her best in California, including many Republicans.  They cannot fathom why a few Senators have decided to target someone as well-qualified and as moderate as she is.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a recent article from the Los Angles Times by Henry Weinstein on the nomination of Margaret Morrow, entitled ``Bipartisan Support Not Enough For Judicial Nominee,'' be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my statement.
