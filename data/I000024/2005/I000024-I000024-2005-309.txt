President, by design, politicians are largely a reactive bunch--our constituents voted us in to our offices to represent their interests, and when they are unhappy we too are unhappy. One issue that certainly makes all constituents unhappy or even angry is high fuel prices. Therefore, policymakers at all levels of government have been struggling with ways to address high prices--some have advocated for repealing fuel taxes, the Administration reacted in many critically important and helpful ways such as releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. After Hurricane Katrina disabled a large portion of our refining capacity and Rita threatened an additional 27.5 percent, several members have talked about the need to build new refineries.  In May 2004--Before the hurricanes, and before EPACT 2005 (The Energy Policy Act of 2005), the Environment & Public Works Committee, which I chair, considered the challenges facing the refining industry. At that hearing, we learned how the industry has been struggling to balance the public's increasing demand for cheap transportation fuels while also meeting legal and regulatory requirements to produce cleaner fuels.  Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan stated in a May 2005 speech that, ``the status of world refining capacity has become worrisome. Of special concern is the need to add adequate coking and desulphurization capacity to convert the average gravity and sulphur content of much of the world's crude oil to the lighter and sweeter needs of product markets, which are increasingly dominated by transportation fuels that must meet ever-more stringent environmental requirements.''  Make no mistake, significant investments have been made to achieving environmental objectives--however, investments into increasing capacity have been inadequate to meet demand, and no new domestic refinery has been built since 1976.  A critical hurdle to constructing anything these days, especially refineries, is overcoming the ``Not-In-My-Backyard'' or NIMBY interests. The President recognized the need to build new refineries while overcoming local opposition when he recommended that policymakers consider constructing on BRAC sites.  Building upon what we learned in our hearing while balancing potential local opposition to refineries and answering the President and the public's call, I rise today to introduce the Gas Petroleum Refiner Improvement and Community Empowerment Act or Gas PRICE Act. This Gas PRICE Act seeks to address fuels challenges in the short, mid and long-term range in several key ways.  First, the bill encourages communities who are about to lose jobs as a result of BRAC to consider building refineries on those properties. The legislation directs the Economic Development Administration to provide additional resources to communities considering new refineries on those sites. Refineries are not just a good source of high paying jobs, but they are an area of national interest so those communities acting in that interest should be benefited.  Second, States have a significant if not dominant role in permitting existing or new refineries. Yet, States face particular technical and financial constraints when faced with these extremely complex facilities. Therefore, the Gas PRICE Act establishes a Governor opt-in program that requires the Administrator to coordinate and concurrently review all permits with the relevant State agencies to permit refineries. This program does not waive or modify any environmental law, but seeks to assist States and consumers by providing greater certainty in the permitting process.  Third, the Gas PRICE Act answers the call for increasing efficiency. Today's recent reports show that natural gas prices this winter are projected to increase 75 percent. This bill requires the EPA's Natural Gas Star Program to provide grants to identify and use methane emission reduction technologies.  Further, it requires the Administrator to conduct a series of methane emission reduction workshops with the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission to officials in the oil and gas producing states.  Fourth, the supply disruptions caused by hurricane Katrina requiredEPA to issue fuel waivers to allow the use of conventional fuel in special or boutique fuel areas. The bill provides that States acting pursuant to an emergency will be held harmless under the law. Additionally, some members have called for the reduction of the total number of fuels used to increase the overall fungibility. In principle, I agree with my colleagues, however the special or boutique fuel blends address environmental and health needs of each region. Therefore, I have proposed a more cautious approach that will allow for the reduction of fuel blends pursuant to the environmental and consumer preferences in each State.  Fifth, policymakers, businesses, and the public have struggled to balance increased demand for transportation fuels against preferences for ever more stringent environmental quality all while preserving low prices at the pump. Most ``solutions'' have focused on technologies that may not be realized for decades or other measures that would hurt U.S. manufacturers.  Fischer-Tropsche fuels are the likely answer. F-T fuels use petroleum coke, a waste product from the refining process, or domestic coal to produce ultra-clean, virtually sulfur free diesel or jet fuel, and are price competitive at $38/barrel of oil.  The Gas PRICE Act requires EPA to establish a demonstration project to use Fischer-Tropsche, diesel and jet, as an emission control strategy; and authorizes EPA to issue up to two loan guarantees to demonstrate commercial scale F--T fuels production facilities using domestic petroleum coke or coal.  Of course, Congress should have taken many actions in anticipation of the current refining capacity crunch over last several years. Yet, as I indicated earlier, elected officials in large measure react to the will of their constituents. The good news is that we are not too late to make sure that the economy-wide stifling high prices are only temporary.  The Gas PRICE Act that we are introducing today can go a long way in addressing the nation's short, mid, and long-term fuels challenges. Furthermore, it does so by empowering local communities and States, establishing greater regulatory certainty without changing any environmental law, improving efficiency, and establishing a future for the use of ultra clean transportation fuels derived from abundant domestic resources.                                 ______                                       By
