Mr. Speaker, I insert the following for printing in the Record:                    [From the World, Jan.-Feb. 1999]                            (By David Reich)       When President Clinton signed the Personal Responsibility      and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 more commonly      known as the welfare reform bill, US Rep. Fortney Pete Stark      didn't make a secret of his displeasure. ``The president sold      out children to get reelected. He's no better than the      Republicans,'' fumed Stark, a longtime unitarian Universalist      whose voting record in Congress regularly wins him 100      percent ratings from groups like the AFL-CIO and Americans      for Democratic Action.       One of the Congress's resident experts on health and      welfare policy, the northern California Democrat has earned a      reputation for outspokenness, often showing a talent for      colorful invective, not to say name-calling. First elected to      the House as an anti-Vietnam War ``bomb-thrower`` (his term)      in 1972, Stark has called Clinton healthcare guru Ira      Magaziner ``a latter-day Rasputin'' and House Speaker Newt      Gingrich ``a messianic megalomaniac.'' When the American      Medical Association lobbied Congress to raise Medicare      payments to physicians, Stark, who chaired the Health      Subcommittee of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee,      called them ``greedy troglodytes,'' unleashing a $600,000 AMA      donation to Stark's next Republican opponent.       ``I've gotten in a lot of trouble speaking my mind,'' the      congressman admits with a rueful smile. For all his      outspokenness on politics, Stark appears to have a droll      sense of himself, and he tends to talk softly, his voice      often trailing off at the ends of phrases or sentences.       Back in the 1960s, as a 30-something banker and nominal      member of the Berkeley, California, Unitarian Universalist      congregation, Stark upped his commitment to the UU movement      after his minister asked him to give financial advice to      Berkeley's Starr King School for the Ministry. ``I think I      was sandbagged,'' he theorizes. After a day of poring over      Starr King's books (``The place was going broke,'' he says),      he was invited by their board chair to serve as the      seminary's treasurer. ``I said, `Okay,' '' Stark recalls. He      said, `Then you have to join the board,' I said, `I don't      know. I guess I could.' ''       The UUing of Pete Stark culminated at his first board      meeting, when the long-serving board chair announced his      resignation and Stark, to his astonishment, found himself      elected to take the old chair's place. ``There I was,'' he      reminisces, his long, slim body curled up in a wing chair in      a corner of his Capitol Hill office. ``And I presided over a      change in leadership and then spent a lot of time raising a      lot of money for it and actually in the process had a lot of      fun and met a lot of terrific people.''       The World spoke with Stark in early October, as rumors of      the possible impeachment of a president swirled around the      capital. But aside from a few pro forma remarks about the      presidential woes (``His behavior is despicable, but nothing      in it rises to the level of impeachment''), our conversation      mainly stuck to healthcare and welfare, the areas where Stark      has made his mark in government.       World: You have strong feelings about the welfare reform      bill. Do the specifics of the bill imply a particular theory      of poverty?       PS: They imply that if you're poor, it's your fault, and if      I'm not poor, it's because I belong to the right religion or      have the right genes. That the poor are poor by choice, and      we ought not to have to worry about them. It's akin to how      people felt about lepers early in this century.       World: Does the welfare reform law also imply any thinking      about women and their role in the world?       PS: Ronald Reagan for years defined welfare cheat as a      black woman in a white ermine cape driving a white El Dorado      convertible and commonly seen in food checkout lines using      food stamps to buy caviar and filet mignon and champagne and      then getting in her car and driving on to the next      supermarket to load up again. And I want to tell you she was      sighted by no less than 150 of my constituents in various      supermarkets back in my district. They were all nuts. They      were hallucinating. But they believed this garbage.       And then you've got the myth that, as one of my Republican      neighbors put it, ``these welfare women are nothing but      breeders''--a different class of humanity.       World: You raised the idea of belonging to ``the right      religion.'' Do these views of poor people, and poor women in      particular, come out of people's religious training?       PS: No, my sense of what makes a reactionary is that it's a      person younger than me, a 40- or 50-year-old man who comes to      realize he isn't going to become vice president of his firm.      His kids aren't going to get into Stanford or Harvard or make      the crew team. His wife is not very attractive-looking. His      sex life is gone, and he's run to flab and alcohol.       World: So it's disappointment.       PS: Yes. And when the expectations you've been brought up      with are not within your grasp, you look around for a      scapegoat. ``It's these big-spending congressmen'' or ``It's      these women who have children just to get my tax dollar. The      reason I'm not rich is that I pay so much in taxes; the      reason my children don't respect me is that the moral fabric      has been torn apart by schools that fail to teach religion.''       And then there's a group that I've learned to call the      modern-day Pharisees, people from the right wing of the      Republican party who have decided the laws of the temple are      the laws of the land.       World: Then religion figures into it, after all.       PS: Oh, yeah, but to me that's a religion of convenience.      In my book those are people with little intellect who listen      to the Bible on the radio when they're driving the tractor or      whatever. But I do credit them with being seven-day-a-week      activists unlike so many other Christians.       World: Going back to the welfare reform bill itself, how      does it comport with the values implied by the UU Principles,      especially the principle about equity and compassion in      social relations?       PS: If you assume we have some obligation to help those who      can't help themselves, if that's a role of society, then      supporters of the welfare reform bill trample on those      values. ``I'm not sure that's the government's job,'' they      would say. ``It's the church's job or it's your job. Just      don't take my money. I give my cleaning lady food scraps for      her family and my castaway clothes to dress her children. I      put money in the poor box. What more do you want?''       The bill we reported out, the president's bill, was      motivated by the belief that paying money to people on public      assistance was, one, squandering public funds and, two,      preventing us from lowering the taxes on the overtaxed rich.      I used to try and hammer at some of my colleagues, and      occasionally, when I could show them they were harming      children, they would relent a little, or at least they would      blush.       World: Did you shame anyone into changing his or her vote      or making some concessions on the language of the bill?       PS: We got a few concessions but not many. Allowing a young      woman to complete high school before she had to look for a      job, because she'd be more productive with a high school      education--you could maybe shame them into technicalities      like that. But beyond that they were convinced that if you      just got off the dole and went to work, you would grow into--     a Republican, I suppose.       World: It's been pointed out often that many people who      supported the bill believe, as a matter of religious      conviction, that women should be at home raising kids, yet      the bill doesn't apply this standard to poor women. Can the      bill's supporters resolve that apparent contradiction?       PS: Yes, I hate to lay out for you what you're obviously      missing. The bill's supporters would say that if a woman had      been married and the family had stayed together as God      intended, with a father around to bring home the bacon, then      the mother could stay home and do the household chores and      raise the children. They miss the fact that they haven't      divided the economic pie in such a manner that the father can      make enough money to support mother and child.       Now, I do think young children benefit grandly, beyond      belief, by having a mother in full-time attendance for at      least the first four years of life. But given the reality      that a single mother has to work, you have to move to the      idea of reasonable care for that mother's child. And by      reasonable care I do not mean a day care worker on minimum      wage who's had four hours of instruction and doesn't know      enough to wash his or her hands after changing diapers and      before feeding the kid. Or who's been hired without a      criminal check to screen out pedophiles. Because it's that      bad.       World: Did the welfare system as it existed before the 1996      bill need reform?       PS: Sure. The Stark theory--which I used to peddle a      thousand years ago, when I chaired the House Public      Assistance Committee--is that people have to be allowed to      fail and try again and again--and again. We can't let people      starve, but they've got to learn to budget money and not      spend it all on frivolous things. So I'd have cashed out many      of the benefits. For instance, instead     of giving you food stamps worth 50 bucks, why don't I give      you the 50 bucks? The theory behind food stamps was that      you'd be so irresponsible you'd buy caviar and wine and beer      and cigarettes and not have any money left for tuna fish and      rice. And that kind of voucher doesn't give you the chance to      learn.       We did a study, good Lord, in the 1960s in Contra Costa      County, California. Our church was involved, along with the      United Crusade charity, and some federal money went into it,      too. We identified in the community some people who had never      held a regular job--either women who had done day work or men      who were nominally, say, real estate brokers but hadn't sold      a house in years. And in this study we took maybe 20 of them      and made them community organizers--without much to do but      with an office and a job title. All this was to study what      happened to those people when they had regular hours and a      regular paycheck, having come from a neighborhood where      people didn't necessarily leave for the office at every      morning at 7:30.       And we found that these people suddenly became leaders,      that people in the neighborhood came to them for advice. They      even talked about going into politics, just because of the      fact that they fit into the structure and what that did for      their self-image and their neighbors' image of them.       Another part of that program: in the poorest parts of our      community people were given loans to start new stores--wig      shops and fingernail parlors and liquor stores and sub shops      and soul food places and barbecue pits. The stores had little      economic value but lots of social value. They were places      where children of the families who owned them went after      school, and people didn't sleep or piss in the doorways or      leave their bottles there because the street with these shops      became a community that had some cohesion--though when the      funds were cut back, it reverted to boarded-up shops.       World: Are you suggesting that this kind of program might      work for current welfare recipients?       PS: Absolutely. I don't believe for a minute that 99      percent of people, given the opportunity, wouldn't work. They      see you and me and whoever--the cop on the beat, the school      teacher, the factory worker, the sales clerk--going to work.      People want to be part of that. It's just like kids won't      stay home from school for very long. That's where the other      kids are, that's where they talk about their social lives.      That's where the athletics are. And so it is with adults:      they want to be part of the fun, of the action.       Inefficient as some people's labor may be, as a last      resort, bring them to work in the government. It would be so      much more efficient than having to pay caseworkers and making      sure they're spending their welfare checks the right way.      Give them a living wage, damn it. They'll learn. And given      time, their efficiency as economic engines will improve.       World: Do you have a clear sense of how the changes in the      system are affecting welfare clients so far?       PS: No, and I'm having a major fight with our own      administration over it. Olivia Golden, who until recently      headed up the family, youth, and children office in the      Health and Human Services Department, sat there blithely and      told me ``Welfare reform is working!'' I said. ``Olivia,      what do you mean it's working?'' ``Well, people all over      the country have told me--'' ``How many?'' ``Maybe 12.'' I      said, ``Are you kidding? You've talked to maybe 12      people?''       They won't give us the statistics. They say, ``The states      don't want to give them to us.'' All we know--the only      figures we have--is how many people are being ticked off the      rolls. What's happened to the people who leave the rolls?      What's happened to the kids? The number of children in      poverty is starting to go up--substantially, even when their      family has gotten off welfare and is working.       World: One of the arguments in favor of the welfare bill      involved ``devolution.'' Do you accept the general      proposition that states can provide welfare better than the      federal government?       PS: Well, the states were always doing it, under federal      guidelines. Now we've taken away the guidelines and given the      states money with some broad limitations.       I have no problem with local communities running public      assistance programs. They're much closer to the people and      much more concerned, and somebody from Brooklyn doesn't know      squat about what's needed in Monroe County, Wyoming, where an      Indian reservation may be the sole source of your poverty      population. But I want some standards--minimum standards for      day care, minimum standards for job training. I'm talking      about support standards, not punishment standards.       World: And the current bill has only punishment standards?       PS: Basically. It's a threat, it's a time limit, it's a      plank to walk.       World: What about the idea that welfare reform would save      the government money? How much money has been saved?       PS: I can get the budget figures for you, but I suspect we      haven't saved one cent. I mean, do homeless people cost us?      What is the cost in increased crime? We're building jails      like they're going out of style. Does the welfare bill have      anything to do with that? I don't know, but I wouldn't make      the case that they're unrelated.       So if you take the societal costs--are we saving? And it's      such a minuscule part of the budget anyway. It's like foreign      aid. I could get standing applause in my district by saying,      ``I don't like foreign aid.'' And if I ask people what we're      spending on it, they say, ``Billions, billions!'' We spend      diddly on foreign aid. The same is true for welfare. Any one      of the Defense Department's bomber programs far exceeds the      total cost of welfare.       World: Is there any hope of improving the country's welfare      system in the short of medium term, given that the 1996 bill      did have bipartisan support?       PS: It had precious little bipartisan support, but it had      the president. No, I don't think we're apt to make changes.      And what's fascinating is that with the turn in global events      our economy may have peaked out. We may be heading down. And      while this welfare reform may have worked in a booming      economy, when the economy turns down, those grants to the      states won't begin to cover what we'll need.       World: If Congress isn't likely to do anything, what can      people in religious communities do to make sure the system is      humane?       PS: They can get active at the state and local level.      Various states may do better things or have better programs      or more humane programs. And the lower the level of      jurisdiction, the easier it is to make the change, whether      it's in local schools or local social service delivery      programs.       The other thing is to take the lead in going to court. It's      the courts that have saved us time after time--in education,      women's rights, abortion rights. We need to look for those      occasions where a welfare agency does something illegal--and      there will be some--and take up the cause of children whose      civil rights are being violated.       World: Let's shift over to healthcare. In the 1992      presidential campaign, the idea of a universal healthcare      plan was seen as very popular with the voters. Why did the      Clinton health plan fail?       PS: I'd like to blame it on Ira Magaziner and all the      monkey business that went on at the White House--the secret      meetings and this hundred-person panel that ignored the      legislative process. Their proposal became discredited before      it ever got to Congress. We paid no attention to it. My      subcommittee wrote our own bill which accomplished what the      president said he wanted. It provided universal coverage, it      was budget-neutral, and it was paid for on a progressive      basis.       World: And it did that by expanding Medicare?       PS: Basically it required every employer to pay, in effect,      an increase in the minimum wage, to provide either a payment      of so much an hour or add insurance. And if they couldn't buy      private-insurance at a price equivalent to the minimum wage      increase, they could buy into Medicare--at no cost to the      government, on a budget-neutral basis. But the bill allowed      private insurance to continue, with the government as insurer      of last resort.       We got it out of committee by a vote or two, but then on      the House floor, we couldn't get any Republican votes. They      unified against it, so we never had the votes to bring it up.       The Harry and Louise ads beat us badly. People were      convinced that government regulation was bad, per se. It was      just the beginning of the free market in medical care,      which we're seeing the culmination of now in the for-     profit HMOs and the Medicare choice plans that are      collapsing like houses of cards all over the country. But      back in 1993 the idea was ``Let the free market decide.      HMOs will be created. They'll make a profit, they'll give      people what they want. People will vote with their feet      and the free market will apply its wonderful choice.''       World: Did that bill's defeat doom universal healthcare for      a long time to come?       PS: It certainly doomed it for this decade and things are      only getting worse. We now have a couple of million more      people uninsured. We're up to about 43.5 million uninsured,      and we were talking about 41 million back in 1993. And people      on employer-paid health plans are either paying higher copays      or getting more and more restricted benefits. Plus early      retirement benefits are disappearing so that if people retire      before 65, they often can't get affordable insurance. It will      have to get just a little worse before we'll have a popular      rebellion. We're seeing in the managed care bill of rights      issue where people are today. To me, that's the most potent      force out there in the public.       World: In both areas we've been discussing assistance to      the poor and health insurance, the US government is taking      less responsibility than virtually all the other industrial      democracies.       PS: Why take just democracies? Even in the fascist      countries, everybody's got healthcare. We are the only nation      extant that doesn't offer healthcare to everybody.       Take our neighbor Canada. There is no more conservative      government on this continent, north or south. I've heard the      wealthiest right-wing Canadian government minister say: ``I      went to private prep schools, but it never would occur to us      Canadians to jump the queue, go to the head of the line in      healthcare. We believe healthcare is universal. Now, we fight      about spending levels, we fight about the bureaucracy, and we      fight about how we're working the payment system.'' But they      don't question it.       World: In the US we do question it--the right to      healthcare, that is, Why?       PS: It's connected with this idea of independence. Where do      we get the militias from, and those yahoos who run around in      soldier suits and shoot paint guns at each other?       World: The frontier ethos?       PS: Maybe, maybe. And the American Medical Association is      not exactly exempt from blame. The physicians are the most      antigovernment group of all. They're the highest paid      profession in America by far, and so they are protecting      their economic interests. Though the government now looks a      little better to them than the insurance industry because      they have more control over government than over the      insurance companies.       Look, the country was barely ready for Medicare when that      went through. It just made it through Congress by a few      votes. There are some of us who would have liked to see it      include nursing home or long-term convalescent care. That can      only be done through social insurance, but people won't admit      it. They say, ``There's got to be a better way.'' It's a      mantra. On healthcare: ``There's got to be a better way.''      Education: ``There's got to be a better way.''       They've yet to say it for defense though. I'm waiting for      them to privatize the Defense Department and turn it over to      Pinkerton. Although in a way they have. There's a bunch of      retired generals right outside the Beltway making millions of      dollars of government money training the armed forces in      Bosnia. I was there and what a bunch of crackpots! They've      got these former drill sergeants over there, including people      out to try to start wars on our ticket.       World: A few more short questions. Have the culture and      atmosphere of the House changed in the years since you      arrived here?       PS: Yes, though I spent 22 years in the majority and now      four in the minority, so I may just be remembering good old      days that weren't so good. Back when I was trying to end the      Vietnam War. I was in just as much of a minority as I am now,      and I didn't have a subcommittee chair to give me any power      or leverage.       On the other hand, look at the country now. Look at TV talk      shows--they argue and shout and scream, and then they call it      journalism. Maybe we're just following in their footsteps.       World: Is it a spiritual challenge for you to have to work      with, or at least alongside, people with whom you disagree,      sometimes violently?       PS: Yes, and I don't a very good job. My wife says, ``When      you retire, why don't you become an ambassador?'' And I say,      ``Diplomacy doesn't run deep in these genes.'' But it's tough      if you internalize your politics and believe in them.       Still, I like legislating--to make it all work, to take all      the pieces that are pushing on you, to make the legislation      fit, to accommodate and accomplish a goal. It really makes      the job kind of fascinating. I once reformed the part of the      income tax bill that applies to life insurance, and that's      one of the most arcane and complex parts of the tax bill. It      was fun--bringing people together and getting something like      that. And actually writing that health bill was fun.       But not now. We don't have any committee hearings or      meetings anymore. It's all done in back rooms. Under the      Democratic leadership we used to go into the back room, but      there were a lot of us in the room. Now they write bills in      the speaker's office and avoid the committee system. I mean,      it's done deals. We're not doing any legislating, or not very      much.       World: Do you think about quitting?       PS: No, I don't think about quitting. I'd consider doing      something else, but I don't know what that is. Secretary of      health and human services? Sure, but don't hold your breath      until I'm offered the job. Even in the minority, being in the      Congress is fascinating, and as long as my health and      faculties hold out. * * * I mean, I'm not much interested in      shuffleboard or model airplanes.                               ____________________
