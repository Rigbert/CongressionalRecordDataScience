Speaker, I rise to congratulate Mr. J.C. Collins of Bethalto, IL. Mr. Collins has been chosen as the 1995 Inductee of the National Mens' Ministries Christian Hall of Excellence, by the national Assemblies of God denominational headquarters in Springfield, MO. This honor is equivalent to a national layman of the year award for the Assemblies of God.  Mr. Collins was chosen for this award from among the 50 State inductees of the State Assemblies of God. He had earlier been named the Illinois State Inductee by the State Assemblies of God denominational headquarters in Carlinville, IL.  He has faithfully served his church, the First Assembly of God in Cottage Hills, IL, as a deacon, assistant Sunday school superintendent, and youth leader. He has been a Sunday school teacher for 30 years. He has supervised almost all of the church's construction projects, including the church itself, the houses, and all the buildings that belong to the church.  He has been active for decades with Gideons International, spreading the Gospel and passing out Bibles in schools, hospitals, hotels, and colleges.  When Mr. Collins retired in 1988 from his work as a construction supervisor, after 41 years at Laclede Steel Co. in Alton, IL, he prayed for the opportunity to make 10 trips overseas to help build churches. Since then he has made 11 trips, including Belgium, the former Czechoslovakia, Lesotho, Mexico, Germany, and the former East Germany when the Berlin Wall was coming down. He is now planning trips to Belgium and El Salvador.  J.C. Collins was born in Marshall County, KY, on February 8, 1926. He entered the U.S. Armed Forces when he was 17 years old, and he was promoted to staff sergeant by the time he was 18. During his military service he worked on researching German V-2 rockets on the White Sands Proving Ground.  Mr. Collins married his lovely wife, Ruby Scott, on December 9, 1944, in Mineral Wells, TX. They are blessed with two daughters, Wanda Collins Burgund and Patricia Collins Moran, and four grandchildren, Brian Hendricks, Stephanie Burgund Krienitz, Rachel Moran, and Alicia Moran. Following their father's and grandfather's strong and positive spiritual influence, all of Mr. Collins' children and grandchildren are active in their local churches.  I congratulate Mr. J.C. Collins and wish him and his family the very best in the future.                          ____________________
