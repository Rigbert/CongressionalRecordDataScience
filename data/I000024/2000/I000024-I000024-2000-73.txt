President, my language would actually fully fund impact aid to all school districts in the country by fiscal year 2004. The effect it would have this year would be approximately $78.2 million. In discussing this with both the majority and the minority, I realized the offset we are suggesting; that is, to take it out of administrative overhead, is something that has already been done. I recognize that once they get to conference, they are going to have to shuffle these things around and see what actually can be done.  While I recognize that in the House and Senate bills there is an increase in impact aid, it does not have anything in the future that will reach full funding. I have a list here. Not one of the 50 States is 100 percent. Yet these are funds taken from the States due to Federal activities.  What I would like, perhaps with the understanding and the agreement of the chairman of the committee and the ranking member, is to go ahead and adopt this amendment which says, in the 4-year period, impact aid will be fully funded; however, there is to be an understanding it has to go into conference along with some other requests to see what actually can be worked out.  I want to have a colloquy with the chairman of the committee so we can have this understanding. The State of Pennsylvania is actually at 11 percent of being fully funded, which is not nearly as well as Oklahoma, which is at 37 percent. This is something that is an equity issue. It is not a distinction of 50 percent or 60 percent of full impact aid funding or 10 percent. It is an equity issue.
