Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds.  Mr. Chairman, if this bill is voted down, we also will have opened up our hearts to corporate crooks who build multimillion dollar mansions on the water in nice places in Florida because the unlimited homestead exemption that is in the current law will be maintained. I do not want to open up my heart to those folks, and that is why this bill ought to pass.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Cannon).
