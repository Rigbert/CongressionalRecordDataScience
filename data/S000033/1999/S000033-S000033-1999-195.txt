 Speaker, I would like to have printed in the Record statements by high school students from my home State of Vermont, who were speaking at my recent town meeting on issues facing young people today. I am asking that you please insert these statements in the Congressional Record as I believe that the views of these young persons will benefit my colleagues.                            Police Brutality (On behalf of Chris Callahan, Ingrid O'Reilly, Chris Lancaster, Reah                          Greico and Andy Weber)       Ingrid O'Reilly: To serve, honor and protect. It's a phrase      that is supposed to be a representation of police forces all      over America. They serve the American people, but do they      really honor and protect them? By definition, honor means to      regard or to treat with respect. But it seems that the police      officers that harassed Officer Aaron Campbell of Florida were      not respecting him, never mind honoring him.       Then there is the question of protect. Americans depend on      officers in the time of danger, but for Amadou Diallo, he      lost his life when four New York City officers emptied their      entire rounds on him because he looked suspicious. Is our law      enforcement system covered by a blue curtain and our officers      put on a pedestal, or is the law enforcement just getting a      bad reputation for a few mistakes?       Chris Callahan: Aaron Campbell, a 26-year veteran of the      Miami Dade Police Department, was pulled over and charged      with a traffic violation. Campbell didn't believe that he was      pulled over because of any traffic violation, but was a      victim of racial profiling. Campbell resisted arrest, and      later was accused of assaulting a police officer.       Campbell was successful in convincing the jury that racial      profiling is an everyday occurrence. He was later acquitted      of all charges, except for resisting arrest. The fact that      Campbell was a police officer helped his case significantly.      Imagine the victims who are not professionally affiliated      with the legal system, and the difficulty that they have      proving their innocence.       Reah Greico: On February 4, 1999, Amadou Diallo, a 22-year-     old African immigrant, was shot and killed by four white      policemen. Officers pleaded not guilty to the murder,      believing that Diallo looked like a sketch of a serial      rapist, and that he was reaching for a gun. The four officers      were indicted for second-degree murder.       While the murder of Amadou Diallo is not believed to have      been an intentional case of police brutality, it shows how      susceptible minorities are to police prejudices and      brutalities.       Andy Weber: Since police enforcement began, there has      always been some form of brutality or misuse of power. While      there is no one solution to end brutality, many organizations      and plans have been adopted to control this problem. Many      precincts are waging heavier fines, longer suspensions, and      even dismissals for officers convicted of brutality.       However, these actions should not even be happening.      Therefore, many ideas have brought forth on how to prevent      the brutality. The most popular of these ideas is community      policing. Recently, the Los Angeles Police Department      instituted a community policing program, which a report      explains by the following: The catalyst for moving the      department away from the faceless militaristic organization,      toward a 21st century model that is more compatible and      interactive with local communities.       Lastly, one of the most important ways to end police      brutality is the destruction of the blue curtain. Though this      is the easiest solution, it is also the hardest to actually      carry out.       Chris Lancaster: Both brutality and corruption among law      enforcement agencies have always been problems. Fortunately,      today, it has been acknowledged that these problems exist,      and this is the first step towards any possible resolution.      These are problems that cannot be solved by any one policy or      program, and programs such as the Los Angeles Community      Policing Program are simply the beginning.       As for the blue curtain, it is time to realize that, while      such a code may strengthen the bonds and camaraderie among      police officers, it is no excuse to withhold the truth.      Taking a definitive stance on eliminating the blue curtain      will end a large percentage of corruption among police, and      will lead to a more productive, constructive relationship      between the police and the public.       Congressman Sanders: Good job.                                         ____                              Prostitution(On behalf of Lynn Clough, Angela DeBlasio, Kayla Gildersleeve and Tess                                 Grossi)       Lynn Clough: Prostitution is a major concern and a policy      issue for many countries, including the United States.      Prostitution is defined as a relatively indiscriminate      sexually exchange made for material gain. Persons prostitute      themselves when they grant sexual access for money, gifts or      other forms of payment, and in doing so, use their bodies as      a commodity. In legal terms, the world ``prostitute'' refers      only to those who engage frequently and overtly in such      sexual economic exchanges.       Prostitution is now illegal for most of the United States.      Prostitution is wrong. It spreads deadly diseases such as      AIDS, promotes violence and cruelty, and minorities are      involved for the easy way out. The violence is terrible and      inhumane, but the prostitutes have to deal with it.      Currently, if a prostitute is murdered, the police wouldn't      make a big priority of it, but it really needs to be.       The government has to realize that prostitution is still      happening and is not going to ever stop. Wise governments      will accept that paid sex is ineradicable and concentrate on      keeping the business clean, safe and inconspicuous.      Prostitution is not going to go away and it needs to be taken      care of.       Angela DeBlasio: Many people know that prostitution is      illegal, but they find that they have sexual needs. They know      they can't get a prostitute, so they try and pick up fellow      workers, which brings up sexual harassment. The United States      holds a huge sexual harassment problem. Sexual harassment is      one of the fastest expanding areas of American law.       The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which handles      sexual harassment complaints, in 1991 handled over 6,000      cases, and in 1997 close to 16,000. If prostitution was legal      and open for business, would there be any reason for sexual      harassment cases?       Kayla Gildersleeve: One would wonder, if prostitution is      going on anyway, why legalize it? The answer is simple. If      prostitution is legalized, then the government would be in      charge, and there would be great protection from diseases and      violence. Also, there     wouldn't be any unprotected prostitutes on the streets, and      they would get paid, not the pimps.       Tess Grossi: Prostitution has been a part of life      throughout history, and what would make the government think      that making it illegal will stop it? The sex industry is      exposed to many of the forces that normal businesses must      contend with, but will it ever become a normal and respected      part of society? History suggests that it might. Throughout      history, there have been all forms of prostitution, including      legal prostitution.       Again, prostitution causes deadly diseases to spread more      rapidly, and there is great violence and inhumanity involved.      All of these problems can be eradicated if the government      would legalize it. The government is the only answer to      solving the problem. Prostitution will never go away.      Therefore, the government should legalize prostitution.       Lynn Clough: The people and the prostitutes are afraid to      go to the government for help, and so the government needs to      go to them.       Thank you.                                 ____________________
