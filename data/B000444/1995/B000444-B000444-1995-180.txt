 President, if I can respond, we did make that inquiry and reached a totally different conclusion than the Senator from Mississippi. Again, let me make clear why.  First, there was no question. The records were public documents. The issue was whether a mandamus should be issued.  Second, the fact that only one of the five legislators, turned over these records further underscores the point that they were the only five people involved in this matter. No one was asking for, in this court, case records from any other legislator.  Third, the question that the intermediate court responded to differently than the upper court was whether or not the vehicle to get these records from Tulane would be a writ of mandamus or a lawsuit. That was the issue; not just how do you get the records. And that issue did not go to whether or not they would have to be produced, but when and under what legal document would they have to be produced. And on that score, Justice Dennis affirmed the intermediate court's ruling along with five other justices.
