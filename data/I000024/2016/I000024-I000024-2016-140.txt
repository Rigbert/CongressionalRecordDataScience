President, I think Senators Thune and Nelson have done a great job of putting together the reauthorization bill for the FAA. It is something that should have been done some time ago. We are hoping the House will adopt what we have or something close to it because we are getting ready to do this. It is significant.  I want to mention something that people may not be aware of. This month leaders from around the world are going to meet in New York to sign the Paris climate agreement--an agreement that hinges entirely on President Obama's commitments to reduce emissions in the United States.  In Paris, he said: We commit that the United States will reduce our CO2 emissions somewhere between 26 and 28 percent by 2025.  Of course, that is just not going to happen.  President Obama has three legacies, as his days are now numbered. One of them is to take away people's guns. We all know about Second Amendment rights. Every time something happens, they always try to restrict gun ownership. He still wants to do that. Closing Gitmo is another one. The third one we are trying to survive is his global warming program.  While the President has been working to solidify his legacy on global warming, he has chosen to ignore the reality that the United States will not keep his carbon promises. The document that will be signed on April 22--Earth Day--will soon be added to the president's stack of empty promises on global warming. This has been going on since 1997. While President Obama will undoubtedly issue a press release praising the signing as a ``historic'' event--he won't even be attending. That should be a good indication that he knows he is not going to be able to do this. He is not even going to be there.  Once again, I want to make sure the international participants are warned that the President's climate commitment lacks the support of his own government and it is going to fail. There is no question about that. I can say that because history has already repeated itself. I have been on the frontlines dating back to the failed Kyoto treaty of 1997. For over 20 years, history has been repeating itself, and I have been on the frontlines dating back to that time.  This is kind of interesting. In 1997 President Clinton and Vice President Gore went to the Kyoto convention. They signed the treaty and they thought: This is great. Everyone is going to have to do cap and trade.  They got back here, and there was a little thing called the Byrd-Hagel resolution. It passed this body 95 to 0. What did it say? It said: If you come back with the Kyoto treaty and it does one of two things, we will vote against it. That was 95 Members; there were 5 people absent that day.  They said they would not do it if two things were in it: No. 1, if it is an economic hardship on the United States of America, and No. 2, if you come back with a treaty that doesn't treat developing countries the same as developed countries. In other words, if we have to do something in the United States that China doesn't have to do, that India doesn't have to do, that Mexico doesn't have to do, then we will vote against it.  Of course, they came back with something that violated both. So there was never any possibility that it was going to pass, and it didn't. We subsequently rejected four cap-and-trade bills in the following 13 years.  This past year a bipartisan majority in both the Senate and the House spoke again when we passed two resolutions of disapproval formally rejecting President Obama's carbon regulations. There is a little thing a lot of people don't know about called the CRA, the Congressional Review Act. That means if the President tries to do something that is against the wishes of the people through their elected representatives, then you can pass a CRA--Congressional Review Act--that will reject the regulation. So we passed two resolutions formally disapproving what he was trying to do.  So I say to the 196 countries that might show up here: Don't show up anticipating that something is going to happen, because it is not. This isn't even supported by a majority of the Members of the Senate or the House. Congress has continuously shown that the American people don't want the Federal Government imposing harsh penalties like cap and trade to address the highly contested theory of manmade global warming.  The first attempt to enact cap and trade back in 2003 would have cost our economy upwards of $400 billion a year.  I say to our good friend from Alaska who is the Presiding Officer right now that every time I hear a large figure, I take the current population in my State of Oklahoma--those families who actually pay Federal income taxes--and I do the math. In this case, this would cost in the neighborhood of $3,000 per family, and of course, as I will demonstrate in just a minute, they will get nothing for that.  In 2003 the first bill that came up would have cost upwards of $400 billion. This has not been contested, and the numbers aren't much different from what the President is trying to do right now with his Clean Power Plan, which he is trying to do through regulation because he knows it won't pass as legislation.  The Clean Power Plan--the centerpiece of the President's promise to the international community that the United States will cut greenhouse gases between 26 and 28 percent by 2025--this plan, which attempts to do through regulation what the President was unable to do through legislation, stands on very shaky legal ground.  Most recently, the Supreme Court joined the chorus in signaling to the President that the President's efforts on climate change are dead on arrival. This is the U.S. Supreme Court.  I think we owe it to the 196 countries to let them know that nothing is going to happen once they get here. I think it is nice if they all want to come and tour America and spend their money, maybe take old Highway 66 down through my State of Oklahoma and see what America really looks like. I would love to have them come. But I want to make sure they know that nothing is going to happen in terms of the President's Clean Power Plan or his broader international commitments.  The Supreme Court dealt the President's legacy a major blow when it voted 5 to 4 in February to block the implementation of Obama's Clean Power Plan while it is being litigated by over 150 entities, including 27 States, including Oklahoma, which are filing a lawsuit to make sure this does not happen. So we have a majority of States in America saying: Not only do we not want it, but we are suing them to make sure it is not implemented. There are also 24 trade associations, 37 electric co-ops and 3 labor unions challenging EPA in court. They are all filing these lawsuits, so the Supreme Court comes along and says: Until these are resolved, we are going to stay the regulation.  This decision delays implementation of the rule until the next President and completely upends Obama's Paris commitments. Without the central component of his international climate agenda, achieving the promises he made in Paris is a mere pipe dream. Even with the Clean Power Plan, the United States would fail to meet 45 percent of the promised greenhouse gas emission reductions. Now, with the Supreme Court's stay on these regulations, there could be an even greater deficit. If the Clean Power Plan is overturned, the United States will miss the mark by about 60 percent. Furthermore, the litigation on the Clean Power Plan won't likely get resolved until 2018. That means the regulations will be blocked for at least the next 2 years, as the chart shows.  First, on June 2, the three-judge panel on the DC Circuit will need to hear the case. The three-judge panel will issue a decision sometime this fall, and it will almost certainly be challenged with a request for an en banc review by the entire DC Circuit. A decision from an en banc panel won't come until much later--likely by the end of the year, as we can see on the chart. This decision will almost certainly be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. If the Court decides to hear the case, a final decision is expected in late 2017 or 2018.  The DC Circuit has already decided to delay hearing the case on the Clean Power Plan's sister rule on carbon controls for new power plants until after the November elections, signaling little appetite for allowing this to be an easy, quick legal review of Obama's carbon mandates.  Similar to the Clean Power Plan litigation, any decision on a new source rule--new sources of power plants--would likely be appealed to the Supreme Court, with a final decision expected in 2018. Critically, the new source rule is a legal prerequisite for the Clean Power Plan, so without the new source rule, there is no Clean Power Plan.  The success of Obama's carbon mandates hinges not on just one but on two Supreme Court wins that will be decided well after he leaves office. He will be long gone. And with a new administration needing to fill a vacancy next year on the Court--who knows how that will impact or delay consideration of pending cases.  We are clearly a long way off from knowing the outcome of the President's carbon regulations. You wouldn't know that when you hear the releases that came from Paris saying this has been a great success. He made the commitment as to what kind of reductions we are going to have when he in his own mind knew for a fact that was not even a possibility.  So we are a long way from knowing the outcome of the President's carbon regulations that were written to help fulfill his pledge to international communities. But, as I said, Obama will be long gone by that time.  It is important for the 196 countries involved in the Paris climate agreement to understand what I am saying. The Congress, the courts, climate experts, and industry are all pointing to the same conclusion: President Obama's climate pledge is unattainable, and it stands no chance of succeeding in the United States. For the sake of the economic well-being of America, that is a good thing. Again, we still would welcome the 196 countries to come over here and enjoy America, but don't expect any of President Obama's climate promises to happen.  A few countries have taken note. Specifically, China and India, two of the world's largest emitters of greenhouse gas, are now second-guessing the legitimacy of Obama's commitments.  Navroz K. Dubash, a senior fellow at the Center for Policy Research in New Delhi told the New York Times that ``[the Supreme Court stay] could be the proverbial string which causes Paris to unravel.''  Zou Ji, the deputy director general of China's National Center for Climate Change Strategy and International Cooperation, also told the New York Times: ``Look, [if] the United States doesn't keep its word, why make so many demands on us?''  In another display of solidarity against Obama's climate agenda, I led 34 Senators and 171 House Members in an amicus brief filed in the DC Circuit arguing that the Clean Power Plan is illegal. The plan would cause double-digit electricity price increases in 40 States and have no impact on the environment. Further, these regulations would prevent struggling communities from accessing reliable and affordable fuel sources, which could eventually lead to poor families choosing between putting food on the table and turning the heat on in the wintertime.  Much of the focus this past year has been the Clean Power Plan and the Paris Agreement that is reliant on its success. The administration has the power generation sector in its crosshairs, but they will not stop there. We know that. We are keenly aware of Obama's war on fossil fuels--coal, oil, and natural gas.  If I don't have to be someplace in conjunction with my obligations with the Senate Armed Services Committee, I go back home every weekend. They ask questions you don't hear in Washington. They ask: Now, wait a minute, if we are reliant upon fossil fuels--coal, oil, and gas--for 85 percent of the power necessary to run this machine called America and if Obama is successful in killing coal, oil, and gas, then how are we going to run this machine called America?  That is a logical question, but not here in Washington. You don't hear that here in Washington.  The Clean Power Plan is a template for unauthorized action, and if it works for one sector, future bureaucratic agencies will use it to restructure every industrial sector in this country. The immediate threat to future generations is not climate change. The climate is always changing and will continue to do so regardless of who is in the White House.  Luckily, the American people have caught on to the President's climate charade. But don't take my word for it; just look at the polls. I can remember back when the first bills were coming out. There was the McCain-Lieberman bill in 2003, and we looked at the bill. At that time, the polls showed that global warming was either the No. 1 or No. 2 concern in America. That has all changed. A FOX News poll found just the other day that 97 percent of Americans don't care about global warming when they stack it up against terrorism, immigration, health care, and the economy. Even an ABC News/Washington Post poll from last November found that the number of Americans who believe climate change is a serious problem is on the decline. According to the Gallup poll--they have a big one every March--the Gallup poll in March of 2015 had global warming coming in dead last of environmental issues that people are concerned about. George Mason University did a poll of 4,000 TV meteorologists, and it also dispelled the President's talking point that there is 97-percent consensus among scientists that humans are driving climate change. The survey found that roughly one out of three meteorologists do not believe man is the primary cause--if, in fact, it is happening.  Overall, neither the American people nor Congress supports the President's detrimental climate change agenda and his attempt to bolster his personal legacy with empty promises.  Let me wind up and say that we welcome the international community to come over here, but with regard to the Paris Climate Agreement, nothing is going to happen.  I wish to mention a couple other things. Many countries quickly jumped on the global warming bandwagon that the United Nations was trying to sell to the world and instill an obligation to impose associated restrictions. Australia was one of the first countries to join in. They did this several years ago--until they realized what it cost, and then they came back and passed legislation taking themselves off of this so that they are no longer legally obligated to do anything about their emissions.  If you stop and think about China, every 10 days China is building a new coal-fired power plant. This is the country the president is using to justify his own climate agenda while convincing the American people China is making similar contributions to reducing greenhouse gases. The problem with this is that China admits they are going to continue to build coal-fired plants and increase emissions until the year 2030 and then they will consider reducing their emissions. We know it is not going to happen.  Lastly, I remember when Lisa Jackson was appointed by President Obama. She was his first appointment as Administrator of the EPA. I remember talking to her in a public meeting live on TV, and I asked her the question: Let's assume that one of these pieces of legislation passes on cap and trade or that through regulation they are able to do it. Is that going to have the effect of reducing overall emissions worldwide?  She said: No, because this isn't where the problem is. The problem is in China; it is in India; it is in Mexico.  In fact, you can actually say this could have the effect of increasing emissions because as we chase our manufacturing base overseas, it may go to countries like China that have lower environmental standards and will ultimately increase emissions, not decrease.  So the President's international climate commitment is not going to happen. I want to make sure people are aware of that. We wouldn't want them coming over here under the impression that something is going to happen when it is not.                          ____________________
