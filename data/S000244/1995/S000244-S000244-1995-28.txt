Chairman, we are pleased to accept this amendment. I commend the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Hoke] for offering it.  The amendment addresses the concerns of NASA, specifically that it provides the agency with a 3-month overlap of zero G operations by both NASA aircraft as well as aircraft operated by a prime contractor. This will ensure that there will be no hiatus in zero G capability during the transition period, and this means that there will be no impact in the training schedule of the astronauts.  Privatization of this program by NASA means that now private corporations will have the opportunity to compete for a contract to provide this service to the agency. There are at this time companies that are prepared to enter competition and who are investing considerable amounts of time and capital to lay the groundwork for this effort. This legislation provides the opportunity to the private sector to demonstrate their ability to provide this service more efficiently, and this amendment allows sufficient overlap between the existing Federal operation and its private counterpart to ensure that there is no gap in this important function.
