President, I am pleased that the House of Representatives today passed the Former Vice President Protection Act, H.R. 5938--a bill to ensure that that former Vice Presidents and immediate family members receive Secret Service protection for 6 months after they leave office. I am especially pleased that this important legislation, which will now be sent to the President for signature, includes key provisions of the Identity Theft Enforcement and Restitution Act, a critical cyber crime bill I introduced last year and that has twice unanimously passed the Senate in this Congress. I hope that the President will promptly sign this measure into law.  Although the Secret Service has provided protection to former Vice Presidents over the last 30 years through a variety of temporary grants of authority, this legislation will provide clear authority for the Secret Service to provide such protection for the first time. The men and women of the Secret Service perform the very difficult jobof protecting our current and former leaders exceptionally well. I am pleased that this legislation will help the Secret Service to carry out this important mission.  This bipartisan legislation also includes important cyber crime provisions--portions of the Identity Theft Enforcement and Restitution Act--to protect the privacy rights of all Americans. The anticyber crime provisions in this bill are long overdue. A recent survey by the Federal Trade Commission found that that more than 8 million Americans fell victim to identity theft in 2005. In addition, a new report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development encourages democratic governments around the world to more aggressively fight identity theft, by enacting stronger cyber crime laws and stiffening the penalties to deter potential cybercriminals.  The key anticyber crime provisions that are included in this legislation will close existing gaps in our criminal law to keep up with the cunning and ingenuity of today's identity thieves. First, to better protect American consumers, the legislation provides the victims of identity theft with the ability to seek restitution in Federal court for the loss of time and money spent restoring their credit and remedying the harms of identity theft, so that identity theft victims can be made whole. Second, to address the increasing number of computer hacking crimes that involve computers located within the same State, the cybercrime amendment eliminates the jurisdictional requirement that a computer's information must be stolen through an interstate or foreign communication in order to federally prosecute this crime.  Third, this legislation also addresses the growing problem of the malicious use of spyware to steal sensitive personal information, by eliminating the requirement that the loss resulting from the damage to a victim's computer must exceed $5,000 in order to federally prosecute the offense. The bill carefully balances this necessary change with the legitimate need to protect innocent actors from frivolous prosecutions, and clarifies that the elimination of the $5,000 threshold applies only to criminal cases.  In addition, the amendment addresses the increasing number of cyber attacks on multiple computers, by making it a felony to employ spyware or keyloggers to damage 10 or more computers, regardless of the aggregate amount of damage caused. By making this crime a felony, the amendment ensures that the most egregious identity thieves will not escape with minimal punishment under Federal cyber crime laws. The legislation also strengthens the protections for American businesses, which are more and more becoming the focus of identity thieves, by adding two new causes of action under the cyber extortion statute--threatening to obtain or release information from a protected computer and demanding money in relation to a protected computer--so that this bad conduct can be federally prosecuted. And, lastly, the legislation adds the remedy of civil and criminal forfeiture to the arsenal of tools to combat cyber crime and our amendment directs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to review its guidelines for identity theft and cyber crime offenses.  Senator Specter and I have worked closely with the Department of Justice and the Secret Service in crafting these updates to our cyber crime laws and the legislation added as an amendment to the Former Vice President Protection Act has the strong support of these Federal agencies and the support of a broad coalition of business, high tech and consumer groups. The bill as amended to include these critical cyber crime provisions is a good, bipartisan bill that will help to better protect our Nation's leaders and to better protect all Americans from the growing threat of identity theft and other cyber crimes.  I thank Senator Specter for his hard work on this legislation. I also thank Senators Biden and Hatch and the bipartisan coalition of Senators who have joined with us to ensure its passage. In addition, I thank House Judiciary Committee Chairman Conyers and Congressman Bobby Scott for their assistance in enacting this bill. I also thank Majority Leader Reid, House Majority Leader Hoyer and House Majority Whip Clyburn for their leadership in advancing this legislation. Lastly, I thank the many high tech, business and consumer organizations who have worked so hard to enact this legislation to better protect the privacy and security of American consumers and American businesses. I encourage the President to promptly sign this important criminal legislation into law.                          ____________________
