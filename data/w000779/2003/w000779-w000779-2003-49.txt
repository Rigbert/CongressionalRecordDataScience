President, I will be very brief. I want to recognize my friend from New Mexico who has spent a lot of time on this bill and has an important amendment.  As we go to the amendments this afternoon--particularly those from my side--I think it is critically important that the bipartisan compromise which was consummated yesterday in a 97-to-1 vote on the floor of the Senate not become unraveled today. This is, in my view, the only bill that can make it to the President's desk. It is a balanced approach on management. It ensures that the public has every single opportunity to participate in the debate about forestry but, at the same time, it does not establish a constitutional right to a 5-year delay on every conceivable matter that may relate to the forestry sector.  In particular, it provides for potentially lifesaving hazardous fuel reduction projects in our national forests. We have to respond to what we have seen in California. It is a heartfelt need in that State.  If this legislation as set out in the compromise doesn't become law, what we have seen in California in the last few days, and as we saw in Oregon last year, is going to be what the country faces year after year.  I am very interested in working with our colleagues in an expeditious manner. I thank Senator Cochran again for all of his cooperation. Senator Bingaman has been waiting for a long time.  I intend to work with all of our colleagues on this amendments today. What I especially look forward to is completing the work on this legislation. It was a very exciting development to have yesterday's vote by such a large plurality. It shows what you can do if you stay at it and try to find common ground in an area that is about as contentious as you can find. As Senator Cochran noted, we hope colleagues will bring amendments to the floor and move expeditiously.  I yield the floor.
