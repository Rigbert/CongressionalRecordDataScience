 President, I am pleased to introduce this important legislation today with my colleagues, Senator Lieberman, Senator Kerrey, and Senator Bryan. This bill represents an important step toward ensuring patients receive safe, quality health care in our nation's hospitals and healthcare facilities.  The Institute of Medicine (IOM) Report released last fall indicates that nearly 44,000 to 98,000 people die or are seriously hurt in hospitals every year. That is equivalent to having three jumbo jets filled with passengers crash every two days. Should we be safer flying in an airplane than going to a hospital for routine surgery?  Take the case of Gary Masiello, who lost his daughter when her breathing tube was accidentally disconnected. Nine months later he lost his wife in another hospital when she choked on her medication. He no longer has the confidence that he or his family are safe when entering the hospital.  The case of Betsy Lehman, a Boston Globe health reporter, is yet another example of how medical mistakes can lead to death. She received a drug overdose in 1994 during her chemotherapy treatment.  Ironically, even one of the contributors to the IOM report was touched by a medical error. Mary Wakefield, while she was preparing the report, discovered that her 83 year old mother was operated on the wrong hand.  Today, Senator Lieberman, Senator Kerrey, Senator Bryan, and I are introducing a bipartisan bill to make patient safety a national healthcare priority. We recognize that mistakes happen, and that in our complex healthcare system, problems will occur. But in a country that is the leader in healthcare research, technology, and advancement, we should be able to do much, much better when it comes to patient safety.  We are not here today to point the finger or to blame. We are here to provide a solution to this disturbing problem--a problem we think is preventable.  Our legislation establishes a reporting and patient safety program for hospitals and other healthcare providers that participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, which would include virtually every healthcare facility in the United States. Billions of federal tax dollars go to these programs. The taxpayers deserve to know that the healthcare system they invest in provides safe, high-quality care.  This bill extends confidentiality protections to ensure that providers will report without risk of retaliation by trial lawyers. By creating a safe environment, this bill will foster reporting and corrective action plans in hospitals and healthcare facilities across the country.  Our legislation will improve patient safety and give providers the tools they need to address medical mistakes before patients are harmed. These errors are not intentional by any means, but they are preventable. So, I ask that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this bill to ensure that medical errors become a thing of the past.  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: Section-By-Section of the Stop All Frequent Errors (SAFE) in Medicare                         and Medicaid Act of 2000       Section I. Title and Table of Contents.       Section II. Purpose--This section describes the intent of      the legislation which is to create a non-punitive medical      error reduction program under the Medicare and Medicaid      programs through identification of medical errors, extension      of confidentiality with limited disclosure, and      implementation of systems and processes to reduce the number      of adverse events that occur.       Section III. Improvement of Patient Safety under the      Medicare Program--This section establishes the guidelines for      the medical error reduction program in the Medicare and      Medicaid programs as a condition of participation.       Facilities that choose to participate in the Medicare and      Medicaid programs including hospitals, critical access      hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, comprehensive      outpatient rehabilitation facilities, home health agencies,      hospice, renal dialysis facilities, and ambulatory surgery      centers would have to meet the requirements of this Act.       Hospitals would be required to participate one year after      the date of enactment of this Act. The other institutions      would be phased-in on a timetable to be determined by the      Secretary of Health and Human Services.       Providers would have to implement a patient safety program      to reduce medical errors. The program will target both      sentinel events and additional events associated with injury      as targeted by the Secretary, or local providers. The program      shall utilize active investigation to discover health care      errors and achieve measurable improvement in the rates of      health care errors.       In addition, providers would be required to report sentinel      events and additional designated errors to the following: (1)      their state health department; (2) a national accrediting      organization when applicable, i.e. the Joint Commission on      the Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO); and      (3) the Medicare peer review organizations. The facility      would be responsible for performing a root-cause analysis and      implementing a corrective action plan that reduces the risk      of such event happening in the future. Providers can      designate which agency or entity described above to approve      their compliance with the reporting and correction program.      Aggregated reports without identifiers would be submitted to      the Secretary by the agency or entity.       Confidentiality and privacy protections based on current      peer review protections would be extended to ensure that      institutions would be encouraged to report and to implement      effective patient safety programs. Information would also be      protected for the purposes of conducting peer review      activities and root cause analysis.       A definition of poor performance is complying with the      reporting and correction program will be specified by the      Secretary, JCAHO, the Agency for Healthcare Research and      Quality (AHRQ), the peer review organizations, providers and      consumer organizations. When a facility has a pattern of      poor performance, this information is reported to the      Secretary and the Secretary shall then release this      information to the public. This would occur if the pattern      of poor performance continues for more than two years, and      a provider fails to report sentinel events and implement      corrective actions to address safety problems.       Section IV. Improvement of Patient Safety Under the      Medicaid Program--This section extends the Medicare      provisions above to congregate care providers in the Medicaid      program. Congregate care provider is defined as facilities in      the Medicaid program that provide hospital services, nursing      facility services, services of intermediate care facilities      for the mentally retarded, hospice care, residential      treatment centers for children, services in an institution      for mental diseases, and inpatient psychiatric hospital      services for individuals under age of 21.       Section V. Establishment of the Center for Patient Safety--     This section establishes a Center for Patient Safety (Center)      within HHS. The mission of the Center is to improve patient      safety and reduce the incidence of medical errors. The Center      would establish national goals for patient safety and      mechanisms to track such goals. In addition, the Center would      prepare and submit an annual report to the President and      Congress with recommendations concerning patient safety.      Among some of its duties, the Center would develop a national      health care patient safety research agenda, disseminate      information and evaluate mechanisms to improve patient      safety, and conduct pilot projects to conduct new or      innovative patient safety reporting systems.       Section VI. Grants to Establish Patient Safety Programs--     This section authorizes the Center to award grants to      providers and health professionals affiliated with such      providers for the establishment and operation of patient      safety programs.       Section VII. Authorization of Appropriations--This section      authorizes the following amounts:       (1) For fiscal year 2001, $30,000,000.       (2) For fiscal year 2002, $35,000,000.       (3) For fiscal year 2003, $40,000,000.       (4) For each fiscal year thereafter, such sums as may be      necessary.                                 ______                                       By
