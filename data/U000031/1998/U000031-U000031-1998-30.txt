Speaker, we need full and immediate disclosure, and that is what H.R. 3582 does. At the end of next month, most of us will file our FEC report for the first time since 1997. I cannot imagine a Member here or a challenger that does not have a fax machine, a telephone, e-mail, the ability to get on the Internet.  This bill will require reports by all committees that raise or spend $50,000 to be filed electronically so that we can see an immediate reporting of contributions and expenditures within 24 hours. What is wrong with that? Nothing, and that is why every Member here should support it. This bill is an important first step as we look for full disclosure and the need to enforce the law.  Last year, there was a report in the magazine, The Hill, that all of us receive here in Washington in our offices, and it said that most Members do not comply fully with the laws that are already on the books.  Well, I have a fourth grader at home, and I know that when she does not fully comply with her homework assignment, that her dad, myself, or her mom, makes sure that in fact that work is done before she goes to school the next day.  I would say that both this bill and other measures will seek full compliance with the law so that every constituent can see how we raise and spend money which is very important as we look forward to the days when we receive the full confidence that our constituents should have in the Members that run for office.
