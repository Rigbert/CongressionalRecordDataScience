Mr. Speaker, I come to the House Floor today with a heavy heart. On June 11, 2016, a ``Bulldog'' in the Alaska Veterans community passed from our world, and joined his comrades from Vietnam, family, and friends in Heaven above. On behalf of the countless Alaskans who were touched by Retired Air Force Master Sergeant Fred ``Bulldog'' Becker, Mr. Speaker, I would like to share my condolences with his son Fred, daughters Elizabeth, Melinda, and their many grandchildren and great-grandchildren.   Mr. Speaker, I recall one special occasion when I joined Bulldog on our nation's birthday, July 4, 2010, after he and his brothers in arms rode across the country in honor of fallen Naval Chief Special Warfare Operator Lance Vacarro. From the moment we met so many years ago, to that day in 2010, and until his passing, his commitment to his fallen brothers was never-ending, and I will always treasure our friendship.   Mr. Speaker, though Bulldog was never one to flaunt his own achievements, it is only fitting to mention several of them in recognition of this remarkable Alaskan. Bulldog served his country in the United States Air Force for 20 years, including three tours in Vietnam, before retiring in 1981. Among his many commendations, he is the recipient of the Air Force Commendation Medal with 1 Oak Leaf cluster, a Presidential Unit Citation, the Vietnam Service Medal, the Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross with Palm, and the Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal.   Mr. Speaker, upon ``Bulldog'' Becker's retirement, he chose to call the great state of Alaska home. In Alaska, and across the country, he was a tireless advocate for our nation's veterans. He proudly dedicated his life to serving our nation, my home State of Alaska, and all those who wore the uniform of our great nation.   Mr. Speaker, Master Sergeant Becker never backed down from a challenge. A proud member of the Vietnam Veterans Motorcycle Club and later the Combat Veterans Motorcycle Club, he always fought to ensure our men and women in uniform received the care and respect they not only deserved, but earned.   Mr. Speaker, I have always believed that a hero is someone who has given his or her life to something bigger than themselves. In the eyes of anyone who knew him, MSgt. Fred ``Bulldog'' Becker was a true American hero. Bulldog, Godspeed my friend, until I see you again, riding through the clouds of Heaven.                          ____________________
