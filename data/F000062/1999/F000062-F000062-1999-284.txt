 President, I want to say a few words about the tragedy in Colorado. I want to express my sincere sympathies for the families and victims of yesterday's events.  Once again, we have witnessed a deadly school shooting in America's heartland. Yesterday's events, although greater in magnitude than other shootings in recent years, have, it seems, become part of a growing trend in this country, and particularly among young people, and that is to solve everyday problems with deadly violence.  Now, some of us have heard firsthand the gruesome effects of gun violence. But we can't imagine what the classmates and families of those Colorado children must be going through today. The senseless loss, the graphic memories, the fear of violence, the lack of explanation.  Who among us can imagine how we would feel if two dozen of our friends and classmates were gunned down in a matter of minutes? Who among us knows what we would say to our own children if something like this happened at their school? And who among us wants to imagine what it would be like to receive that phone call telling us that our child is no more.  Mr. President, this is a time for grieving, but it is also a time for sincere reflection on the direction of this country and the nature of child on child violence. Sadly, this nation has experienced an ever increasing number of these incidents in the last two years. We saw it happen in Pearl, Mississippi where two students were killed. We saw it happen in West Paducah, Kentucky where three students were killed. We saw it in Jonesboro, Arkansas where five were killed and in Springfield, Oregon where two were killed.  We saw a five-year-old Memphis, Tennessee kindergartner last year bring a gun to school because the teacher had given him ``timeout'' the day before. Now Littleton, Colorado joins that tragic list.  We are still learning the specifics of this latest tragedy. But while this most recent incident may have been executed with more deadly results, it is all too familiar. We must struggle to learn why these incidents are happening with ever increasing frequency. Are children more troubled than they have been in the past? Do parents need to pay more attention to danger signals within their own homes? Do parents even have the ability to recognize danger signs? And do they know what to do when they see the signs of trouble?  I am certain that we will all continue to ask these questions in the coming days and weeks. I hope we don't stop asking until we find some answers.  One area in which I have been working for many years is the problem of gun access. I realize that bringing up gun control at this time might be viewed by some as trying to capitalize on yesterday's tragedy. I am sure the NRA will criticize those of us who connect this violence with the easy access of guns in America. But sadly, times of tragedy like this are often the only times people pay attention to the problems plaguing our society. If we do not speak up now, we may not prevent future Littletons from occurring.  Children have easy access to guns of every sort and every caliber--including assault weapons and high capacity clips that make it all too simple to strike fellow students down in mere seconds. Whereas in the past a grievance might be settled in a brief fist-fight, today our children often turn to firearms.  Yesterday, two masked gunmen killed as many as 25 people with semiautomatic gunfire and explosive devices. Other students hid under desks and in rooms throughout the school, watching the gruesome scene develop on televisions within the classrooms, and in some cases calling the media to report crying, gunfire, and the sound of running feet from within the school walls. One student reported to police that he saw two of his classmates carrying shotguns, automatic weapons, and pipe bombs.  We may never be able to stop children from feeling alone and wanting to strike out. But we can certainly stop them from gaining the use of high capacity weapons with which to strike. And we should.  In 1994, we passed a ban on assault weapons and high capacity ammunition clips, with the intent to get these guns off the streets, out of the hands of criminals, and away from our kids. But because of strong NRA opposition, we were forced to allow pre-existing guns and clips to remain on the shelves of stores across this country. And although the President has stopped the importation of most assault weapons to this country, millions of high capacity ammunition magazines continue to flow onto our shores and into the hands of criminals and, indeed, our children.  In fact, between March and August of last year alone, BATF approved more than 8 million large-capacity clips for importation into America. The clips approved during this one short period accounted for almost 128 million rounds of ammunition--and every round represents the potential for taking one human life.  Mr. President, 75, 90, and even 250-round clips have no sporting purpose. They are not used for self defense. They have only one use--the purposeful killing of other men, women and children.  I have introduced legislation, supported by the President, that will stop the flow of these clips into this country. I know that we cannot eliminate these clips from existence. But we must--we must--do our best to make it harder and harder for children to find these clips and to use these guns.  It is both illogical and irresponsible to permit foreign companies to sell items to the American public--particularly items that are so often used for deadly purposes--that U.S. companies are prohibited from selling. It is time to plug this loophole and close our borders to these tools of death and destruction. Our domestic manufacturers are complying with the law, and we must now force foreign manufacturers to comply as well.  In closing our borders to these high capacity clips, we will not put an end to all incidents of gun violence. But we will limit the destructive power of that violence. We will not stop every troubled child who decides to commit an act of violence from doing so, but we can limit the tools that a child can find to carry out that act.  Each of us has been touched in some way by the devastating effects of gun violence. Each of our states has faced unnecessary tragedy and senseless destruction as a result of the high-powered, high-capacity weapons falling into the hands of gangs, drive-by shooters, cop killers, grievance killers, and yes, even children. My own state of California has too often been the subject of national attention due to incidents of gun violence.  We must work to console the victims of this crime and the families of those who have been injured. My thoughts and prayers go out to those who have been affected by yesterday's events. We must now rededicate our efforts to prevent future tragedies from developing. I for one want to stop the easy access juveniles have to weapons of war, reduce this violence we see every night on TV, and help strengthen and nurture a new family ethic that says ``enough'' to this kind of violence.                          ____________________
