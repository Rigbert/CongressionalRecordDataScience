 Iwant to assure them that I fully intend to make good on the promise made in the Committee mark up. In a separate statement I made today, I laid out for the Senate the history of the use of the corporate shift. It has been used in varying forms on a number of tax bills that have been enacted. In making this agreement, I do not concede that it is an improper provision for the tax writing committees to use. As the legistlative process moves forward, I pledge that I will continue working to address their concerns.
