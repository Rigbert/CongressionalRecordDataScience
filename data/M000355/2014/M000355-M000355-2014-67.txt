 President, I rise to mourn the loss of a U.S. marine and a Kentuckian from the hometown of Abraham Lincoln. LCpl Matthias N. Hanson hailed from Lincoln's birthplace of Hodgenville, KY, and was killed on February 21, 2010, of wounds suffered as a result of conducting combat operations in Helmand Province, Afghanistan. He was 20 years old.  For his service in uniform, Lance Corporal Hanson received several awards, medals, and decorations, including the National Defense Service Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, and the Purple Heart.  ``Matt's our hero because of how he lived,'' says the Reverend Norm Brock, who spoke at Matt's memorial service. ``Matt didn't miss life. He lived life.''  Service was a proud tradition in Matt's family. His father Lowell R. Hanson, Jr., served in the Army. One of Matt's brothers is currently Active Duty Army, while the other is in the Army Reserve. Matt himself was born in Germany on a military base. As Mary Huff, Matt's mom, puts it: Matt ``had to go rogue and join the Marines.''  Matt had a strong work ethic in high school says his father Lowell:       He used to get up at 4:00 in the morning to milk cows on a      nearby farm, then go to school, then onto football practice,      and back to work on the farm. Other people noticed and were      impressed by his work ethic, and I was proud of him. He was      determined that when he got old enough, he would join the      Marines and serve his country.  Growing up, Matt was known for his blue eyes and sneaky smile, and he had a way of talking himself out of anything.  He had an easygoing manner and a lust for life. ``He was quiet, a trickster and a charmer,'' says his mother. But ultimately, he was a country boy who wanted to do right by his country. Matt was a country music fan who particularly liked the song ``Way Out Here'' by Josh Thompson. He was ``funny, energetic, really outgoing,'' says family friend Emily Johnson. ``He could make anyone laugh. He had the brightest blue eyes ever. That's what we'll remember him as.''  Matt graduated from LaRue County High School in Hodgenville, where he was a member of the football team and the Student Technology Association. Next to his picture in the school yearbook he put the following quote: ``Life moves pretty fast. If you don't look around and pay attention, you could miss it.''  Soon after graduation he enlisted in the Marine Corps in the spring of 2008. ``He was very proud of what he had done when he signed up to go to the Marines,'' remembers LaRue County High School football coach and assistant principal Rodney Armes. ``He got his hair cut short and he was a Marine from the day he signed up.''  Matt was trained as a rifleman and assigned to the 3rd Battalion, 6th Marine Regiment, 2nd Marine Division, II Marine Expeditionary Force based in Camp Lejenue, NC. He was deployed to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in January of 2010. Matt played a key role in a crucial multiday battle in Afghanistan just days before his death in mid-February 2010. Matt's platoon came under fire from Taliban forces in the town of Marjah. Matt walked up, under air cover, to the fortified bunker where the enemy fire was coming from and fired a grenade launcher into the bunker with great poise and accuracy, killing the enemy forces. ``The battle was over,'' said Matt's father, thanks to his bravery. ``He played a critical role,'' says Capt. Gordon Emmanuel, Matt's platoon commander. ``Anytime he shot he was on impact. Marines were cheering with his shots.''  Matt's father was told by Matt's platoon sergeant and by Captain Emmanuel that Camp Hanson, once the biggest U.S. position in Marjah and well known to any Marine who has served in the area, was established at that site in Matt's honor because of his actions.  ``The last time I saw [Matt] was on Christmas Eve 2009,'' said Matt's father. ``He hugged me around the neck and said: Daddy, don't worry about me. Everybody dies. Not everybody has Jesus. Not everybody gets to be a Marine.''  We are thinking of Matt's family as I recount his life for my Senate colleagues today. They include Matt's mother and stepfather Mary and Larry Huff; his father and stepmother Lowell R. Hanson, Jr., and Cynthia Hanson; his siblings Megan, Samantha, Erika, Lowell, and Brendan; his grandparents; and many other beloved family members and friends.  Matt was buried with full military honors in Hodgenville. The town that is the birthplace of one of America's greatest patriots, Abraham Lincoln, is also a fitting resting place for this brave young man and Marine. The Commonwealth of Kentucky will never forget the life and service of LCpl Matthias N. Hanson or his ultimate sacrifice given freely to his country. It is thanks to men like him that our Nation is free.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
