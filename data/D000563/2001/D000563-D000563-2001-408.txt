President, it is with great pleasure that I rise today to honor America's mothers. On Sunday, May 13th, families across America will celebrate Mother's Day. This is a special time of year, when we pay tribute to our mothers for playing an important role in our lives.  Mother's Day is a time to thank mothers for their patience, compassion, and devotion. Mothers have taught us to be who we are today and who we will be in the future. They instill values of respect and honor in our lives. On this day, we acknowledge the role mothers play in shaping our nation's future, one child at a time.  Our mothers were first honored in this way in 1907, when Anna Jarvis petitioned influential political and religious leaders to adopt a formal holiday honoring mothers. She hoped that such an observance would increase respect for parents and strengthen family bonds. Thanks to her efforts, in 1914, President Woodrow Wilson proclaimed the second Sunday in May as Mother's Day. He declared that on this day, the U.S. flag is to be displayed in government buildings and at people's homes ``as a public expression of our love and reverence for the mothers of our country.''  This year, as we celebrate Mother's Day, we are reminded of the changing role of mothers in our society. Today, mothers are not only homemakers and volunteers. They are lawyers and doctors, teachers and nurses, Senators and CEOs. In fact, half of American women with children under the age of eighteen now work full time, outside the home. Whether our mothers work inside or outside the home, they are our caretakers and nurturers. They are the cornerstone of our country. Their role in our society is priceless.  With all of our mothers' hard-work and devotion, it is no wonder that each year families search for the perfect gift to give for Mothers' Day. We purchase flowers, candy, and cards. Yet, America's mothers deserve more. Mothers want to know that their children are safe in school, receiving the best possible education, and protected from dangers in the community. This is where we, as lawmakers, have a role to play. We can do more to help mothers. We can help give them something they want and deserve for Mother's Day by passing legislation that reduces the number of guns on our streets, improves our schools, and protect our neighborhoods.  One year ago I joined over 900,000 mothers, fathers and children across the country in the Million Mom March. We came out on Mother's Day to renew our commitment to our children--we will continue to work tirelessly to prevent the senseless gun related deaths of our children. We want to raise our children, not bury them.  We joined together to talk about the need for gun safety and sensible gun control. Yet this body has turned a deaf ear to the calls.  While some downplay the fact that guns are more rampant in America than in any other country, more and more children are killed by guns. Every day, 10 mothers are told that their child has been killed by gunfire. That is 10 too many. Last Congress, I introduced bipartisan legislation with eight other Senators, known as the Child Access Prevention, CAP, bill, in an effort to hold gun owners accountable when they fail to safely store their firearms. Gun owners need to assume responsibility for safely storing their firearms in a way that is not accessible to children. Unfortunately, the Congress did not pass my bill. I plan to reintroduce this legislation during this Congress and I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort.  Here we are, two years after Columbine, one year after the Million Mom March, and two months after Santana High, and this Senate still has not acted on any gun legislation. How many more mothers will have to celebrate Mother's Day without their children at their side before we begin helping law enforcement and school officials end the violence in our schools? Our mothers should not have to fear sending their children to school. We must pass sensible gun laws--for our nation, for our children, for our mothers.  This year, for Mother's Day, let us also assure mothers that their children are receiving a quality education. Too many school children face challenges that inhibit their ability to learn. Student-to-teacher ratios are too large, teachers are not properly trained, and the best technology is not made available. Mothers count on our schools to provide their children with the best possible education. Yet, our schools are not meeting the standards. While Congress debates funding priorities, our children are leaving school unprepared for their futures.  We must increase Federal support for education to ensure that all our children have the skills and knowledge they will need in the future. Our goal must be to make every child a success story. Allocated funding will allow schools to reduce class sizes and increase professional development programs for teachers. It will help local schools invest in and integrate new technology in classrooms and help expand school counseling, school safety, and substance abuse programs. By helping our schools, we will assure mothers that their children are ready for the future.  As a gift for Mother's Day, we can also give children a place to go after school hours. With one half of American mothers working full time outside the home, many children come home from school to an empty house. It is during this time when many unsupervised children find trouble. A study released by the YMCA of the USA designated the hours between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. as the ``danger zone.'' Teenagers are more likely to drink, smoke, or engage in sexual activity because they are unsupervised. But this time could and should be used for productive activities.  The hours after school should be a time to learn and grow, not invite trouble. We need to expand funding for programs like Chicago's Lighthouse after school program, so that children have access to tutoring and mentoring programs, recreational activities, and literacy education after the school day ends. When children participate in these programs, working mothers can be reassured that their children are not only safe, but thriving, while they are at work.  In conclusion, Sunday is our special opportunity to recognize the role of mothers and to thank them for their nurture, care, and love. On Sunday, when we salute our mothers for the role they have played in our lives, let's recommit ourselves to give them a gift in return, a gift they will treasure. Let's pass sensible gun laws, increase funding to our schools, and protect our communities. That is what our mothers want, on Mother's Day and every day. And that is what we should give them.                          ____________________
