President, I am pleased to be joining with my colleagues, Senators Durbin and Snowe, in introducing this bill to ban all late-term abortions, including partial birth abortions, that are not necessary to save the mother's life or to protect her from grievous physical harm.  Let me be clear from the outset. I am strongly opposed to all late-term abortions, including partial birth abortions. I agree that they should be banned. However, I believe that an exception must be made for those rare cases when it is necessary to save the life of the mother or to protect her from grievous physical harm. Fortunately, these procedures are extremely rare in my State, where there were just two late-term abortions between 1984 and 1996.  We believe that this debate should not be about one particular method of abortion, but rather about the larger question of under what circumstances should late-term, or post-viability, abortions be legally available. We believe that all late-term abortions--regardless of the procedure used--should be banned, except in those rare cases where the life or the physical health of the mother is at serious risk.  In my view, Congress is ill-equipped to make judgments on specific medical procedures. As the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists--which represents over 90 percent of ob-gyns and which opposes the partial birth abortion ban--has said, ``the intervention of legislative bodies into medical decision-making is inappropriate, ill advised, and dangerous.'' Most politicians have neither the training nor the experience to decide which procedure is most appropriate in a given case. These medically difficult and highly personal decisions should be left for families to make in consultation with their doctors.  The Supreme Court, in Roe v. Wade, has identified ``viability''--the point at which the fetus is capable of sustaining life outside the womb with or without support--as the defining point in determining the constitutionality of restrictions on abortion. While I don't believe that it is appropriate for us to dictate medical practice, I do believe that it is appropriate for Congress to determine the circumstances under which access to late-term abortions--by any procedure--should be restricted.  That is what the legislation we are introducing today would do. Our bill goes beyond the partial birth abortion ban, which simply prohibits a specific medical procedure and will not prevent a single abortion. Let me emphasize that point. The partial birth legislation would not prevent a single late-term abortion. A physician could simply use another, perhaps more dangerous method to end the pregnancy.  By contrast, our bill would prohibit the abortion of any viable fetus, by any method, unless that abortion is necessary to preserve the life of the mother or to prevent ``grievous injury'' to her physical health. We have taken great care to tightly limit the health exception in this bill to ``grievous injury'' to the mother's physical health. It would not allow late-term abortions to be performed simply because the woman is depressed or feeling stressed or has a minor health problem because of the pregnancy.  ``Grievous injury'' is narrowly and strictly defined by our bill as either a ``severely debilitating disease or impairment specifically caused by thepregnancy,'' or ``an inability to provide necessary treatment for a life-threatening condition.'' Moreover, ``grievous injury'' does not include any condition that is not medically diagnosable or any condition for which termination of the pregnancy is not medically indicated.  This bill includes an additional safeguard. The initial opinion of the treating physician that the continuation of the pregnancy would threaten the mother's life or risk grievous injury to her physical health must be confirmed by a ``second opinion.'' This second opinion must come from an independent physician who will not be involved in the abortion procedure and who has not been involved in the treatment of the mother. This second physician must also certify--in writing--that, in his or her medical judgment, the continuation of the pregnancy would threaten the mother's life or risk grievous injury to her physical health.  What we are talking about are the severe, medically diagnosable threats to a woman's physical health that are sometimes brought on or aggravated by pregnancy.  Let me give you a few examples: primary pulmonary hypertension, which can cause sudden death or intractable congestive heart failure; severe pregnancy-aggravated hypertension with accompanying kidney or liver failure; complications from aggravated diabetes such as amputation or blindness; or an inability to treat aggressive cancers such as leukemia, breast cancer, or non-Hodgkins lymphoma.  These are all obstetric conditions that are cited in the medical literature as possible indications for pregnancy terminations. In these extremely rare cases--where the mother has been certified by two physicians to be at risk of losing her life or suffering grievous physical harm--I believe that we should leave the very difficult decisions about what should be done to the best judgment of the women, families and physicians involved.  Mr. President, the legislation we are introducing today is a fair and compassionate compromise on this extremely difficult issue. It would ensure that all late-term abortions--including partial birth abortions--are strictly limited to those rare and tragic cases where the life or the physical health of the mother is in serious jeopardy, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it. This legislation presents an unusual opportunity for both ``pro-choice'' and ``pro-life'' advocates to work together on a reasonable approach.  I also ask unanimous consent that a recent editorial from the Bangor Daily News endorsing our approach be included in the Congressional Record at the conclusion of my remarks.  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:              [From the Bangor Daily News, Sept. 11, 1998]                             Abortion Vote       Back when the subject of abortion was debated on moral and      religious grounds, opponents could disagree while      understanding how each arrived at a position. Now that      abortion is a vehicle for fund raising there is no room for      understanding because understanding doesn't bring in the      bucks or whip up the membership.       With the Senate's vote next week on late-term abortion, the      Christian Coalition, according to The Washington Post, has      directed at five senators radio advertisements, 300,000      postcards and countless automated telephone calls. Two of the      five senators are Maine's Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins.      The purpose of this extensive campaign is to harass these      senators into dropping their support for a compromise measure      that allowed late-term abortions to protect against      ``grievous injury'' to the physical health of the mother.       But the vote is more about power than pregnancy--Maine had      only two third-term abortions between 1984 and 1996,      consistent with other states. If abortions were the primary      concern, the coalition could with one magazine ad extolling      the effectiveness of condoms do more to reduce unwanted      pregnancies than this entire Senate campaign. As a bonus, the      condom ad might also help reduce sexually transmitted      diseases.       The coalition's main goal is to remain relevant now that      its best-known leader, Ralph Reed, has moved on. The group      has two themes, abortion and gay rights, and even Mr. Reed      says gay rights is a sure loser. That leaves the coalition      trying to override a presidential veto of a ban on so-called      partial-birth abortions, but its lack of sincerity is evident      in its refusal to accept an exemption for the physical health      of the mother.       Assuming for a moment that telling doctors what procedures      they may use to perform an abortion is constitutionally      legal--and the court's 1976 Danforth decision says it isn't--     this compromise should be seen as a fair way for opponents to      agree. The grievous injury provision is not the large      loophole that the coalition claims. It is narrowly defined to      cover either a ``severely debilitating disease or impairment      specifically caused by the pregnancy'' or an ``inability to      provide necessary treatment for a life-threatening      condition.'' It does not include any condition that is not      medically diagnosable or any condition that can be treated      without ending a pregnancy.       The grievous injury exemption would allow treatment for      such illnesses as leukemia or non-Hodgkins lymphoma, primary      pulmonary hypertension, which can cause sudden death or      congestive heart failure, and pregnancy-aggravated      hypertension, which can cause kidney or liver failure.       Instead of recognizing the humanity in allowing for      abortions under the threat of these illnesses, the coalition      continues to demand an end to the partial-birth procedure,      with an exemption only for the near-certain death of the      mother. Banning a procedure, of course, doesn't reduce the      number of abortions; it forces physicians to use riskier      procedures.       Sens. Snowe and Collins have supported a fair and      compassionate compromise in the extremely difficult issue of      abortion. They deserve support from constituents who      recognize the coalition's agenda as having little to do with      unwanted pregnancies and everything to do with power.                                 ______                                       By
