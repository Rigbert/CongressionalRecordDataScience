 President, let me begin by concurring with much of what Senator Salazar has said. I have a lot of respect for Senator Alexander. I have worked with him on some issues, and I look forward to working with him on other issues. But, unfortunately, on this one he is dead wrong, and the amendments on wind energy he has brought forth should be soundly defeated in a tripartisan vote.  Let me begin by quoting from an AP article that appeared on the front page of Vermont's largest newspaper, the Burlington Free Press, this morning and in papers throughout the country. Here is what the article says: ``Ominous Arctic melt worries experts.''       An already relentless melting of the Arctic greatly      accelerated this summer, a warning sign that some scientists      worry could mean global warming has passed an ominous tipping      point. One even speculated that summer sea ice would be gone      in five years.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record.
