Speaker I rise today to honor George Becker, a great union leader, great American, and President Emeritus of the United Steelworkers (USW). Not only has George been a dear friend of mine, but to working men and women everywhere. They owe him a debt of gratitude for the years of service he has given not only to the labor movement, but to his country.  Retirement as the USW's International Union President in 2001 did not change his goals nor dim his vision and resolve. He continued his advocacy during his service on the U.S. Trade Deficit Review Commission. He is still fighting in his capacity as Commissioner on the U.S. China Economic and Security Review Commission to give a voice to the concerns of workers in the industries affected by our exploding trade deficit with China.  I am sure my colleagues on the Congressional Steel Caucus will join me in expressing our good fortune to have worked in close association with a man who warned us years ahead of time that the American steel industry was on the brink of collapse after the Asian financial crisis in 1998. It was George Becker's persistence and foresight that created the joint union-industry alliance ``Stand Up for Steel'' that fought for fair steel trade policies before Congress and two Administrations to bring the relief necessary for the U.S. steel industry to restructure and consolidate.  I remember standing with USW President Becker among hundreds of steelworkers on Capitol Hill who helped win passage of H.R. 975 in the Spring of 1999, a bill I sponsored titled the `Stop Illegal Steel Trade Act' to impose a freeze on steel imports. The U.S. House of Representatives passed it 289 to 141, but the measure was subsequently defeated in the Senate on a procedural vote.  But the determined President Becker didn't stop fighting to save American steelworkers' jobs and the industry. He supported H.R. 808, the Steel Revitalization Act of 2001, to require a five year rollback of steel imports to pre-crisis levels, while providing assistance for retiree health care costs and establishing a $10 billion loan fund to finance steel industry modernization.  The Steelworkers Union president didn't stop at the legislative door of Congress, leading a national union-industry petition under the U.S. Foreign Trade Act to implement a Section 201 tariff on all steel imports that included a public hearing in my Congressional District of Northwest Indiana by the International Trade Commission. The ITC's investigation demonstrated the need for steel tariffs and President Bush implemented relief in 2002.  George Becker, a second-generation steelworker, rose through the ranks to become the sixth international president of the United Steelworkers (USW). He served seven years as the union's international president, elected in 1993 and 1997. He also was chair of the Labor Advisory Committee for Trade Negotiations and Trade Policy for the U.S. Department of Labor; during the Clinton Administration, he served on the President's Export Council and the U.S. Trade & Environmental Policy Advisory Committee.  He is a respected union organizer and strategist, and an internationally-known spokesman for industrial safety, workers' rights on the job and fair global trade.  Among his major accomplishments are:  Mergers with the United Rubber Workers (URW) in 1995, and the Aluminum, Brick and Glass Workers (ABG) in 1997, bringing 140,000 new members to the USW.  Launching the union's pioneering national Rapid Response Network to mobilize members and their local unions to personally contact their members of Congress and state legislatures with handwritten letters on bread & butter issues.  Establishing a USW Legislative Leadership Program in Washington, D.C., which provides member-activists with training in lobbying and political action.  On February 28, 2001, George Becker joined the ranks of one of the Labor Movement's more formidable legacies. He becameonly the sixth past President of the United Steelworkers.  Born within a few yards of the Granite City Steel Mill in Illinois where he went to work at age 15, he lived and loved the life of a steelworker from his first day in an open hearth labor gang to the last day he served as International President.  His service to his country included a stint in the U.S. Marines toward the end of World War II and again during the Korean War, when he was drafted into the U.S. Army, owing to a critical shortage of light weapons infantry leaders.  USW President Becker is enjoying his 55th wedding anniversary this year with his wife Jane that began when he met her in the Ozarks of Missouri. They have three married sons and 14 grandchildren.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in commending George Becker for his outstanding contributions to his union and his country. His commitment to improving the quality of life for working people everywhere is unparalleled, and he should be recognized and commended.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Pages E377-E378]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                        TRIBUTE TO GEORGE BECKER                                 ______                                                         HON.
