Mr. Speaker, it is my understanding that President Carter is heavily involved in the land acquisition and park expansion authorized in this legislation. We have been made aware that one of the properties included in the expansion is a haunted house. This is no Halloween trick. The currently dilapidated structure will be rehabilitated by the National Park Service and eventually be made available to show the public where President Carter lived before his current estate was constructed.  I am also aware that President Carter is an avid hunter. He likes to stalk deer, dove, quail, turkey, and even the occasional squirrel. Fortunately, with the passage of an important Republican gun rights amendment to the Credit Card Reform Act last spring, President Carter will be able to legally transport his firearms to and from his home and clean and load his firearms on his compound within the national park without fear of violating Federal law when this provision goes into effect in February 2010.                              {time}  1415  Right now, other Americans and the other 391 National Park units would be subject to criminal penalties for these actions.  President Carter has an excellent relationship with the National Park Service, which should be preserved. After all, the agency has the duty to preserve the legacy of his 4 years as President through the conservation of his high school, boyhood home and even his current residence within the park. The National Park Service dutifully handles many important tasks, including the day-to-day maintenance of his property and even of mowing his lawn.  Finally, it has been said that these new acquisitions will complete the story of Mr. Carters life. This is a noble goal. I can only assume that is why the legislation also includes the Federal takeover of Billy Carter's gas station.
