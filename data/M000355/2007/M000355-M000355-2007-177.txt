 REID. Yes.  Mr. McCONNELL. It strikes me that there is no good reason why we should not wrap this up tomorrow. I think virtually all of the items left to be dealt with, there is broad agreement on on a bipartisan basis that we ought to pass.  I will be working with the majority leader to complete our work for the week at the earliest possible time.
