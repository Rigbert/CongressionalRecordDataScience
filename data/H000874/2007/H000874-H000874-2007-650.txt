Speaker, we believe that the issue of the President's policy, which was announced some weeks ago, is an extraordinarily serious question confronting the country and the Congress. We expect the resolution to be very straightforward and very simple.  We expect the resolution to deal only with the proposal the President has made for escalation. We believe we should present that to the House of Representatives as an issue on which they can make their advice to the President of the United States and to the Executive Department.  So the answer to the gentleman's question is that we do not believe, as you have not in the past on similar resolutions, I remember your so-called Murtha resolution, we believe that there will be a direct question propounded to the House which every Member can speak to for 3 to 4 days, and then give their advice on.
