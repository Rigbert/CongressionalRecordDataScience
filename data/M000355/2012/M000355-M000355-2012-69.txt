 President, I want to begin by welcoming all the new Members who are here today, Republican and Democrat. Congratulations on your victories, and welcome to the Senate. I assure you, it is not as terrible a job as some say it is. We welcome your ideas, your energy, and your enthusiasm, and we wish you every success in your time here.  I also want to congratulate the President and the Vice President on their hard-fought victory last week. And I wish to say a brief word of thanks to our own nominees as well, Governor Romney and Congressman Ryan.
