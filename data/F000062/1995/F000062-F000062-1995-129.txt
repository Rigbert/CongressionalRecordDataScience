 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a long-time friend and associate, Hadley Roff. Since I first met Hadley when we were both students at Stanford University, he has been a close and dear friend. Over the years, as we worked together when I was mayor of San Francisco, during a campaign for Governor, and as a U.S. Senator, our friendship and respect for one another continued to grow.  Hadley Roff's career, both in Washington, DC, and in San Francisco, shows exactly what can be accomplished when someone devotes his life to public service.  Hadley began his distinguished career as a reporter for a San Francisco newspaper, the News, in 1956 and continued as the News was merged with the Call Bulletin and, finally, with the San Francisco Examiner. Hadley, from his days at Stanford University, wanted to work on a San Francisco newspaper. He did and he closed two of them.  Hadley soon switched his sights to the world of public service.  In Washington, DC, he industriously served as chief of staff to U.S. Senator John V. Tunney, press secretary for Senator Edward M. Kennedy and national media director for the Presidential campaign of Senator Edmund Muskie. But, Hadley gladly returned to San Francisco when the chance arose to serve the city of San Francisco.  Hadley adeptly served the citizens of San Francisco under four mayors. Beginning as press secretary for Joseph L. Alioto, Hadley continued to serve during the tenures of Art Agnos, my administration, and Frank Jordan.  Hadley served as my deputy mayor for more than 8 years when I became mayor of San Francisco in 1978. He constantly showed a particular devotion to public safety that has continued to today. As deputy mayor, Hadley was always made aware when a fire reached three alarms and, regardless of what he may have been doing, Hadley was off to the scene.  More recently, when Hadley served as my State director in my Senate office for 2 years, Hadley was instrumental in assisting former San Francisco Fire Department Assistant Chief, Frank Blackburn, in establishing a temporary emergency water system that helped save the lives of 140,000 Rwandan refugees in 1994.  Hadley describes himself as a ``human switchboard,'' understanding the need to get the right people to a problem, but he is much more than that. He is a very gracious person who always shows great concern for people. He was never too busy to take a call or listen to someone's thoughts. During demonstrations, he effectively maintained a constructive dialog and, more often than not, made it so everyone left smiling. He was the heart and soul of the office and his dedication could not help but motivate others.  For a long, long time Hadley has been a big part of my life.  Recently, Hadley left my office to become a director for the San Francisco Urban Institute at San Francisco State University. And, today, many San Franciscans are joining together to pay tribute to him and to celebrate his affiliation with the Urban Institute. I am sorry I cannot be home right now, joining in the celebration, but it is with fond memories and enthusiastic praise, that I wish Hadley, his wife Susie, and everyone at the Urban Institute all the best.  Hadley, we miss you, but do not think for a second that we will not call you into duty when projects that need that special Hadley touch arise.  Congratulations, Hadley, on the tribute and the wonderful opportunity of working at the Urban Institute.                          ____________________
