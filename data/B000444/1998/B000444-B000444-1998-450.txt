  Mr. President, I say to those who support the position that I will be managing, which is that we should support the President's position and not support my good friend from California,who thinks, along with others, we should decertify, I ask them to come to the floor and let me know if they wish to speak so we can, with some degree of rationality, allocate the time. I know Senator Dodd, after the Senator from California makes her case, wants to speak in opposition to her position. I have told him I will recognize him first. But I say to other Senators who wish to speak in opposition to this decertification, please let me know. I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). Who yields time?
