 Speaker, I would like to have printed in the Record statements by high school students from my home state of Vermont, who were speaking at my recent town meeting on issues facing young people today. Statement by Karl Cloney, Jessica Martin and Jonah Monfette regarding                           Healthy Alternatives       KARL CLONEY: Karl Cloney, from North County Union High      School. Our topic is healthy alternatives.       The Newport area recently has suffered the loss of four      teenagers killed in a drunk driving accident on the way back      from partying in Canada. Recently, there was a town forum      held to respond to this tragedy. The community came together      to discuss the issues and some ways to create healthy      alternatives.       JESSICA MARTIN: Our group came together to propose a      project to start an area teen center. The center will be a      safe place for teenagers to socialize in a healthy manner. We      further propose that we buy a space as a long-term investment      in area youth and the community as a whole. We are looking at      a size that would be large enough for a cafe for snacks to be      served, a dance floor, and a space for a pool and ping-pong      tables, some arcade games and video games. We also want an      outside area for volleyball, skate-boarding, and roller      blading. We would solicit funds as well as acquire grants and      utilize state and federal funds set aside for alcohol-free      events and activities and teenagers. We would like      AmericaCorps and Vista personnel to staff the center full      time. This would make our personnel more cost-effective and      would include local, state and federal resources.       We would create a board of directors made up of parents,      teens, business people and community leaders to oversee the      center. Students would work in the center. This would give      the teens responsibility, job skills, and the ability to work      with adults to create their own place. The center would be a      healthy alternative to hanging out on the streets to see our      friends.       Our yellow ribbons symbolize the death of our young people,      and also symbolize our hope and commitment to find healthy      alternatives within our own community.       JONAH MONFETTE: The teen center could be put where the      Department of Employment and Training is now. It is moving to      the new building being built in Newport. It is an industrial      building with space outside, and we want to buy the space so      that it would be permanent.       Newport has high unemployment. The teen center would      provide job skills for students helping with full-time staff.       The COURT: Thank you very, very much.   Statement By Brian Hodgson and Jessica Riley Regarding Child Labor       BRIAN HODGSON: In our world today, there are 250 million      people toiling in sweatshops around the globe, 250,000      working right here in the United States. These workers endure      long hours in filthy, unsafe factories and plants for      subsistence wages paying them barely enough to keep them      alive.       A typical sweatshop contains unsafe numbers of people      packed into poorly lit, dusty, disease-ridden workplaces,      with no sufficient ventilation or running water. Supervisors      yell, scream, threaten and curse at the workers and put      constant pressure on them to work faster. For all their      suffering, workers are rewarded with paychecks reflecting      hourly wages of 20, 37, as low as six cents, often with      unexplained fees and tolls removed from the take-home amount.       Any workers who dare to speak up, to complain about their      working conditions or pay, are fired. If the workers try to      defend themselves, to meet, to learn their rights, or      organize a union, their employment is almost always illegally      terminated. The most fundamental human and employment rights      of these workers are being violated on a daily basis.       One million of these workers are children, sold or rented      out by their parents, in countries such as India or Pakistan,      into a life of hard, bonded labor at the hands of clothing      and rug producers. Children who should be in school are      working long hours in unsafe, abusive conditions. To these      children, education is a fantastic privilege, and life a      daily struggle.       The move to Third World countries, where the minimum wages      are steadily dropping and where environmental and worker      regulations are nonexistent, has become an all too common      trend in big business. Some of the most heinous abusers of      this form of labor produce staples in our everyday lives.       At a Disney sweatshop in Haiti, a worker who handles 375      Pocahontas shirts an hour is paid the minimum wage of 28      cents an hour, or $10.77 a week, while the Disney shirts sell      at Wal-Mart for $10.97 each. A pair of Nike sneakers that      sell in the U.S. for $140 cost the corporation $3.50 in      offshore labor expenses. That is about a 97 percent profit.       These exploitative companies could easily afford to pay      their workers a living wage, but greedily choose not to.       JESSICA RILEY: At the Student Progressive Coalition in      Brattleboro Union High School in Brattleboro, Vermont, we      have taken positive action against these practices. Devoting      our time to these issues, we have gathered hundreds of      signatures on a petition to the National Labor Committee      calling for President Clinton to end sweatshop practices. We      took part in the promotion of and attendance at the National      Day of Conscience that took place here, in Burlington, on      October 4th. We have educated our community through a candle-     lit vigil, as well as taken our knowledge into an elementary      school to inform students there. Our letters have also      stimulated the local paper to editorialize on the issue. It      is almost impossible to walk down the halls of the community      center without viewing an informative poster or hearing an      issue being discussed amongst the crowds.       By making the community more aware of this one virtually      unknown issue, we help to create a more conscientious      consumer. But awareness is only one part of the action      needed. We also need the power of your law to help with the      issue.       Mr. Congressman, the approval of your bonded labor bill is      a huge and welcome step     in the fight to keep foreign items made by use of child labor      being kept out of the country. He must not let the issue die      with that. We need the U.S. to put money into the United      Nations for inspections of shops around the world, as well as      more money into the U.S. Department of Labor to increase      inspections and sanctions right here at home. We also need      laws that include prevention of any sweatshop products from      being imported into the country.       BRIAN HODGSON: Although none of us on this earth actively      choose to support these institutions by buying products      without thinking of the effects, we do support them. If we      keep buying these tainted goods, if a company involved with      sweatshop labor continues to make a profit, then they will      not give a thought to what they are doing, and these      violations of justice will go on. We must take the time to      research safe labor organizations. We must take the time to      look at clothing labels. We must make sacrifices in order      that these violations do not continue. By being educated, we      can help workers in other countries and in our own get the      rights they need and deserve.                                  ____ Statement by Neale Gay and Liz Rocheleau Regarding Education and Wages       NEALE GAY: My name is Neal Gay and this is Liz Rocheleau.       Let us start by thank you for your time. We will be      discussing what we consider to be a wage problem plaguing the      United States. In this land of opportunity, dreams cannot be      realized as socioeconomic, classes are divided into two      groups, the haves and the have-nots. We do not need a faction      that is able to control the wealth and prosperity of an      entire nation due to their personal and immense wealth. We      readily admit that those with higher education may be better      suited for management jobs; chances are they worked hard to      attain dreams, like becoming CEO of a billion dollar company.      But those that work under them are not given an opportunity      to earn much more than a living wage.       LIZ ROCHELEAU: Since 1979, blue collar workers earning a      wage at or after the 20th percentile have seen their wages      drop an astonishing 11.8 percent. These wages are still going      down, and even though minimum wage has increased numerous      times in recent history, inflation makes this increase not at      all worthwhile. Even more interesting, though, those earning      a wage in the top ten percentile are the only ones who have      seen an increase at all. We see this as a case of the rich      getting richer, and the middle class and the poor quickly      descending the economic scale.       NEALE GAY: Marx and Engels wrote in The Communist      Manifesto, ``Of all the classes that stand face to face with      the bourgeois today, the proletariat alone is a really      revolutionary class. The other classes decay, and finally      disappear in the race of modern industry. The proletariat is      its special and essential product.'' If we take this as true,      that the worker has more worth than the industrialist due to      their work, then shouldn't the worker get a reasonable      compensation for his output?       LIZ ROCHELEAU: We are not talking about a revolution. We      understand that the Federal Government can't put a cap on      what people earn, since capitalism grants private industry.      What we want to know from you is: What has the government      done to make wage distribution just, and what are their plans      for the future?       Congressman SANDERS: All right. Very interesting.                                 ____________________
