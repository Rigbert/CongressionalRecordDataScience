President, that is correct. The committee recommends approximately $2.1 billion for traditional bilateral aid, which is approximately 16 percent less than the level appropriated for fiscal year 1995. To ensure that no single account sustains an unreasonable share of reductions, the committee included language in the bill that requires a proportional allocation among accounts consistent with appropriated levels in fiscal year 1995. It flows from that premise that, as the committee report states, microenterprise poverty programs deserve support substantially consistent with last year's level.
