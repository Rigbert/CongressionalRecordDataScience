Speaker, my colleagues, I have two duties that I want to perform tonight. One is a very happy one, and I will do that first.  This institution has existed for a little over 200 years. One who sits among us has served for a quarter of that time. He is a historic figure. He is one of the most masterful legislators that ever has served in this body. He is a man of great integrity, intellect and, as I said, legislative skill.  He has chaired one of this Congress's and this House's most important committees with broad jurisdiction and has dealt with matters across the spectrum of the jurisdiction of that committee. But 25 years from now, when he retires, he will be remembered most for his leadership on health, on health care for all Americans, on a passion to ensure that each and every American has the availability of affordable, quality health care. We are engaged in that issue on a bill that will be sponsored by this gentleman.  Today, he is 83 years of age, 83 years young. My colleagues, as all of you know, John Dingell is revered by many, feared by some, respected by all.  Let me now yield to my colleague and friend, the Republican leader, Mr. Boehner.
