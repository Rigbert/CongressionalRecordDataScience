Chairman, this provision was struck because it was determined to be substantive in nature and potentially controversial. It is the intention of me as the author of this amendment to have the amendment to be completely technical and nonsubstantive in nature and to clean up the inconsistencies in the bill that was presented to the President last year and ended up being pocket vetoed.
