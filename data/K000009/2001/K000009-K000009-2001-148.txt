Chairman, I thank my esteemed colleague the gentleman from New York for yielding me this time and rise in support of his amendment which is a very straightforward and simple amendment to ask FDA to engage itself in the proper labeling of goods that come into this country. In the area of cocoa beans and chocolate, I think we do not often think of where a product's ingredients come from.  Mr. Chairman, I include for the Record an article that was published in the St. Paul Pioneer Press on June 24 of this year that talks about the cocoa beans that come here to America blended into our product from places like the Ivory Coast.            [From the St. Paul Pioneer Press, June 24, 2001]                           Daloa, Ivory Coast       There may be a hidden ingredient in the chocolate cake you      baked, the candy bars your children sold for their school      fund-raiser or that fudge ripple ice cream cone you enjoyed      on Saturday afternoon. Slave labor. Forty-three percent of      the world's cocoa beans, the raw material in chocolate, come      from small, scattered farms in the poor West African country      of Ivory Coast. And on some of the farms, the hot, hard work      of clearing the fields and harvesting the crop is done by      boys who were sold or tricked into slavery. Most of them are      12 to 16 years old. Some are as young as 9. The slaves live      on corn paste and bananas. Some are whipped, beaten and      broken like horses to harvest the almond-size beans.       The State Department's human rights report last year      concluded that some 15,000 children ages 9 to 12 have been      sold into forced labor on cotton, coffee and cocoa      plantations in northern Ivory Coast in recent years.       Aly Diabate was almost 12 when a slave trader promised him      a bicycle and $150 a year to help support his poor parents in      Mali. He worked for a year and a half for a cocoa farmer who      is known as ``Le Gros'' (``The Big Man'') but he said his      only rewards were the rare days when Le Gros' overseers or      older slaves didn't flog him with a bicycle chain or branches      from a cacao tree.       Cocoa beans come from pods on the cacao tree. To get the      400 or so beans it takes to make a pound of chocolate, the      boys who work on Ivory Coast's cocoa farms cut pods from the      trees, slice them open, scoop out the beans, spread them in      baskets or on mats and cover them to ferment. They they      uncover the beans, put them in the sun to dry, bag them and      load them onto trucks to begin the long journey to America or      Europe.       Aly said he doesn't know what the beans from the cacao tree      taste like after they've been processed and blended with      sugar, milk and other ingredients. That happens far away from      the farm where he worked, in places such as Hershey, Pa.,      Milwaukee and San Francisco.       ``I don't know what chocolate is,'' said Aly. The chocolate      chain Americans spend $13 billion a year on chocolate, but      most of them are as ignorant of where it comes from as the      boys who harvest cocoa beans are about where their beans go.       More cocoa beans come from Ivory Coast than from anyplace      else in the world. The country's beans are prized for their      quality and abundance, and in the first three months of this      year, more than 47,300 tons of them were shipped to the      United States through Philadelphia and Brooklyn, N.Y.,      according to the Port Import Export Reporting Service. At      other times of the year, Ivory Coast cocoa beans are      delivered to Camden, N.J., Norfolk, Va., and San Francisco.       From the ports, the beans are shipped to cocoa processors.      America's biggest are ADM Cocoa in Milwaukee, a subsidiary of      Decatur, Ill.-based Archer Daniels Midland; Barry Callebaut,      which has its headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland;      Minneapolis-based Cargill; and Nestle USA of Glendale,      Calif., a subsidiary of the Swiss food giant.       But by the time the beans reach the processors, those      picked by slaves and those harvested by free field hands have      been jumbled together in warehouses, ships, trucks and rail      cars. By the time they reach consumers in America or Europe,      free beans and slave beans are so thoroughly blended that      there is no way to know which chocolate products taste of      slavery and which do not.       Even the Chocolate Manufacturers Association, a trade group      for American chocolate makers, acknowledges that slaves are      harvesting cocoa on some Ivory Coast farms.       And a 1998 report from UNICEF, the United Nations      Children's Fund, concluded that some Ivory Coast farmers use      enslaved children, many of them from the poorer neighboring      countries of Mali, Burkina Faso, Benin and Togo. A report by      the Geneva, Switzerland-based International Labor      Organization, released June 15, found that trafficking in      children is widespread in West Africa.                  some of the bags were taller than me       Aly Diabate and 18 other boys labored on a 494-acre farm,      very large by Ivory Coast standards, in the southwestern part      of the country. Their days began when the sun rose, which at      this time of year in Ivory Coast is a few minutes after 6      a.m. They finished work about 6:30 in the evening, just      before nightfall, trudging home to a dinner of burned      bananas. A treat would be yams seasoned with saltwater      ``gravy.''       After dinner, the boys were ordered into a 24-by-20-foot      room, where they slept on wooden planks. The window was      covered with hardened mud except for a baseball-size hole      to let some air in. ``Once we entered the room, nobody was      allowed to go out,'' said Mamadou Traore, a thin, frail      youth with serious brown eyes who is 19 now. ``Le Gros      gave us cans to urinate. He locked the door and kept the      key.''       ``We didn't cry, we didn't scream,'' said Aly. ``We though      we had been sold, but we weren't sure.'' The boys became sure      one day when Le Gros walked up to Mamadou and ordered him to      work harder. ``I bought each of you for 25,000 francs''      (about $35), the farmer said, according to Mamadou. ``So you      have to work harder to reimburse me.''       Aly was barely 4 feet tall when he was sold into slavery,      and he had a hard time carrying the heavy bags of cocoa      beans. ``Some of the bags were taller than me,'' he said.      ``It took two people to put the bag on my head. And when you      didn't hurry, you were beaten.'' You can still see the faint      scars on his back, right shoulder and left arm. ``They said      he wasn't working very hard,'' said Mamadou.       ``The beatings were a part of my life,'' Aly said.      ``Anytime they loaded you with bags and you fell while      carrying them, nobody helped you. Instead, they beat you and      beat you until you picked it up again.       Le Gros, whose name is Lenikpo Yeo, denied that he paid for      the boys who worked for him, although Ivory Coast farmers      often     pay a ``finder's fee'' to someone who delivers workers to      them. He also denied that the boys were underfed, locked up      at night or forced to work more than 12 hours a day without      breaks. He said they were treated well, and that he paid for      their medical treatment. ``When I go hunting, when I get a      kill, I divide it in half--one for my family and the other      for them. Even if I kill a gazelle, the workers come and      share it.''       He denied beating any of the boys. ``I've never, ever laid      hands on any one of my workers,'' Le Gros said. ``Maybe I      called them bad words if I was angry. That's the worst I      did.'' Le Gros said a Malian overseer beat one boy who had      run away, but he said he himself did not order any beatings.                             a boy escapes       One day early last year, a boy named Oumar Kone was caught      trying to escape. One of Le Gros' overseers beat him, said      the other boys and local authorities. A few days later, Oumar      ran away again, and this time he escaped. He told elders in      the local Malian immigrant community what was happening on Le      Gros' farm. They called Abdoulaye Macko, who was then the      Malian consul general in Bouake, a town north of Daloa, in      the heart of Ivory Coasts's cocoa- and coffee-growing region.      Macko went to the farm with several police officers, and he      found the 19 boys and young men there. Aly, the youngest, was      13. The oldest was 21.       ``They were tired, slim, they were not smiling.'' Macko      said. ``Except one child was not there. This one, his face      showed what was happening. He was sick; he had (excrement) in      his pants. He was lying on the ground, covered with cacao      leaves because they were sure he was dying. He was almost      dead. . . . He had been severely beaten.''       According to medical records, other boys had healed scars      as well as open, infected wounds all over their bodies.      Police freed the boys, and a few days later the Malian      consulate in Bouake sent them all home to their villages in      Mali. The sick boy was treated at a local hospital, and then      he was sent home, too.       Le Gros was charged with assault against children and      suppressing the liberty of people. The latter crime carries a      five- to 10-year prison sentence and a hefty fine, said      Daleba Rouba, attorney general for the region. ``In Ivorian      law, and adult who orders a minor to hit and hurt somebody is      automatically responsible as if he has committed the act,''      said Rouba. ``Whether or not Le Gros did the beatings himself      or ordered somebody, he is liable.'' Le Gros spent 24 days in      jail, and today he is a free man pending a court hearing that      is scheduled for Thursday.       He said the case against Le Gros is weak because the      witnesses against him have all been sent back to Mali. ``If      the Malian authorizes are willing to cooperate, if they can      bring two or three of the children back as witnesses, my case      will be stronger,'' Rouba said. Mamadou Diarra, the Malian      consul general in Bouake, said he would look into the matter.                           official responses       Child trafficking experts say inadequate legislation,      ignorance of the law, poor law enforcement, porous borders,      police corruption and a shortage of resources help perpetuate      the problem of child slavery in Ivory Coast. Only 12      convicted slave traders are serving time in Ivorian prisons.      Another eight, convicted in absentia, are on the lam.       Ivorian officials have found scores of enslaved children      from Mali and Burkina Faso and sent them home, and they have      asked the International Labor Organization, a global workers'      rights agency, to help them conduct a child-labor survey      that's expected to be completed this year. But they continue      to blame the problem on immigrant farmers from Mali and on      world cocoa prices that have fallen almost 24 percent since      1996, from 67 cents a pound to 51 cents, forcing impoverished      farmers to use the cheapest labor they can find.       Ivory Coast Agriculture Minister Alfonse Douaty calls child      slavery a marginal ``clandestine phenomenon'' that exists on      only a handful of the country's more than 600,000 cocoa and      coffee farms. ``Those who do this are hidden, well hidden,''      said Douaty. He said his government is clamping down on child      traffickers by beefing up border patrols and law enforcement,      and running education campaigns to boost awareness of anti-     slavery laws and efforts.       Douaty said child labor is Ivory Coast should not be called      slavery, because the word conjures up images of chains and      whips. He prefers the term ``indentured labor.''       Ivory Coast authorities ordered Le Gros to pay Aly and the      other boys a total of 4.3 million African Financial Community      francs (about $6,150) for their time as indentured laborers.      Aly got 125,000 francs (about $180) for the 18 months he      worked on the cocoa farm.       Aly bought himself the very thing the trader who enslaved      him promised: a bicycle. It has a light, a yellow horn and      colorful bottle caps in the spokes. he rides it everywhere.  I cannot read the entire article, but I will just read a few sentences, where it indicates 43 percent of the world's cocoa beans come from small scattered farms in poor West African countries like Ivory Coast where harvesting of the crop is done by boys who were sold or tricked into slavery. They talk about 15,000 children ages 9 to 12 sold into forced labor and that it takes 400 or so beans to make one pound of chocolate. The boys who pick these beans do not know what chocolate tastes like because they never have a chance to eat the final product.  The beans that they harvest go to places like Hershey, Pennsylvania; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; and San Francisco. America's biggest users of these beans are ADM Cocoa in Milwaukee, a subsidiary of Illinois-based Archer Daniels Midland; Barry Callebaut, which has its headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland; Minneapolis-based Cargill; and Nestle USA of Glendale, California, a subsidiary of the Swiss food giant.  It talks about these boys being beaten and held, being tired, slim with no smiles, and many boys having healed scars as well as open infected wounds all over their bodies. It talks about the reasons that there is no law enforcement in the countries which are the suppliers. And it talks about the amount of money being made by the firms that use this kind of indentured servitude.  I think $250,000 out of a multibillion-dollar budget is almost nothing to ask to have proper labeling of a product. If we can have happy faces on carpets that come from the Indian subcontinent, we can certainly have proper labeling of chocolate products that come into this country from places like Ivory Coast. I really want to thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel), who is a member of the Committee on International Relations, for bringing this issue to us.  It is always difficult for us to get labeling legislation passed by this subcommittee and full committee, but, my goodness, do we not have a moral responsibility to do this? It is within budget, what he is asking to do. It is asking FDA to meet not only its scientific responsibilities to this country but its moral responsibilities.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Engel amendment and commend the gentleman for bringing this again to the House floor so the American people can understand what is going on.
