 He has made some modifications. We are still hearing about some more concerns. I have expressed two of those already. I would like to express another concern that I have heard.  Yes, it preserves jobs in America if there is not outsourcing of service jobs that are involved. But this is a legitimate concern on our side: The extent to which there might be retaliation by countries that outsource some things to the United States. That goes on as well. We want to make sure if we are losing jobs, we don't have a greater loss of jobs in retaliation for Americans who are already employed by a company outside the United States which is using the services of American people in America.  These are concerns that need to be addressed. These are things that will be brought out in debate, and it may be possible to work on continuing modifications of the Dodd amendment so that hopefully we can get it passed without a great deal of opposition.  At this point, we are not prepared to vote.
