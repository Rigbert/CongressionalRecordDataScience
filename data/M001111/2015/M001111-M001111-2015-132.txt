 President, today I express my deep gratitude and appreciation for the National Association of Letter Carriers, especially its members in my home State of Washington.  On Saturday, May 9, letter carriers throughout Washington State will join their colleagues from around the country for their Stamp Out Hunger food drive, an annual event that has provided needed meals to so many. In more than 10,000 cities and towns across our country, letter carriers use our mail delivery network to collect donated food.  The food drive, now in its 23rd year, is a shining example of their commitment to our communities. In addition to the excellent service they provide as part of their daily work, these dedicated men and women will be picking up donated food on a Saturday to deliver to food banks and pantries in their communities. In 2010, the food drive reached an amazing milestone as it surpassed the 1-billion-pound mark for collections.  I thank the men and women of the National Association of Letter Carriers for their hard work and commitment to their communities, and I wish them the best with this year's Stamp Out Hunger food drive.                          ____________________
