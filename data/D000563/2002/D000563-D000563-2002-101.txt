GRAMM. Let me finish my point. Only 434 of them went through the removal process, and that process takes as long as 18 months, and many of them remained on the payroll. That is the first point.  The second point, the Senator talks about INS. In 1990, at the Honolulu Airport, the Immigration and Naturalization Service was worried about a surge in flights and the long lines, and they wanted to hire more INS agents to enforce the law.  The American Federation of Government Employees filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board saying, under their contract, INS could not hire more agents without renegotiating its union contract. Guess what. The National Labor Relations Board ruled in favor of the union, prohibiting the people from being hired.  The Senator talks about a vote. I ask unanimous consent that on Friday morning at 10 o'clock, we have an up-or-down vote on the substitute I have offered with Senator Miller. That way, there will be no doubt about the fact we are ready to bring it to a vote at that point. We would like an up-or-down vote on our amendment at 10 o'clock.
