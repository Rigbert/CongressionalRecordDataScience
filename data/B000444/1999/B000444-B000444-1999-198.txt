  Senator Hatfield adduces some excellent arguments in favor of ratification, which I commend to my colleagues. But I especially want recommend his conclusion, which summarizes our situation with elegant precision:       It is clear to me that ratifying this Treaty would be in      the national interest. And it is equally clear that Senators      have a responsibility to the world, the nation and their      constituents to put partisan politics aside and allow the      Senate to consider this Treaty.  Senators, that says it all.                               Exhibit 1       Statement By Senator mark O. Hatfield on CTBT Ratification       The time has come for Senate action on CTBT ratification.      Political leaders the world over have recognized that the      proliferation of nuclear weapons poses the gravest threat to      global peace and stability, a threat that is likely to      continue well into the next century. Ratification of the 1996      Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty by the United States      and its early entry into force would significantly reduce the      chances of new states developing advanced nuclear weapons and      would strengthen the global nuclear non-proliferation regime      for the twenty-first century. Just as the United States led      the international community nearly three years ago by being      the first to sign the CTB Treaty, which has now been signed      by 152 nations, the Senate now has a similar opportunity and      responsibility to demonstrate U.S. leadership by ratifying      it.       The Treaty enhances U.S. national security and is popular      among the American people. Recent bipartisan polling data      indicates that support for the Treaty within the United      States is strong, consistent, and across the board. It is      currently viewed favorably by 82% of the public, nearly the      highest level of support in four decades of polling. Only six      percentage points separate Democratic and Republican voters,      and there is no discernible gender gap on this issue. This      confirms the traditional bipartisan nature of support for the      CTBT, which dates back four decades to President's      Eisenhower's initiation of test ban negotiations and was      reaffirmed by passage in 1992 of the Exon-Hatifield-Mitchell      legislation on a testing moratorium.       It is clear to me that ratifying this Treaty would be in      the national interest. And it is equally clear that Senators      have a responsibility to the world, the nation and their      constituents to put partisan politics aside and allow the      Senate to consider this Treaty.
