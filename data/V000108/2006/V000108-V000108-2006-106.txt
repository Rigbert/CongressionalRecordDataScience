Chairman, I rise today in support of Representative Brown's amendment to increase funding for the International Trade Administration's Office of China Compliance (OCC) by $3 million in FY 2007. I thank the gentleman for the opportunity to speak, although I wish the circumstances of my appearance here were different. Simply put, full and effective enforcement of our trade laws is not just the right thing to do; it has become an absolute imperative as we see the growing challenges facing American manufacturers. Will Rogers used to say, ``Even if you're on the right track, you'll get run over if you just sit there.'' Funding for the Office of China Compliance must be increased to reflect the seriousness of this issue to American workers and the economy as a whole.  I would like to draw the attention of my colleagues to a recent report on NPR's Marketplace that highlighted an ongoing practice by China's textile industry called ``transshipment.'' Last year, the USTR and Chinese Commerce Minister agreed to a 3-year pact limiting China's exports of 34 textile and apparel products to the United States. We now find out that China had no intention of sticking to its end of this bargain. Not 8 months after signing the agreement, China has been warned by Indonesia for its continued manipulation of textile exports, which are sent into Indonesia, slapped with a ``Made in Indonesia'' label, and shipped back to China before making their way into the United States, at levels far greater than what both countries agreed upon. These garments are not sent to Indonesia for anything other than this valuable label. According to Indonesia's Minister of Industry, Chinese transshipments through Indonesia alone amounted to an estimated $6 billion in 2005. Thus far in 2006, these illegal shipments are up 79 percent over last year. It is crucial that we stand up against these unscrupulous Chinese trade practices and invest in our efforts to monitor those who skirt international trade laws.  China continues to violate international trade laws, basic human rights, and its World Trade Organization commitments. While we watch imports from China streaming into our ports and shipping hubs, we are left with few options to defend our Nation's manufacturing industries and local jobs. However, we have trade remedies to mitigate this. It is time for the Bush administration to use the funds we are providing and enforce our trade laws. I am offended by the lack of action by this administration with the tools it has had available. We know that goods from China are coming into this country illegally, many of which were made with the help of government subsidies. We know that those imports are hurting U.S. companies and workers. We know that China's disregard for international trade laws only encourages more companies to ship their jobs overseas. This administration must enforce our laws relative to China.  Mr. Chairman, I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment. Increased funding for the Office of China Compliance will increase our ability to monitor Chinese trade and help to stem the tide of illegal imports. American workers and firms are depending on us to consider the real impact of illegal Chinese trade: more outsourcing of American jobs and a weakened American economy. Once again, I thank the gentleman for the opportunity to speak today, and I urge my colleagues to support this critical amendment.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Page E1332]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]SCIENCE, STATE, JUSTICE, COMMERCE, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS                                ACT, 2007                                 ______                                                                speech of                        HON.
