 President, all who have been voting to change the estate tax provisions, listen to what is wrong with his amendment. Every one of you who wants to tax people in the estates that we believe should not be taxed will vote against his amendment. His amendment seems too good to be true. It is too good to be true. It strikes repeal and adds a $100 million unified credit. That ought to be enticing to anybody, even anybody who is a Republican.  But remember, in our bill, when the estate tax is done away with, the capital gains tax is applied to gains above a very low extended-up basis for everybody. This bill before the Senate allows an extended-up basis to $100 million. There would be no capital gains applied to any of the growth. So you are ignoring a principle that we want all money to be taxed at least once, by capital gains or by income tax.  I ask that Members not let $100 million of growth in an estate not be allowed to be taxed at least once.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). All time has expired.  The question is on agreeing to the Feingold amendment No. 726.  The clerk will call the roll.  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.
