 Very frankly, the person who rejected the premise that this matter was over was Robert Mueller in a relatively short press conference in which he answered no questions, but he clearly demonstrated that he thought Mr. Barr misrepresented the fact that this was over. In fact, he said:       If we thought the President had not done anything wrong and      we were convinced of that, we would have said so. We did not      say so.  Now, having said that, this is not related to impeachment. This is related to the Congress' authority, under the Constitution of the United States, to receive information from the executive on behalf of the American people.  Now, if Mr. Barr believes that the information requested need not be submitted, then he had nothing to fear, because what we are seeking is a court ruling, an independent body's ruling as to whether or not he ought to be held in contempt and directed by a court to provide the information to the Congress of the United States, acting pursuant to its constitutional duty.  Madam Speaker, I will tell my friend that it is a sad day when the Republicans and Democrats do not stand together on behalf of not only this institution's constitutional authority, but responsibility to get the information it needs both with respect to, as, again, Mr. Mueller pointed out, the very serious issue of the Russians trying to affect our democracy and our elections.  There is no dispute of that fact. In fact, nine Russians were indicted by the Mueller special counsel for exactly that purpose.                              {time}  1100  Now, this resolution to which the gentleman refers authorizes the Judiciary Committee to pursue civil action to seek enforcement in Federal court of its subpoenas to Attorney General Barr and former White House Counsel McGahn, who is no longer a Federal employee. It also authorizes House committees that have issued subpoenas as part of their oversight and investigation responsibilities. Let me emphasize that: Investigation responsibilities, oversight. That is part of the constitutional responsibility of the Congress of the United States, which, by the way, your party pursued extraordinarily vigorously over the last 8 years of the Obama administration, and, very frankly, in previous administrations.  We are seeking civil enforcement to have a determination as to whether or not Attorney General Barr, Mr. McGahn, and indeed others, who have refused to comply with constitutionally sanctioned requests by the Congress of the United States for information on behalf of the American people. The President of the United States, like Barr, said it is over.  Mr. Mueller says it is not over. Mr. Mueller says he did not have the authority pursuant to Justice policy to go further, but he pointed out that there are other bodies that have the authority and responsibility to do so. Who is that? Us, the Congress of the United States.  Now, one of the problems that we are having is that the President has instructed almost all of government not to respond to the Congress of the United States, not to answer questions, not to testify, not to appear. I have called that perhaps the biggest coverup in the history of any President whohas, in effect, given a blanket suggestion, and in some cases order, that people ought not to testify. He said there is no reason to go any further. He has made that decision. And especially in Congress where it is very partisan, obviously very partisan. We did think this is not partisan. This is our responsibility to the American people.  By refusing to cooperate with Congress, the Trump administration has engaged in a refusal to allow the Congress to exercise its responsibility, and therefore, we are going to continue to pursue the facts on behalf of the American people. And that is what this is about. You will note that we have not sought criminal contempt. We have, however, found it to be untenable, unacceptable to have an administration, any administration, Republican or Democrat, tell the Congress whether it is a Republican Congress or a Democratic Congress that it will not respond to requests for information, to subpoenas to testify, and for other information that Congress needs. So that is what we are going to do.
