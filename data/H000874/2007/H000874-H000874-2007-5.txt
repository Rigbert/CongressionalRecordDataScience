 The holiday season is traditionally a season of giving. Today I would like to take just a few minutes to recognize the vital contributions of a man and his family who have continually given his time, his energy and his efforts to the residents of St. Mary's County and to southern Maryland, which I am honored to represent in this body, my dear and great friend Dr. Vinod K. Shah, affectionately known as Vinnie or V.K.NOTICEIf the 110th Congress, 1st Session, adjourns sine die on or before December 21, 2007, a final issue of the Congressional Record for the 110th Congress, 1st Session, will be published on Friday, December 28, 2007, in order to permit Members to revise and extend their remarks.All material for insertion must be signed by the Member and delivered to the respective offices of the Official Reporters of Debates (Room HT-60 or S-123 of the Capitol), Monday through Friday, between the hours of 10:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. through Thursday, December 27.

ROBERT A. BRADY, Chairman. =========================== NOTE ===========================     On Page H16645, December 18, 2007, the following appeared: The NOTICE box on printed showing the 109th Congress, 1st Session.    The online version should be corrected to read: The NOTICE box for the 110th Congress, 1st Session. ========================= END NOTE =========================     Every so often an individual comes along who leaves an indelible mark on his or her community and the people around them. In southern Maryland, two such individuals are Dr. Shah and his wife, Dr. Shah. Her name is Ila. Together they established their medical practice in southern Maryland roughly 30 years ago when the citizens there were greatly in need of medical services.  We had some good doctors, but we needed more. Since then Vinnie and Ila have built a medical practice that has literally changed the face of health care in our region, expanding to become the largest private medical practice in the State of Maryland.  Dr. Shah's service and the service of his family to southern Maryland as well as our Nation's dependence on foreign-born doctors, particularly in rural America, was recounted in a front-page story in the Washington Post on December 7, 2007.  As Richard Martin, who was the head of St. Mary's County Hospital when Dr. Shah arrived, told the Post, and I quote, ``It was just like miracle workers had walked in. I told them, `You are the answer to my prayers.' ''  The Shahs epitomize family values. Vinod and Ila recruited family and friends, including Vinod's eight siblings, each of whom is a doctor or is married to one.  When I refer to the Shah family, let me just recite their names, all family, brothers or sisters, sons or daughters, giving service in this country to our people:  Dr. Vinod Shah.  His wife, Dr. Ila Shah.  Dr. Mamesh P. Shah.  Dr. Anil K. Shah.  Dr. Amish Shah, Dr. Shah's son.  Dr. Deepak K. Shah.  Dr. Arpana Shah, his daughter-in-law.  Dr. Umed K. Shah.  Dr. Nayan Shah.  Dr. Atul Shah.  Dr. Avani Shah.  Dr. Dhiren Shah.  Dr. Beena Shah.  Dr. Jyoti D. Shah.  It is an amazing list, and it doesn't end there, with his daughter doing her residency and her husband doing his residency. The Shahs epitomize family values. As I said, they are an extraordinary family.  Today, Shah Associates is a growing practice that includes 65 physicians in 10 locations, and which recently announced that it will partner with specialists from Georgetown University Hospital and the Washington Hospital Center in a planned 32,000 square-foot addition to his medical center.  Leslie Miller, who heads the cardiac program at both hospitals, told the Washington Post, referring to Shah Associates, ``They are a model of health care of the future. These guys, on their own, using their own money, have put together this extraordinary system. We want to extend what they have done.''  Madam Speaker, the manner in which Dr. Shah operates Shah Associates is an accurate reflection of this generous and good man and the values that he and his family hold and demonstrate to all of us daily. This medical practice is truly a family affair, as I have noted, and accepts all those who need care, regardless of their ability to pay. I have heard extraordinary stories from my constituents about the extent to which the Shah family has gone to help them, the care that they have extended.  I have known Dr. Shah for many years. He is my next-door neighbor. He is one of my closest friends. He, his wife, his son, his daughter, his son-in-law and daughter-in-law are all very close.  Without doubt, he is one of the most decent, honorable and honest men that I have ever met. His wife, Ila, reflects that same character, as do his children, their spouses and his extended family, his brothers and sisters, brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law. He is not only my friend and my neighbor, but he is a friend and neighbor to the entire community in southern Maryland. He has touched countless lives over the years, and the difference he has made, that his family have made, that Shah Associates have made, cannot be overstated.  Let me say, too, that Dr. Shah's success is a quintessential American story in which a husband and wife, both immigrants, both physicians, come to our Nation and through hard work, intelligence, merit and reputation become, quite literally, the backbone of the community. Gandhi once remarked, ``Be the change you want to see in the world.''  Vinod Shah, Ila Shah and their family have lived this philosophy to the fullest. They saw a dire need and, rather than turn their back or leave the problem to someone else, they embraced a great challenge and have made an immeasurable, positive, extraordinary contribution. They faced discrimination, rejection and challenge.  Their positive, unflagging, and extraordinary talented effort has resulted in their being embraced by their community, which they have served so well. They brought hope and care and service, and they have enriched the lives of all whom they have touched.  I want to thank Vinod and Ila as well as all the physicians and providers at Shah Associates for the incredible service that they have delivered to residents of St. Mary's County and to the entire southern Maryland area, and, indeed, a broader reach as well.  Dr. Vinod Shah is the vice president of the Association of Physicians of Indian Origin. I presume, in a short period of time, he will be their leader. He will be an extraordinary representative of an extraordinary group of people who, like so many immigrants before them, have responded to America's welcome and have made such an extraordinary difference. We are all the better and healthier for it.                [From washingtonpost.com, Dec. 7, 2007]   Born in India, Transforming Rural MD.--Extended Family of Medical                   Specialists Helps St. Mary's Thrive                           (By Jenna Johnson)       St. Mary's County was once a place where no doctor wanted      to settle. In the 1970s, the county hospital used decades-old      equipment, struggled to make payroll and had no full-time      specialists--not even an obstetrician, although more than 600      babies were born there each year.       Then came Vinod K. and Ila Shah, Bombay-educated and D.C.-     trained husband-and-wife doctors who were eager to open a      practice in the rural area. They had heard about St. Mary's      from Vinod's younger brother and were enticed by the      potential impact that even a small practice could have there.       ``It was just like miracle workers walked in,'' said      Richard Martin, 92, who was then head of the hospital. ``I      told them, `You are the answer to my prayers.' ''       The couple was soon joined by Vinod's younger brother, Umed      K. Shah, a gastroenterologist. Next came two family friends.      A few years later, another brother arrived, cardiologist Anil      K. Shah, with his wife, Beena Shah, a neurologist.       In time, Vinod and Ila Shah recruited more friends and      family, including the rest of Vinod's eight siblings, each of      whom is a doctor or is married to one. They built the largest      private specialty practice in Southern Maryland, Shah      Associates, which has treated about 90,000 of St. Mary's      110,000 residents.       For many years, foreign-born doctors have been the unlikely      medical backbone of rural America. In the 1970s, the United      States actively recruited them, promoting the opportunities      available in remote areas avoided by many U.S.-born      physicians. Then, starting in the 1990s, a visa waiver      program promised to fast-track doctors to a green card if      they worked in a rural area for at least three years.       Today, at least 23 percent of practicing doctors in the      United States attended a foreign medical school, and almost      all of those practitioners were born overseas. But recent      changes in visa policy have had the unintended consequence of      slowing the flow of foreign-born doctors to rural areas, a      trend that Shah is, in small ways, resisting.       Two generations of Shah doctors see patients who span      several generations of Southern Maryland families. ``We come      here for everything,'' Navy retiree Paul Hailor said at their      main office in Hollywood, Md. ``My fiancee is down the hall      waiting for a pulmonary appointment. Kids come here for MRIs,      CAT scans.''       Nurses and patients have a system for keeping all of the      Shahs straight. They use initials for the four Shah brothers:      Dr. V.K. the cardiologist; Dr. U.K. the gastroenterologist;      Dr. D.K. the child psychiatrist; and Dr. A.K., another      cardiologist. The other Shahs, especially the four with      names beginning with `A,' often go by their first name:      Dr. Amish the cardiologist, also V.K.'s son; his wife, Dr.      Arpana the dermatologist; Dr. Beena the neurologist; Dr.      Jyoti the sleep specialist.       ``Every once in a while, we get someone calling in wanting      to talk to `Dr. Shah,' '' said Betsy Warren, a registered      nurse who has worked for Shah Associates for 16 years. ``You      ask them, `Which Dr. Shah?' And they say, `The one with dark      hair.' ''       To Southern Maryland, the Shah family has imported      distinctive aspects of Indian culture: colorful saris, lavish      parties for hundreds stocked with huge trays of vegetarian     Indian food and recitals featuring classical Indian dances.       Family members say it took years to earn the trust of the      community, but once they did, the practice quickly grew. Some      local doctors who once viewed the Shahs as competition      eventually joined the practice.       Each time the nearby Patuxent River Naval Base added      employees, the practice received a wave of patients. The      practice's offices, where employees had once been asked to      park in front so business would appear brisk, were soon      overflowing.       In 1995, V.K. Shah found an empty lot on Route 235 in      Hollywood. Two years later, he opened the Philip J. Bean      Medical Center, dedicating it to a late local physician who      he said ``delivered half the county.''       ``We said `Let's name it after someone who means something      to this community,' '' Shah said. ``I think people should      feel good about this place--it should mean something to      them.''       But the facility that felt like a palace then is already      too small, and the practice with 65 physicians in 10      locations, is scrambling to recruit more doctors. ``Demand is      so high across the board,'' said Shah, 66. ``I can't      retire.''       Plans were announced last week for a 32,000-square-foot      addition to the medical center. The extra space will allow      specialists from Georgetown University Hospital and      Washington Hospital Center to practice there as part of a new      partnership.       Because Shah Associates provides so much of the medical      care in the region, the partnership will allow the      universities to study health patterns over generations, said      Leslie Miller, head of the cardiac program at both hospitals.       Shah Associates has compiled its patients' medical records      into a database that allows it to track the medical histories      of families and look for early warning signs in younger      generations. Such locally comprehensive databases might one      day help researchers better understand such hereditary      conditions as heart problems, he said.       ``They are a model of the health care of the future,''      Miller said. ``These guys, on their own, using their own      money, have put together this extraordinary system. . . . We      want to extend what they have done.''       But in many areas that are more rural than Southern      Maryland, as in many inner cities, the gap between medical      needs and resources remains great, despite government      efforts.       In 1994, Congress made foreign doctors who train in the      United States while holding a so-called J-1 visa eligible to      apply for a green card if they practiced for at least three      years in underserved areas. The program, which exempts J-1      holders from a required return home for two years after their      training is complete, has placed thousands of doctors in      inner-city and rural communities, as well as in prisons.       They continue to flood the United States with residency      applications, but each year the program receives fewer      applications and fills fewer spots. Last year, only 900 of      the 1,620 available waivers were issued.       Rural health experts attribute much of that drop to the      popularity of another visa, the H-1B, which allows U.S.      companies to temporarily sponsor highly skilled foreign      workers in such fields as medicine, architecture and science.       In 2000, to make more H-1B visas available for technology      companies, Congress exempted research institutions and      universities, including their hospitals, from a cap on the      hard-to-get visas. The popularity of the J-1 waiver program      plummeted, and the pipeline that once channeled doctors to      underserved areas narrowed.       Today, no medical facilities in Southern Maryland are      eligible to sponsor physicians under the J-1 waiver program.      A majority of the nearly 30 Maryland primary medical care      centers designated as having a specialist shortage are in      Baltimore. The District has 13 sites, including the D.C.      jail. Virginia has nearly 120, two of which are in the      Washington area.       With baby boomers beginning to retire, the American Medical      Association says, the country could be short as many as      200,000 doctors before 2020--a shortage that is expected to      hurt already-underserved areas the most.       V.K. Shah, who is also vice president of the American      Association of Physicians of Indian Origin, said a shortage      could be prevented by drastically increasing the number of      medical schools in the United Sates, relying more on nurses      and nurse practitioners or by allowing more qualified      international medical graduates to practice in the United      States.       But to practice, foreign doctors must first complete      training in a U.S. residency program, for which spots are      scarce. Last year, 46 percent of foreign applicants received      residencies, compared with 93 percent of American graduates,      according to the National Resident Match Program, which      facilitates the application process for more than 1,000 U.S.      institutions.       Each year, Shah Associates hosts a handful of graduates      from foreign medical schools, encouraging them to seek      opportunities beyond big cities. This summer, four recent      graduates of Mumbai medical schools traveled to Southern      Maryland on tourist visas for an unpaid crash course in      American medicine.       The graduates watched as the Shahs cracked jokes with their      patients, reassured them about upcoming operations and gently      recommended diet changes. Mitesh Lotia, 24, one of the      graduates, said that the one-on-one interaction held great      appeal.       ``In India, we would see 100, 150 patients a day,'' he      said. ``There was no time to get to know patients. I want to      practice here. I'll go anywhere.''                          ____________________
