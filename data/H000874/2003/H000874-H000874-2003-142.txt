Speaker, reclaiming my time, I want the gentleman to know as the representative of the original adopters of that extraordinary document who were then later pleased to welcome to our ranks those who serve under that Constitution our distinguished citizens from Texas and distinguished citizens that California. And I had the opportunity of hearing the majority leader speak today at a ceremony at the National Archives atwhich we unveiled the newly ensconced and protected charters of freedom, the Constitution of the United States preceded by the Declaration of Independence and followed closely by the Bill of Rights, those three extraordinary documents which stand as probably the most powerful statements of a free people and of liberty and justice and a government of laws and not of men. They will be preserved from the elements as they have been preserved from those who would undermine their principles and their reality.  I want to congratulate the leader for his comments today at that ceremony.
