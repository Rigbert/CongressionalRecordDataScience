Mr. Speaker, it is with great sadness that I rise today to honor the passing of a deeply committed human rights activist and friend, Mr. Harry Wu. Harry is survived by his son, Harrison, and his former wife, Ching Lee. I offer my sincerest condolences to his family. Harry is also mourned today by the many friends and colleagues who will remember him as a tireless and determined advocate for freedom and justice.   Harry was born into a comfortable life in Shanghai, but this life was turned upside down when the Communist Party came to power in 1949. His father lost his job and his family's possessions were taken away. In college, Harry made the mistake of criticizing the Soviet Union, and for this mistake he suffered for 19 years in the Laogai--the system of forced labor prison camps used by the Communist Party to control the Chinese people. Harry worked to expose the horrors of the Laogai. Unfortunately, a system of arbitrary detention remains in place in China today, under different names.   During his 19 year detention, Harry endured unimaginable hardship and horror. Surviving such an ordeal is itself a testament to Harry's toughness and tenacity. Harry was driven by this hardship to spend the remainder of his life fighting for the victims of Chinese Communism, exposing its abuses to the world.   After emigrating to the United States, Harry risked his freedom on multiple trips back to China to document forced labor in China's prison camps. In 1995, Harry was caught. I remember that time well, as Ching Lee worked with me and other Members of Congress to call publicly for Harry's release. The Chinese government gave Harry a show trial and then sentenced him to exile. He was never able to go home to China again.   Harry remained undaunted by his exile. He poured his time and energy into his organization, the Laogai Research Foundation, continuing to raise awareness of forced prison labor in China. He published several books about his own ordeal. He published the Black Series, the riveting memoirs of other survivors of the Laogai labor camps. In 2008 he opened the Laogai Museum, documenting human rights abuses in China, both past and present.   Harry was also a passionate voice against China's heinous population control policy--the ``One-Child Policy'' and helped this Congress expose the abuses of forced abortions and sterilizations. Harry saw clearly that the violence used to control the vital instinct of parenthood was a great crime, and a lasting black mark on Chinese history.   Until his death, Harry continued to be the conscience of this Congress. He constantly reminded Members of Congress about the abuses heaped on the Chinese people by China's leaders and predicted that U.S. trade with China would not bring political reform--sadly history has proven him correct.   As a Catholic, he was a staunch advocate for freedom of religion, and spoke out against the persecution of Tibetan Buddhists and Uyghur Muslims in China.   Harry's work lives on today even if he is no longer here with us. Because of his work, the brutal truth about the Laogai saw the light of day. Because of Harry's commitment to the truth, the stories of survivors were not silenced, but were published for the world to see.   When China eventually becomes a free nation, Harry Wu will be lauded as a hero, because he worked so hard, and so long, for freedom and for justice.                            ____________________
