President, I rise today to say a few words about Jules and Helen Rabin who are long-time, respected Vermonters. Marcelle and I are proud to call them our friends. The Rabins exhibit what so many Vermonters have: a sense of what is valuable and important in life. With hard work, dedication, and a great deal of patience, Jules and Helen have built up a successful family bakery, serving the needs of their community. Over the last 20 years they have become masters of their craft. Recently, one of our local newspapers wrote an excellent article about the Rabins and their bakery. I ask that the article be printed in the Record so that all Senators may read about this fine family.  The article follows.   [From the Rutland Herald and the Sunday Times Argus, Mar. 8, 1998]In Search of Sourdough--A Vermont Baker Sets Out to Find--and Make--the                               Perfect Loaf                          (By Kathleen Hentcy)       When you bite into sourdough bread, your teeth meet with a      worthy substance: Crackling hard crust, the bread inside      chewy almost to the point of toughness, a sour tang. And once      you've chewed and swallowed a few times, a satisfaction that      few other breads deliver.       Real bread, for my money or effort, must meet this test.      And it must proudly withstand toasting and slathering with      sweet butter, not in the least smashed, or lessened in its      big-holed texture. It should produce a clean crunch when      bitten, and when chewed, remain substantial food, not melting      into a gooey mash.       Overall, bread must take effort to cut, and time to chew      and digest. It must, truly, be the ``staff of life.''       But buying good sourdough bread can eat up the grocery      budget; the loaves typically cost more than $3 each. Besides,      I find baking bread to be an almost spiritual experience. And      eating fine bread that you made yourself, listening to      friends' compliments, is gratifying.       I've baked bread since my teen years. Some of what I make      is outstanding. Some loaves I give to the sheep.       Lately, I've returned to baking sourdough. Sourdough, made      with only the wild yeasts that choose to set up home in a      culture of water and flour you provide, is wild, unruly      bread, its flavor distinctive to the region where it is made.      You don't know how the bread dough will behave from baking to      baking, since the leavening agent--the sourdough--is very      sensitive to atmospheric conditions and room temperature.      From my experience, I'd say the baker's temperament is      included under ``atmospheric conditions'' and can greatly      influence the outcome.       I've made attempts at sourdough breads before, keeping a      liquid starter in the refrigerator for months. I'd use it for      a while, then forget about it and later find a dried-up mass      that I'd have to throw out, jar and all. But the loaves I      made from those starters never compared to the bread I      found at the local food coop.                        the search gets serious       Last fall, I was bitten by a new ambition: To bake the      ultimate ``peasant bread.'' Sourdough French country bread.      Pain de Campagne. Those lordly loaves with chestnut-brown      crusts that crackle, the trademark large-textured chewy      centers, and the sour tang.       This bread, and all French sourdough, is made using a      doughy sourdough starter rather than a liquid. Once the      starter is prepared and a batch of dough is made up, the      baker takes off about a cup of dough--called levain, from the      old French word for rise, or leaven--to store in the      refrigerator. That piece, allowed to warm to room temperature      and refreshed with flour and water, provides the basis for      the next batch of bread, and so on as long as the baker      doesn't forget to take the levain from subsequent batches.       Can making that bread be difficult enough to warrant a      price of $3 a loaf? If peasants baked these glorious loaves      in wood-fired ovens with no refrigeration for the starter,      surely I ought to be able to figure this out. Look at the      ingredients: flour, salt, water. Some note ``sourdough,''      which, technically, is only more of the first and last      ingredients, flour and water. Adding commercial yeast to      sourdough is sacrilege.       So I got out my bread books, and read about sourdough. I      read magazine stories about sourdough. I bought many loaves      of sourdough made by several different Vermont bakeries. I      made sourdough starter and baked loaves of bread on a baking      stone. I didn't feed it to the sheep, but I didn't give it to      friends, either.       I went back to the books, and finally, to two bakers nearby      who make five wonderful kinds of sourdough. I'll tell you      what I learned up front: good sourdough bread is definitely      worth $3 a loaf. But baking it is worth more.                             in the bakery       In a small building in the backyard of Helen and Jules      Rabin's house, the Rabins continue the tradition of baking      the community bread. Helen pulls large hunks of dough off a      slouching 75-pound mass on the wooden counter. She places      each chunk on a scale and adds enough to make the scale level      out at one and three-quarter pounds, then drops the measured      blob onto the counter, and starts the process anew. Once she      has six or so lumps of dough, she kneads them one by one,      shaping them into slender loaves about eight inches long.      These are ``French white sourdough,'' or batards, the      shorter, fatter version of the popular baguette. In little      more than an hour, she will have weighted and shaped 65      batards.       Helen and Jules have done this work nearly every week, two      days a week, for 20 years. While she mills the grains, mixes      the dough and forms the loaves, he builds the fire that heats      the oven and eventually bakes the bread.       The Rabins began baking bread in 1978, shortly after Jules      was laid off from his job teaching anthropology at Goddard      College in Plainfield. Five years earlier, after visiting      friends who were trying to recreate the lives of 19th-century      peasants in the south of France, the Rabins decided to build      a massive stone wood-fired oven like those that once dotted      the European continent.       The Rabins' oven is large enough to bake 250 loaves a day.      They bake two days a week, producing 500 loaves out of 750      pounds of dough. When they started making sourdough bread,      they had no competition.       ``We had an easy ride when we began--people around here had      not had such bread,'' Jules says. That meant when they      delivered their first loaves, which were dense, unrisen and      hard, people still snapped them up. The taste was good, and      slowly the texture improved.                          A few secrets found       ``It took over five years to develop our loaves,'' Jules      told me during an earlier visit. This gave me great hope.      These people, who routinely make excellent sourdough bread,      had once produced loaves similar to what I started with.       ``Sourdough is very tricky stuff to work with,'' Jules      said, making me feel even better. ``To get even, well-raised      loaves is very difficult with sourdough.''       But did they seek out instruction in books or from other      bakers? No. They figured it out themselves.       ``We set ours elves the challenge to bake without yeast,''      he said.       The Rabins got their ideal for the kind of bread they      wanted from European breads, and Helen once spent a night in      a French bakery, watching. But she received no instructions.       ``We fiddled and mixed to arrive at what we have today,''      Jules said. He credits Helen with all the brain work in the      operation, from building the oven to figuring out how long      the bread should rise.       And so, on a mild March day, I stand inside the bakery,      careful to stay out of the way, and watch, much as I imagine      Helen watched those French bakers many years ago. I'm allowed      questions, but I avoid direct queries regarding the secrets      of sourdough. Not only are the Rabins offering Upland Bakers      for sale, and so have to protect their system, but I want to      figure out at least some of this process for myself.       My time with the Rabins revealed two important lessons. The      first is that baking good sourdough requires time. Let the      levain warm for a few days after refreshing it, and before      mixing the dough. Then, allow the dough to rise for four to      six hours, punch it down and form the loaves, and allow those      to rise for another four to six hours. The variation in      rising times has to do with those atmospheric conditions, and      you will know only by trial and error when to bake at four      hours and when to wait for six.       The other important detail I learned is that sourdough does      not have to be babied like yeasted bread dough. The risen      loaves can be picked up and placed on the baking surface      without worrying about flattening them. Go ahead and slash      the tops deeply, to allow the loaf to expand as the hard      crust develops.       These may sound like trivial details, but on my counter      this morning sit the two best loaves of sourdough I have made      to date. I haven't yet developed quite the sour tang I like,      but the texture and volume of the loaves is beautiful. Toast      and tea this morning was especially pleasing.       And the Rabins ``refreshed'' this lesson for me: Having the      answer as quickly as possible isn't always best. Sometimes      it's the process of looking that is the most fun.                          ____________________
