  Senator Reid and I have said that the goal of all of us should be to reduce the number of unintended pregnancies so that this issue that is being debated does not have to be debated on the floor of the Senate; that this issue should be decided between a women and her doctor, her family and her faith.  I commend Senator Reid for working with me on this very important amendment, and I yield 8 minutes of my remaining time to Senator Reid.
