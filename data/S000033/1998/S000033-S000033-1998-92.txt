 Chairman, I appreciate the differences that we have in the Northeast Dairy Compact, but it is really not appropriate to call it un-American. In fact, it is the essence of what America is about.  Six States at the grassroots level, people came together and they went to their legislatures and they went to their governors and they came forward to do what they thought was best for the people in their own State.  So I understand the gentleman's differences, but he should not refer to it as un-American. It is democracy at work.
