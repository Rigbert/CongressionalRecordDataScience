Chairman, reclaiming my time, I understand the gentleman's perspective, but my point is, no other employees have that prescription on the purchase of their health insurance. Now, employers, the gentleman is correct, may choose a limited policy, I understand that, and the employee may have the choice of only one policy; I understand that. That is the compensation package available to them. Fortunately, in my opinion, for Federal employees, their compensation package is broader as it relates to Federal employee health benefits.  The gentleman is making a distinction between all other employees and Federal employees and, inevitably, because of the gentleman's premise that the premium is being paid by taxpayer dollars as opposed to Federal employee dollars.
