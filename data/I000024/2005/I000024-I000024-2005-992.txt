President, it is my understanding the regular order is the amendment offered by the Senator from Indiana. He has agreed to set his amendment aside for the consideration of other amendments as they come to the floor, with the understanding he will regain the floor after those amendments are considered and action taken, if action is taken.  We do have an amendment from the chairman of the Subcommittee on Transportation, Senator Bond, who has worked tirelessly for years on this bill. I am sure he wants to offer it at this time.
