Speaker, on September 25, 2013, I was absent from the House and missed rollcall votes 484 and 485.   Had I been present for rollcall vote 484, on the motion to suspend the rules and pass H.R. 1961, to amend title 46, United States Code, to extend the exemption from the fire-retardant materials construction requirement for vessels operating within the Boundary Line, I would have voted ``yes.''   Had I been present for rollcall vote 485, on the motion to suspend the rules and agree to H. Res. 354, providing for the concurrence by the House in the Senate amendment to H.R. 527, with an amendment, I would have voted ``yes.''                          ____________________
