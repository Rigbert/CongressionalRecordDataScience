These two high school students both placed in the top 12 finishers in this country's highest precollegiate math competition, the U.S. Mathematical Olympiad, which took place in May. In the 34-year history of the Olympiad, this is the first time any Vermonter has made it this far and this year my state had two students accomplish this incredible achievement.  Colin and David, at the ages of 18 and 16 respectively, have been preparing to compete at this level of mathematical competition their entire educational careers. They have achieved this goal through their own hard work and perseverance, and also through the support of their parents and teachers. David benefited from being home-schooled by his parents. The Vermont State Math Coalition identified Colin in the first grade, and he began tutoring outside of the classroom by engineers and physicists at IBM. Three years ago, he began taking high-level math classes at the University of Vermont.  Both students have also benefited from the dedication of Anthony Trono, who retired from teaching at Burlington High School in 1992, but has played a key role in training Vermont's talented math students. Anthony directs the Governor's Institute in Mathematical Sciences, a week-long residential program for students held every year at the University of Vermont that both Colin and David attended. Anthony also runs the Vermont State Mathematics Coalition Talent Search. He will retire this year and Colin and David's success this year is a testament to the many years he has invested in Vermont's students.  This month, Colin will compete on a six-student team which will represent the U.S. in the 49th annual International Math Olympiad. In the fall, both Colin and David will attend the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. I congratulate them and their families on their accomplishments and I wishthem the best of luck in what I am sure will be bright futures.  Madam President, I ask to have an article from the Burlington Free Press detailing their accomplishments be printed in the Record.  The material follows:Two Reach Apex in Math Competition, Essex, Rupert Teens Among Nation's                                   Best                             (By Matt Ryan)       Six congruent circles are arranged inside a larger circle      so that each small circle is tangent to two other small      circles and is tangent to the large circle. The radius of the      large circle is 2007 centimeters. Find the radius of the      small circles.       For Colin Sandon of Essex and David Rolnick of Rupert, this      problem was preparation for a series of increasingly      selective math competitions. The two high schoolers placed in      the Top 12--Sandon tied for first place--in the country's      highest pre-collegiate math competition last week. They will      try out in June for a national, six-person math team that      will compete internationally in Madrid.       Sandon, 18, and Rolnick, 16, are the first Vermont students      to place in the Top 12 at the U.S. Mathematical Olympiad in      at least a decade, according to the Mathematical Association      of America. Anthony Trono, who has been training Vermont's      math prodigies since he retired from teaching at Burlington      High School in 1992, said, as far as he knew, they were the      state's first students to accomplish the feat. The Olympiad      began in 1974.       Trono, 80, of Colchester conceived the sample problem above      and provided The Burlington Free Press its solution: 669      centimeters. Four times a year, he mails a sample exam with      eight such problems to Vermont's high schools to test the      waters for up-and-coming whizzes. The problems, like those      found on exams for the American Math Competition, the      American Invitational Math Exam and the Olympiad--the three      tiers of the national math tournament through which Sandon      and Rolnick advanced--involve applications up to pre-     calculus.       ``Some of these problems aren't even algebra, it's just      arithmetic, but you gotta use your head to solve them,''      Trono said. ``They usually have to prove something is true,      derive some kind of formula, or solve a very, very complex      problem.''       During the course of the tournament, the field narrowed      from 500,000 students--including some from Canada--to the 500      who competed in the Olympiad.       Students in the competitions generally take the exams at      their high schools. Sandon took his at Essex High School and      Rolnick, who is homeschooled, took his at Middlebury College.      Students were allotted 4 1/2 hours on two consecutive days to      complete the Olympiad's six problems. The highest scorer,      Sandon, a senior, and Rolnick, a junior, have been accepted      to and plan to enroll at the Massachusetts Institute of      Technology in the fall.       ``I'm kind of nervous, because I've never been away from      home for more than a month, and MIT will be my home for the      next four years,'' Sandon said. ``On the other hand, I'll get      to meet new people there and take more challenging classes.''       Sandon has sought more challenging classes since elementary      school.       The Vermont State Math Coalition discovered Sandon when he      was in first grade. Engineers and physicists from IBM tutored      the boy for the next few years, as his capacity for math      exceeded that of his teachers. He finished pre-calculus in      sixth grade, and began taking courses at the University of      Vermont three years ago. His course load includes calculus      III, linear algebra, graph theory and number theory.       His goal was to crack the Top 12 in the Olympiad.       ``I felt like I had done pretty well, but I didn't think I      had done that well,'' Sandon said.       His parents, Peter and Maureen Sandon, an engineer at IBM      and a retired home economics teacher, respectively, said the      announcement surprised them, too.       ``We had a message on our answering machine,'' Maureen      Sandon said. ``I said, `Wait a minute, what did this message      say?' I must have replayed it three times.''       Peter Sandon said his son left him behind ``quite a while      ago'' in math.       ``I used to play chess with him, too, and I used to be able      to beat him,'' Peter Sandon said. ``And now I can't.''       Colin Sandon said he enjoys strategy games, and also likes      to read science fiction and fantasy.                          The renaissance man       Rolnick said he also enjoys strategy games--as well as      hiking; tennis; word play; reading; writing; talking;      listening to classical composers, such as Bach, Beethoven,      Haydn, Schubert and Tchaikovsky; and studying moths.       Tiny white moths are boring, Rolnick said. He prefers the      variety of larger moths with scarlets, violets, yellows,      greens, silvers and golds.       ``I have had the fortune to grow up in a household with      parents who did not cause me to be afraid of insects,''      Rolnick said. He blasted the ``societal prejudice against      insects'' that assumes all bugs ``bite, sting or eat      furniture.''       Rolnick sees beauty in moths and math.       ``Geometry I find easier to talk about,'' Rolnick said. ``I      love the way that things that are true, really are true.''       ``If you have a triangle, and you join the vertices to the      midpoints of the opposite side, you come up with three lines.      Those lines will come to a point--those three lines will      always meet--and I find that very beautiful.''       Problem solving becomes increasingly important as students      advance through the competitions, Rolnick said.       ``For all the problems, there is a certain amount of      thinking and puzzling that is absolutely necessary,'' Rolnick      said.       ``It is absolutely hard,'' he said of the Olympiad. ``It is      meant to be hard, even for professional mathematicians.''                             Trono retires       Sandon and Rolnick attended the Governor's Institute in      Mathematical Sciences, a week-long residential program for      students held at UVM during the summer.       Trono has directed the institute and run the Vermont State      Mathematics Coalition Talent Search--for which he mails high      schools his sample exams--since the early 1990s. He said he      will retire from the institute this year.       ``This has been a terrific year for me to go out,'' Trono      said.       He said he has 10,000 ``super, very good problems''--those      that did not make the cut for previous sample exams--to give      his successors a head start.                          ____________________
