 President, I rise today in honor of Judge Donald H. Patterson who died at age 61 on May 28, 1997 after his courageous 7-month battle with lung disease. Donald Patterson was a friend, dedicated father and community leader who was respected by all who knew him. Judge Patterson honorably served the people of Lauderdale County, AL, as an elected judge in the 11th Judicial District of Alabama.  Don grew up in Florence, AL and then received both his bachelor's and law degrees from the University of Alabama. Always a leader, Don was president of the student government association while at the university. Following his graduation from law school, Don served active duty in the U.S. Army, and later, 6 years in the U.S. Army Reserve.  In 1959, Don began his law practice with Bert Haltrom. The two continued to practice until Bert Haltrom was appointed U.S. district court judge. Until Don's election to the circuit court in 1989, he practiced law with Florence attorney Gary Jester.  Judge Patterson was a true gentleman and leader. His Christian valuesare reflected not only in the way he lived his life, but in the many organizations he led, belonged to and served. Until his passing, Judge Patterson was a member of the Alabama Judicial Study Commission and a director of the Alabama Circuit Court Judges Association.  Additionally, Judge Patterson served as chairman of the Florence-Lauderdale Industrial Expansion Committee; director of the chamber of commerce; past president of the Florence Rotary Club, and a recipient of the Paul Harris Fellow of Rotary International Award. Furthermore, he served numerous other legal, civic, and Christian groups.  Judge Patterson was a first-rate judge and lawyer--always very professional and knowledgeable. As a Sunday school teacher and past chairman of the board of the First Methodist Church of Florence, he was an exemplary citizen, leader, and role model. And as a husband, father, grandfather, and friend, Don was a compassionate and wonderful human being.  My prayers go out to Don's family and friends. Don Patterson's lifelong dedication to community and country made our world a better place--he will be sorely missed.                          ____________________
