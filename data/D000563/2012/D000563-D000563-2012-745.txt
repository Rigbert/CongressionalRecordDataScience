President, I wish to thank my colleague from Alaska and tell her that this week on National Public Radio there was a feature about Cordova and all the snow they have had to deal with there. I am sure this is perhaps commonplace in her great State, but as we listened to it from Chicago, we felt blessed we haven't been hit too hard yet this winter. But our hearts go out to the men and women in the Coast Guard and the National Guard in Alaska and the people who are struggling in Alaska's communities to survive these natural disasters.                          ____________________
