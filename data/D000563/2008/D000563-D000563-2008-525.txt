President, time and time again we are told by the Republican side, if we could just drill for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, all of our prayers would be answered and gasoline would be $1.50 a gallon, people would stop complaining, and the American economy would be back on its feet. It turns out this idea of drilling for oil in ANWR is not the answer to our prayers. For many of us, it is somewhat blasphemous to think we would take a section of land that was set aside by President Eisenhower as a wildlife refuge and say that we are so desperate in America for oil that we are going to change it forever.  It strikes me that we have to look at the reality. Of all the oil reserves in the world, the United States has access in our boundaries, near our shores, to 3 percent of all the oil in the world. We consume 25 percent of the oil in the world. The Republicans believe we can drill our way out--drill in the Great Lakes, drill in the ANWR--and it will all be just fine. We know better. We have to take an honest look at this and realize that drilling in those places will not answer the need.                          ____________________
