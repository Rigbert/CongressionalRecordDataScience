 Mr. Speaker, we may have a difference of opinion, but perhaps we will see who is right on whether it passes the United States Senate or not. I understand reconciliation only needs a majority, but we will see.  Mr. Speaker, I want to also ask the majority leader: One of the issues that I know the majority leader has been working on--and I know that all of us on this floor feel it to be very, very important to pass before October 30, when the highway bill authorization expires, and I know the gentleman from California is a strong supporter of it. Clearly we need to invest in infrastructure, again, to expand the economy.  Can the gentleman tell me what prospects we have on passing or at least considering the highway bill?  I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  As the gentleman knows, the hardest thing to do in this town is to find pay-fors. But Chairman Ryan continues to have bipartisan discussions on ways to pay for the long-term highway bill.  I have had follow-up meetings with him today, and they are progressing over in the Senate. I have met with Chairman Shuster even today as well, and I expect an announcement very shortly on committee movement.  We will advise Members as soon as action is taken to schedule it for the floor.
