Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  On his last rejoinder, my good friend and colleague said that the President said something about declaring an emergency.  Well, the President says an awful lot of things that he doesn't do, so I don't know how we were supposed to give credibility to that.  He said Mexico--he said, probably a hundred times, maybe more than a hundred times: ``Mexico is going to pay for the wall.''  ``Who is going to pay for the wall?''  ``Mexico.''  I mean, he got cheers. He just would brighten up, this was so wonderful.  But, of course, that is not happening.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).
