 As the gentleman knows full well, because he and I have been involved in discussions, I have consistently been for considering the appropriations bills in a timely manner with agreement between the majority and the minority, as occurred in 2006 when Mr. Obey and Mr. Lewis reached agreement on the consideration of those bills. The gentleman is accurate when he says that that is my preferred option on the consideration of appropriations bills. But, as I say, I have not talked to the chairman, and I will be talking to him to get his view on how these bills can most effectively be considered.
