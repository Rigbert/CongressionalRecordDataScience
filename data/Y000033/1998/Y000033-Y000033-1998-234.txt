Mr. Chairman, I do not want the full 5 minutes, but I do want to suggest to the Members on the floor that it is my intention to entertain the amendments that will be offered by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Gutierrez) and the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez) and that we will roll the votes until 9 o'clock. At that time, I hope the gentleman and the gentlewoman, and whoever is offering amendments, will have come to a fruition, finalization, of these amendments so that we can bring this legislation to the end of the day very quickly.  That is my intent, to have no more votes until, I believe, 9 o'clock.
