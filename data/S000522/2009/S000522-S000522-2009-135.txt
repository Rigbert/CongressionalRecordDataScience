Mr. Speaker, yesterday I submitted two pro-life, pro-child, pro-women amendments to the Rules Committee and asked that they be made in order. Regrettably, both were rejected.  As a direct, absolutely predictable consequence of President Obama's abortion export order a few weeks ago nullifying the Mexico City policy, an Obama action that the Gallup poll found that 58 percent of the people oppose him, 35 percent support him--as a result of that order, there will be significantly more abortions worldwide, more dead babies, and more wounded women.  Now the number of innocent children forced to die from dismemberment, decapitation, or chemical poisoning by abortion will increase significantly mostly in Africa and Latin America.  The pro-abortion organizations who will divvy up the $545 million pot of U.S. taxpayer grant money contained in the bill have made it abundantly clear that they will aggressively promote, lobby, litigate, and perform abortions on demand in developing countries. My amendment would have prevented that.  Flush with U.S. funding, foreign pro-abortion NGOs will be regarded in those countries as an extension of American values and mores. In your name and mine, and in the name of the American people pro-abortion organizations will unleash massive death, pain, sorrow, and destruction on babies, women, and families.                              {time}  1300  The second amendment, Mr. Speaker, would have preserved the Kemp-Kasten anti-coercion amendment. That amendment, while it's in the bill, is actually gutted by language also in the bill that says that funds made available to the UNFPA shall be made available notwithstanding any other provision of law. So it's gutted. My amendment would strike the notwithstanding language and reiterate the anti-coercion text.  The U.N. Population Fund, Mr. Speaker, has actively supported, comanaged and whitewashed the most pervasive crimes against women in human history, yet the omnibus Appropriations bill gives them $50 million and a slap on the wrist.  China's one-child-per-couple policy relies on pervasive coerced abortion, involuntary sterilization, ruinous fines in the amounts of up to 10 times the salary of both parents, imprisonment, job loss or demotion to achieve its quotas. In China today, with UNFPA enabling acquiescence and facilitation, brothers and sisters are illegal. Illegal kids--siblings! Women are told when and if they can have even the one child permitted by law. Unwed mothers, even if the baby is their first, are forcibly aborted.  Women are severely harmed emotionally, psychologically and physically, yet for the past three decades the UNFPA has been China's chief apologist as well as program trainer, facilitator and funder.  So, Mr. Speaker, how does Congress respond to the UNFPA's unconscionable complicity in China's crimes against Women? Do we demand reform, or the protection of Chinese women and children? Heck no. We gut the anti-coercion law and write a $50 million check to the UNFPA.  Mr. Speaker, yesterday I submitted two pro-life, pro-child, pro-women amendments to theRules Committee and asked that they be made in order under the pending rule.  Notwithstanding the fact that both the Mexico City Policy amendment and the Kemp-Kasten Anti-Coercion population control amendment have been fundamental foreign policy for the better part of two decades, the Democratic leadership chose to reject both, out of hand, precluding members so much as an up or down vote.  As a direct, absolutely predictable consequence of President Obama's abortion export order a few weeks ago nullifying the Mexico City Policy the number of innocent children who will be forced to die from dismemberment, decapitation, or chemical poisoning by abortion will increase significantly, mostly in Africa and Latin America.  According to a Gallup poll released earlier this month, overturning this pro-life policy was the least popular of the President's actions in his first week in office. In fact 58 percent of those polled opposed overturning the policy and only 35 percent supported funding groups that promote or provide abortion as a method of family planning.  The pro-abortion organizations who will divvy up the $545 million pot of U.S. taxpayer grant money contained in the bill have made it abundantly clear that they will aggressively promote, lobby, litigate and perform abortion on demand in developing countries. My amendment prevents that.  Flush with U.S. funds, foreign pro-abortion NGOs will be almost certainly regarded by people in foreign nations as extensions of American values and mores. Mr. Speaker, in your name and mine and in the name of the American people--pro-abortion organizations will unleash massive death, pain, sorrow and destruction on babies, women and families throughout the world.  President Obama--the Abortion President--has put countless innocent children in harm's way, all while speechifying that he wants to reduce abortion.  And please, let's not kid ourselves any longer. There is nothing whatsoever benign, kind or compassionate about abortion; it is violence against children and wounds women.  The second amendment would have ensured that the Kemp-Kasten anti-coercion proviso in the bill has meaning. On one page of the Omnibus, Kemp-Kasten is seemingly retained intact, only to be completely gutted by text which reads.       Funds appropriated by this act for UNFPA''--$50 million--     ``shall be made available to UNFPA notwithstanding any      provision of law . . . .  The U.N. Population Fund has actively supported, co-managed, and white-washed the most pervasive crimes against women in human history.  Yet this bill gives them $50 million and a slap on the wrist.  China's one-child-per-couple policy relies on pervasive, coerced abortion, involuntary sterilization, ruinous fines in amounts up to 10 times the salary of both parents, imprisonment, and job loss or demotion to achieve its quotas.  In China today with UNFPA enabling China's barbaric government policy, brothers and sisters are illegal. Imagine, a government so hostile to siblings that it makes them enemies of the state--and dead.  Women are told by Chinese family planning cadres when--and if--they can have even the one child permitted by law.  Unwed mothers--even if the baby is her first--are forcibly aborted. No exception.  Women are severely harmed emotionally, psychologically, and physically. Chinese women are violated by the state. The suicide rate for Chinese women--about 500 a day--far exceeds suicide anywhere else on earth.  Then there are the missing girls--about 100 million--victims of sex selection abortions. This gendercide is a direct result of the China/UNFPA one child policy.  In 2008--the U.S. State Department found once again that the UNFPA violated the anti-coercion provision of Kemp-Kasten and reprogrammed all funding originally earmarked for the UNFPA to other maternal health care or family planning projects.  Yet throughout the past three decades, the U.N. Population Fund has remained China's chief apologist, as well as program trainer, facilitator and funder.  So, finally, Mr. Speaker, how does Congress respond to the UNFPA's unconscionable complicity in China's crimes against women? Do we demand reform and protection of Chinese women and children? Heck no. We gut the anti-coercion law and write a $50 million check to the UNFPA.  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey).
