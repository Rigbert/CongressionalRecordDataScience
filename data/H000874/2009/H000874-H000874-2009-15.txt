I want to make it clear to the gentleman, I do not believe you were let go because you failed to meet a time frame for reporting bills. I believe, frankly, the substance of our work is that which the public makes a judgment on. And, frankly, we think that the reason that they turned to us in 2006 and 2008 was because they thought that the programs and policies you were pursuing weren't working for our country or for the economy or for them, with all due respect.  But I continue to tell the gentleman that we want to try to make sure, as you did--sometimes--that you, our Members, the public have sufficient knowledge to make the decisions that are called upon for them to make.
