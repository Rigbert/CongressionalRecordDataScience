Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment. The chairman of this committee, as I have said in the past, has been, in my opinion, as good a chairman as I could possibly work with on the Committee on House Administration. He is open, he is fair, he is a pleasure to work with. We have worked very closely on election reform.  This House overwhelmingly passed election reform. It is now in the Senate. Hopefully, they will pass it soon, we will have a conference, and we will have a bill that we can all be very proud of. We agreed on that legislation. The gentleman made compromises; I made compromises.  On campaign finance reform, however, we have differed. Essentially it has been his position to oppose the Shays-Meehan alternative. In fact, the Shays-Meehan alternative could not be favorably reported out of committee. In my view, the Ney-Wynn amendment, which was changed last night, as I understand it, to reduce the limits, but, nevertheless, still has soft-money payments to the national committees, is in effect Shays-Meehan extraordinarily light, and in fact does not cover most of what Shays-Meehan covers. Furthermore, notwithstanding the reduction in the $75,000 to $20,000, it still provides for very, very, very substantial payments of soft money to various party committees, substantially more than does Shays-Meehan.  So if you want real campaign finance reform, you need to defeat this amendment, pass a motion to recommit, and pass Shays-Meehan finally and send that bill to the Senate, and then hopefully soon thereafter to the President of the United States for signature.  Mr. Chairman, I would say to my colleagues, we are coming to the end of the evening. We have defeated almost all of the amendments that were designed to undermine and defeat Shays-Meehan. We have one more step to take. I urge my colleagues to take it.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
