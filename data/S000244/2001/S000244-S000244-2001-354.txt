Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.  I am very interested in the argument of the gentleman from Michigan. Under this constitutional amendment, we could repeal a tax loophole that gave these outrageous benefits to the corporation he mentioned by a majority vote as long as the revenue that was raised was distributed to the American people. If there was just a flat out repeal, it would take a two-thirds vote. This would make it easier to give tax relief to the American people in repealing these loopholes.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Hefley).
