 The Senator from Washington is not only a leader in education but is a former classroom teacher. I don't know that many of us--I certainly cannot--in the Senate can claim to have that background when we address this important issue.  So I would like to ask the Senator from Washington, as perhaps one of thefew, if not the only, classroom teachers on the floor of the Senate, whether there is any importance to the President's priority of saying, we are going to try to fund 100,000 new teachers and reduce class size, as opposed to some other way this money might be spent?
