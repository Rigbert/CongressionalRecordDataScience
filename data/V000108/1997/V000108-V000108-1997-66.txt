Speaker, it is my distinct honor to congratulate St. John the Evangelist School, in Saint John, IN, on the completion of its recent sesquicentennial celebration.  St. John the Evangelist School is a parochial elementary school under the jurisdiction of the Catholic Diocese of Gary. Upon its founding in 1846 by the Brothers and Sisters of the Holy Cross from Notre Dame, IN, St. John the Evangelist was the first school opened within the town of Saint John. With the beginning of the Civil War, the parochial school was closed, and was reopened after the war as a public school. In 1903, the school returned to its Catholic origin and was in useuntil the building of the present school in 1969. Due to increased enrollment, a second floor addition was built in 1988. St. John the Evangelist has a current enrollment of 351 students.  The Saint John community began commemorating the 150th anniversary of St. John the Evangelist School on Friday, April 18, 1997, with an all-day celebration, entitled ``150 Years of Quality Catholic Education.'' The day's events, which took place in the school gymnasium, included a prayer service, a giant birthday cake, and a program put together by the St. John the Evangelist students. The student program depicted the theme ``Eras of Education'' with costumed, musical presentations of past decades. Eighth-graders in turn-of-the century garb portrayed the construction of the Panama Canal, a malaria outbreak, and such inventions as the airplane, toaster, and Model T. Ford. Each class within the school researched an assigned era and similarly presented their interpretations. School Principal, Sister Angela Mellady, commented that the students learned a great deal about American history, as well as the heritage of their school, while planning the event.  Some celebration activities which will take place throughout the year, include the wearing of St. John the Evangelist birthday celebration shirts each Friday in place of the student uniform, and an appreciation luncheon for local businessmen who have supported the school throughout the years. The anniversary celebration will close with a 150th birthday reunion this coming Saturday, July 12, 1997. Approximately 1,000 St. John the Evangelist alumni have been invited to the reunion, where past experiences and memories will be shared.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to once again extend my most heartfelt congratulations to St. John the Evangelist School on achieving its sesquicentennial anniversary. Everyone involved in the school's growth and success over the years should be commended, as the values and quality instruction provided to students have undoubtedly served as a cornerstone of education in the Saint John, IN community.                          ____________________
