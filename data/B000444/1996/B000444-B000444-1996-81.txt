 President, I heard again, this time from our friend from Arizona, about the President's flagging effort on drugs and Bush up, Clinton down. Let's get the record straight.  There was over $300 million more requested by the President for this very function than the Congress is willing to give him. The Republican Congress in the Senate last year cut the FBI by $112 million, cut the drug task force by $19 million, cut the number of prosecutors by $19 million. Let's stop this.  I think it makes sense to do what the Senator from Georgia wants to do. Let's do it and stop this partisan malarkey. The facts do not sustain the assertions.  I yield the floor.
