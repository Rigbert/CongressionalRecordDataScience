Speaker, on December 14, 1994, Sheriff Cois Byrd officially retired as the sheriff of Riverside County, CA. His commitment to law enforcement and the professional manner in which he ran his department for 8 years after being elected Riverside's sheriff in November 1986 will be missed by all of us who have had the opportunity to work with him--and by all law-abiding citizens of the county.  During his tenure as our sheriff, Cois Byrd epitomized what it means to be a professional in the increasingly complex field of law enforcement. Since first being hired as a deputy sheriff in 1959--after returning to Riverside from 3 years with the Fleet Marines/Pacific--Cois Byrd worked hard to keep up with the latest techniques in fighting crime. During his tenure as sheriff, his department grew from some 1,250 employees to more than 2,000 deputies and civilians operating out of more than 25 offices, stations, and detention facilities. By working cooperatively with the county's board of supervisors, Sheriff Byrd was able to develop a population-driven growth formula for patrol operations. This formula has helped increase the sheriff's staff/population ratio so that the department can keep up with the growing demands for law enforcement in an increasingly urban environment.  Cois Byrd has also made his mark in law enforcement at the State level. He was an active member of the California Sheriff's Association, serving as a member of the executive [[Page E37]] board and as the associate treasurer, and he served as the training committee chairman and as a member of the advisory committee for the California Commission on Peace Officers' Standards and Training.  Locally, the sheriff was instrumental in guiding county policy for the development of the Southwest Justice Center, including a jail and sheriff's station. In September 1989, Sheriff Byrd officially opened the Robert Presley Detention Center, which was the first major correctional facility constructed in the county in 50 years. The project came in on time and under budget, demonstrating the tight-fisted budgeting and fiscal conservatism that Cois Byrd always practiced as our sheriff.  But, perhaps more important than his expertise at working with the board of supervisors, State law enforcement organizations, and other community groups, or even his superb management skills, what made Cois Byrd such an outstanding sheriff was his ability to motivate his deputies and other department staff. In spite of the rapid growth of the sheriff's department, Cois always made it a practice to personally meet each graduating class of deputies from every training academy--and, he maintained a good, close working relationship with the civilian employees.  While building one of the largest and most respected sheriff's departments in the Nation, Cois also found time to participate in numerous civic activities, including serving faithfully as a volunteer for the Boy Scouts and sponsoring an explorer program. While we will miss Cois as our sheriff, we are delighted that he will continue to provide his law enforcement expertise at the Crime Control Technology Center at the University of California, Riverside, school of engineering. And, we are especially grateful that he and his wife, Evelyn, will remain in our community.  It is a great pleasure for me, on behalf of the citizens of California's 43d Congressional District, to congratulate and thank Sheriff Cois Byrd for many years of dedicated service to the Riverside County Sheriff's Department and to wish Cois and Evelyn continued good health and happiness, and much success in their new endeavors.                          ____________________
