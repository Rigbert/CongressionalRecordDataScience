President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of the Small Marine Business and Fishing Guide Relief Act that Senator Coleman is introducing today. This legislation will provide much-needed relief to charter boat captains and other operators of small marine businesses in Maine by exempting them from having to obtain a Transportation Worker Identification Credential, or TWIC, which costs $132.50 for each employee.  Under current law, any individual who holds a Coast Guard license, as most charter boat captains do, must also obtain a TWIC.
