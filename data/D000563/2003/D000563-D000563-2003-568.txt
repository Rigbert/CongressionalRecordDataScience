And in this situation, it is my belief that this underlying bill does not. The reason the Stabenow amendment was defeated the other day, the reason there is opposition here, is, once you put Medicare in the picture on a national basis, bargaining for lower prescription drug prices, you are more likely to succeed and the drug companies are more likely to have to reduce their costs.  I think that is why the pharmaceutical companies don't particularly care for my approach and the reason many people have opposed it here. But from where I am standing, if my interest is in the senior citizens of America having the lowest prescription drug prices and our giving a helping hand as much as we can, rather than the bottom line profits of prescription drug companies, I think this is a much more advisable approach.  I reserve the remainder of my time.
