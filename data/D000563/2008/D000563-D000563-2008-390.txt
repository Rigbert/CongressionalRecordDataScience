President, the late Senator Paul Simon was my closest friend in politics. He was my boss for several years, and he is the reason I am in the Senate today.  Paul Simon used to like to tell the story about Meriwether Lewis, half of the fabled exploration team of Lewis and Clark. In the story--a true story--Meriwether Lewis returns to his hometown after helping lead the historic journey of the uncharted West to the Pacific coast. At a dinner in his honor, Meriwether Lewis tells the people of his hometown:       Patriotism is not words, it's work. It's what we do.  Paul Simon believed that, and he surrounded himself with others who shared that belief. Patriotism is not words, it is works.  For Joseph Dunn, that was the creed of his political faith. Most people in the Senate have not heard of Joe Dunn, but if you care about social and economic justice and the survival of small towns, small businesses, and family farms, you would have liked him. If you live in southern Illinois, there is a good chance your life is better today because of Joe Dunn.  Joe was the quintessential smalltown American. He loved his family, his church, and his community. For 15 years, he, too, worked for Paul Simon in the House, then in the Senate. For most of that time, he was Senator Simon's downstate director in Illinois.  When Senator Simon retired in 1996, Joe took a salary cut to work for the ICCS, the Illinois Coalition of Community Services. It is a nonprofit organization whose motto is ``helping communities help themselves.'' Two years later, Joe became its director.  ICCS works with people in struggling communities in southern Illinois, mostly small farm belt and coal belt towns that have been losing jobs and residents for a long time. ICCS helps residents in those towns identify their community's specific challenges and strengths and work together for a better future.  As a friend wrote:       Joe believed there was no community without assets, no      individual devoid of talents. He spent his life working in      partnership with these communities and individuals, taking      advantage of their assets and talents. He was a kind, sweet,      thoughtful, passionate man.  Last Friday, on the Fourth of July, Joe Dunn's caring heart stopped. He suffered a fatal heart attack while he was exercising at home. Joe was 55 years old. Joe learned the meaning of patriotism from his mother Johanna and his father Ben, a World War II POW and survivor of the Bataan Death March.  Joe learned about community growing up in Gorham, a small town in the Mississippi River Bottoms of southern Illinois bordering on the Shawnee National Forest. This is how Joe described his hometown last year:       The median household income of Gorham is a mere $22,750.      Kids have to be transported at least 12 miles to school. Most      residents who work must travel an average 34 miles to their      jobs. But in spite of this and the fact that you cannot buy      either a loaf of bread or a gallon of gas there, Gorham      remains.  Joe went on to say it is not unique.       The isolation that poverty has brought to Gorham affects      many, many other small communities in Illinois.  Joe asked:       What can residents in such towns do to combat their      isolation? They must organize . . . and be willing to work      very hard to keep their sense of community intact. . . .      [T]hey must also organize and join with the voices of others      to let our legislators and other decisionmakers know that      [residents of small towns] have the same human rights as      residents of more prosperous and affluent Illinois      communities.  Joe Dunn was committed to the notion that America should be a land of opportunity for all, not just for some, and he spent his life working to improve the lives of others. He worked tirelessly to better the lives of people living in poverty by changing public policy and providing creative community solutions.  Like Paul Simon, Joe believed government could be a force for good. At Eastern Illinois University, where Joe earned a degree in political science in 1975, he was the student senate speaker. He was a political natural. He knew how to build and use political power. But he used his political and organizing skills to serve others, never himself.  He brought joy wherever he went. His laughter was warm, his humor was quick but never mean. Joe always had a smile on his face.  Joe was born with a condition that left him with a pronounced limp, but he was so full of energy that you quickly forgot he had any physical limitations, and he had so much faith in theability of everyday people to change their lives so the people with whom ICCS were working forgot about their supposed limitations.  Under his leadership, ICCS helped dozens of communities create community development programs, neighborhood cleanup and rehabilitation programs, community policing programs, and volunteer community libraries. Joe helped establish afterschool programs and school and summer lunch programs that fed tens of thousands of young people in my State. He helped create new partnerships between community and faith-based groups, and new bridges between generations.  Before joining Senator Simon's staff, Joe worked for the Illinois Farmers Union-CETA, and he coordinated summer youth programs in four southern Illinois counties. He was a member of the Governor's Rural Affairs Council, the Illinois Poverty Summit Steering Committee, the Illinois Collaboration on Youth and the Service Learning Task Force of the Illinois State Board of Education and the Steering Committee of the Alliance of Communities for Faith and Justice.  Through these programs, and the people he inspired, Joe's work will live on.  Days before he died, Joe sent some friends an e-mail that ended with these words:       By the way, happy 4th of July, and remember that one of the      most patriotic things we can do is strengthen our      communities.  He was a profoundly good man who made life better for many people and a great friend of mine. I can't tell you how many times we worked together on projects in communities around our State. We had this common political heritage in Paul Simon. It rubbed off, I hope, on me but certainly on Joe Dunn. I knew Joe was going to live up to those values, those Simon values that inspired so many of us over the years.  What a tragedy it was to learn of his passing on the Fourth of July. When Kappy Scates in my downstate office contacted us, it was hard to believe. Joe was too young, too alive, too necessary. But now he is gone.  In closing, I wish to extend my deep condolences to Joe's family, especially his wife Tempa; their daughters Abby and Katie, and the two grandchildren Joe loved so much, as well as his many friends. Joe Dunn has left his legacy in my State of Illinois. His caring heart may have stopped on the Fourth of July, but his caring for the people of my State will not end.                         Republican Filibusters  Mr. President, I listened a minute ago to the Senator from Texas talking about energy, and I thought to myself: Doesn't he remember that a few weeks ago we brought energy bills to the floor and we asked him and the Republicans to join us in a bipartisan effort to deal with the gasoline prices in this country? Is he suffering from political amnesia? Has he forgotten that we tried unsuccessfully over and over to get a bipartisan group of Senators to start the debate he is begging for today?  I took a look at some of these rollcall votes to try to remember who was on which side when it came to bringing up the issues, and here we have, for example, a vote on June 10 of this year--June 10, not that long ago, less than a month ago--and we were trying to bring up the basic tax credits for energy development in this country--something that is about to expire and that we want to make sure will go forward. Unfortunately, we were stopped. On these tax extender votes of June 10, 2008, we needed 60 votes to go forward. We had 50 votes.  I looked to see what Republicans joined us in this effort. There were three. The Senator from Tennessee, Senator Corker, Senator Smith of Oregon, and Senator Snowe of Maine, which led to a total of 50. We needed 60. The Senator from Texas, unfortunately, voted against starting that debate.  So he comes to the floor today and says that we surely can't leave for the August recess until we start a bipartisan debate. Sadly, on June 10, he voted against a bipartisan debate on tax extenders.  But that wasn't the only time that day he voted against a debate on energy policy. I don't wish to single him out, but he came to the floor and made the speech, and I will make it clear that many others joined him. We brought up a bill that wasn't just an extension of tax incentives so companies could start building more wind turbines and research into renewable and sustainable sources of energy. It went further. In fact, I think it was a very balanced and proactive effort to bring down gasoline prices and to try to take control of an element that is not only hurting families and businesses but our economy. We came forward with the Consumer-First Energy bill, and we said we want to debate this on a bipartisan basis.  Here is what it said. First, we are going to roll back the $17 billion in tax subsidies that we are giving the oil companies. Listen, they are turning in and reporting the biggest profits in their history. They don't need subsidies from Federal taxpayers. We could put that money to better use. What if we gave consumers across America a helping hand in paying for gasoline? What if we gave independent truckdrivers several thousand dollars to defray the expenses they are running into trying to fuel their rigs and make a living? I would rather put $17 billion in that kind of tax relief than in tax relief to ExxonMobil. But that is what we are doing. So the bill said, let's change that.  The bill also said we were going to impose a 25-percent windfall profit tax on these oil companies to let them know the sky is not the limit when it comes to profit taking. There is a point where the Federal Government will take that money back for consumers, for investment in renewable and sustainable fuels.  We also wanted to suspend oil shipments to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve for the rest of the year. Why do we keep buying this expensive oil, taking it off the market and sinking it in the ground, making it more expensive for our economy? It doesn't make sense.  We also had a provision to protect consumers from price gouging. I am afraid that is going on here. This bill gave the President the authority to declare an energy emergency and set aside excessive price increases.  We also set limitations on oil market price speculation. Most people understand that is part of the issue. We had it in our bill.  We had a clear message to OPEC by allowing enforcement actions against companies that collude to set the price of oil and natural gas.  Well, that was the bill. Those were the provisions. They could have made a difference. But in order to get that bill to the floor and to start debating it, we needed 60 votes. That is what the Senate requires, 60 votes. So we called it for consideration on June 10, 2008, and we had 51 votes. The following 6 Republicans joined 45 Democrats. Coleman, Collins, Grassley, Smith, Snowe, and Warner. The Senator who was just on the floor, who says we shouldn't go home in August without debating a bipartisan measure, voted not to debate a bipartisan measure on June 10, 2008.  We tried again on June 17. We believe it is important. We tried to bring up these tax extenders again to encourage the kind of investment that is necessary. Well, unfortunately, again we couldn't get 60 votes. We had 52. Republicans voting with Democrats: Coleman, Collins, Corker, Smith, and Snowe. Sadly, the Senator who spoke on the floor was not among those voting to go forward on June 17. On three separate occasions he refused to vote to start the debate on this energy issue, and now he is complaining that we should be starting the debate on the energy issue.  Well, I hope he will reconsider his previous votes, and I hope he will join us in a bipartisan effort to go forward. But I must say that if we are going forward on this bill and others, then the policy and strategy of the Republican Senators has to change. This chart shows we have had 82 Republican filibusters so far in this session of Congress.  Now, people say: Is that a lot? How many do you expect? In the history of this Senate, there have never been more than 57 filibusters in a 2-year period. So far, in a little over a year, we have had 82 Republican filibusters. What is a filibuster? A filibuster is using the Senate rules to stop the debate on a bill, to stop the debate on an amendment or a nomination. Any Senator can stand and do that, and then you have to wait 30 hours and see if you can get 60 votes together to overcome that Senator's filibuster.  Well, we have 51 Democratic votes. When you do your Senate math, you find out we need nine Republicans to join us to move forward on anything. Eighty-two times the Republican Senators have stopped debate on issue after issue. On the three separate occasions that I have made reference to, when the Democratic majority of 51 tried to get 9 Republican Senators to join us in a bipartisan debate to bring down gasoline prices, to talk about investment in renewable and sustainable fuels, they refused. They give us just a few Senators. Coincidentally, most of them are up for reelection. They give us a few, but never enough to reach 60. That has been their strategy. That is the Republican strategy, the strategy of opposition to debate and moving forward.
