First, the bill calls for increased civil monetary penalties and requires that they be placed in escrow in advance of adjudication of an alleged violation. This provision could be especially burdensome to smaller nursing homes that already operate close to the margin. I think it would be useful to review the size of the proposed fines but especially the escrow provision. Tying up thousands of dollars in escrow would be particularly difficult for small nursing homes and especially unfair for homes whose alleged violations were later found to be without merit. I also believe it raises due process concerns in terms of imposing penalties before a matter has been finally settled.
