Congress has a long track record of supporting the public's ``right to know'' about the nature and volume of toxic chemicals that are being released into the environment from manufacturing facilities in their neighborhoods. The ``Toxics Release Inventory'' has empowered citizens and communities and is helping local and state environmental agencies to identify the most pressing problems within their neighborhoods. A glaring gap in information from the Inventory is mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that at least 52 tons of mercury are being released to the environment each year, every year, from these plants. When Congress amended the Clean Air Act in 1990, we did not address mercury emissions but instead required EPA to report back to Congress on the sources, impacts and control strategies for mercury. Congress finally received that report last year and now needs to act on it. That is why I introduced the ``Omnibus Mercury Emissions Reduction Act of 1998.'' Although I will not offer my mercury right-to-know amendment today, Congress has a responsibility to act on the EPA Mercury Report to Congress. I believe Senator Chafee who is one of the leading proponents of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, agrees with me that steps should be taken to address mercury emissions.
