President, I remind my colleagues of the vital importance of developing, and then maintaining, effective cybersecurity systems in our workplaces, our government offices, and our homes. We have all become acutely aware, as we confront the many possible threats to our national security, that much of our critical infrastructure is now run by computer networks. Illegal access to these networks can compromise the provision of power, telecommunications, and water in an instant. In the private sector, whole industries now rely on information technology in order to function. In addition, millions of Americans depend on their computers to explore the Internet, to access information and entertainment, and to preserve their personal records. At the same time they must protect their most significant, and often intimate, data--such as medical records and credit card information. With all this at risk, effective cybersecurity should be paramount in every corporation, government agency, and personal home.  This past weekend marked National Cybersecurity Day. With the strong efforts of the Federal Trade Commission and the Congressional Internet Caucus, we have come a long way in raising awareness about cybersecurity. The FTC has made a great deal of important information available on their website, and I encourage people to visit that website, at www.ftc.gov. I am proud to be a Senate cochair of the Internet Caucus, along with Senator Burns, Congressman Goodlatte, and Congressman Boucher. In addition to an impressive array of speakers on all aspects of the Internet, the caucus has begun a series of constituent education seminars, targeted at helping all of us provide better information, assistance, and support to the people in our home states as they grapple with the dizzying possibilities and pitfalls of the Internet.  Our efforts have not been limited to just one day. Last week this body passed important anti-spam legislation that will help to keep unwanted--often illicit--e-mail off the Internet, and off our computer screens. In the Judiciary Committee, we have held hearings recently on the dangers of peer-to-peer technology. This technology has the potential to revolutionize the way people share all sorts of information. But as with any technology, it can be abused. Peer-to-peer networks can be used to distribute child pornography and to expose our children to a host of obscene materials. It can also be used to delve into people's private records or illegally to share copyrighted material.  Pornography, and child pornography in particular, is prevalent on peer-to-peer networks. According to recent reports, as much as 42 percent of peer-to-peer requests are for pornography. What is more, at a recent committee hearing we learned that at least one popular peer-to-peer network does not identify its pornographic material in any way. Thus, advertisements on its network appear just as regularly with child pornography and other obscene content as with scientific reviews and scholarly papers.  Some of the danger of using peer-to-peer networks can be alleviated with good cybersecurity. Reading privacy statements, taking the time to understand the software you are using, as well as keeping filters and antivirus software turned on and up to date, all help. Knowing what your children are doing online is also important. In addition, we have given prosecutors powerful tools to go after the people who threaten our security.  Our efforts must continue. The very nature of cyberspace means that the threat to security is always changing. Our responses must evolve as well, both as individuals and as legislators. I am pleased to be continuing to work with Chairman Hatch as we investigate, not just the peer-to-peer situation, but the larger set of circumstances that may threaten our cybersecurity. As we identify those threats, our primary goal will be to raise awareness about those dangers, and to give citizens and law enforcement the tools they need to protect our rights, to improve our security, and to redress wrongdoing as we continue to develop ever-better cybersecurity systems.                          ____________________
