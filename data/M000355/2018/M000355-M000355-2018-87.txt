 President, I would like to say a few words following today's announcement from our dear friend, the senior Senator from Tennessee.  The great State of Tennessee has been generous to the U.S. Senate over the years. A number of the State's Senators from both parties have enriched this institution through especially distinguished service and built reputations as national leaders.  Nobody embodies this legacy more fully than Lamar Alexander. While I am sure he will accomplish even more over the next 2 years, Lamar is already one of the most consequential Senators on domestic policy in memory. Lamar was a success long before he became a Senator. He had already been a popular and accomplished Governor and a brilliant Secretary of Education, but fortunately for this body and for our Nation, 16 years ago the Volunteer State saw fit to continue that career of excellence by sending Lamar here.  He has chaired the Republican conference. He has chaired the HELP Committee. For his colleagues in both parties he is a go-to expert on some of the most critical subjects that directly impact Americans' lives, particularly American families, healthcare, and our children's schools.  The Every Student Succeeds Act and this year's landmark opioids legislation are two perfect examples of signature Lamar Alexander accomplishments. They tackle challenging issues in a thoughtful and substantive way. They tangibly improve Americans' lives, and they passed both Houses of Congress with big bipartisan majorities.  So the Senate will be lesser without Lamar's wisdom, collegiality, and expertise when he retires. I am glad that day is 2 years away and grateful we will keep benefiting from his leadership through the 116th Congress.                          ____________________
