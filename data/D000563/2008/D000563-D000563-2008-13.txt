Hewas 1 of 10 Republicans who did this evening. They were Senators Bond, Brownback, Collins, Dole, Domenici, Lugar, Snowe, Specter, Voinovich, and Warner. The motion required 60 votes. It had 53. It was seven votes short. The Senator from Pennsylvania took exception to my characterization earlier that the Republicans could have done more and helped us pass that. I want the Record to reflect that on the final vote, before Senator Reid changed his vote for procedural reasons, 43 of the 46 Democrats voted in favor of the motion. Ten Republicans voted in favor.  It is clear we could have had more, certainly, but it would not have been enough to make up the seven-vote deficit. When less than a third of the Republicans voted in favor of it, it is pretty clear that most of those on the other side of the aisle did not support that motion, despite the heroic vote by the Senator from Pennsylvania.                          ____________________
