 But so far there are 20,000 new pages of regulations--so far--a stack this high.  This is absolutely indecipherable by very intelligent people, and they are just getting started.  I want to thank the Senator from Florida for his comments. I think they are right on the mark. This is a huge mistake for our country. Hopefully, someday, maybe even beginning with this amendment, we may begin to undo this massive mistake we made a few years ago.  Madam President, we have been saying for 3 years this bill will be too expensive; it won't do what it promised. Every day we are seeing further proof of that.  The Federal Reserve said it will cost jobs--the Federal Reserve not the RNC. We predicted that. Yesterday we had a glimpse of the application process for ObamaCare. It turns out applying for it will be as difficult as doing your taxes.  Today there is another AP story saying some folks will see their insurance bill double next year as a result of this law. As I indicated, so far there are 20,000 pages of regulations and many more are expected. This bill is an unmitigated disaster for our country, an absolute disaster.  I applaud Senator Cruz for offering this amendment. I strongly support his efforts. Not a single Member of my party in the House and the Senate voted for this bill in the first place. We need to get this bill off the books and straighten out our country. This would be a big step in the direction of achieving that.  I yield the floor.
