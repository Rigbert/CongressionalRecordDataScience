REID. I say to my friend, he knows how much I support his efforts. But I haven't had the opportunity to speak to Senator McConnell. It wouldn't be appropriate for me to agree to something without consulting with him. I can't consult with him now. I will do everything within my abilities here to work this out so that prior to the end of our next work period, we will get this done.
