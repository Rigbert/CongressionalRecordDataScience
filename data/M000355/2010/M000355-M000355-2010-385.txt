 President, first, I welcome everyone back after what I hope was a restful time away from Washington. It is good to be here. I can assure everyone that Republicans are energized and eager to pick up where we left off. There is a lot to do, and we are ready.  The news of the day, of course, is that we will soon be welcoming a new Senator into our ranks. It has been a long time--a very long time--since the people of Massachusetts sent a Republican to the Senate. So I congratulate Senator-elect Scott Brown on his decisive victory last night.  I had a chance to speak with him last night. I think it was truly a remarkable turnout and decision on the part of the people of that State.  There is a reason the Nation was focused on this race. The American people have made it abundantly clear they are more interested in shrinking unemployment than expanding government. They are tired of bailouts. They are tired of government spending more than ever at a time when most people are spending less. They do not want the government taking over health care. They made that abundantly clear last night in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  This is why Americans are electing good Republican candidates who they hope will reverse a year-long Democratic trend of spending too much, borrowing too much, and taxing too much. The voters have spoken. They want a course correction. We should listen to them.  Today, we will have a chance to show we have gotten the message when we take up legislation that would raise the national debt limit. The reason we are being asked to raise the limit on the national credit card is clear. It is because the majority has spent the past year spending money we do not have on stimulus bills that do not stimulate the economy, on budgets that double the debt in 5 years and triples it in 10. We need to move in a new direction--a dramatically new direction. That is the message of Virginia. That is the message of New Jersey. That is the message of Massachusetts.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.                          ____________________
