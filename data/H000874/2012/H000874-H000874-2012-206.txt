There was a bill that passed through the other Chamber, which passed overwhelmingly--more than 2 1--and it is not like this bill.                              {time}  1500  There are Members that would like to incorporate the Senate's provisions in the House bill, and I know we would appreciate it if we would be given that opportunity to offer that on the floor as an alternative. If the gentleman would take that into consideration, perhaps talk to Mr. Dreier about making such amendments in order, we would very much appreciate that. Of course we would also appreciate, perhaps, if you wanted to take up the Senate bill as a substitute. We think we would have overwhelming votes for that on this side of the aisle. In light of the fact that you and I have been working in such a bipartisan fashion lately, perhaps that would be a good way to continue that process.  I yield to my friend.
