 President, again I raise a budget point of order. I ask unanimous consent it be exactly the same as the previous one on the last two bills. I ask unanimous consent to waive all provisions of the Budget Act and budget resolutions necessary for the consideration of the pending amendment to this bill and for the inclusion of the language of the pending amendment in the consideration of one amendment between the Houses--an amendment.
