President, I am pleased that today the Senate will consider and confirm Judge Christina Reiss to a seat on the U.S. District Court in Vermont. Judge Reiss will be the first woman to serve on that Court.  As the senior Senator from the State of Vermont, I was honored to recommend Judge Reiss to President Obama for this post. She has considerable criminal and civil experience, and is extremely qualified. For the past 5 years, she has been a State trial court judge in Vermont--a position to which she was appointed by Governor Jim Douglas, a Republican, and confirmed unanimously. She formerly was a partner in two Vermont law firms. Judge Reiss earned her B.A. from my alma mater, Saint Michaels College, and earned her J.D. with high honors from University of Arizona College of Law, where she was editor-in-chief of the law review.  Judge Reiss has been nominated to fill the vacancy created when my good friend, Judge Garvan Murtha, announced his intention to take senior status on the court. It is the first vacancy on this court since 1995, when the Senate confirmed Judge Murtha and Judge William Sessions. Judge Reiss will make an excellent addition to that court. She has already demonstrated as a state court judge her ability to relate to litigants of many backgrounds, and knows how important it is for judges to possess an understanding of the effects of legal rulings on people's lives.  In making this recommendation, I looked to Vermont's Judicial Nominating Commission, a practice I started with the late Senator Robert Stafford, a Republican, and a practice I have continued to follow. The Commission that helped select Judge Reiss was comprised of a nine member non-partisan panel appointed by me, Senator Sanders, and the Vermont Bar Association, and we were aided in the selection process by input from Congressman Peter Welch. The non-partisan, merit-driven process is a good fit for our approach to government in Vermont.  Senators of both parties have clearly seen that Judge Reiss has all of the qualities that are important on the Federal bench. Earlier this week, Judge Reiss's nomination was reported from the Senate Judiciary Committee without dissent in a voice vote. I am confident that Judge Reiss is the right person for this position.  The Senate will also consider and confirm Abdul K. Kallon to the Northern District of Alabama, the home state of the Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee. Mr. Kallon's nomination has the support of both Senator Sessions and Senator Shelby, and was reported out of the Senate Judiciary Committee this week with approval by voice vote.  I congratulate Judge Reiss, Mr. Kallon and their families on their confirmations today.                          ____________________
