Ever since this administration created the National Ocean Policy through executive order,the subcommittee has asked the CEQ, the DOI, and the EPA to provide an estimate of the impact of the Policy on their budgets, and we have yet to receive a substantial answer.  The so-called report we were provided last year was fewer than three pages long. Clearly, this failed to outline expenditures supporting the administration's National Ocean Policy.  Our job here is to pay the bills. When we ask how much does the National Ocean Policy cost, we expect to get an answer. We need an answer so that proper congressional oversight can be conducted.  I want to point out that this language was included in the House fiscal year 2016 Energy and Water Appropriations bill. There are concerns about the costs and all of the unknowns related to this policy in multiple jurisdictions.  The bottom line is, if this administration wants the funds to implement the National Ocean Policy, then tell us how much it is going to cost the taxpayer. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this amendment.  Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
