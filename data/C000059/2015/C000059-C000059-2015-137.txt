Chair, I appreciate the gentleman's efforts on trying to clean the ozone out of the South Coast Air Quality Management District. We have to suffer the ozone that is being blown from L.A./Long Beach over into the Inland Empire. Certainly the ports of L.A. and Long Beach, the trains emit a lot of ozone and a lot of pollutants that end up in the Inland Empire, so we want to clean that air up.  As you know, we can't meet the 2008 standards at this time. We are doing everything we can to meet those standards, but until these communities can get the technology to meet the existing standard, we shouldn't impose a new standard that could cause grave economic harm to the communities.  With that, I would say ``no'' to this amendment and move on.  I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Lowenthal).  The amendment was rejected.  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will read.  The Clerk read as follows:                          hydraulic fracturing       Sec. 439.  None of the funds made available by this or any      other Act may be used to implement, administer, or enforce      the final rule entitled ``Hydraulic Fracturing on Federal and      Indian Lands'' as published in the Federal Register on March      26, 2015 and March 30, 2015 (80 Fed. Reg. 16127 and 16577,      respectively).                  Amendment Offered by Mr. Cartwright
