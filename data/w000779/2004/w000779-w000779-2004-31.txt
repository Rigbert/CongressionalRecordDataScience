President, I am pleased to be joined today by Senators Lott, Graham of Florida, and Snowe in introducing legislation to create an independent National Security Classification Board. We believe it is time to clear the fog of secrecy by creating an independent board to review current and make recommendations for new standards and procedures for the classification of information for national security purposes.  Our Founding Fathers believed in the idea that democracy works best with the full disclosure of accurate information. Today, some might find that notion quaint. But it is one that bears consideration--because the principle of open government so dear to America's founders is being tested today as never before. The culture of secrecy that grew out of the Cold War has now become woven into the very fabric of our daily lives.  Information that the American people have a right to know--indeed, information that the American people need to know to make informed decisions about the kind of government they want and the kind of country this should be--is being withheld by the Federal government. It is being buried in a virtual bunker marked ``do not enter,'' sealed off from public view with a big red stamp--marked ``Classified.'' And too often that big red stamp is used not to hide state secrets, but to protect political backsides at great cost to our open and democratic society.  A very revealing speech was delivered three weeks ago by the head of the Information Security Office, which oversees classification and declassification policies, Mr. William Leonard. Knownsometimes as the ``secrecy czar,'' he complained that the classification system for national security has lost touch with the basics; that some agencies don't know how much information they classify, or whether they are classifying more or less than they once did; whether they are classifying too much or too little. He called today's classification system ``a patchwork quilt'' that is the result of a hodgepodge of laws, regulations and directives. ``In reality,'' he said ``the Federal Government has so many varieties of classification that it can make Heinz look modest . . .''  Two important reports confirm Mr. Leonard's argument that the classification system is out of control. The reports, the forthcoming 9-11 Commission report and last week's Senate Intelligence Committee on Iraq, show the Administration's determination to blanket the Federal government in secrecy. Even more important than the information that is published in these reports is the information withheld from the public and redacted from the reports.  These reports demonstrate a serious imbalance of power between the public and the officials who wield the ``top secret'' stamp. They raise troubling questions about whether those who control the classification of information for national security purposes have misused this authority to shield officials from the glare of public accountability and to stifle public debate about politically sensitive parts of the war on terrorism.  This is not the first time our country has grappled with the trade-offs between the need to protect the public and the public's need to know. But the automatic default to secrecy rather than public accountability is not part of our history. Scholarly studies about which material should be classified and at what level fill libraries. According to the late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, an expert on secrecy in government, the first real Congressional debate about protecting national secrets occurred during consideration of the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798, passed to silence opposition to war with France. ``It was,'' as Senator Moynihan wrote in Secrecy, ``our nation's first experience with how war or the threat of war changed the balance between private liberty versus public order, an instability that was eerily reenacted 119 years later.'' ``Indeed, much of the structure of secrecy now in place in the U.S. government took shape in just under eleven weeks in the spring of 1917, while the Espionage Act was debated and signed into law.'' Eighty years later, Senator Moynihan would note that 6,610,154 million secrets were created in one year alone. In fact, only a small portion, or 1.4 percent, were created pursuant to statutory authority, the Atomic Energy Act; Senator Moynihan labeled the other 98.6 percent ``pure creatures of bureaucracy,'' created via Executive Orders.  One of the ``creatures'' in the classification menagerie was set free to roam through the work of the 9-11 Commission and the Senate Intelligence Committee's report. The American people should not be fooled--pure bureaucracy refused to allow full public disclosure of the decisions and materials used by the 9-11 Commission to prepare its report. Pure bureaucracy also redacted nearly half of the Senate Intelligence Committee's review of Intelligence on Iraq. The ``creature'' has overreached.  Since President Roosevelt issued the first national security classification directive in 1940, the American people have often demonstrated a high tolerance for secrecy in military and foreign affairs, even in some cases where it has been abused. However, the rising tide of secrecy has reached the point where it threatens to drown our system of checks and balances, and calls out for a complete rethinking of the system used to classify information for national security purposes.  Today the Executive Branch exerts almost total control over what should or should not be classified. Congress has no ability to declassify material. There is no self-correcting mechanism in the system. Even if Members of Congress wanted to share information with their constituents, it's so complicated for Congress to release information to the public that nobody's ever tried to use the convoluted processes. The Executive Branch has a little known group that can review classification issues, but it is seldom used and open only to Executive Branch employees, not to Members of Congress or the public.  What does all of this mean in practice? It means that with the thump of a stamp marked ``secret,'' some bureaucrat in the belly of a federal building has prevented the families of the victims of 9-11 from knowing exactly what happened to their loved ones. It means the American people may never know who gave the orders dictating how prisoners at Abu Ghraib could be treated. It means these decisions cannot be appealed, even by Congress. It means there is no independent review of the classification decisions by the Executive Branch.  With no chance of unbiased review, classification decisions are ready and ripe for abuse. Agencies wishing to hide their flaws and politicians of both parties wishing to make political points can abuse the existing classification guidelines to their advantage. I want to change that.  President Kennedy said the time to repair the roof is when the sun is shining. In the realm of secrecy, storm clouds are approaching. The bureaucracies in our government that deal with secrets are by nature cautious when it comes to protecting information pertinent to our nation's security. They err on the side of caution and they are very territorial about it, treating secrets as if they are assets to be traded. This is an understandable impulse. But erring too far and too often on the side of caution keeps a lot of information hidden that could safely enlighten public debate. Even worse, overclassification of information is dangerous. If agencies and bureaucracies aren't sharing information among themselves, important clues can be missed. Their mission to keep citizens safe can be jeopardized by classification itself.  The tragedy of 9-11, the war on terrorism and the United States' invasion of Iraq have offered ample opportunity to argue for classification of just about any document on the grounds of national security. Additionally, there are those who feel that the current Administration took office with an unhealthy penchant for secrecy already firmly in place. In its first two years, Bush Administration officials made 44.5 million decisions to classify records and related documents, according to the Information Security Oversight office, part of the National Archives and Records Administration. This is about the same number of classification decisions made during the last four years of the Clinton Administration.  The Atlanta Journal reported recently that ``federal, state and local governments are shutting down access to public records in what some experts say is the most expansive assault on open government in the nation's history.'' The Bush Administration has even expanded the number of officials with the power to classify documents for purposes of national security beyond the 13 agencies that operated under the national security classification system to include the secretaries of agriculture, health and human services and the EPA Administrator.  I for one do not subscribe to the view that there is an inherent conflict between the Executive Branch's accountability to Congress and the American people on the one hand, and the Constitutional role of the President as Commander in Chief on the other.  I believe a balance can and must be struck between the public's need for sound, cleareyed analysis and the Executive's desire to protect the nation's legitimate security interests. I believe we can fight terrorism ferociously without sacrificing personal privacy. There is no room in this equation for the use of classification to insulate officials and agencies from political pressure. As a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee I have had lengthy discussions with my colleagues about how to achieve such a balance.  In my view this balance can be achieved only through a broad overhaul of the national security classification system. Legislation that I will be introducing shortly will accomplish this through the establishment of an Independent National Security Classification Board. The Board would be made up of three individuals, knowledgeable in national security classification, appointed by the Presidentwith the advice and consent of the Senate.  The task of the Independent Board would be to review and make recommendations on overhauling the standards and process used in the classification system for national security information. The Board would submit proposed new standards and processes to both Congress and the Executive Branch for comment and revision, and then implement the new standards and process once they have had the opportunity to comment. The Board would then begin to implement the new system, reviewing and making recommendations on current and new national security classifications, subject to Executive Branch veto that must be accompanied by a public, written explanation.  The balance in this proposal assures that the public and Congress have access to an independent Board for national security classification matters while leaving undisturbed the Commander in Chief's constitutional prerogative in military and foreign policy matters through the power to appoint the Board and to veto the Board's classification decisions.  The Founding Fathers conceived of the Federal government to serve the American people. Sometimes that is done by keeping secrets, by securing information that could put Americans in harm's way if it became public. Information should be classified to protect the homeland. But when information is withheld to protect political careers and entrenched bureaucracies, that's not a service to the American people. It's a perversion of a policy intended to save lives, a perversion that weakens our democracy and could even endanger our people. It's time to throw open the curtains and let the sun shine in on American democracy and on the governmental process much brighter than it does today. That's what I intend to do with my legislation. The American people deserve no less.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2672       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
