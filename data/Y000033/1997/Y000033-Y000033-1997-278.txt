Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate Miss Black Alaska for hersuccess at the national Miss Black USA Pageant. Shannon Byrdsong represented Alaska well last Sunday February 23, 1997. Shannon is from Fairbanks, AK and is currently a student at the University of Oklahoma. Her parents, George and Vallie Byrdsong, made the trip from Alaska to proudly watch as their daughter advanced through the pageant held here locally at Howard University. After two nights of competition, Shannon ended as one of the top 15 finalists.  While in the finals, Shannon was awarded both the Presidential Award and the Fundraiser Award. The Presidential Award was to honor Shannon for her strong leadership abilities. It was to award her for contributions to the community, while maintaining strong academic achievement. The Fundraiser Award was for accomplishing the most community support. It is significant to acknowledge this award, as young women competed from large States like California, Florida, and Texas. This support speaks a great deal about Shannon Byrdsong, as well as, the community she calls home.                          ____________________
