 When the cartels are operating with such impunity that they do not hesitate to bribe officials on both sides of the border and, as ``Nightline'' has just pointed out, to buy up businesses along the border, the drug problem is not our problem alone. So the drug problem is a problem for both sides. What we need is a cooperative effort of both nations acting as full partners. Neither the United States nor Mexico can win this battle alone.  The report that the President has now committed to provide to the Congress on September 1 will be an important indicator of whether or not Mexico has taken the decision to approach this terrible problem in a cooperative partnership and in a fully committed way. Unless the report can cite significant and demonstrable progress in cooperation, the answer, very sadly, will be that Mexico has not yet taken such a decision. I hope that is not the case on September 1.  To me, this report is very meaningful. The point I want to make is that I believe the expectation of a majority of this body is that there be tangible and substantial steps taken that are visible, discernible, and real to combat the cartels and to stop the corruption, the bribing, and the sort of total disregard for law which is now characteristic of the situation.  I, for one, will watch the extradition picture especially carefully.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the May 14 letter from the President be printed in the Record, I thank the Presiding Officer for his forbearance, and I yield the floor.                                              The White House,                                     Washington, DC, May 14, 1997.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Dianne: Thank you for your letter regarding      counterdrug cooperation between the United States and Mexico.      I want to take this opportunity to tell you about my visit to      Mexico and the efforts my Administration is making to advance      our counternarcotics strategy in a bipartisan spirit.       President Zedillo and I had a full and frank discussion on      ways we can achieve greater progress toward attacking the      abuse and trafficking of illegal drugs. The Binational Drug      Threat Assessment Report that General McCaffrey and Attorney      General Madrazo presented to us sets forth in plain terms a      common view of all aspects of the drug phenomena striking at      our societies. On that basis, President Zedillo and I agreed      to form an Alliance Against Drugs, which commits our two      governments to prepare a common counterdrug strategy this      year to achieve 16 specific objectives.       These objectives, which reflect your own thoughtful      contributions, include reducing demand through anti-drug      information campaigns directed at our youth, bringing the      leaders of criminal organizations to justice through      strengthened law enforcement cooperation, attacking      corruption, fully implementing laws to combat money      laundering and increasing interdiction and eradication.      Achieving all these objectives in the short term is      unrealistic, but I believe we can make progress and that      President Zedillo's effort to restructure Mexico's anti-drug      forces is an essential starting point.       I want to keep the Congress informed of the progress we are      making toward achieving the objectives set forth in my 1997      National Drug Control Strategy and the U.S.-Mexico Alliance      Against Drugs. ONDCP Director McCaffrey will provide further      details on these issues to Members of both Houses in the near      future. My Administration will also provide the Congress by      September 1, 1997, a report covering each of the issues      contained in the Senate resolution passed in March as      elaborated in your recent letter and discussions with my      Administration. In addition, we will provide reports, as you      have requested, commenting on prospects for multilateral      hemispheric cooperation and on the feasibility of enhancing      truck inspections at the border.       I appreciate your continued efforts to work with my      Administration to ensure that our children face a future free      of drugs and the crime they breed.           Sincerely,                                                     Bill Clinton.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:
