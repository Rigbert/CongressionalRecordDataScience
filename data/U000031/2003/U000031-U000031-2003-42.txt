Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that the House is considering H.R. 3038, the Health Care Safety Net Amendments Technical Corrections Act of 2003. H.R. 3038 introduced by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), the subcommittee chairman, makes technical and conforming amendments to the Health Care Safety Net Amendments Act of 2002.  As Members may recall, this act strengthens several public health programs for low-income and underserved populations, including community health centers and the National Health Service Corps. Just this past week, a study conducted by GW University found that community health centers have helped to reduce health disparities in areas such as infant mortality, prenatal care, TB case rates, and age-adjusted death rates. This study highlights the impact that communityhealth centers are making in providing underserved Americans with access to affordable, high-quality health care.  H.R. 3038 strengthens the commitment that we have already made to community health centers. These changes are indeed technical, and they should be made to properly align the U.S. Code and clarify our original intent when we passed the bill last year. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
