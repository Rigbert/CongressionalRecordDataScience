Speaker, yesterday morning Akin Birdal, the President of the Human Rights Association of Turkey (IHD), was gunned down in his Ankara office. A right-wing squad has claimed responsibility for the attack which left Turkey's most vocal human rights critic comatose.  Since 1986, under Akin Birdal's leadership, the IHD has established itself as the largest independent human rights monitoring NGO in Turkey. Akim Birdal has appeared before the Helsinki Commission and met with its staff in Washington and Ankara. He is in high regard by legislators and diplomats around the world. In recent years he has received awards from the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, the International Human Rights Law Group and NGOs in Europe. Last year, he was elected Vice-President of the prestigious International Federation of Human Rights Leagues (FIHD).  This vile assault takes place against a backdrop of repression and intimidation against rights workers throughout Turkey. The Government of Turkey has criminalized non-violent human rights advocacy. Security forces and right-wing death squads have collaborated in the murders of human rights activities, Journalists, Kurdish dissidents and others. More than a dozen IHD offices have been closed by authorities and IHD leaders, including Mr. Birdal face continuous legal and other harassment.  Mr. Speaker, despite great personal danger, Akin Birdal and his colleagues dared to continue speaking against human rights violations by the State. The IHD has been especially critical of the ``dirty war'' waged against Turkey's Kurdish rebels. In recent weeks, the climate of intimidation escalated. Mr. Birdal reported numerous death threats against himself and his family. Unsubstantiated allegations by security officials leaked to the media stated that Birdal took orders from the PKK, an outlawed Kurdish guerrilla group. Mr. Birdal vigorously denied such allegations and denounced the ``primitive conspiracy'' orchestrated by Turkey's military rulers against their ``enemies list.''  Mr. Speaker, the shooting of Akin Birdal is a great tragedy for all who cherish human rights. His steadfast support for peace and non-violence is an inspiration to many in Turkey and abroad. IHD was working with NGOs around the world to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. On this auspicious occasion, itis sad to note deteriorating human rights conditions in Turkey and a steady slide towards outright military rule. Instead of supporting the work of independent human rights NGOs, which make significant contributions to development of civil society and the rule of law, the Government of Turkey instead represses them, labels their members ``terrorists,'' and makes them open targets.  Mr. Speaker, the United States Government supports Turkey militarily, economically and politically. Turkey is a NATO ally and member of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. I therefore welcome the settlement by the State Department spokesperson condemning the attack and urging that the perpetrators be brought to justice.  However, our government must do more to demonstrate our commitment to democracy in Turkey. If we truly value a stable and long-term relationship, we must not continue to ignore the fact that the military's predominance in politics precludes true democracy. The inability of military or civilian administrations to peacefully address the Kurdish problem or the rise of Islamic political activism remains a recipe for disaster. The resulting political instability fuels the climate in which human rights activists are attacked, free speech is curtailed and other fundamental freedoms eroded.  Mr. Speaker, as I speak today, my thoughts and prayers are with Akin Birdal, his family, his colleagues at IHD and all those in Turkey committed to the ideals of human rights and democracy. It is a sad day for all, and we can only hope that this incident will make people think and act seriously about the state of human rights in Turkey.                          ____________________
