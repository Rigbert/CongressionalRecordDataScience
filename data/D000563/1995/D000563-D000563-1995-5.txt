Speaker, last month the Federal Government was shut down by the gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Gingrich, and Mr. Dole for the longest period of time in our Nation's history. It cost American taxpayers $100 million a day for this political strategy, a manufactured crisis that sent 800,000 Federal employees home.  Most people thought that the Republicans had learned their lesson. America was not ready for that kind of political strategy. They found it childish and unnecessary, and yet here we are today in the midst of another Government shutdown, inspired and orchestrated by the same Republican leaders. They just do not get it. They do not understand that sending home some 300,000 Federal employees a few days before Christmas is beyond heartless, it is stupid, crazy for us as a Nation to be incurring debts of $80 million to $100 million a day because of someone's pride.  The American people sent Democrats and Republicans to Washington to solve problems, not to create them, not to say to people who are going to Federal agencies today that their phone calls will be unanswered and no one will be at the door. What they want us to do is to sit down in a commonsense, bipartisan way, deal with our budgetary problems, to make sure we protect Medicare and Medicaid, to make sure that we do not end up obliterating college student loan programs, and to bring a balanced budget in a reasonable period of time.  It is time for some of the political hubris to be set aside.
