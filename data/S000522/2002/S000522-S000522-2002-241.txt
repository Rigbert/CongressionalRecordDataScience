Mr. Speaker, as Chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I rise today to pay tribute to Mr. Roger R. Rapp, who on October 3, 2002, will be retiring after serving 30 years at the Department of Veterans Affairs.  Roger personifies the steadfast career civil servant. He began his federal career at the Veterans Health Administration in 1972, advancing through various positions which included field assignments at VA medical centers in Dayton, Ohio, and Washington, DC. Ultimately, Roger moved to the National Cemetery Administration (NCA), where he served as the director of the National Cemetery Area Office in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In 1987, Roger was named Director of Field Operations for the NCA. In March of 2000, his title was changed to that which it is today, Deputy Under Secretary for Operations. As the one responsible for operations and construction at NCA, Roger has personally visited each of the 120 VA National Cemeteries.  Roger's dedication to veterans and their families is apparent to all who know him, and he truly is a man with a vision. He has been a leading voice in ensuring the expansion of existing cemeteries, development of new national cemeteries, and expanding the State Cemetery Grants Program. Through his leadership, the number of national cemeteries increased from 103 in 1973 when NCA was formed, to the current 120; five new national cemeteries are currently in the planning stages.  It is said that Roger knows the majority of NCA employees nationwide on a first name basis, and he has devoted his career to helping all VA employees take pride in their jobs and focus on the needs of veterans. Owing to his leadership, NCA scored 93 percent on the American Customer Satisfaction Index, the highest score of any federal government entity. Roger was also instrumental in establishing the Director Training Programs to provide upward mobility and career advancement for VA employees throughout the system. Additionally, he's contributed significantly over the years to Leadership VA, the agency's executive development program.  Mr. Speaker, Roger Rapp is an advocate for veterans and has dedicated 30 years to this advocacy--20 years with the National Cemetery Administration alone. And when the situation called for it, he has done so with humor and selflessness. Indeed, Roger was a lucid and forthright witness when testifying before the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs. Thank you, Roger, for your dedication to America's veterans. You are leaving, a lasting legacy of dedicated federal service.                          ____________________
