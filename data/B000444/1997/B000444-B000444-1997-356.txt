 President, for the third consecutive Congress, I am introducing legislation to expand the Federal Government's $150 payment to States when they bury veterans in State-owned veterans cemeteries.  For those who are not familiar with my proposal, it is quite simple. My bill says that if a State buries a veteran free of charge in a State-owned cemetery--and that veteran is eligible for burial in a national veterans cemetery--the Federal Government will pay the State $150 for the cost of the plot.  In other words, Mr. President, rather than the multiple and restricted criteria of plot allowance payments to States under current law, there would instead be only one standard in judging whether a State receives assistance from the Federal Government. And, that standard is: Is the veteran eligible for burial in a national cemetery? Period.  Not only is it simple, it is the only thing that makes sense and the only thing that is fair. When the plot allowance for States was first established a decade ago, Congress did it in part to relieve the pressure on the national cemetery system. Our national cemeteries were filling up rapidly. That trend continues today. More than half of all national cemeteries are closed to additional burials, and there is no where near enough space for all of America's World War II veterans, let alone the veterans from later conflicts. So, rather than undertake the expensive process of building more national cemeteries, we entered into a partnership with the States for the creation of State-owned veterans cemeteries.  That partnership has worked well, especially in States like Delaware that do not have a national cemetery to begin with. But, after entering into this partnership, the Federal Government then limited for whom it would reimburse States for the cost of the plot. We said that States would receive the $150 payment only if the veteran was receiving disability compensation or a pension; died in a veterans hospital; was indigent and the body was unclaimed; or was discharged from the military due to a disability.  In other words, we ask States to bury all veterans eligible for burial in a national cemetery--but then we do not financially help them when they do.  And, States are not even being reimbursed for all wartime veterans that they bury. Let me repeat that. States are not being reimbursed for all wartime veterans that are buried in State-owned veterans cemeteries. I mention that, Mr. President, because some people have characterized this bill as an attempt to provide the plot allowance to States for the burial of nonwartime veterans, and an attempt to give a benefit intended for those who fought in wartime to those who did not. That is simply not the case.  There are thousands of wartime veterans who do not meet the current law's criteria. In fact, each year, about 5,000 veterans--many of them wartime veterans--are eligible for burial in a national cemetery and are buried without charge in State-owned veterans cemeteries, but do not meet the criteria set forth in current law for the States to receive the plot allowance. That is not fair to the States, and it is not right for America's veterans.  Mr. President, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated that this proposal would cost $1 million per year. While we all want to balance the budget--and this proposal will be paid for--$1 million per year is a relatively small sum in order to fulfill our commitment to America's veterans.  In 1995, the Senate recognized this in unanimously approving this proposal as an amendment to the budget bill. Whether this bill is voted on separately or as part of another measure, it does not matter. What matters is that we work to ensure that America's veterans are guaranteed a decent and dignified burial.  I encourage my colleagues to join me in this effort.                                 ______                                       By
