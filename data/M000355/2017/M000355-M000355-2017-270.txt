 President, this resolution concerns a request for testimony in a criminal action pending in Arizona State court. In this action, the defendant is charged with threatening to cause physical injury to Senator Flake and for trespassing on his Tucson, AZ, office. A trial is scheduled for November 29, 2017.  The prosecution is seeking in this case testimony from an employee in the Senator's office who witnessed the relevant events. The enclosed resolution would authorize that staffer, and any other current or former employee of the Senator's office from whom relevant evidence may be necessary, to testify and produce documents in this case, with representation by the Senate legal counsel.
