 We are joined in this effort by Senators Kerry, Frist, Sarbanes, Chafee, and DeWine.  Earlier today, our friends from the House, Chris Smith, John LaFalce, Spencer Baucus, Maxine Waters, Barney Frank met with us to announce the introduction of companion legislation on their side of the Hill.  Looking around at that group of people, it would be fair to wonder what we all have in common. Some days, not much. Today, however, what we have in common is a shared concern about the fate of the men, women, and children in the poorest countries of the world.  It is true that the war on terrorism has brought home to us more clearly than before that conditions of grinding poverty in the rest of the world are ignored at our peril. Common sense tells us that our national security is at risk in a world where millions of people have little to live for, and are ripe for the seductions of radical, even violent action against the desperate conditions they face every day.  As Tom Friedman has said in another context, if you don't visit the bad neighborhoods, they will visit you.  But that cannot be the only reason that we all share a concern about poverty in the underdeveloped countries of the world. All of the world's great religions charge us to look after each other, and show special concern for those who need it most.  Common decency recoils at the conditions of disease and deprivation faced by others while we are so blessed with abundance here.  Common sense, and common decency. That is what brought us all together today.  Few things offend both common sense and common decency more than the situations faced by the poor countries of the world who lack the resources to provide the most basic public health care and the most basic education, but yet still send money to the international financial institutions established by the wealthiest nations of the world.  They send two billion dollars a year here to Washington, home of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, and to the regional development banks around the world, to pay interest on loans they have taken out over the years, money that they desperately need for basic human services.  We set up those institutions to promote conditions for global economic growth and stability, and to promote economic development. And they do many good things. But the blessings that came when those loans went out to poor countries in many cases have turned into a curse. Now many of those countries are stuck in a debt trap, where payments to simply service the interest on those loans weaken their ability to provide the kind of essential public services needed for basic human existence, much less sustainable economic growth.  Tragically, most of the countries with the greatest debt burdens are among the worst victims of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. The resources needed in African countries in the fight against HIV/AIDS are already beyond their reach. The burden of debt makes that fight even harder.  Two years ago, the United States joined with the other members of the IMF and the World Bank to reduce the debt burdens of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries. The world's churches led that fight, the Jubilee 2000 fight, to undo some of the harm done by this cycle of debt. I was proud to be part of that effort.  The result was a real improvement in the debt situation of many countries. Our experience with that program shows that the money we free up with debt relief really does go for the important services the poor citizens of these countries really need.  As a matter of fact, about 40 percent of the debt savings in those countries is going for education, and 25 percent for health care.  But realistically, these countries will still be stuck in a debt trap far into the future.  In fact, just this week the Bank and the Fund honestly admitted that under the current formula, many countries will simply not reach a sustainable level of debt. James Wolfenson, President of the World Bank, has said that he is considering deeper debt relief to achieve the goals of the existing HIPC program. The legislation I am introducing today with Senator Santorum will make success under that HIPC program more likely.  Specifically, for the many countries facing a public health crisis, such as the HIV/AIDS epidemic, we say that no more than five percent of their budgets should go to service their debt to the international financial institutions. For those who do not face such a crisis, debt service should exceed no more than ten percent of their budget.  While the existing HIPC program sets a sustainable level of debt at 150 percent of a country's income from exports, our bill says that it is also important to measure the debt burden against a country's budget, as well. That's the best way to see the real impact on a country's ability to meet its own pressing domestic needs.  In fact, given the deep problems the eligible nations have with trade--most of them export basic commodities whose prices have been declining--using export income should not be the sole basis for determining their ability to pay. The HIPC program currently assumes that the eligible countries will enjoy much higher growth in that export income than they have ever been able to achieve. That is a formula for disappointment.  Deeper debt relief, more sustainable debt levels, measured by a country's actual ability to pay as a share of its budget, that is what our legislation would establish as the U.S. negotiating position at the Bank and the Fund. If those reforms are adopted, an additional billion dollars a year of debt service will be lifted from the poorest nations.  This weekend, the Bank and the Fund will be meeting here in Washington, and I expect those very issues will be under discussion. The legislation we are introducing today offers a way to achieve the original goals of debt relief, and the goals of our own foreign policy in the developing world.  Common sense, and common decency, should help us find some common ground to achieve those goals. The broad coalition of support this legislation already enjoys tells me that we can succeed.                                 ______                                       By
