William Beatty, who has been recognized by the Hammond Rotary Club as an outstanding club member who has demonstrated consistent achievement in mentoring young men and women in the community of Hammond and throughout Northwest Indiana. His devotion to teaching young people the importance of community service is to be commended. For his outstanding efforts, he will be presented with the Robert V. Heinze Vocational Service Award by the Hammond Rotary Club on Tuesday, June 1, 2010.  The Hammond Rotary Club was established in 1920, adhering to the principles of Rotary International: ``World Peace through Understanding'' and ``Service above Self.'' These values are vigorously upheld by the Hammond Rotary Club members, who passionately serve their community. Each year, the club recognizes an individual or organization who enthusiastically reaches out to the youth of the community by honoring the recipient with the Robert V. Heinze Vocational Service Award, and this year's recipient is William ``Bill'' Beatty.  Bill Beatty grew up in Hammond, Indiana and is a proud graduate of Hammond High School. He went on to attend Purdue University where he studied mechanical engineering. After college, Bill joined the family business, which at the time was called Beatty Machine, and is now known as Beatty International. In 1975, Bill succeeded his father and became the company's leader. In addition to his amazing career, Bill has been involved with the Hammond Rotary for many years and is recognized for his work with the youth of the community as well as his positive attitude and contagious laugh. He has been the inspiration behind the Hammond Robotics Team, a science and technology competitive team, and has led these students to many State, regional, and national championships. In addition, he has assisted other school districts in forming their own robotics teams. His willingness to encourage and guide the youth of the community is constant and unwavering, and it is because of his efforts that he is the recipient of the 2010 Robert V. Heinze Vocational Service Award.  Bill's dedication to the community and his career is exceeded only by his devotion to his amazing family. Bill and his wonderful wife, Lisa, have two beloved sons, Brian and Jeff.  Madam Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating Bill Beatty on receiving the Robert V. Heinze Vocational Service Award, and in honoring the Hammond Rotary for their outstanding contributions to the community of Hammond and all of Northwest Indiana. Their constant commitment to improving the quality of life for countless individuals in Northwest Indiana is truly inspirational, and they are worthy of the highest praise.                          ____________________
