I yield myself an additional 30 seconds.  I am glad you brought up the interfaith aspect of this as well. I actually chaired another hearing on anti-Semitism just several months ago, and the chief rabbi from the Ukraine came and testified and gave very powerful testimony as to how the faith community is working side by side to mitigate and, hopefully, end the cruelty of anti-Semitism while simultaneously working with Christians and others on behalf of human rights.  Again, this demonstration of the faith community should go noted by everybody in this Chamber and, I hope, by everyone in the world.  I reserve the balance of my time.
