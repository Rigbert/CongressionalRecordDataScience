Mr. Speaker, it is very difficult to stand on the floor of the House to question whether those in power deliberately misled and deceived the American people and the community of nations. However, the events in Iraq leave me no other choice.  Our President, Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense and Undersecretary of Defense told the men, women and children of this Nation and of the world that we must go to war in Iraq because the country had weapons of mass destruction. Time and time again, they told us that Iraq posed a clear and present danger to the health, well-being and life of our people.  Why? Because Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and was prepared to use them or give them to terrorists who would use them.  So where are the weapons that President Bush promised?  Saddam is gone. For several weeks, American troops have been free to search Iraq. They have been free to search Iraq, virtually at will. Today we find no weapons of mass destruction. No chemical weapons, no biological weapons, no nuclear weapons. Nothing.  Where are the weapons? Where is the threat?  Mr. President, where is your justification for war? The credibility of this administration is at stake.  Americans died in Iraq because President Bush told us that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. Children lost their mothers and fathers. Parents lost their sons and daughters. Women lost their husbands, and husbands lost their wives.  For what?  Excuses and explanations cannot answer this question. We need, we deserve, we demand justification.  What justified the loss of American lives? What justified taking $100 billion out of the pockets of our children, our grandchildren and unborn generations?  Three major American news organizations have cited leaks from Federal intelligence officials that the Bush administration manipulated intelligence about weapons of mass destruction, that the President and his advisers told the intelligence community to provide evidence to support the war in Iraq.  In Britain, senior war correspondent Max Hastings, who supported the war against Iraq, wrote that ``the Prime Minister committed British troops and sacrificed British lives on the basis of a deceit, and that stinks.''  These accusations cannot go unanswered. We are not just talking about the veracity of the Bush administration. We are talking about the credibility of the United States of America. Our Nation's reputation is at stake.  The next time we go to our allies, the next time we go to the United Nations, they will doubt what we say. Our enemies will be safer, and our citizens will be less secure.  The President and members of his administration have an obligation to come clean, to put their cards on the table and level with the American people. What did they really know and when did they know it?  They are the ones who toured the country, beating the drums of war. They are the ones who told the American people that we needed to go to war. They are the ones who traveled the globe campaigning for a war to save us all from weapons of mass destruction.  In the name of our fallen soldiers, in the name of the credibility of the United States of America, in the name of what is right and just and true.  We need an answer, and we need it now.                          ____________________
