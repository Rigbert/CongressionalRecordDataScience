President, to many Vermonters, Joel Najman is part of rock-and-roll radio history. Taking the reins of the Vermont Public Radio show ``My Place'' 30 years ago this spring, he captivated rock-and-roll enthusiasts from around the region and staked his claim in Vermont radio history.  Marcelle and I have known Joel for many years and have followed his career with great interest. Starting in radio at Vermont's own Middlebury College, Joel went on to WJOY in South Burlington and continues to work WDEV in Waterbury, in addition to hosting ``My Place'' on Vermont Public Radio.  Joel first joined ``My Place'' as a substitute host in 1982. After taking over full time in 1983, he took the show far beyond an ``oldies rock radio hour'' and made it his mission to apply cultural and historical context to rock music for his listeners. In each hour-long episode, he examines rock-and-roll history, providing his listeners with details that often take years to accumulate. He has even been known to spend his entire radio hour picking apart a single song.  In 2004, he was inducted into the Vermont Broadcaster's Hall of Fame, and the Vermont State Legislature recently passed a resolution honoring him as a ``rock and roll impresario.'' Today, I would like to congratulate Joel for his 30 years as host of ``My Place.'' I ask unanimous consent an article from the Vermont publication, Seven Days, entitled, ``Vermont Legislature Honors `My Place' Host Joel Najman'' be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                    [From Seven Days, Apr. 26, 2013]        Vermont Legislature Honors ``My Place'' Host Joel Najman                            (By Dan Bolles)       On Wednesday, April 24, the Vermont Legislature surprised      Joel Najman with a resolution congratulating the local DJ on      his 30th anniversary as the host of the Vermont Public Radio      show, and rock-and-roll time machine, ``My Place.''       ``My Place'' was originally hosted by David Field and began      life as a wide-ranging, interactive retrospective of rock and      roll from the 1950s and '60s. But Najman dramatically      revamped the show's format when he took over in 1983, after      serving as a substitute host the year prior.       Najman is as passionate a musicologist as he is a fan,      which is really saying something. In each hourlong episode,      he hones in on a specific theme or topic, sometimes      sharpening his focus to a single song, and examines its      historical context and cultural importance in painstaking      detail.       He's said those details can take years--yes, years--of      sleuthing to fully unearth. Recent episodes of ``My Place''      have explored the first and second waves of the British      Invasion, Berry Gordy's pre-Motown canon and ``Popular Songs      About Women.''       ``There are a lot of oldies stations, and you can buy      oldies CDs, or go online and MP3 them or however you want to      get the music,'' said Najman in a 2007 interview with Seven      Days celebrating his 25th anniversary. ``But it's relating it      to the evolving culture of that time and the stories behind      the songs--how they came about, how they were made--which has      always been my hobby.''       Some hobby.       If you're into stiff, overly formal verbiage with lots of      ``Whereas''-es, you can read the full resolution here.      Whereas, if you'd like to hear from the man himself, Najman      will appear as a guest on VPR's ``Vermont Edition'' on      Monday, April 29.       Whereas, you could also listen to ``My Place'' on VPR      Saturdays at 8 p.m.       Congrats, Joel.                          ____________________
