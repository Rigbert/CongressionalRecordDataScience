 Feinstein, Ms. Collins, Mr.         Smith of Oregon, and Mr. Bennett):  S. 2194. A bill to hold accountable the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Palestinian Authority, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, on behalf of the Senator from California and myself, I offer the Arafat Accountability Act. This act seeks to create conditions more conducive to stopping the senseless violence and flow of innocent blood in the Middle East.  The act takes aim at the weakest link in ongoing efforts to negotiate a political solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict--PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat. His leadership has been marked by repeated failures--failure to forcefully denounce and terminate the spree of horrific homicide bombings, failure to serve as a credible and reliable partner in peace, and failure to fulfill the aspirations of the Palestinian people for stability, economic opportunity, and a viable homeland.  Instead, he has acquiesced to terror and violence. Documents seized during recent counterterrorism operations on the West Bank reveal his personal involvement in financing and supporting terrorism against Israeli civilians. The successful interception of a cargo vessel from Iran earlier this year--loaded with offensive weaponry destined for the Palestinian Authority--should have conclusively proven that Chairman Arafat was, at best, a balky partner in peace, or, at worst, a foe of any meaningful reconciliation.  The terrorist attacks against Israel must come to an end. And they must end on terms that safeguard the lives and livelihoods of innocent Israeli and Palestinian civilians. Much like our war against the Taliban and al-Qaida in Afghanistan, Israel is rotting out terrorist cells and destroying their networks.  It is no understatement that the Israeli military is undertaking its operations with precision and professionalism that no other army in the region could exert.  The Arafat Accountability Act will not frustrate or derail the important efforts of the administration to secure a political solution to the ongoing strife. Rather, it places critical incentives to ensure that Chairman Arafat and the Palestinian Authority do not deliver a fatal blow to the prospects for peace.  Specifically, the act denies a visa to Arafat and other senior PLO officials to travel to the United States, downgrades the PLO's representative office here in Washington, restricts the travel of senior PLO officials at the United Nations, and seizes the assets of the PLO and the Palestinian Authority and Arafat in the United States. It also requires the administration to report to Congress on any acts of terrorism committed by the PLO or its constituent elements.  Importantly, the bill provides the President with flexibility in determining the sanctions, but it is my expectation that they would remain in place until a cease-fire is achieved and the Tenet plan implemented. These are the very same short-term goals that Secretary Powell has been trying to achieve over the last few days.  We should not forget that in 1993 Arafat himself committed the PLO to ``a peaceful resolution of the conflict,'' so we are not holding Arafat to any higher standard than he established for himself already.  I would offer that Arafat should have listened more carefully to Secretary Powell when he said to the Nation and the world from the McConnell Center for Political Leadership at the University of Louisville last year that solutions to this conflict ``will not be created by teaching hate and division, nor will they be born amidst violence and war.''  I emphasize that it is not my intent to push this bill to a vote on the Senate floor at this time. We should give the President and his advisers more time to pursue their objectives in the region.  It is my intent, though, and the intent of the Senator from California, to send a powerful signal to Chairman Arafat and the Palestinian Authority that the Senate will not stand idly by while they talk peace in English and practice terror in Arabic.  No progress toward a political solution to this conflict will be made until and unless Yasser Arafat forcefully, clearly, and repeatedly condemns homicide bombings and other acts of terrorism against Israel and takes concrete measures to restrain Palestinian extremists.  The bill we introduce today puts added pressure on Arafat and the PLO to be responsible and responsive partners in peace. There is no room for further failure on Arafat's part. He must either lead his people toward peace or get out of the way.  Let me close by commending President Bush and his administration for their superb conduct in the ongoing war against terrorism. They certainly have my full support in this endeavor--be it in the West Bank or in Gaza or, for that matter, in Iraq.  My colleagues and I are looking forward to hearing from Secretary Powell when he appears before the Foreign Operations Subcommittee next week.
