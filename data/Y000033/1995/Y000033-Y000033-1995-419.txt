Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate both the Anchorage Neighborhood Housing Services and the National Bank of Alaska for being nationally recognized by the Social Compact in its 1995 Outstanding Community Investment Awards program for their partnership achievement: the rehabilitation of a historic downtown property into a mixed-use rental and retail development. ANHS and NBA were selected from over 160 applicants from across the country for their highly effective and innovative community investment strategies.  The project, known as the Loussac-Sogn Limited Partnership, marked a series of firsts in Anchorage: National Bank of Alaska [NBA] was the first financial institution in Alaska to purchase historic and low-income housing tax credits, Loussac-Sogn was the first housing built downtown since 1980, and it was the first limited partnership between a nonprofit and financial institution to provide for the housing needs of low-income individuals.  The shortage of affordable housing in Anchorage is critical. Significant increases in number of low- and moderate-income residents and a concurrent loss of almost 1,000 substandard housing units between 1988 and 1990 created the severe shortage. A decline in per capita income caused by a shift in the economy from oil-based jobs to service jobs also contributed to the problem. The affordable housing available in the Loussac-Sogn Single Rental Occupancy [SRO] building is helping alleviate the situation.  Located in Anchorage's downtown business district, this historically significant, 42,000 square foot art moderne structure was rehabilitated and preserved according to national historic standards. The building will be placed on the National Historic Register in 1996. It includes retail businesses on the ground floor and 52 renovated and furnished single room occupancy housing units on the upper floors. Residents, very-low income adults, will stay at Loussac-Sogn as the first step in a continuum of housing provided by Anchorage Neighborhood Housing Services [ANHS]. Support services, provided through a case management system, will also help the residents more successfully bridge a transitional period before finding permanent, independent housing.  The project could not have been completed without NBA's leadership and participation throughout the process. They assisted with the complex acquisition of the land and building. The bank convinced the landowner that the creation of low-income housing would be within its purpose as a charitable organization, and then they negotiated with the building's owners to settle litigation so that it could sell the property to ANHS at a reasonable price. NBA also provided funds in acquisition and renovation equity and a construction loan with $1.55 million in financing through the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation. The additional financing needed to complete Loussac-Sogn was obtained through taxable bond financing and grants from the local historic preservation nonprofit, the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation, and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Seattle. NBA also stepped in with needed support when ANHS assumed the role of general contractor in order to address unexpected hazardous materials abatement requirements.  The Loussac-Sogn SRO is an asset and enhancement of downtown Anchorage. The residents take an active part in the community and focus on particular problems such as crime prevention. Thanks to Loussac-Sogn, businesses have learned about the positive effects of low-income housing.                          ____________________
