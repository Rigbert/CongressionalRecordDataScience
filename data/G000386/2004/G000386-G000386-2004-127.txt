 President, tomorrow, following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of the class action bill. The majority leader stated this morning that it is his desire to consider related amendments to the pending class action bill and finish the bill in a reasonable timeframe. It is our hope that progress can be made on the bill during tomorrow's session.  Again, to reiterate, this is a bipartisan bill, and I would encourage Senators to show restraint in offering nonrelevant amendments.                          ____________________
