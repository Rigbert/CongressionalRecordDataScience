This is the core of this bill. It's not enough, in my opinion, and I have made that clear and made some angry by saying that, as has the chairman.  But it is a good, solid down payment and a solid core for an American recovery with these investments. Stop talking just about one-note tax cuts. They didn't work for George Bush. They are not going to work today. We need to begin real investment and rebuilding our future, transportation infrastructure. This is the core of this bill.
