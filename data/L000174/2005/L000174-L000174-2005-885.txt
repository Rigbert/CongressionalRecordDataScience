She was 76.  Ginny Cochran was a native Vermonter originally from Hartland Four Corners. Like her husband Mickey who died in 1998, she attended the University of Vermont. Over the years, the Cochran name became synonymous with Vermont skiing. Ginny and Mickey established their own ski area where thousands of children learned to ski. They instilled a competitive spirit in each of their four children who went on to become internationally known ski racers. One daughter, Marilyn, won a World Cup race in 1969, and another, Barbara Ann, won an Olympic gold medal in 1972. Several of Ginny's grandchildren are already outstanding ski racers.  Ginny Cochran was one of those lifelong Vermonters who personified the essence of what it means to be a Vermonter. She loved the four seasons, she was loved by her community, and she taught countless people how to enjoy freezing weather and beautiful scenery while gliding down snow covered mountains with style.  I ask that a February 6, 2005, article in the Burlington Free Press about the extraordinary life of Ginny Cochran be printed in the Recrod.  The article follows.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Burlington Free Press, Feb. 6, 2005]                  Skiing Matriarch Ginny Cochran Dies      Mother of Olympians taught thousands to love the sport, and                              sportsmanship                            (By Susan Green)       Virginia Davis Cochran, whose name has been entwined with      Vermont's skiing heritage for more than four decades, died      Saturday morning at age 76.       Cochran, known as Ginny, started the Cochran Ski Area in      Richmond with her husband, Mickey, in 1961 and over the years      taught more than 10,000 children to ski. She also helped her      own four children and 10 grandchildren become top skiers--     with some joining the U.S. Ski Team and one winning an      Olympic gold medal.       Cochran died at Vermont Respite House in Williston of      complications from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Mickey Cochran      died in 1998.       The Cochran Ski Area began as a family affair when the      couple moved to a former dairy farm along the Winooski River.      They soon constructed a rope tow for their children: son Bob      and daughters, Marilyn, Barbara Ann and Lindy.       Barbara Ann went on to earn the 1972 Olympic gold medal in      slalom at Sapporo, Japan. In 1969, Marilyn was the first      American to win a World Cup in the giant slalom.       ``From the start, neighbors wanted to ski their hill,''      said David Healy, a friend of the Cochrans, ``so Ginny opened      her back door and welcomed them in. Her kitchen became the      lodge.''       The ski area was a modest business offering affordable      access to the sport. ``They ran a small mom-and-pop      operation,'' Healy said, ``and it's the nation's first      nonprofit ski area.''       In the winter nowadays, 800 schoolchildren come to ski at      Cochran's each week, he said.       Cochran also ran the town's after-school ski program for 35      years as a volunteer, Healy said.       Ginny Cochran, who hailed from Hartland Four Corners, met      Mickey on a ski trip to Stowe while both were UVM students in      the late 1940s. They married in 1949 and moved to Windsor,      where Mickey taught high school science.       ``They skied with their kids at Mount Ascutney,'' Healy      said, ``but they came back to Burlington in 1958. He worked      as an engineer at General Electric.''       With the purchase of about 190 acres in Richmond, however,      the Cochran clan didn't have to stray far from home to      indulge their love of the slopes.       ``The kids were already racing at Smugglers' Notch,'' Healy      said. ``Mickey recognized they needed to practice during the      week. His goal was to give them a place to train after      school.''       Peggy Farr, who met the Cochrans when they arrived in      Richmond, remembers the early years at the ski area.       ``When the kitchen was still the lodge, one day Ginny had      made brownies for her family. My son Chuck spent a lot of      time at their house. He and his pals ate them all,'' she      recalled with a laugh.       By way of a belated apology, the now-grown Chuck Farr and      his wife made brownies for Ginny Cochran on her 75th birthday      in March 2003.       ``She had a great influence on so many children,'' Peggy      Farr said. ``Two of my three kids and all my grandchildren      learned to ski there.''       Ditto for Marvin Carpenter, who grew up nearby on what      would later be called Cochran Road.       ``There'd be 60 or 70 of us kids waiting in line for their      rope tow on a knoll behind the house,'' he said. ``We'd tramp      through the kitchen with our ski boots on, open the fridge.      If you needed gloves, they gave you gloves. The Cochrans made      trampolines we could jump on as part of our ski training. In      the summer, Ginny took us swimming. She was a mother to the      whole community.''       Carpenter, who now owns the Bridge Street Cafe in Richmond,      boasts that Ginny Cochran ``called me her second son. Of      course, there are about nine other guys who make that      claim.''       The Cochran skiing philosophy, Carpenter said, has always      been to teach parents who would in turn teach their children.      When it came to ski lessons, ``Ginny was a tough      taskmaster,'' he said.       ``Ginny never pulled any punches,'' said her friend Jack      Linn, who got to know her in 1978. ``She was direct as all      get-out, thanks to her old Vermont stock.''       As the ski area grew in popularity, the Cochrans added to      the property. They bought another 140 acres in 1965. The      facility includes eight trails, four lifts and a T-bar. Other      lodges were built, allowing the family to reclaim its      kitchen; the most recent one went up in 1984.       Although skiing was central, Ginny Cochran had other      interests. ``She was an avid tennis player and loved      bridge,'' said Linn, her bridge partner.       ``Ginny was very competitive at everything she did,'' noted      Carpenter, who participated in the regular card games, ``She      also bicycled and walked a lot. This was a busy lady. I      remember the calendar in her kitchen had activities written      down on every day of the week.''       Linn surmised that her legacy is the kind that endures.      ``Ginny was a supercitizen of Richmond.''                          ____________________[Pages S1195-S1196]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS                                 ______                                                          VIRGINIA DAVIS COCHRAN
