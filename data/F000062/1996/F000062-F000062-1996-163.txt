 President, I recently delivered a speech to the World Affairs Council of Los Angeles. I took the opportunity to lay out some of the areas in which I believe the United States needs to improve its policy toward the People's Republic of China. I thought my colleagues would find this speech to be of interest. I ask that the full text of the speech be printed in the Record.  The speech follows:                    China: Where Do We Go From Here?  (Remarks of U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein to World Affairs Council,                             April 11, 1996)       It is a great pleasure to be in the City of Los Angeles.      And it is my honor to be introduced by such a distinguished      resident of this great city.       I'm delighted to be at the World Affairs Council, I've had      the privilege of speaking at the World Affairs Council in San      Francisco on several occasions, but never in this major      capital city, so I'm delighted to be here.       I want to share with you today some candid thoughts that I      have about what I believe to be one of the most important      issues for peace and stability in the world today: The     current crisis in negotiations on Sino-American relations,      and to discuss for a moment how we can forge a new, and      better, era in this important relationship.       One hundred years from now, I have no doubt that when      historians look back, the remarkable rise of China as a world      power will be considered one of the most important      international events of the latter half of the twentieth      century.       More than the tragic war in Bosnia, more than the unsteady      march toward peace in the Middle East, more even than the      collapse of the Soviet Union, China's ascendence as a great      power--and the content and quality of U.S.-Chinese      relations--will shape the direction of global history in the      Pacific Century.       Following what the Chinese view as a ``century of      humiliation'' at the hands of western imperial powers, and      fifty years of war-lord rivalries, revolution, and economic      stagnation, China today is poised at the brink of a      remarkable renaissance.       For close to two decades the Chinese economy has grown by a      staggering 10% a year. China is now the world's 11th largest      exporter--that's where Japan was in 1980--and moving up fast.      By most estimates, by early in the next century China will      have the world's largest economy.       In a little more than a decade, U.S. trade with China has      grown from some $1.2 billion to over $50 billion per year.      China has emerged as a major presence on the world stage.       It is a shame that we do not have the benefit of the      hindsight that our children and grandchildren will have,      because I believe that most Americans--including many      policymakers--do not understand the magnitude or breadth of      the changes currently underway in China and what they mean      for the future peace and stability of Asia and, yes, the      world.                          U.S. Policy Missteps       This fundamental lack of understanding is unfortunate--and      could turn out to be tragic--because how we manage our      relationship with China will have a greater effect on      stability in Asia and peace in the world than nearly anything      else we do.       In recent months U.S.-China relations have reached perhaps      their lowest level since President Nixon's historic trip to      China in 1972. Our relationship is plagued by tensions in      nearly every area in which we interact: a large trade      imbalance; China's failure to curb pirating of U.S.      intellectual property; China's transfers of sensitive      weapons, nuclear materials and technology to Pakistan, Iran,      and others; clashing visions of human rights; most      importantly, U.S. concerns about Taiwan, Hong Kong, and      Tibet, these are perceived as deep threats to Chinese      sovereignty.       This situation is made even more complicated by domestic      politics in both countries.       In the U.S., the relationship between China and the U.S.      has been buffeted by the vicissitudes of a Presidential      election year and provocative Congressional actions. For      example, the recent Department of State Authorization      Conference Bill contains ill-advised policy mandates,      including an invitation for a 1996 visit by Lee Teng-hui to      the U.S. ``with all appropriate courtesies,'' and an      elevation of the Taiwan office in Washington.       In China, the lingering of Deng Xiaoping has prevented, in      a sense, the cementing of new leadership, resulting in      jockeying and in-fighting among China's political hierarchy.      It is difficult for any Chinese leader to take bold action to      improve relations with the United States for fear of being      accused of weakness.       Fundamental to the worsening of relations between our two      countries is the lack of any conceptual framework or long-     term strategy on the part of the U.S. policy with respect to      China--a strategy which sets specific goals for the      relationship five and ten years down the road.       Instead, U.S. policy has been reactive and ``event-     driven,'' responding to whatever happens to be the current      revelation, which generally concerns human rights. This calls      into question our entire relationship with China each time we      lurch from crisis to crisis.       A whole host of events have contributed to the current      downward spiral in our relations: Tiananmen Square, the sale      of F-16's to Taiwan, Congressional opposition to China's bid      for the Olympics, U.S. opposition to the construction of      Three Gorges Dam project, and Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui's      visit to the United States last year.       Each of these events has helped create the current      atmosphere. Let me say a few words about why these events      were so important.       Americans were understandably horrified by the globally-     televised scenes of Chinese tanks advancing on unarmed      civilians at Tiananmen Square in 1989. Unfortunately, those      images have come to color our perception of nearly every      aspect of the U.S. relationship with China. For most      Americans Tiananmen Square is all they know of the China of      today.       In the wake of Tiananmen, the U.S. made a number of policy      decisions that further antagonized China. In 1992, for      example, President Bush, who understands China better than      most Americans, made what, I believe, was an unfortunate      decision to sell 150 F-16 aircraft to Taiwan.       The sale, announced during an election campaign, was made      without strong evidence that Taiwan faced a significantly      enhanced threat from China that made these advanced military      planes necessary. For China, the sale was a violation of the      ``One China'' policy which has been the bedrock of Sino-     American relations since 1972.       China put forth an extensive effort to host the Summer      Olympic games in 2000: they built a large stadium, apartments      and several other facilities, and made a strong pitch to the      International Olympic Committee. This was going to be China's      introduction to the world--a moment of great national pride.       But, the U.S. reaction was distinctly negative. The House      of Representatives passed a resolution urging the IOC not to      give the games to Beijing and a majority of U.S. Senators      sent a letter urging denial to the IOC. The IOC decided, by      one vote, to give the games to Sydney, Australia, and, again,      China felt the sting of humiliation.       Another American effort to thwart Chinese development, from      China's perspective, has been our reaction to the Three      Gorges Dam project. This massive undertaking, designed to      generate power for the enormous Chinese market, is considered      a critical step in China's economic development program.       Anyone that has been to Beijing has seen the choking clouds      of high sulfur coal dust and lacking sufficient power for the      basic necessities of life for millions of its people, the      Three Gorges Dam represents an important national priority      for the Chinese. But the United States has criticized the      project, on environmental grounds and last year the      Administration indicated it would oppose multilateral and      U.S. financing of Three Gorges.       The current crisis in U.S.-China relations came to a head      last year with the U.S. decision to allow Taiwanese President      Lee Teng-hui to visit the United States last summer to      receive an honorary degree at Cornell University.       The Administration had told the Chinese--as late as May of      last year--that allowing the visit would be inconsistent with      the United States' longstanding ``One China'' policy.      Congress then voted overwhelmingly--myself included--to allow      this ``private'' visit, and the Administration changed its      policy about the visa.       The Chinese President, Jiang Zemin, learned of the decision      by reading it in the newspaper, as he told me when I visited      him in August. You can imagine what the impact was.       President Lee's visit, although billed as a private visit,      turned out to be much more than that. Members of the Senate      met him, he spoke at Cornell and spoke about opportunity for      representation in the United Nations. Again generating a deep      visceral reaction within the Chinese leadership, not only      within the leadership, and this is what Americans must come      to understand, but within the Chinese people itself. And this      gave rise to a new wave of nationalism among its people. The      Chinese showed their anger by overreaction-- engaging in      missile tests and live ammunition war games in the Taiwan      Straits just prior to the Taiwanese elections.       These provocative and unneccessary actions prompted      President Clinton to place two carrier groups in the      immediate area, sending a clear message that the U.S. would      not tolerate military action against Taiwan.       It is clear that none of us fully understood the depth to      which Taiwan presents a deep and fundamental sovereign      imperative to China. We must understand this if we are to      deal directly with China.       These events, occurring against a background of little      dialogue between our two nations and constant criticisms in      the American press, added to the strain and distance.       The Chinese, for their part, have contributed to the      downward spiral in our relations by failing to carry out      commitments made. For example, China's failure to carry out      last year's Intellectual Property Rights agreement signed      last May has cost American copyright-holders over $2 billion      in 1995, and less than full compliance with nuclear Non-     Proliferation and violations of missile reduction treaties      are areas which have drawn considerable and legitimate U.S.      concern.                       The Costs of U.S. Missteps       The consequence of this confused and reactive relationship      is that --precisely at the time when we should be doing      everything we can to strengthen and encourage reform in China      by increasing relations with the West--some in China believe      that the U.S. is intentionally encouraging China's increasing      hardline attitudes with the purpose of pushing China toward      an adversarial posture reminiscent of Cold War years with the      Soviet Union.       As you know, a long, drawn-out leadership struggle has been      going on in China for the past several years as the elderly      Deng Xiaoping has disappeared from public life. Although a      new leadership is in place, competitive forces within that      leadership appear to be growing stronger. Hardline actions      are more prevalent.       For example,       China's provocative war games in the Taiwan Straits leading      up to the Taiwanese election.       China's continued provision of sensitive nuclear and      missile technology to Pakistan.       The increasingly strong rhetoric toward Hong Kong, such as      announcing that the elected Legislative Council will be      dissolved and that Hong Kong civil servants will be required      to take an oath of loyalty to Beijing.       And just last week, when Chinese police tried to stop      fundraising for Chinese orphanages at a dinner attended by      U.S. Ambassador James Sasser and prevented Chinese-American      author Amy Tan from delivering a speech.       Additionally, U.S. policy has not enabled those within the      Chinese leadership who favor greater cooperation with the      West to advance their program. In my conversations with      President Jiang Zemin and Executive Vice Premier Zhu Rongji,      I have become convinced of their genuine desire to reach out      to the United States and build a much more cooperative      relationship. In fact, Deng Xiaoping himself, empowered Jiang      Zemin to be in charge of American relations and this was      ratified by the 14th People's Congress.       But to do that, they need our help. They need to be able to      engage in a genuine dialogue with U.S. leaders, at the very      highest levels. Our President and the President of China need      to be able to sit and talk face-to-face, and to pick up the      phone and call one another on a regular basis. But they do      not yet have that kind of relationship.       When the Administration decided not to invite President      Jiang Zemin to Washington for a state visit, I believe we      lost a valuable opportunity to give ``face'' and support to a      moderate, pro-Western leader, thereby enabling the Chinese to      see greater value in increased ties and pro-Western views.                       Most-Favored Nation Status       In approximately two months, Congress will consider whether      to grant the President's request to renew China's Most-     Favored Nation trading status. I believe this issue will      spark a definitive debate in the Congress on the future of      the United States' China policy.       The political implications of revoking MFN for China are      great, and dangerous. Revoking MFN would be seen, I believe,      as a complete break in U.S.-Chinese cooperation.       For a country such as China, where face and respect are      such central issues, revoking MFN--a trading status the U.S.      grants to all but a handful of rogue nations--would be seen      as tantamount to the United States telling China that we no      longer accept them as a member of the family of nations. More      importantly, thousands of businesses and millions of jobs in      this country and in China who are now dependent on MFN status      would be lost. To deny it would be shooting ourselves in the      foot. Also, our ability to work with the Chinese on other      trade issues, on Asian security, on non-proliferation, on      Taiwan, and on human rights would be severely diminished, if      not incapacitated.                       Where Do We Go From Here?       Many of you may be wondering if there is anything we can do      to repair a relationship that many feel has already been      irreparably harmed. As a Chinese proverb goes, ``Laughter      cannot bring back what anger has driven away.'' But there is      another Chinese proverb that is perhaps more relevant--``By      hard work one can succeed in moving two mountains to open a      road.''       First, we must elevate the importance of the relationship      with China. President Clinton, Secretary Christopher and high      officials must become much more directly involved. With      China, in many cases, the messenger is as important as the      message.       Most Americans know little of China and less about the      importance of this relationship. The President must speak to      Americans directly of the importance of this relationship and      make the case for an improved relationship to the American      people. He has not done so thus far. It must be done.       Secondly, Secretary Christopher who has visited China only      once, must devote to this relationship the same time and      energy as he has so effectively applied in the Middle East.       Third, we must realize that despite recent tensions, China      and the United States have many more common interests than is      generally realized, and we must build on those common      interests.       Four areas in which our shared interests outweigh our      differences include: Taiwan, trade, security and nuclear non-     proliferation, and improving the quality of life for people.       Taiwan: The role of the United States in constructing a      relationship between China and Taiwan must, by necessity, be      supportive. We should not attempt to impose a solution on      either party. The United States can, however, provide the      underlying stability for Chinese-Taiwanese cooperation by      continually and publicly reaffirming our commitment to a      ``One China'' policy.       We must also continue to encourage China to refrain from      aggressive military actions and rhetoric. The key to a      solution remains peaceful reunification. How and when that      takes place is up to the two parties involved. Our interest      must be to see that peace is maintained, to encourage the two      sides to talk, to be an honest broker.       Both Taiwan and China should be encouraged to restart the      Cross-Strait Initiative that was conducted by China's      Association for Relations across the Taiwan Strait and      Taiwan's Strait Exchange Foundation. This dialogue showed      much promise until it was derailed last summer. Even at the      nadir of relations earlier this year, Chinese Prime Minister      Li Peng renewed President Jiang Zemin's offer from last year      for a Taiwan-China summit. And the Chinese offer to begin      direct air, sea, and postal service with Taiwan can only be      beneficial.       Trade: Trade issues have all too often become flashpoints      in U.S.-China relations, with blame to be shared by both      sides.       This past January, while I was in Beijing, Executive Vice      Premier Zhu Rongji, who is in charge of Central Economic      Planning, told us that, effective this month, China will      lower tariffs by 34% across the board and bring its tariff      rate schedule in line with the average of developing      countries within two years.       Our Trade Representative, Mickey Kantor, told me that he is      now reviewing this proposed schedule. The U.S. should work      with China to increase U.S. exports to China, now growing at      a rate of 17% per year. China states it wants to increase      U.S. exports, and this would lower our trade deficit with      China. The U.S. should also review provisions of our laws      which restrict high value exports.       At the same time, the United States should continue to      insist that China live up to fair trade policies, in      particular, its agreements to protect U.S. intellectual      property rights. For example China must prevent the illegal      production of pirated CDS, CD-ROMs, and Lds.       The best way to accomplish this goal is the development of      joint ventures between U.S. copyright holders and Chinese      manufacturers, which could transform factories from illegal      to legal operations with little job cost. In January, I      presented to both the President, the Executive Vice Premier      and to the Trade Minister, a letter from the Recording      Industries of America containing a proposal that six major      American copyright holders are prepared to enter into such      joint agreements.       As I left China and was in Hong Kong, I noted that a      Chinese representative said, ``but we already have these      joint ventures.'' And that is exactly the key, the joint      ventures are not with the copyright holders, and in order to      carry out the intent of the law the venture must be with the      U.S. copyright holder.       As the world's 11th largest exporter and moving up fast,      China's entry into the World Trade Organization is strongly      in the United States' interests and holds the best promise      for preventing trade disputes from escalating into major      conflicts. Although it will take time, we need to continue to      work with China to help them develop the commercial legal      structure and fair trade policies that are necessary for      their membership in that organization.       Security: It is vital that China be engaged in a new      security partnership, one that is cooperative rather than      confrontational. With more than a fifth of the world's      population, a permanent seat on the United Nations Security      Council, and an arsenal of nuclear weapons and      intercontinental ballistic missiles, isolating China is a      very dangerous course.       Such a partnership suggests that China be encouraged to      become an active and responsible party to international      organizations, treaties, and regimes. As such, China should      be granted an equal say in setting the ``rules of the game.''      The corollary of this, of course, is that China must agree to      abide by those rules.       One area that immediately suggests itself as a testing      ground for this type of partnership is the threat of nuclear      proliferation in South Asia. China was helpful in preventing      nuclear proliferation in North Korea, a situation that still      remains problematic.       It is also clearly in the interests of both China and the      United States to ensure that tensions are de-escalated in the      highly unstable India-Pakistan relationship. Both India and      Pakistan have the ability to launch 10 to 20 kiloton nuclear      devices, that is twice the size of Hiroshima, in a matter of      weeks. Both countries are on China's Southern border, and      both suffer from major internal instability. Acting alongside      other local and regional powers, the United States and China      must work together to de-escalate growing tensions between      these two countries.       Quality of Life: Finally, despite the bad press that China      has received in this country of late regarding human rights,      I believe that here too there is opportunity for progress.      However, to believe that China will change its ways merely to      please America is naive. The real key to change is convincing      China that it is in China's interests to change.       We have tried lecturing China on individual human rights      cases, and have found that method to be unsuccessful. A more      productive approach would be to work with China to develop an      independent judicial system that can guarantee due process      and the rule of law--an area in which China has asked for our      help.       By engaging China in a larger dialogue about good      governance, through exchange programs, assistance in the      drafting of criminal and commercial codes, and in      establishing an independent judiciary with due process of      law, we will do much more to advance the cause of human      rights in China in the long run than through constant      castigation.       Even without our help, China is moving in this direction.      Last month, the National People's Congress enacted      legislation that provides individuals greater protection from      arbitrary punishment by police and government agencies, which      sets stricter standards on government agencies for imposing      fines and fees, and which requires the ruling State Council      to secure the approval of the People's Congress before      declaring martial law.       Evidence of the past twenty years suggests that China is      changing. You must remember back to the 1960's, when 10-15      million people were harmed or lost their lives. When I first      went to China in 1979, it was impossible to have an open      political discussion. People were simply too afraid.       Last month, international journalists openly interviewed      ordinary Chinese citizens     on the street about their views of the Taiwanese elections.      Some supported the government's response, others did not.      This change should not be underestimated. It is the      unavoidable result of improving conditions and interaction      with the West.       One has but to look back at the Cultural Revolution of 35      years ago to see the contrast and improvement in freedoms, in      the increasing standard of living, wages and savings, and      better education of the people, to know that things are      changing and improving. As Minister of Trade Wu Yi said to      me, ``It isn't easy to go from a China which has been ruled      by man for 5000 years to a China ruled by law.'' And that is      what is happening.       With the Taiwan elections behind us, we now have the      opportunity to move past some of the events that soured Sino-     American relations earlier this year.       To do this, President Clinton must immerse himself fully in      the details of this most delicate and critical of American      relations. In the final analysis, the goal of American policy      must be to encourage China toward a full and active      relationship with the West and to work together toward a      China that is able to take its role as a stable leader of      peace and security in Asia, and an America that can be her      ally.                          ____________________
