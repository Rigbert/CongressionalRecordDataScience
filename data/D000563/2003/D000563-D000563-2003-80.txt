That nominee is then given to the White House for approval and investigation, FBI background checks, the normal things. If the White House then clears that nominee, the name is sent to the Senate Judiciary Committee. A hearing is scheduled in the normal course where the person is brought before the committee. After the committee has done its investigation, questions are asked and then the person is brought for a vote and eventually finds their way to the floor.  Under the Clinton administration, after the nominee came out of the White House, 63 times, 20 percent of the President's nominees were stopped at that point and never brought to a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. So the argument that we have stopped four belies the reality that when we looked at the numbers from the Clinton administration, 20 percent, not 2 percent but 20 percent, of the judges never got their chance before the Judiciary Committee to even present their credentials and argue for their nomination.  I say to the Senator from Nevada, that is a sad reality. Frankly, this President is being treated far better than President Clinton. This Senate Judiciary Committee, under the leadership of Senator Patrick Leahy, a Democrat, approved 100 of President Bush's nominees, gave them hearings and moved them forward.  We tried in a bipartisan fashion to meet our constitutional responsibility. Only 4 times out of 172 have we said no. Only four. It is reasonable for us to stop and ask hard questions of nominees who are asking for lifetime appointments to some of the highest courts of the land.
