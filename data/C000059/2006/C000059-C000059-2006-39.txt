Speaker, last night, during a series of two-minute votes, I inadvertently voted ``no'' on rollcall No. 340. I had intended to vote ``aye.'' I would like to make it clear for the record, that I do not support the multilingual ballot provision in the Voting Rights Act, and that I oppose such provisions that mandate financial burdens on the states and further divide this great Nation.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Page E1328]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                          PERSONAL EXPLANATION                                 ______                                                             HON.
