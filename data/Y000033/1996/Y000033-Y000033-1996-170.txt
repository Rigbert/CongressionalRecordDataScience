Reclaiming my time, I had an opportunity, I wrote a good bill with the gentleman from California [Mr. Pombo] to solve this problem. But anybody who thinks the Endangered Species Act works, I would suggest he start reading it and seeing where this Government has gone out of whack, when they tell a woman she cannot take and raise grain on her ranch because there is a kangaroo rat. She stopped raising grain. The rats left because there was nothing to eat. It burned and burned the houses down in all the area.  This is the act that Members support. I am terribly disappointed to support an Endangered Species Act that does not protect the species, does not take and protect the private landowners, in fact, allows this Government to run amok. I am saying, let us change it. That is what I am saying.
