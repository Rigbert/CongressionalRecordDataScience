Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to a great statesman and leader in the State of Maryland. With the death of former state Senator Frederick C. Malkus, Jr., on November 9, Maryland, as well as the entire Country, lost a great patriot and a dutiful public servant.  Frederick C. Malkus, Jr. died at the age of 86, having spent all of his adult life in the service of his fellow citizens. Senator Malkus, a conservative Democrat, served in the legislature for 46 years--12 in the House of Delegates and 34 in the Senate--before retiring in 1994. Upon his retirement, he was the longest serving State Legislator in the United States.  Born July 1, 1913, in Baltimore, Senator Malkus moved to the 380 acre Egypt Road farm, nine miles outside of Cambridge, on Maryland's Eastern Shore where he was raised there by his aunt and uncle. He spent the past 83 years on the working farm that produces wheat, corn, and soybeans. He graduated for Western Maryland College in 1934 and received his law degree four years later from the University of Maryland Law School. During World War II, Senator Malkus served in the U.S. Army and rose to the rank of major. He returned to Maryland and in 1947 won a seat in the House of Delegates.  He was, Mr. Speaker, an unforgettable individual who was a wonderful servant to Maryland and America. To know Fred Malkus was to know how deeply he cared for rural America and more specifically for the Chesapeake Bay region. Senator Malkus was at the forefront of the fight to save the Bay. Even though he was pro-business in his views, he was a great environmentalist. His legacy will no doubt live on and serve as a model for future leaders of our State and our Country.  Senator Malkus is survived by his wife of 41 years, the former Margaret ``Maggie'' Moorer, his son, Frederick C. Malkus III, two daughters, Margaret Elizabeth ``Betsy'' LaPerch, and Susan Moorer Malkus, and three grandsons.                          ____________________
