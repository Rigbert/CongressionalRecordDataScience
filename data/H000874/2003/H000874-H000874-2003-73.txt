I thank the gentleman for that.  The continuing resolution, Mr. Leader, you point out there will be a continuing resolution that, perhaps, will be considered next week. The current one goes to October 31.  Can you tell the Members what date you contemplate the continuing resolution going to?  Mr. DeLAY. If the gentleman will yield further, we have not consulted with everyone yet, and certainly we will consult with the minority, but in talking to the other body, our goal would be to complete the first session by November 7. So, hopefully, the continuing resolution would match that timetable.
