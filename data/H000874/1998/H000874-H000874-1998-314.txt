Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Francis J. Salveron. Mr. Salveron, 88, a retired Air Force master sargeant and personal aide to General Douglas MacArthur during the general's triumphant return to the Phillipines, died August 23, 1998 at this Bladensburg home.  Mr. Salveron was about 32 years old when he enlisted in the U.S. Army in Australia. He served for 10 years as a purser on a luxury liner sailing between the Phillipines and Australia. In 1942, Mr. Salveron's ship, the S.S. Mactan, was one of the few ships to survive the Japanese invasion.  In February 1942, Mr. Salveron was aboard a U.S. transport ship sailing from Melbourne to the Phillipines where the ship was met by Japanese zero fighter planes and sunk. Mr. Salveron and about one-third of the ship's crew survived. They floated in the sea for almost 12 hours before being picked up. The survivors were then transported to Melbourne for a recovery period. It was shortly after that Mr. Salveron was ordered to join General MacArthur in New Guinea to be his personal aide. For three years he personally served the general. Mr. Salveron was with General MacArthur as they took the first step off the landing barge to wade ashore on October 20, 1944 on Red Beach, Leyte. General MacArthur had fulfilled a promise to the Phillipine people and spoke those famous words, ``I have returned.''  After the war, Mr. Salveron left General MacArthur and reenlisted in the Air Force,where he became part of the official flight crew of, then, General Dwight D. Eisenhower. Mr. Salveron went on to serve as part of the crew for the U.S. Secretaries of Defense and State until his retirement in 1963.  Upon retirement, Mr. Salveron went on to devote his life to volunteer work in the city of Bladensburg, in my home State of Maryland, and to preserving the MacArthur legend. He went on to found the General Douglas MacArthur Post of the Veterans of Foreign Wars and was commander for 21 years. Mr. Salveron was also active in the Bladensburg promotion committee. He distinguished himself by restoring the Bladensburg Peace Cross Memorial, and establishing the town's Korean and Vietnam memorials. In 1983, he was named outstanding senior citizen by the Prince George's County Maryland Jaycees. His military honors include a bronze star, a purple heart and three Presidential distinguished citations. Mr. Salveron is survived by his wife of 66 years, four children, nine grandchildren and two great grandchildren.  Mr. Salveron dedicated his life to service in both the public and private sector. He was an individual who stood out among his fellow soldiers and showed strength of character during some very difficult times. I join the citizens of Bladensburg in recognizing his commitment to our country, our State, and their great city.                          ____________________
