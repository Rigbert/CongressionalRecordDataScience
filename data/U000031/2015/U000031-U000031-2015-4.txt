Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.  Mr. Speaker, I want to take this time to thank my colleague, Mr. Pallone. This was his legislation, which I cosponsored, as he indicated. We moved it through regular order, lots of hearings, a unanimous vote in subcommittee and full committee, and we want to get this bill to the President for him to sign.  As I have talked to Members of the Great Lakes Coalition, our colleagues in the Great Lakes States--Republican and Democrat--but also our Senators from the Great Lakes as well, there is huge interest in getting this bill to the President. It will, indeed, make a difference. The phaseout time was appropriate, so, in essence, we are telling the manufacturers to stop making it, and a time then for them to see the products off the shelf, so that ultimately, they will not be in cosmetics or toothpaste and other personal care products.  Again, I want to thank the gentleman for his leadership on this. I look forward to passing it on a bipartisan vote.  I yield back the balance of my time.
