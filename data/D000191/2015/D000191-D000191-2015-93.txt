 The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman?  There was no objection.  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 minutes.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Madam Chair, this is a very meritorious amendment offered by the gentleman. It provides flexibility for small projects under the Nationally Significant Freight and Highways Projects program.  Rather than only highway freight, States and localities will be able to apply for funds to carry out a variety of project types, such as highways, bridges, intermodal, freight rail, and grade crossings.  This is giving more control to local governments to do the most cost-effective solutions to their problems that they know best. So I think it has great merit. I support it and recommend our colleagues support it.  Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
