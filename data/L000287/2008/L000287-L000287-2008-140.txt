Madam Speaker, I rise today to introduce the Medicare Home Health Flexibility Act of 2008. This bill would allow home health agencies the flexibility to use the most appropriate skilled rehabilitation professionals to open cases and to conduct the initial assessment for Medicare home health beneficiaries who do not require skilled nursing care.  Currently, occupational therapists cannot conduct the initial assessments for Medicare home health cases even when occupational therapy is included in the physician's order along with one of the other qualifying services, like speech therapy and physical therapy. Under current law, home health agencies are not able to fully utilize all of their professional staff for Medicare rehabilitation clients, which can cause delays in beginning medically necessary care.  The Medicare Home Health Flexibility Act is actively supported by the American Occupational Therapy Association and the National Association of Home Care and Hospice.  I am proud to introduce this important legislation. I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact this legislation so that home health agencies can better manage their staff and better meet the needs of Medicare patients.                          ____________________
