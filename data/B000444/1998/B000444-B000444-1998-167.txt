 President, I rise to introduce the ``Violence Against Women Act--II.'' I am pleased to be joined by several Senators who are cosponsoring this legislation--including Senators Specter, Boxer, Snowe, Murray, Moseley-Braun, Mikulski, Dodd, Lautenburg, Wellstone, Kennedy, and Durbin.  Mr. President, when I introduced the Violence Against Women Act eight years ago--in June, 1990--it was not clear that the Senate would ever even consider this legislation. The fundamental reason--just eight years ago, few thought it either appropriate or necessary for national legislation to confront the problem of domestic violence.  From 1990 to 1993, as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I convened six hearings on the bill, released six reports on the problems of violence against women, convinced the Judiciary Committee to favorably report the bill to the full Senate on three times and had to re-introduce the bill twice.  But, it was not until November, 1993--nearly 3 and \1/2\ years after introduction--that the full Senate even considered the Violence Against Women Act. In September, 1994, the Violence Against Women Act became law.  But, even passage of the act into law did not end the significant debate on the issue of whether the problem of violence against women merited a national response. As my colleagues will recall, throughout the summer of 1995, the Congress debated whether or not we should actually fund the Violence Against Women Act.  Fortunately, by the fall of 1995, the Congress finally reached a consensus--the Federal Government can and should provide resources and leadership in a national effort to end the violence women suffer at the hands of men who profess to love them.  That consensus has held to this day.  And, at the most practical levels, that consensus has been rewarded:  The murder rate for wives, ex-wives and girlfriends at the hands of their ``intimates'' fell to an 19-year low in both 1995 and 1996.  Thousands of trained police officers are on the streets arresting abusers before they can victimize again; police officers are working as never before to guide victims toward help; prosecutors have been added to the front-lines to put these abusers where they belong--behind bars; tens of thousands of women have been provided the shelters necessary to protect themselves and their children; battered women are being provided a whole range of support services--counseling, legal help for such matters as getting a ``protection from abuse'' orders; and a new national domestic violence hotline has already answered nearly 200,000 calls for help.  Mr. President, our consensus in the Congress reflects a fundamental consensus in our Nation--the time when a woman has to suffer in silence because the criminal who is victimizing her happens to be her husband or boyfriend is over.  Today, we must build on this consensus and deliver on its promise--because for all the strides we have made, there remain far too many women who will go home this evening knowing in the nervous pit of their stomach that there is a better than even chance that they will get the hell beat out of them.  I don't know that any of us who have not been in this situation can truly understand what it must be like--an understanding which would, in turn, also help us recognize the tremendous need to take action.  Perhaps we can gain a glimmer of such an understanding if we recall our school-boy memory--and every man in this Chamber I know has at least one of these--a memory of sitting in class, dreading the time when the recess bell would ring, because the school bully told you that he was going to beat the daylights out of you on the playground. Imagine feeling that dread every day. Imagine feeling that twist in your guts as an adult.  That is what every man in this Senate, this Congress and this Nation must remember as we continue to debate what we can--and what we should--do to combat violence against women.  Mr. President, the legislation I am introducing today--the Violence Against Women Act II--has one simple goal: make more women safe.  This legislation seeks this goal by building on the original Violence Against Women Act--continuing what is working; seeking improvements to fix those efforts which could work better; and expanding the national fight into those areas where the need is clear, but our efforts have neglected.  Beyond describing some of the specifics of the legislation being introduced, I want to make it clear, there are many other ideas and proposals that should be considered before the full Senate debates this legislation. Also, I am sure there are several refinements to improve what is currently in this bill.  There are several Senators who are developing these other proposals and refinements--for there are many Senators who are deeply committed to combating violence against women. And, I hope that my colleagues will review this legislation, offer their insights and lend their names as co-sponsors and leaders in the fight against domestic violence.  Still, as my colleagues review this legislation, I believe they will find that it offers comprehensive and sensible responses to violence against women.  To highlight just some of the specific aspects of this legislation, let me start with what I believe to be the central component of the Violence Against Women Act II--the money, continuing the dollars for cops, prosecutors, judges, shelters, and all the elements which are working.  This requires one simple step--continue the violent crime reduction trust fund which the Biden crime bill set up several years ago. This trust fund is due to expire in the year 2000.  Let me remind everybody how it is funded. We agreed that we would reduce the number of Federal workers by over 200,000. We reduced them by 271,000. We agreed that the paychecks that were being paid to those Federal workers would be taken and put in the trust fund, and that trust fund would only be used to fight crime, a part of which is to fight domestic violence. That fund, that trust fund, that separate entity's authorization expires in the year 2000. This legislation first and foremost extends it, extends it to the year 2002. And it does not relitigate the balanced budget agreement upon which we agreed last year. It is accommodated within that balanced budget agreement.  Beyond this fundamental step, there are four key policy areas addressed in my new legislation.  1. Strengthening law enforcement's tools.  2. Improving services for the victims of violence.  3. Reducing violence against children, not only the frequent and horrible side effects of violence against women but also the wellspring of future generations of abusers because all of the data shows that those who witness abuse, ironically and tragically, tend to become abusers.  4. To bolster the antidomestic violence training and education programs to enlist many more professionals in our fight to deal with violence.                     Strengthening Law Enforcement  On the law enforcement front, the bill introduced today, starts with needed improvements to bolster the inter-state enforcement of ``stay-away'' or protection orders.  To give a practical example, let's say a woman from my home State of Delaware gets one of these protection orders against and old boyfriend who has been stalking and beating the heck out of her. Let's also say she works in Pennsylvania.  This is the scenario which led the original Violence Against Women Act to call on states to honor the protection orders of other states. We did sobecause the cops recognize the simple reality--they know what will happen sooner or later if the old boyfriend keeps showing up at the woman's work. And, the cops in Pennsylvania don't want to wait for the worst to happen--they want to nail the guy for violating the protection order, stopping violence before it happens--in other words, community policing.  The problem--the cops in Pennsylvania may not know about that there is a valid protection order issued by the State of Delaware. We propose today a few simple fixes: Permitting state and local cops to use their ``pro-arrest'' grants for this information sharing; encouraging states to enter into the cooperative agreements necessary to help interstate enforcement; and calling on the Justice Department to help develop new protocols and disseminate the ``best practices'' of state and local cops.  Pretty simple, but all are extremely necessary--and I hope we can all support such common sense measures.  I won't go into nearly as much detail in describing the law enforcement initiatives proposed in this bill, but just to ``tick'' some of these off--we propose to: Bolster the resources available for courts to handle domestic violence and sexual assault cases; target the ``date-rape'' drug with the maximum federal penalties; continue funding for police, prosecutors, law enforcement efforts in rural communities, and for anti-stalking initiatives; extend the support of local police ``pro-arrest'' efforts--a program expiring this year; and provide new laws to protect our military support personnel stationed, as well as our female military personnel who may be assaulted off-base--where, too often, lax foreign laws give a ``free-pass'' to their victimizer.                   Assisting the Victims of Violence  Of course, a comprehensive effort to reduce violence against women and lessen its damages must do more than just arrest, convict and imprison abusers--we must also help the victims of violence. This legislation proposes to assist these crime victims in three fundamental ways:  Immediate protections from their abuser--such as battered women's shelters; help so that they can have access to the courts and legal assistance necessary to keep their abuser away from them; and removing the ``catch-22s'' that may literally often force women to stay with their abuser--such as the discriminatory insurance policies which could force a mother to choose: turn-in the man who is beating me or keep health insurance for her children.  Those are the three general policy goals, but to be more specific, let me outline just how our legislation proposes to boost the protections for the victims of violence:  First and foremost, we must build on our successful effort to provide more shelter space for battered women and their children. Senator specter and the appropriations committee has done tremendous work to boost annual funding for shelters to $78 million--enough for about 200,000 battered women and their children.  Unfortunately, the unmet need for shelter remains significant. For example, data from six states, which together have about 16% of the Nation's population had to turn away more than 45,000 battered women who were seeking shelter because they simply did not have the space. Extrapolating these figures to the entire nation suggests that about 300,000 battered women and their children are turned away from shelters every year.  As I said, the current appropriations for shelter space stands at about $78 million. This legislation boosts this amount to $175 million over the next four years. The additional $100 million over current services will close the ``shelter-gap''--of roughly 300,000 battered women and their children. This will bring us closer to the day when all battered women will have a safe, secure place when they need it most.  Of course, we phase in this increase--but, it is clear to us that we must take the basic, fundamental step if we are to protect these victims of violence.  As I said, we must also provide women with the assistance necessary so that they can get access to help from our justice system. We do so, in some clear and common sense ways, such as:  Re-authorizing the expiring program to provide about $1 million per year for victim/witness counselors in federal court; as Senators Wellstone and Moseley-Braun have recognized, women should not have to chose between showing up at court to make sure her abuser is punished and losing her job--so, this legislation includes their proposal to extend the protections of the Family & Medical Leave Act to the victims of domestic violence;   Continuing the national Domestic Violence Hotline (at a cost of about $2 million per year); and   Developing a national network of trained, volunteer attorneys who will help each of the nearly 100,000 women who, each year, call the national hotline for help.  The other component of our plan to aid the victims of domestic violence is to target what I refer to as the ``catch-22'' problems.  Senator Murray has identified one source of just such a ``Catch-22''--the fact that some insurance companies and plans deny women health, disability, property or life insurance protections because the woman is a victim of domestic violence.  In starkest terms, this forces a woman to chose between reporting--and trying to end--the violence she is suffering or her children's health care.  This must end--we must pass Senator Murray's proposal, included in this legislation, to protect the victims from abuse from insurance discrimination.  Let me also remind my colleagues that in the original Violence Against Women Act we took bi-partisan action to end another such insidious ``choice.'' In 1994, we worked out provisions so battered immigrant women--whose ability to stay in the country was dependent on their husbands--would not have to chose: stay in America and continue to get beaten or leave their husbands, end the abuse, but have to leave America (perhaps even without their children.)  While we had fixed some aspects of this problem in 1994, there remain other aspects of immigration law which leave a woman with just such a horrible, unfair and immoral choice. With Senator Kennedy, we have worked to include in this legislation several of these corrections.  I urge my colleagues to support--and even build upon--our efforts to put an end to these real problems.                   Reducing Violence Against Children  A third area where this legislation seeks action is on reducing violence against children. As my colleagues know, households where the wife is beaten are much more likely to also be home to child abuse and neglect. In addition, the research findings are clear--children who witness violence are much more likely to repeat the cycle when they are adults and they have a wife and children.  Here, our legislation proposes to continue two long-standing programs--  Resources to serve runaway and homeless youth who are victims of sexual abuse; and  The resources provided for Court-Appointed Special Advocates and special child abuse training for court personnel through the Victims of Child Abuse Act (originally co-sponsored by Senator Thurmond and myself in 1990.)  The current appropriations for all these programs total about $25 million--we propose to increase that annual amount by about $10 million.                    Improving Research and Training  The remaining area targeted by the Violence Against Women Act--two includes several efforts to help train and educate those already on the front-lines of the battle against violence against women.  Senator Boxer has recognized that one of the leading reasons why women enter hospital emergency rooms is because they were beaten at the hands of a man. So, this bill, includes her proposal to increase the number of health professionals who are trained in the identification, treatment and referral of victims of domestic violence and sexual assault.  Over the past few years, I have worked with several corporations (including, DuPont, Polaroid, Liz Claiborne, and The Body Shop) who have begun their own workplace initiatives--everything from 24-hour assistance hotlines for their employees, training to help managers better recognize domestic violence, and even comprehensive employee assistance efforts.  Helping other companies start or improve--again, on their own initiative--such anti-violence efforts is the reason this legislation includes a national workplace clearinghouse on violence against women.  The clearinghouse will provide technical assistance and help circulate ``best practices'' to companies interested in combating violence against women.  Another practical problem out in the field relates to the complex nature of criminal investigations into sexual assault cases. To assist the cops in the field who face these investigations, this legislation calls on the Attorney General to evaluate and recommend standards of training and practice of forensic examinations following sexual assaults.  I want to make clear, this legislation does not allow any Federal dictates--but only some assistance to those in the field.  Finally, this legislation continues the authorization for rape prevention and education programs. These programs provide public awareness and education efforts to both teach young women how to protect themselves from rape and attack, as well as to help build their self-esteem.  Mr. President, I have just offered the most general outline of the contents of the Violence Against Women Act--Two. I urge my colleagues to review this legislation. I am confident they will find this bill a comprehensive and practical response which will help us meet a goal I believe is shared by every member of this Senate--making more women safer.
