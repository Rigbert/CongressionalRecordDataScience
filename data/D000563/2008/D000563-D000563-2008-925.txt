DORGAN. Well, it sounds that way. But we will see. Again, it is very frustrating. We have worked very hard to bring this legislation to the floor of the Senate. I know a lot of people are counting on the Congress to do the right thing. My hope is we can move forward. I think we have about four amendments we have cleared. We have a managers' package that is cleared. We will get votes on the Coburn amendment, which is germane, right on target, on the bill. So there is no reason we cannot move forward and get this piece of legislation done.
