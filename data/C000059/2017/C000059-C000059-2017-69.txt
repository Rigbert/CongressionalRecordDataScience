Chair, I just want to let the gentleman know that I oppose this amendment. I don't think we should stand in the way of exploration research that could inform potential future decisions, whether it is for or against drilling, but we need to know information so once we know the potential, we can allow the agencies to weigh those pros and cons.  Mr. Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote.
