LOTT. Mr. President, we have no objection. We are encouraging Senators to come to the floor with their amendments, and if Senator Wyden would like to be next in line, that is fine. As a part of that, let me ask consent that Senator Inhofe be allowed to offer the next amendment after the Wyden-Grassley amendment so we would have a package of the two lined up.  I propose then that we have the Wyden amendment in order after the Santorum-Dodd proposal, to be followed by the Inhofe amendment.
