President, I say through the Chair, I commend the Senator from Michigan. I know she has a substantial Lebanese population in her State. We have a substantial Lebanese population as well. They are fine people, good people, who have made a success here in America, proud of their heritage in Lebanon. They are following every day, every minute the news that is coming back that reminds us of the suffering that is taking place both in Israel and in Lebanon.  I am glad the Senator from Michigan has addressed this issue. I would like to ask the Senator this. I have prepared a bill, with Senator Sununu and Senator Feingold as cosponsors, which addresses another aspect of this issue. There are many Lebanese who are currently visiting in the United States or studying in the United States here legally on visas, whose visas may expire at any time--tomorrow or in the next week or month. Many of them are concerned about being forced to return to a war zone, being asked to return to a place that may be dangerous.  We know we evacuated American citizens out of Lebanon for fear for their own safety and warned the others not to stay. We know many other countries did the same.  I ask the Senator from Michigan, in addition to her excellent amendment relative to humanitarian assistance for those both in Lebanon and Israel, does she feel this temporary protected status which we would offer on a temporary basis should be expedited as well so these visitors will have a chance, if they want, to stay in the United States in a safe place until the hostilities have ended?
