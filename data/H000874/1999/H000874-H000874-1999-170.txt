Chairman, I want to ask my friend, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), a question, because I know of his very sincere beliefs, and do not question them at all. I agree that we should not question moral convictions, either.  Is there a problem? Have we had some plan, an insurance company that deals with the FEHBP, i.e., a plan, come to us and say that they were being compelled to do something that they did not want to do?
