But I think experience is showing that it would have been an error because the law is working very well. We have a rare historic opportunity to do something to help the American people. It has been done already by the great State of Texas in many respects, but we can do much more, and we shall do much better. I would like to see the same type of protections that are available to the good people of Texas afforded to everyone in this great country.  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.
