Chairman, in 1970, President Nixon signed into law the Title X Family Planning Program to provide disadvantaged women with the means to avoid unintended pregnancies. No one would have imagined 25 years later, tonight, what we are trying to do.  In a country where our health bills are skyrocketing, the abolition of title X will deny preventive health care to millions of American women. In a world where too many unwanted kids become the victims of neglect and abuse, abolishing title X will result in more unintended pregnancies. In a Nation where we should work to keep abortion safe, legal, and rare, abolishing title X will result in more than 500,000 more abortions each year. At a time when we should encourage women to do the responsible thing in planning the size of their families, the abolishing of title X will slam the door on over 1 million women each year who turned to title X for family planning services.  Mr. Chairman, the abolishing of title X means more misery, more abused children, more abortions, and more American women locked in poverty.
