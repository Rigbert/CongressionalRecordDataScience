There are those who began this debate saying: We are going to change Medicare. Well, they had their way. Many came here saying: We want to help seniors pay for prescription drugs. If we had stuck to our original goal and focused on what seniors really want and what works, I think we would have achieved this result through Medicare a long time ago. It would have been at the expense of the profitability of pharmaceutical companies.  I say to my friend, who follows some of these corporate reports more than I do, this pharmaceutical industry is the most profitable in America. Look at this chart. Profits as a percentage of revenue in 2002: No. 1, pharmaceutical companies, with 17 percent return on revenues. Return on assets: No. 1, pharmaceutical companies, with 14.1 percent. Then they were nosed out when it came to return on shareholders' equity by household and personal products, but they are still No. 2, with 27.6 percent profit as a percent of equity.  This bill is giving them more profit at the expense of families and low-income seniors in America. That is why the pharmaceutical companies are spending millions of dollars for television, radio, and newspaper ads telling this Congress to ``do our bidding.'' That is why they already spent $139 million lobbying Congress to pass this bill.  If the pharmaceutical companies wanted to help seniors, they could have done this long ago. They could have charged more reasonable prices, particularly to low-income seniors. But that isn't their goal. Their goal is more profitability. Sadly, they found allies with the Republican majority who are attempting to pass this bill and make certain they are more profitable.
