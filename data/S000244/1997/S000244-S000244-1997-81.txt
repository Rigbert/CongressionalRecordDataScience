Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding to me.  Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to support the amendment on behalf of the committee leadership. Let me say that this amendment was for the sole purpose of alleviating the concerns of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure that our legislation does not infringe upon their jurisdiction whatsoever.
