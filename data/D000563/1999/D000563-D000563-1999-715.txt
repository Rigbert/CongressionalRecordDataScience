There is no doubt that the funding for education is primarily State and local. The responsibility follows the funding. But we are remiss at the Federal level if we don't realize we have an important role here. As I have traveled around and have spoken to school administrators, thesource of the funding was secondary. They were talking about solving problems and what to do with those problems.  I see that we have been joined by the Senator from Washington, Senator Murray, who was a teacher in the classroom before she came to the Senate. I welcome her to join us in this colloquy. She knows, as well, that there are practical problems. When the administration starts talking about technology in schools, they are sometimes heartened by the fact that they have the new computers, but they quickly add, ``Senator, don't forget, we have to bring the teachers up to speed now.'' Many teachers my age, as decrepit as I am, and even older, are trying to become well versed in technology in order to keep up with the students. If the kids don't get the technology and the teachers don't get the training to give it to them, then we are all going to be losers. I agree, that is a central part of this.
