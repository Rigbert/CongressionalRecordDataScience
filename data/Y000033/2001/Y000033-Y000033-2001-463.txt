Mr. Speaker, I am pleased today to introduce the proposed legislation titled ``Russian River Land Act'' on behalf of Cook Inlet Region, Incorporated. The purpose of this legislation is to ratify an agreement that settles a land ownership issue at Russian River on the Kenai Peninsula in Alaska.  The agreement that this legislation ratifies was reached on July 26th of this year, after three years of negotiations between the Alaska Native regional corporation, Cook Inlet Region, Inc. and the United States Forest Service and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. The agreement covers lands at the confluence of the Kenai and Russian Rivers.  The area surrounding the confluence of the Russian and Kenai is rich in archeological cultural features. It is also the site of perhaps the most heavily used public sports fishery in Alaska. Because of the archeological resources at Russian River, Cook Inlet Region, Inc. made selections at Russian River under the section of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act that allowed for selections of historical places and cemetery sites. The lands at the confluence are managed in part by the U.S. Forest Service and in part by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.  Seeking to protect the public's access to the sports fishery at Russian River, the two federal agencies and Cook Inlet Region, Inc. have reached agreement that requires federal legislation in order to become effective. Because this agreement provides for the continuing ownership and management by the two federal agencies of the vast majority of lands at Russian River, the public's right to continue fishing remains unchanged from its current status.  Through negotiation and agreement, the two federal agencies and Cook Inlet Region, Inc. have found a way to fulfill the intent of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act in a way that fully protects the interests of the public. I congratulate all three parties on reaching final accord on the long-standing unresolved issue of land ownership at Russian River. I urge passage of the Russian River Land Act.                          ____________________
