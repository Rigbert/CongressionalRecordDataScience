 President, I ask unanimous consent the pending amendments be set aside and that Senator Gregg be recognized in order to offer an amendment regarding generic drugs, with no second-degree amendment in order to the amendment; further, that there be 60 minutes equally divided for debate prior to the vote in relation to the amendment; provided further that at 3:45 today the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the Enzi amendment, No. 932, as amended, with no other amendments in order to the Enzi amendment. I further ask that following that vote there be 10 minutes equally divided for debate prior to a vote in relation to the Daschle amendment, No. 939, again with no second-degree amendment also in order prior to the vote. Finally, I ask consent that following that vote, the Senate proceed to a vote on the Gregg amendment, with no intervening action or debate, and 2 minutes equally divided prior to the vote.  I further ask consent that following disposition of the Gregg amendment, the next sequence of amendments be the following: Senator Dorgan, Senator Grassley, and Senator Harkin, and these would be first-degree amendments.
