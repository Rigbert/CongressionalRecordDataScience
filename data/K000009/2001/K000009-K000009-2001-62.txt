BARGAINING IN GOOD FAITH.       ``(a) Clarification of Obligation.--The obligation of a      designated handler to bargain in good faith shall apply with      respect to an accredited association and the products or      services for which the accredited association is accredited      to bargain. The good-faith bargaining required between a      handler and an accredited association does not require either      party to agree to a proposal or to make a concession.       ``(b) Extension of Same Terms to Accredited Association.--     If a designated handler purchases a product or service from      producers under terms more favorable to such producers than      the terms negotiated with an accredited association for the      same type of product or services, the handler shall offer the      same terms to the accredited association. Failure to extend      the same terms to the accredited association shall be      considered to be a violation of section 4(g). In comparing      terms, the Secretary of Agriculture shall take into      consideration (in addition to the stipulated purchase price)      any bonuses, premiums, hauling or loading allowances,      reimbursement of expenses, or payment for special services of      any character which may be paid by the handler, and any sums      paid or agreed to be paid by the handler for any other      designated purpose than payment of the purchase price.       ``(c) Mediation and Arbitration.--The Secretary of      Agriculture may provide mediation services with respect to      bargaining between an accredited association and a designated      handler at the request of either the accredited association      or the handler. If an impasse in bargaining has occurred (as      determined by the Secretary), the Secretary shall provide      assistance in proposing and implementing arbitration      agreements between the accredited association and the      handler. The Secretary may establish a procedure for      compulsory and binding arbitration if the Secretary finds      that an impasse in bargaining exists and such impasse will      result in a serious interruption in the flow of an      agricultural product to consumers or will cause substantial      economic hardship to producers or handlers involved in the      bargaining.''.       (d) Accreditation of Associations and Designation of      Handlers.--The Agricultural Fair Practices Act of 1967 is      amended--       (1) by redesignating sections 6 and 7 (7 U.S.C. 2305, 2306)      as sections 9 and 11, respectively; and       (2) by inserting after section 5 (7 U.S.C. 2304) the      following new section:     ``SEC. 6. ACCREDITATION OF ASSOCIATIONS AND DESIGNATION OF                    HANDLERS.       ``Not later than ____ after the date of the enactment of      this section, the Secretary shall establish procedures--       ``(1) to accredit associations seeking to bargain on behalf      of producers on an agricultural product or service; and       ``(2) for designation of handlers with whom producer      associations seek to bargain.''.

If,      in the opinion of the Secretary, the facts contained in the      petition warrant further action, the Secretary shall forward      a copy of the petition to the accredited association or      handler named in the petition, who shall be called upon to      satisfy the complaint, or to answer it in writing, within a      reasonable time to be prescribed by the Secretary.       ``(b) Investigation and Complaint.--If there appears to be,      in the opinion of the Secretary, reasonable grounds for      investigating a complaint made under subsection (a), the      Secretary of Agriculture shall investigate such complaint or      notification. In the opinion of the Secretary, if the      investigation substantiates the existence of a violation of      section 4 or other provision of this Act, the Secretary may      cause a complaint to be issued. The Secretary shall have the      complaint served by registered mail or certified mail or      otherwise on the person concerned and afford such person an      opportunity for a hearing thereon before a duly authorized      examiner of the Secretary in any place in which the subject      of the complaint is engaged in business.       ``(c) Hearing.--The person complained of shall have the      right to file an answer to the original and any amended      complaint and to appear in person or otherwise and give      testimony.

The Secretary may order such further affirmative action,      including an award of damages to compensate the person filing      the petition for the damages sustained, as will effectuate      the policies of this Act and make the person filing the      petition whole.       ``(e) Complaints Instituted by Secretary.--The Secretary of      Agriculture may at any time institute an investigation under      subsection (b) if there appears to be, in the opinion of the      Secretary, reasonable grounds for the investigation and the      matter to be investigated is such that a petition is      authorized to be made to the Secretary.
