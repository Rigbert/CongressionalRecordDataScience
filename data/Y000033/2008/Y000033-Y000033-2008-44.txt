Mr. Speaker, when Puerto Rico kicked us out, yes, kicked us out of our training areas for the Air Force and the Navy in Vieques, we had to move that specialized type of training into the eastern Gulf of Mexico. We established a military mission line and said there would be no drilling platforms or drilling ships there because it would not be compatible with the type of training.  The type of training that we are doing there with the Air Force and the Navy aviation, as well as the naval surface ships are hypersonic weapons, supersonic aircraft, long-range missiles, stand-off missiles like AMRAAM, and we are talking about Patriot missiles. We are talking about all types of ordnance being used to train our pilots and our ship crews, a very specialized training.  For those of us who are determined to make sure that our forces have the best training possible, this is the only place, according to a briefing that I had with the Deputy Secretary of Defense this week, the Air Force this week, the Navy this week, this is the only place east of the military mission line where this type of training can take place in America.  So those who are concerned, those of us who are concerned about this, are curious as to what will the motion to recommit have to do or speak to this area east of the military mission line?  It's very important to us. It's very important to our national security and to those fighter pilots who are going to be doing their training here before they get into a combat situation.
