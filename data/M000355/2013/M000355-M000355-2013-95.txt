 The President, even when he had a 40-seat majority in the House and 60 votes in the Senate, couldn't get cap and trade through the Congress.  Yet last Friday he has announced he is going to do it anyway. All indications are there won't be another coal-fired generation plant built ever.  It is a perfect example of what the Senator is talking about, a kind of executive arrogance, that if I can't get what I want through Congress, I will just do it on my own and see you in court, or whatever limited options we have left.  If he really believes he has the power to delay ObamaCare, why not delay it for everyone, not just businesses.
