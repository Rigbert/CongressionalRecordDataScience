President, in honor of April being National Poetry Month, I want to take a few moments to recognize an extraordinary teacher, poet, and Quincy, IL, legend, Dwain ``Doc'' Preston.  In the winter of 1936, Doc was born on a farm near Barry, IL. The son of a World War II tank crewman and a tough as nails mother who grew up in Oklahoma surviving the Dust Bowl, Doc attended four different one-room schoolhouses, including Berrian Elementary School in Quincy. After graduating from Liberty High School, he enrolled at Western Illinois University. That was the decision that he said ``took me out of the cornfield.''  Doc joined the Air Force, attending Chinese language school, spending 6 hours a day for 8 months, studying at Yale University. To this day, much of his work in the Air Force remains classified. After his service, Doc returned to Quincy and was introduced to Regina Higgins by a friend Jay Lenne at Park Bowl, a bowling alley at the corner of 12th and Harrison. They fell in love, got married, and started their family. They had the first of four daughters in 1963, the second in 1964, the third in 1965, and lastly, the fourth, in--you guessed it--1966.  Doc followed in his uncle's footsteps--a teacher of 55 years--and accepted a position at Quincy Junior High School after two of his former teachers vouched for him. Six years later, Doc used his G.I. bill to work toward his doctorate at the University of Illinois in Champaign. While working on his dissertation, he taught at Western Illinois University and officially became ``Doc'' Preston. He then did the unexpected and tried his hand at selling insurance, but Doc had teaching in his blood and returned to the classroom after just 1 year. For the next 26 years, Doc Preston could be found in the classroom, teaching writing, speech, and English at Quincy Notre Dame, where each of his daughters would attend high school. He also supervised the QND student council, teaching leadership skills and important life lessons that aren't normally found in high school textbooks. Even after his official retirement, Doc continued teaching creative writing to seniors and others.  Throughout the years, Doc has stayed in touch with many of his students. They will send him notes using words like icon, terrific, great, awesome, amazing, special--to describe him as a teacher or writer, but mostly as a man. When hearing these compliments, he responds in his humble simple way: ``That's always fun.'' They just don't make them like Doc Preston anymore.  Doc and his wife, Regina, spent 44 years, or as Doc put it, ``over 16,000 days'' together before Regina passed away in 2006, just 4 weeks following Doc's retirement. In his beautiful poem titled, To Regina, he writes:     For over 16,000 days     You were part of me.     Now only memories are left     Of days that used to be.     But Ah! What memories they are!     The Buoy of my very life,     Which would have been of little worth     Had you not been my wife.  His words are haunting as he takes us on an emotional ride that both breaks the heart and allows us to celebrate the blessings that are memories.  Doc Preston didn't write to publish or make money. He wrote because he loved it and his audience, consisting largely of his family, loved it. When each of his four daughters were married, Doc wrote them a sonnet. When each of his 11 grandchildren turned 13, he wrote what could be called a ``goodbye to their youth'' poem. When they were younger, Doc wrote each of them a book. All told, Doc estimates he has written about 150 books. On his 80th birthday, Doc's children compiled and presented him with a book of his poem's that he dedicated to Regina.  Despite being a brilliant writer and teacher, Doc's proudest accomplishment is his family. In an interview last year, he said, ``One of the things that is joyful about being a parent is watching them grow up and succeed.'' His children certainly did. Two even went into the family business and became teachers. Doc loved parenting, but he once said, ``Grandparenting is better.'' I couldn't agree more.  When looking for heaven, many look toward the sky--not Doc Preston. Doc and Regina, looked along the river bluffs of the Mississippi River and built heaven in Quincy, IL. Whether it was with Doc's wife, Regina, four daughters--Carolyn, Cheri, Debbie, Teresa--11 grandchildren, or countless student, his life, love, and poetry have touched so many lives, including my own.  I want to thank Doc Preston for his dedication to teaching and his generosity to the wonderful people of Quincy. They call Quincy ``Gem City.'' Well, there is no gem shining brighter than Dwain ``Doc'' Preston.  Thank you, Doc, for sharing your gift with us all.  I would like to share the final lines of Doc's poem, Southern Memories.     Oh, yes, I'll savor snapshots,     To be sure,     But what I'll treasure most     Are all the memories I made with you.  Doc's right. I would like to tell him that what will be treasured most by those who know Doc, ``Are all the memories [we] made with you.''                          ____________________
