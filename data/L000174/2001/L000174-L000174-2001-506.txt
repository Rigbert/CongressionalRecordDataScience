President, I want to congratulate Elizabeth Robert, a graduate of Middlebury College and the University of Vermont, for her success in transforming the struggling Vermont Teddy Bear Company into a highly profitable e-business.  Ms. Robert joined the Vermont Teddy Bear Company as its Chief Financial Officer in 1995 and only two years later rose to the position of Chief Executive Officer. In 1997, profits at Vermont Teddy Bear Company were way down and the future was bleak. Now, only three years later, sales are up 50 percent and the company boasts more than $22 million in annual sales. This spectacular turnaround was spearheaded by Elizabeth Robert, who harnessed the power of the Internet to transform the Teddy Bear Company into a successful Bear-Gram gift delivery service. The company's website is http://store.yahoo.com/vtbear/.  Recently, The Rutland Herald and The Times Argus, featured Ms. Robert as a ``captain of industry.'' I ask that the full text of the Rutland Herald/Times Argus article of March 11, 2001, titled ``Elizabeth Robert: A `captain of industry' bears watching'' be printed in the Record.  Liz's success is a shining example for all Vermonter business leaders to follow. By taking advantage of the new markets offered by the Internet and developing a sharply focused business plan, the Vermont Teddy Bear Company has doubled its sales and significantly expanded its customer base.  Last year, I invited Liz Robert to be the keynote speaker at my annual Women's Economic Opportunity Conference in Vermont. Ms. Robert shared her personal story with hundreds of women who attended the conference and encouraged each of them to follow their dreams. As an incredibly successful businesswoman and the mother of two teen-aged daughters, she is an inspiration for all of us. My wife, Marcelle, and I were proud to be there with her.       Elizabeth Robert: A ``Captain of Industry'' Bears Watching                        (By Sally West Johnson)       Elizabeth Robert is nothing like her product. This woman,      who took over the floundering Vermont Teddy Bear Co. and      returned it to solvency, exudes a cool, angular self-     confidence that is not a bit like the warm and cuddly      personae of her stuffed bears.       A wiry, athletic 45-year-old, Robert has been with Vermont      Teddy Bear since 1995, when she signed on as chief financial      officer in what was already a financially troubled time. The      charm of founder John Sortino's bear-peddling pushcart      operation on Church Street in Burlington had long since worn      thin; his successor, Patrick Burns, ``took us on a trip down      teddy-bear lane,'' says Robert, explaining that Burns had a      vision of turning the company into a Disney-like conglomerate      that sold all things ursine. But that idea tanked, and when      Burns left town, Robert took over as chief executive officer      in October 1997.       In truth, taking on a top job had been in her game plan for      a long time. It's part of who she is, and she knew it. She      comes from several generations of highly accomplished women.      Her grandmother emigrated from Armenia to Paris, where she      worked in the laboratory of Mme. Marie Curie and later,      according to Robert, became the first female pediatrician in      Geneva. In the early 1940s, Robert's mother was working as a      photo editor at Time-Life Inc. ``I grew up in a household      where everything was possible,'' she says.       A Middlebury College alumna, class of 1978, she married      English professor Bob Hill in 1980, then had her first child      10 days before entering graduate school at the University of      Vermont. They have since divorced. With an MBA in hand, she      worked at all sorts of jobs for the next few years: at      Vermont Gas Systems, as a financial consultant, and as      campaign manager for Louise McCarren's 1990 run for      lieutenant governor. It was McCarren, now president of      Verizon in Vermont, who pointed out the obvious to her.       ``She told me that I wanted to be a captain of industry . .      . and she was exactly right,'' says Robert of her mentor. ``I      had been learning, accumulating a skill set with undefined      purpose. Now I knew what the purpose was.''       She leapt into her future by signing on as chief financial      officer with a high-tech start-up in Williston, Air Mouse      Remote Controls. ``We were constantly groveling for money,      constantly short of cash,'' she recalls. If it didn't seem to      be a blessing at the time, ``all that experience would be      relevant to me when I got to Vermont Teddy Bear.''       Robert's success at VTB has made her much in demand as a      speaker, especially when the subject is business      strategizing. Invited to address a UVM graduate class last      fall, she immediately turns the tables on her students.      ``What business is Vermont Teddy Bear in?'' she asks them.      (Hint: The correct answer is not ``selling teddy bears.'')       ``We are in the Bear-Gram gift delivery service,'' she      informs them after a few proffer hesitant guesses. ``We are      delivering a highly personalized message, and one that can be      changed right up to the last minute.''       Are Vermont Teddy Bears expensive? Yes, partly because they      are exclusively made in America, which costs more than making      them overseas. But then VTB isn't selling toys for kids.      ``You can't sell the Lover Boy bear off the retail shelf for      $65 or $75 even on Madison Avenue,'' explains Robert, ``but      you can sell them for $85 if you guarantee delivery the next      day and sell them with an embroidered shirt and a personal      message transcribed by a bear counselor.''       She settles into the story of VTB's decline into--and      resurrection from--bankruptcy with the confidence born of      success. It is a classic tale of a company getting too big,      too fast. ``We went from revenues of $300,000 in 1990 to $20      million in 1994,'' she recounts. But after an IPO in late      1993, ``the company hit the wall. We were spending huge      amounts of money: We were advertising on Rush Limbaugh for $1      million a year; we spent $8.1 million on the new building (in      Shelburne).''       In some ways, the financial crisis was relatively easy to      manage: ``When there is no money,'' she notes, ``the answer      is always `no.' '' With Robert's modified, and sharply      focused, sales strategies, the company began to come back. A      hugely successful Valentine's Day in 1998 liquidated the old      inventory and brought in a huge pile of cash. The company      picked up corporate-gift clients such as Seagrams, Nabisco      and Triaminic, the cold-medicine people. It also focused on      direct marketing of Bear-Grams through radio advertising to a      clientele Robert calls generically ``Late Jack''--a guy      between 18 and 54 years old who has forgotten the holiday,      whatever it is. They can bail him out at the last minute with      a gift that costs about the same as a nice bouquet of flowers      but lasts a lot longer and is more personal.       In fiscal 1998, VTB reported a net loss of $2 million.      Thanks to ``Late Jack,'' in fiscal 2000 company books showed      sales of $33 million, with a profit of $3.7 million. At the      moment, Elizabeth Robert is pretty much where she wanted to      be.       ``I am now a captain of industry,'' she says. The remark is      candid, not boastful. ``I'm not at the end of my career by      any means, but I don't see the need to move on at this      point.''                          ____________________
