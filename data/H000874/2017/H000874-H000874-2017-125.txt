Speaker, this rule ought to be rejected. It is not the regular order, it is not good policy, and it is not good for the institution of the House of Representatives or for the country.  The border wall is controversial, and many people in the Trump administration do not believe the border wall will be effective, and they believe it is a waste of money. And, of course, the President told us all the Mexicans were going to pay for the wall.  Well, this is $1.6 billion of about $20 billion that would have to come not to be paid for by the Mexicans, but to be paid for by the U.S. taxpayer for an ineffective effort to make this country more secure.  Everybody on this floor believes we ought to know who comes into this country and that people ought not to come into this country unless they are authorized to do so. We all agree on that.  I ask the majority leader: Bring this border wall to the floor; let us debate it; put it open for amendment. That is the regular order.  The Speaker went on to say: ``We will not duck the tough issues. We will take them head on.'' That is Speaker Paul Ryan, October 29, 2015.  They had an amendment offered on the authorization bill by Mrs. Hartzler of Missouri. It was controversial, and the majority party lost. So what did they do? They didn't add it to the bill as Mrs. Hartzler wanted to do, have an amendment on this floor so we could debate it again on its demerits or merits depending upon your perspective, but they went around not by regular order, not by taking issues head-on, but by having the President issue some tweet that the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff says he never was talked to about it.
