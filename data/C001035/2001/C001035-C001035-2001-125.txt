President, for the information of all Senators, under the order, tomorrow the Senate will conduct two votes in relation to the education bill. The first vote will be in relation to the Dayton amendment No. 622, to be followed by a vote in relation to the Voinovich amendment No. 443. Senators should, therefore, expect two early morning votes beginning shortly after 9 a.m.  Following those votes, the Senate will begin consideration of the reconciliation bill and the statutory 20 hours for debate. Additional votes will occur throughout Thursday's session, and the Senate is expected to remain in session into the evening in order to make progress on the tax reconciliation measure.  Before we close, I remind all Members of the early morning votes and ask that Senators be prompt to enable us to begin work on the important Tax Relief Act.                          ____________________
