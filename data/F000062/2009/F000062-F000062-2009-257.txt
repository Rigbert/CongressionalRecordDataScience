 We voted on this yesterday. The vote was compelling, 87 to 7. To the best of our knowledge--and the staff has scrubbed the bill--there is no money for ACORN in the Interior appropriations bill. To do this is to set a precedent to do this on every single appropriations bill. This morning I said to the distinguished Senator from the great State of Nebraska: We will take this amendment. He refused. I guess all of this is really to show people. It is unnecessary. It delays. This is an important bill. We would like to get it passed. Please vote no.
