President, I commend Senator Ron Wyden for offering an amendment to require the General Accounting Office [GAO] to review and report on the effectiveness of the H-2A Nonimmigrant Worker Program after passage of immigration reform legislation.  I have heard from many agriculture and labor groups about the importance of H-2A Nonimmigrant Worker Program. In my home State of Vermont, for example, apple growers depend on this program for some of their labor needs during the peak harvest season. Many of these farmers have concerns with the current operation and responsiveness of the H-2A program. Both farmers and laborers are concerned that passage of legislation to reform the Nation's immigration laws may further hamper the effectiveness of the H-2A Nonimmigrant Worker Program. I believe this amendment goes a long way in addressing their concerns.  I am proud to cosponsor this amendment because I believe it will result in the collection of public, nonpartisan information on the effectiveness of this essential program. It directs the GAO to review the existing H-2A Nonimmigrant Worker Program to ensure that the program provides a workable safety valve in the event of future shortages of domestic workers. And it requires the GAO to issue a timely report to the public on its findings. I am hopeful that the GAO study will provide a foundation for improving the program for the sake of agricultural employers and workers.  I also believe that this amendment crafts a careful balance between the needs of agricultural growers and the protection of domestic and foreign farm workers. The amendment calls on the GAO to review the H-2A Program to determine if it provides an adequate supply of qualified U.S. workers, timely approval for the applications for temporary foreign workers, protection against the displacement or diminishing of the terms and conditions of the employment of U.S. agricultural workers.  I am hopeful that this GAO report will help the H-2A admissions process meet the needs of agricultural employers while protecting the jobs, wages, and working conditions of domestic workers and the rights and dignity of those admitted to work on a temporary and seasonal basis.  I urge my colleagues to support the Wyden amendment.                             ins amendment
