Of course, I thought it would work far more smoothly with a Republican President, a Republican House, and a Republican Senate. We had actually passed a budget back last April, which by law we are required to do.

This was put in by the Republicans in the House, and at least the Democrats in the Senate discovered it. So to that extent, there is at least a glimmer of hope.
