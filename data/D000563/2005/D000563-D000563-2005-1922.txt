I think others are in the same position, including Senator Feingold. It is my hope to move as quickly as possible to a quick, limited debate, for just very short periods of time, and then to vote on these amendments in an effort to keep the bill moving forward. I ask the Republican whip whether or not there are plans to call any other votes today or early tomorrow.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I might say to my friend from Illinois, we have been reviewing amendments. I am hopeful we can have some discussion between now and the vote about how we proceed from here.
