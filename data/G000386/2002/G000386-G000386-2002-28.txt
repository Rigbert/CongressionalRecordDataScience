 President, I would like to inform my colleagues that I have requested to be notified of any unanimous consent agreement before the Senate proceeds to the consideration of S. 3074 or any other legislation creating new bankruptcy judgeships. I believe that these changes should be enacted as part of the comprehensive bankruptcy reform conference report. Majority Leader Daschle has indicated that there will be a lame duck session, and he has indicated that the bankruptcy conference report will be taken up and passed. So I urge my colleagues in the House and Senate to pass the comprehensive bankruptcy reform conference report.                          ____________________
