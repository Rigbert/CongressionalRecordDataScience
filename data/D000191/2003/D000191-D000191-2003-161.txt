Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, the Chair of the Subcommittee on Aviation has done good work with this. A number of Members have come forward since the bill was finalized in committee and raised concerns which have merit, as have other concerns been raised by outside groups, for instance, the flight attendants and others.  So we have here a clarification on the training of the flight attendants, which we mandated earlier, the security legislation. We have here language that would require at least some minimal cooperation and coordination with the metropolitan planning organizations, making certain that they are informed of plans and future plans of airports that might have impact on communities greater than that which currently exist.  To get some clarification, a number of concerns have been raised regarding passenger facility charges and the standards which are being applied by the FAA, and it certainly would be of great benefit to consolidate and publish those requirements so that meritorious projects across the United States can move forward to better enhance the utilization of our airports and their capacity.  Then there was the 76-C regional jet provision for National Airport, again something raised later on; fairly technical, but actually quite practical and meritorious.  Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar).
