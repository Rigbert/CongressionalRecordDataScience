 President, the amendment from the Senator from Utah speaks about ``strengthening and improving'' Medicaid and Medicare. We don't strengthen and improve Medicaid by cutting it by $1 trillion, and we don't strengthen and improve Medicare by cutting it by $469 billion. That is Orwellian language.  We should vote down this amendment and adopt the Sanders amendment which says: Let us give no tax breaks to billionaires while we cut Medicaid.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Toomey). The question is on agreeing to the amendment.
