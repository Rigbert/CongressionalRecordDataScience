Speaker, I thank the ranking member for his generosity.  Mr. Speaker, the current welfare system is at odds with the core values Americans share: work, opportunity, family, and responsibility.  Too many people who hate being on welfare are trying to escape it with unfortunately too little success. It is time for a fundamental change. In 30 second obviously I cannot analyze the changes that I would be for other than to say I was a strong supporter, and continue to support the Deal bill. The Deal bill was sponsored by a Democrat; the gentleman from Georgia [Mr. Deal] is now a Republican. What more bipartisan bill could Members support than the Deal bill?
