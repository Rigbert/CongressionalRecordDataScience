 President, I thank the Senator for his very thoughtful explanation. Senator Sasse and Senator Lee have laid out very clearly the Constitution's separation of powers, the proper role for judges, the proper role for Members of Congress, and when one can't interfere with the other. I think the Senator has laid out very clearly, and I agree, that Judge Gorsuch fits in very well with what judges are supposed to do, what the Supreme Court is supposed to do--obviously not legislate. Members of the judiciary have a lifetime appointment. They can't be voted out of office. That is why, when people don't like what the Congress does, every 2 or 6 years as far as the House and the Senate are concerned, they get a chance to express that opposition and send somebody else to do the job, and they can't do that with whoever is on the Supreme Court.  I thank my colleagues for participating with me in this conversation we have had about the separation of powers and about their thoughts on Judge Gorsuch on the issue of judges judging and not legislating. His record demonstrates a firm grasp on the separation of powers that animates our Constitution. He is an independent judge who properly understands the judicial role. At a time when we hear renewed calls for an independent judiciary, I don't think we could have a better nominee to fit the bill.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
