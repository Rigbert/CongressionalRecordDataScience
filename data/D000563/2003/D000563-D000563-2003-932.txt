I am aware of it. It is sadly troubling, because what the President did in making that statement is to mischaracterize what happened.  The Senator may recall, as I do, that Senator Byrd came before this body early on and said to us we have a problem in America. If we are going to protect America, we need to make a substantial investment in changes such as a statewide communications system for Nevada and Illinois so the police, fire, and medical responders can all be on the same network if there is terrorist activity or a disaster. These investments are basic. And also in the area of bioterrorism, to make sure that doctors, nurses, and health care personnel are adequately trained and that hospitals are ready if there is anthrax, God forbid, as we faced on Capitol Hill.  Senator Byrd came time and time again to this floor and begged us, as a nation, to be responsive. Unfortunately, time and time again, he was rejected.  When we finally sent a $2.5 billion amount to the White House, asking them to put that into homeland security, it was effectively vetoed--$2.5 billion stopped. So the President cannot point the finger at Congress.  I say to my friend from Nevada, I am anxious to follow the debate we are going to face in a few weeks when we have this administration come before us and tell us they need $26 billion for Turkey--$6 billion in grants and $20 billion in loan guarantees for Turkey--which has been their demand if we are going to be using Turkey as a base of operations for an invasion of Iraq.  I want the administration to explain to the American people how we can afford $26 billion for the defense and security of Turkey and cannot afford $2 billion for the defense and security of the United States of America when it comes to homeland security. That is going to be an interesting debate.
