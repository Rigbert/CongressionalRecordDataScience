 President, today I rise with Senator DeWine to introduce the ``Improving Head Start Access for Homeless and Foster Children Act of 2005.''  Head Start has made significant strides in providing comprehensive services to low-income children. SinceHead Start was established in 1965, low-income preschool-aged children have received education, health, nutritional, social and developmental services they would not otherwise have access to. Unfortunately, children in greatest need of these services--homelss and foster youth--are not receiving those services at adequate levels.  It is estimated that 1.35 million children experience homelessness each year, and the mean income of a homeless family is at 46 percent of the Federal poverty level. Due to extreme poverty and the inherent instability of homelessness, children facing these conditions have considerably higher physical, mental and emotional difficulties. It is not surprising that homeless children are reported to be twice as likely to have a learning disability and three times as likely of having an emotional or behavioral problem that interferes with their learning.  These children also face significant barriers to participation in Head Start. These children lack transportation. They lack the necessary documentation. They suffer from the invisibility of homeless families which leaves the community unaware of the need to include these children in Head Start recruitment and prioritization. As a result of these and other barriers, only 15 percent of preschool children identified as homeless are enrolled in preschool programs of any kind, compared to the 57 percent of low-income preschool children. Currently only 2 percent of the more than 900,000 students served by Head Start are children identified as homeless. States report that 60 percent of homeless students are having difficulties gaining access to Head Start.  In addition to homeless children, kids in foster care face a unique set of challenges which both increase their need for the stability and educational services provided by Head Start. Tragically, these same challenges also hinder their ability to gain access to those services. Foster children are likely to suffer from both emotional and physical instability. With more than 500,000 children in foster care and a shortage of foster parents in this country, these children often go without the attention and advocacy that preschool age children need.  More than 40 percent of the children in homeless shelters are under the age of five. The first years of a child's life significantly impact personal development and future academic achievement. That is why I once again stand with Senator DeWine to increase access to Head Start for homeless and foster children.  Our bill would ensure equal access and benefits from to early education and supportive services provided by Head Start for the Nation's poorest children. It would make all homeless children eligible for Head Start. The bill also allow homeless children to be immediately enrolled in Head Start by allowing them extra time to provided required documentation; providing that that documentation be in a reasonable time frame. And, our bill would require school, district liaisons to assist families in obtaining necessary documents. In addition, our bill increases Head Start's outreach to homeless and foster children. Further, the bill would reduce barriers by encouraging coordination between Head Start agencies and community programs that serve these vulnerable populations.  Again, I would like to thank my colleague Senator DeWine for his many efforts in supporting homeless and foster youth. I urge the Senate to ensure that all children, despite their background and socioeconomic situation receive equal access to a quality education.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1101       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

Mr.DeWINE. Mr. President, today I join with Senator MURRAY to introduce the ``Improving Head Start Access for Homeless and Foster Children Act of 2005.'' The problems children who are homeless and in foster care face are daunting. I am grateful to Senator Murray for her leadership in this area. She and I worked on coordinating and improving access to services for homeless and foster children in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), and I am glad to have had the opportunity to work with her again on this issue.  Who is more vulnerable than a child, under the age of five, living on the street or in a shelter? Who is more vulnerable than a child under five who has been abused and neglected? Just because young children cannot speak to their needs does not mean that they should have no voice. The hundreds of thousands of children in the United States who experience homelessness, separation from their parents, or abuse and neglect each year are in need of our help to ensure their needs are met. Unfortunately, their voices are all too often not heard and their needs go unmet. The bill we are introducingtoday would serve as one more step, one move closer, to ensuring homeless and foster children are visible and their voices audible.  In the United States, on any given day, more than half a million children are in foster care, 20,000 of whom are in my home State of Ohio, alone. Of this group, 27 percent are age five and--under. In 2003, we also know that more than 900,000 children were found to be victims of child abuse or neglect. Children as young as six months old can suffer from long-term effects after experiencing or witnessing trauma. More than half of the children in foster care experience developmental delays. Children in foster care have three to seven times more chronic medical conditions, birth defects, emotional disorders, and academic failures than children of similar socioeconomic backgrounds who never enter foster care.  In its 2000 Report to Congress, the U.S. Department of Education noted that only 15 percent of preschool children identified as homeless were enrolled in preschool programs. In comparison, 57 percent of low-income preschool children participated in preschool in 1999. These statistics are especially troubling in light of the fact that over 40 percent of children living in shelters are under the age of five--an age when early childhood education can have a significant positive impact on a child's development and future academic achievement.  Head Start began in 1965, and since its inception, it has served more than 22 million of America's poorest children. This important program has helped these children build the skills they need to succeed in school and provide them with the services they need to be healthy and active in society. With its comprehensive services and family-centered approach, Head Start often offers the most appropriate educational setting for children and families experiencing homelessness and for children in foster care. By providing comprehensive health, nutrition, education, and social services, Head Start helps provide for the needs of these vulnerable children. And, with the passage of this bill, Head Start could help even more. Yet, programmatic and policy barriers continue to limit their access to and participation in Head Start. Some barriers to Head Start access are related to lack of coordination with child welfare agencies, high mobility, lack of required documentation, and lack of transportation.  Our bill would encourage Head Start grantees to reduce these barriers by directing them to increase their outreach to homeless and foster children. It also would encourage coordination between Head Start grantees and community service providers and homeless and foster children. It would increase the coordination for these populations as they transition out of Head Start to elementary school and increase reporting requirements. And, it would allow homeless children to be automatically eligible for Head Start.  Again, I thank my colleague, Senator Murray, for her leadership on this issue. I look forward to working with her to incorporate these ideas into the Head Start reauthorization bill currently being considered in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee.                                 ______                                       By
