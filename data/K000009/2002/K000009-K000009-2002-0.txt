Speaker, I rise tonight to talk about Social Security, a program that will affect or is affectingevery single American, the premier program initiated in the last century by the Democratic Party which has helped to raise a generation of our seniors out of poverty and keeps the current generation out of poverty.  Most seniors in America receive upwards of around $580 per month. For them Social Security is a lifeline. Without Social Security and Medicare, they simply could not survive.  Because the Bush administration and its allies inside this Chamber cannot afford to pay for the extravagant tax giveaways, especially to the superrich in this country like Kenneth Lay from Enron, who will get $245 million in a rebate this year, and because our country is moving into deficit, the Republicans in this Chamber are raiding Social Security every day, the Social Security trust fund, to try to make up that shortfall.  Back in June when I started clocking the Republican raid on Social Security, at that point they had raided over $207 billion out of the Social Security trust fund after us having taken seven votes here that said we would protect the lockbox and not permit that kind of borrowing against the Social Security and Medicare trust fund; but to date, they have now, as of this week, October 16, they have now raided $318,369,863,013 from the Social Security trust fund. That averages out per American over $1,100 out of their pocket. To be exact, $1,104.36 out of the funds that are deserved by every single American who has paid into this fund.  As long as Republicans continue to raid the Social Security trust fund in violation of the promises we have made and passed here in this Congress, it is my intention to be here on this floor, clocking their raid with this debt clock. I also will be reviewing the history of those who created Social Security for our country and who historically opposed it, the Republican Party.  In fact, in 1935 in the deliberations in the Committee on Ways and Means right outside this room here, the Republican Members of the House Committee on Ways and Means voted to kill the original bill that created the Social Security program that our parents, our grandparents, and great-grandparents had benefited from since the mid-1930s.  When that bill moved to the floor, it was the Democratic Party that passed that bill, and I think it is very important that history be recorded for the present generation because if we look at what has been happening with the accumulation of additional debt in our country, and I would like to just put up an additional chart here, as we look back during more modern times to the early chart here focuses on the Johnson administration and the Nixon and Ford administration and the Carter administration. And we begin to look at when did this Social Security trust fund really start going into the red. It was during the Reagan-Bush administration and now during the George W. Bush administration, billions and billions and billions of dollars. It was only during the administration of Bill Clinton and Al Gore that we began to move the Social Security trust fund back into surplus again.  We have over $6 trillion of debt that we are financing in this country, much of it due to the giveaways that this administration has promoted. As an example, with the inheritance tax, Gary Winnick of Global Crossing, with assets of over three quarters of a billion dollars, will get $366 million in a tax windfall. And where do my colleagues think that money is going to come from? It comes right out of here, the Social Security trust fund. Or Dennis Kozlowski from Tyco Corporation, the one that is in all that trouble, he is going to get $149 million. And where do my colleagues think that money is going to come from?  This administration and House Republicans should put seniors first. They have earned it. They have earned it, and reverse this raid. We should continue to commit the savings in the Social Security trust fund as we have promised. It is important for us to tell the truth to the American people using these red numbers and this debt clock to demonstrate and remind ourselves what is really going on.  The Democratic Party historically has been the party that believed in and supported Social Security as an insurance and disability fund for every single American. It is a condition of living in this country. It is not a privilege. It is a right.  Mr. Speaker, we do not need to be borrowing from the trust fund in order to give benefits to the superrich. I hope as the elections approach, the public will remember and vote for the Democratic Party which has always supported Social Security.                          ____________________
