 This amendment deals with one of the great moral challenges of our time. While the pharmaceutical industry, which makes wide campaign contributions, spends more money on lobbying and campaign contributions than any other industry in this country, while they are enjoying record-breaking profits, millions of people, poor people throughout the world, are dying of AIDS. Meanwhile, the pharmaceutical companies are down in South Africa trying to do away with legislation in the courts, trying to do away with legislation passed by the South African government because the South African government is trying to get inexpensive drugs to deal with the epidemic of AIDS.  What this legislation says very clearly is get the State Department off the backs of South Africa when South Africa is operating legally, legally under international law. If the pharmaceutical companies think they are operating illegally, if the U.S. State Department thinks they are operating illegally, go to the World Trade Organization. But the State Department does not want to go to the World Trade Organization. They want to put unilateral action against South Africa. The drug companies want to use their muscle against South Africa. What South Africa is doing is legal. The State Department does not want to challenge them in the World Trade Organization because they will lose.  It is a shame and an embarrassment that the government of the United States of America is working with the multi-billion dollar drug companies to push around South Africa because that country is trying to do the right thing for its people with AIDS.  Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
