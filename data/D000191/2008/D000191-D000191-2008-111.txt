$500 billion in profits to the oil industry since George Bush, the oil man, and Dick Cheney, the oil man, took office. Remember what they told us? They could deal with the industry. They'd talk the prices down. They could deal with OPEC. They'd talk the prices down. OPEC is violating international law. The President won't file a complaint in the World Trade Organization for their illegal constraint of production which is driving up the price. The President refuses to take any action against his friends in the OPEC consortium or cartel.  Now the big oil companies, $40 billion in profits for one, ExxonMobil, last year, their generous campaign contributors, the GOP, Grand Oil Party, is doing very well. But now they're crying crocodile tears here on the floor and saying they really care about consumers, after the Bush-Cheney energy bill, which gave subsidies to ExxonMobil who made $40 billion last year after the Republicans refused last year to strip those subsidies from the oil companies? They complain about the high price to consumers. They're born-again consumer advocates. That's great.  I've been a consumer advocate for a long time. I have consistently supported a windfall profits tax. I've also consistently said we've got to go after the OPEC cartel and file the complaints. And we need new technologies, and we need new fuels, and we need conservation. None of those things were in the Bush-Cheney energy bills written behind closed doors by big oil and the GOP, the Grand Oil Party.  But now, their presumptive political nominee, Mr. McCain, has come up with a great idea, let's suspend the gas tax. Now, let's see. In 1993, the gas tax was 18.3 cents a gallon, and gas was $1.05 a gallon. Today, in my district, gas is $3.50 a gallon, and guess what? The Federal gas tax is still 18.3 cents a gallon. That money is a tax. It's a tax going to big oil and OPEC and to hedge fund speculators who are driving up the price of oil. That's the tax the American consumers are paying. They won't take on OPEC, and they sure as heck aren't going to take on their friends in big oil.  We're willing to do that. And suspending the gas tax, now I would ask the presumptive Republican nominee, Mr. McCain, if we suspend the gas tax, how many highway projects and bridge projects are you going to cancel? How many thousand people are you going to put out of work when you already have a deficit in the trust fund? If you want to give relief to the American consumers, target the real culprits. It is not the gas tax that's been flat for the last 15 years; it's big oil and it's the OPEC companies and the hedge fund speculators on Wall Street. Let's go after them.                          ____________________
