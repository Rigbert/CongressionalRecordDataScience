President and colleagues, this amendment has been agreed to by both the majority and the minority. It simply says, if a polluterengages in action that violates our environmental laws and that action results in a penalty or a fine, those actions would no longer be deductible under our tax law.  Senator Kerry of Massachusetts joins me in this. I thank Senator Domenici of New Mexico and Senator Exon for support of this amendment, and I yield the floor.
