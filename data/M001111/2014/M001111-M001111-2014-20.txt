 President, I previously filed budgetary aggregates and committee allocations for budget years 2014 and 2015 pursuant to section 116 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013. Today, I am adjusting those levels.  Section 251 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 establishes statutory limits on discretionary spending and allows for various adjustments to those limits, while sections 302 and 314(a) of the Congressional Budget Act allows the Chairman of the Budget Committee to establish and make revisions to allocations, aggregates, and levels consistent with those adjustments. On August 1, 2014, the Senate passed one bill that is eligible for an adjustment under the Congressional Budget Act: H.J. Res 76, Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Resolution, 2014, which includes $225 million in budget authority and $150 million in outlays in 2014 and $75 million in outlays in 2015 that is designated as emergency funding pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.  Consequently, I am revising the budgetary aggregates for 2014 by a total of $225 million in budget authority and $150 million in outlays. For 2015 I am revising the budgetary aggregates by $75 million in outlays. I am also revising the budget authority and outlayallocations to the Appropriations Committee by $225 million in revised security budget authority and $150 million in outlays in 2014 and by $75 million in outlays in 2015.  I ask unanimous consent that the following tables detailing the changes to the allocation to the Committee on Appropriations and the budgetary aggregates be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                          BUDGETARY AGGREGATES    (Pursuant to section 116 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 and          section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974)------------------------------------------------------------------------                $s in millions                      2014         2015------------------------------------------------------------------------Current Spending Aggregates: *    Budget Authority..........................    2,842,558    3,015,208    Outlays...................................    2,819,514    3,035,686Adjustments:    Budget Authority..........................          225            0    Outlays...................................          150           75Revised Spending Aggregates:    Budget Authority..........................    2,842,783    3,015,208    Outlays...................................    2,819,664   3,035,761------------------------------------------------------------------------* 2014 current spending aggregates reflect previous adjustments made for  the farm bill and unemployment insurance. 2015 current spending  aggregates reflect previous adjustments made for disaster, overseas  contingency operations, and terrorism risk insurance.
