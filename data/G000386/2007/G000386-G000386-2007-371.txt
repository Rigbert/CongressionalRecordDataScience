 The point here is to look at what Congress was able to accomplish over a 6-year period as evidence of what it might be able to accomplish over the 5-year window of the budget resolution. Some might say it is comparing apples and oranges, because the House was under Republican control during that period. But as we are seeing, Democratic control does not seem to have changed the allergic reaction of the House of Representatives to revenue raisers. Because during the markup, while the chairman of the Budget Committee was holding up his chart, as he did today, with a picture of a German sewer system that U.S. companies are claiming phony depreciation deductions on through abusive leasing transactions, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee in the other body was holding a hearing and somehow sympathizing with lobbyists about how it is bad tax policy to shut off these tax benefits.  The most significant package of revenue raisers over this period was in the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. I took a lot of heat on those revenue raisers, as shown in the Congressional Daily article entitled ``Balance of Payments, A Closer Look at Tax Bill Losers.'' This article refers to the revenue raisers in the Senate passed JOBS bill as ``the most significant rollback of tax loopholes since 1986.''  I ask unanimous consent that that article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         Balance of Payments--A Closer Look at Tax Bill Losers       By now we're well aware of the winners in the Senate's      just-passed, $170 billion-plus, corporate tax cut package--     they include NASCAR racetrack operators, Oldsmobile dealers      and Learjet makers, as well as large manufacturers and      multinational companies more generally.       But one almost-overlooked aspect of the bill--and perhaps      the one that packs the most significant impact over the long      term--is the number of losers the bill would create.       The insistence by Senate Democrats and a few dissenting      Republicans that all tax cuts be balanced out by offsetting      ``revenue raisers'' has given birth to a peculiar form of      alchemy on the Finance Committee. The new tax breaks are      offset by provisions shutting down tax shelters and closing a      vast array of perceived ``loopholes,'' which will raise      upwards of $60 billion for the Treasury over 10 years.       Finance Chairman Grassley said the revenue offsets in his      bill are designed to punish tax cheats and corporate      criminals. The revenue-raising provisions, if they eventually      become law, will be the most significant rollback of tax      loopholes since the 1986 law that changed the passive loss      rules, observers said. They include new, stiff penalties for      failure to disclose tax shelter activities, codification of      the economic substance doctrine and an end to abuses brought      to light by the Enron scandal.       But skeptics in the House and on K Street believe some      offsets are a product of panning in the revenue stream of the      U.S. government for tax cut gold. The rocketing cost of      Senate bill and the parallel drive to create money-saving      offsets have led the Finance Committee to over-reach, they      claim.       House Ways and Means Chairman Thomas criticized the Senate      approach in a Q with reporters last week, saying that the      Senate has the tendency to turn striving for revenue      neutrality ``into a mechanical exercise.'' He said this led      to some situations in which ``the revenue you are reaching      for is not the same as the policy you are trying to cover.''       The most significant piece in terms of the money it      raises--$42 billion over 10 years--is provisions to curb      abusive leasing transactions, under which taxpayer dollars      have literally been used to help finance dozens of foreign      and domestic infrastructure projects, including sewer systems      and subways, while the large financial institutions that      structured the deals raked in billions.       Almost no one in Washington argues that no legislation is      needed to stop the abusive leasing transactions, but the way      the Senate went about it has raised a few eyebrows. By moving      back effective dates and other adjustments, Grassley      gradually expanded the scope of the provision to squeeze a      greater number of transactions as tax cuts were added to the      bill, making it more costly.       Particularly galling to some Republicans in the House and      Senate was making the new curbs applicable to transactions      entered after Nov. 19, 2003, which they argued makes the      provision retroactive. But Senate aides said that was done to      thwart a ``rush-to-market'' of promoters of the leasing      transactions seeking to close deals under the wire.       ``The fact that it was moved back continually to pay for      various items might suggest that revenue had some kind of      relevance,'' said Kenneth Kies of Clark Consulting, who      lobbies on behalf of a coalition that wants the leasing      benefits preserved.       Hill sources said Thomas and other Republicans, including      some from the Senate, would insist in an eventual conference      committee that the Senate language making the leasing      provisions retroactive to last year be removed.       Also stirring some controversy are new limits on the amount      individuals could deduct for donating automobiles to charity.      (Full disclosure: My 1991 Buick was worth a     $950 deduction to me on my 2003 return. I went with the book      value for ``good'' condition and wished the American Lung      Association best of luck getting that much for it. Under the      new rules in the Senate bill, I would have been able to      deduct only what the charity reported to me was the actual      resale price of the car.)       Most donated used cars are sold at auction, and charities      for which car donations are an important part of their      fundraising are arguing to lawmakers that it is unfair to      limit taxpayer deductions to the liquidation price when many      could fetch more for cast-off autos if they found a private      buyer themselves.       Charities--including the National Kidney Foundation, the      American Cancer Society and the American Lung Association--     are shopping alternative language to House tax writers for      inclusion in the House FSC/ETI bill.       Business sources say a provision tightening rules on      deferral for income derived from contract manufacturing      overseas is an example of where the Finance Committee reached      for a revenue raiser without fully understanding the policy      consequences. The provision was struck from the bill in the      hours before final Senate passage.       ``The folks that were advocating that as a possible revenue      raiser--at a time when people were looking for revenue      raisers--didn't appreciate the extent to which most of      contract manufacturing is a completely legitimate,      appropriate business strategy,'' said Dan Kostenbauder, vice      president of transaction taxes for Hewlett-Packard. ``This is      not like someone found a fancy tax dodge.''
