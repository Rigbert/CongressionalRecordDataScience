I was not aware of all the details.  I ask unanimous consent that the document evidencing the organizations supporting the Boxer amendment be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                            Bluewater Network,                                                   August 3, 1999.     Hon. Barbara Boxer,     Senate Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Boxer: Bluewater Network and the following      signatories strongly support S. 1037 to climinate MTBE use      nationwide. Extensive investigation into the hazards of MTBE      demonstrates that continued use of this oxygenate will      further jeopardize U.S. water supplies and undercut the      public's right to clean drinking water, shoulder water and      regulatory agencies with unprecedented liabilities and cost      burdens, and seriously threaten public health.       S. 1037 targets three key areas:       (1) It provides EPA with the authority to immediately      prohibit MTBE in sensitive or at-risk communities. This will      save many areas millions of taxpayer dollars in clean up and      liability costs. California alone faces an estimated $1 to $2      billion in MTBE cost. This provision also allows EPA to react      swiftly to contamination sites, and effectively prioritize      public health.       (2) It immediately restricts the use of MTBE to areas where      oxygenates are required by the Clean Air Act. This is a      common sense approach which will minimize the use and the      impacts of MTBE during the phase-out.       Voluntary use of MTBE is common throughout the country.      Almost all of California's gasoline contains MTBE, while only      Los Angeles, San Diego, and Sacramento are required to use      oxygenates. MTBE use in     non-oxygenated zones may increase during a phase-out for      various economic reasons involving fuel supply and      distribution. For example, Chevron and Tosco recently      increased their use of MTBE in Northern California--where      oxygenates are not required--despite their agreement with      Governor Davis to cooperate with California's MTBE phase-out.      Providing immediate restrictions on MTBE in non-oxygenated      zones will prevent needless MTBE contamination, and ensure      that the use of the chemical does not spread further into      these areas.       (3) It provides an investigation into the impacts of      ethanol, olefins, aromatics, and alkylates which will provide      critical information about the impacts of banning MTBE, the      general effectiveness of oxygenates, and the overall benefits      of the federal Reformulated Gasoline Program. We strongly      recommend Senator Boxer include the study of ``other ether-     based additives'' in this section to adequately assess the      feasibility and risks of chemical additives with similar      properties as MTBE (e.g. TAME, ETBE). The elimination of      MTBE, and especially the use of non-oxygenated fuels proposed      by some refiners, necessitates fuel blending adjustments      which employ these chemicals. These studies will ensure that      the impacts of non-MTBE fuels are fully realized.       We commend Senator Boxer's efforts to combat the MTBE      problem nationally. Neither improving underground storage      tanks, banning two-stroke engines, and/or lifting the Clean      Air Act's oxygen mandate will prevent continued use of the      additive, nor will such steps protect our most critical      resources and public health from ongoing MTBE contamination.       S. 1037 provides critical protections against the inherent      risks of MTBE use, and phases out a chemical known to be a      significant threat to public health.       We look forward to working with you on this issue. If we      can be of any assistance, please do not hesitate to contact      us. Thank you for your consideration.
