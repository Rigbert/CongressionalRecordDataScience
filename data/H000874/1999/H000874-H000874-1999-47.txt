Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Kolbe), and I agree with him. Allegations of unfair treatment by Customs personnel toward minorities at international airports is certainly taken seriously by this committee. This is an area where we need to exercise our oversight responsibilities.  The United States Customs Service has taken these allegations seriously as well and has undertaken a thorough review of its policies. More importantly, an independent panel has been appointed to review the practices of personal searches at the Customs Service and by the Customs Service.  The Personal Search Review Commission is chaired by a widely respected individual, Ms. Constance Newman, and includes three esteemed officials from other agencies. As someonewho has had the opportunity of working with Connie Newman over the years, I have full confidence in her fairness, in her thoroughness, and in her impartiality.  The collective experience, knowledge, and insight of the commission will provide a firm basis for an objective analysis of the Customs Service's methods for carrying out this aspect of their mission.  In addition, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Sanford Cloud, the President of the National Conference for Community and Justice, has been selected to be an independent advisor to the Commission of the Customs Service on personal search matters.  In this time of change at Customs, it is imperative that Congress be provided with the information to evaluate the modifications in personal search policy. That is why we intend for this report to be prepared by the Customs Service with the approval of the Secretary of Treasury and Under Secretary for Enforcement on the changes and its implementation.  I thank the chairman for allowing us to clarify this matter so that we fully understand the import of the language that is included in our bill.
