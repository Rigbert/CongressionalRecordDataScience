 President, this amendment will be accepted. And I would like to say, after listening to Senator Feinstein's statement, as well as studying the legislation in great detail, we can enthusiastically back this and fight for its retention in conference as well. I was not that certain when I visited with the Senator privately, but I would like to state publicly that we think she has a very good idea here and that we can work to keep it in conference. I cannot guarantee anything, but at least I feel very strongly about it.  It kind of backs up some of the things that we have done on disclosure in the managers' amendment as well. Those things will probably be much more controversial in conference than what the Senator from California is trying to do. She, from my standpoint, through the year that we have worked on this legislation, and being prodded also by the Senator from Illinois about the problems that we have or the potential problems we have with credit card companies, and they not being too careful in their anticipation of who they take on to give credit to, does back up the study that the Senator from California has called for.  She does not give new statutory authority to the Federal Reserve. She does give the Federal Reserve authority, after the study, if the Federal Reserve wants to do it, to issue regulations that would require additional disclosure to consumers, then, within their existing statutory authority, if the board finds necessary, ``to ensure responsible industrywide practices and to prevent resulting consumer debt and insolvency.''  This is all based upon a study which we believe, based upon our year's consideration of this legislation, probably is a very worthwhile thing for us to have and to promote. So with those ideas in mind, we accept the amendment and congratulate the Senator from California. Most importantly, we thank her for her cooperative attitude toward our resolving a lot of differences we have had with her original legislation.
