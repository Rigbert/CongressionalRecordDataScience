 President, later today Senate Democrats will show where their legislative priorities truly lie.  At a moment when the American people are reeling from the slowest economic recovery in modern times, and just 5\1/2\ months away from the culmination of tax hikes and spending cuts already being referred to around the world as America's fiscal cliff, Senate Democrats want us to waste our time on the DISCLOSE Act, a bill that has only two discernible purposes: to create the impression of mischief where there is none, and to send a signal to unions that Democrats are just as eager to do their legislative bidding as ever.  Think about it. We have had 41 straight months of unemployment above 8 percent. It has been more than 3 years since the Democratic Senate passed a budget, but this is what they want to do.  For months Republicans have been urging Democrats to do something about the approaching fiscal cliff now, before it is too late.
