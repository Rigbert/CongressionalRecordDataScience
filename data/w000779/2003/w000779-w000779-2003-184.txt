President, before she leaves the floor, let me commend our colleague from Texas, Senator Hutchison, who has spent an enormous amount of time on this issue. It has been particularly helpful to this Senator as I worked on some of the privacy issues I will be discussing. I thank my colleague for all of her good work.  Earlier this year I spoke on the floor about what I think has been the most important privacy issue of our time. That is the proposal for what is known as the Total Information Awareness Program. This would constitute the biggest surveillance program in American history. In the U.S. Senate, Senators Inouye, Stevens, and Feinstein have been working on a bipartisan basis with our colleagues in both political parties. We put in place sensible restrictions so as to ensure accurate congressional oversight.  What we called for was a requirement that first there be a report by the proponents of the program and the agencies involved on how the program would work.  Second, there is a requirement that to deploy any of the technology under the Total Information Awareness Program, there would have to be explicit congressional approval. This was a momentous step for the Senate to pass this legislation unanimously.  I am rising today to discuss what I think is yet another very significant privacy question which is an issue that needs debate in committee on this particular bill: the air cargo security legislation. The air cargo security legislation includes a proposal that I offered regarding what is known as CAPPS II, the passenger prescreening system that the Transportation Security Administration is developing. This program would do a computer search on each airline passenger to determine who should be subject to more careful security screening and, in some cases, who shouldn't be allowed to get on a plane.  All of us in the U.S. Senate understand that it is critically important to protect the security and safety of those who fly, and we certainly want to look at ways to do it that are smart and, particularly, target resources in an efficient way. But to set up a system that seeks information on each and every aircraft traveler and uses that system to assign scores to every individual--a score as to who might possibly be a threat--does raise some very significant privacy questions for the Senate.  The American people will want to know whether that system is narrowly limited for a specific purpose or whether it would become an all-purpose electronic snooping system. The public wants to know whether there are accurate safeguards to be sure the system won't be abused and sound procedures to provide passengers with the means to address mistakes.  Verbal assurances that these technologies will be used only on ``lawfully collected information'' are not enough. For one thing, ``lawfully collected information'' can include almost anything--my medical information, financial information, the books I have read, places I have visited. This same information--for each of my distinguished colleagues and millions of law-abiding citizens--can also be ``lawfully collected.''  In order to protect our civil liberties and right to privacy, Congress must be fully and publicly briefed on these types of new technological efforts.  As the New York Times editorial page said earlier this year, identifying travelers who may pose a terrorist threat is ``a worthy goal'' but also ``raises serious privacy and due process concerns, which the government needs to address in a forthright manner.'' I ask unanimous consent that the text of this article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, Mar. 11, 2003]                       The New Airport Profiling       Having successfully fielded thousands of newly minted      federal agents to screen air travelers and their luggage, the      Transportation Security Administration is now turning to a      far more controversial endeavor. The agency is developing a      sophisticated screening system designed to identify travelers      who may pose a terrorist threat.       It is a worthy goal--one ordered up by Congress--but the      creation of a highly intrusive federal surveillance program      raises serious privacy and due process concerns, which the      government needs to address in a forthright manner.       The notion of electronic profiling is not new. Using such      criteria as whether a passenger paid cash for a ticket, a      rudimentary system designed in the mid-1990's helped airlines      flag passengers deserving heightened scrutiny. What that      usually meant was that their checked luggage was carefully      inspected. Some of the Sept. 11 hijackers were reported to      have been picked out by that system, but it did little good      since they did not check any bags.       The new profiling system is a quantum leap. In addition to      evaluating certain travel-related behavior and looking for      passenger names on watch lists, the new system will give the      transportation agency access to numerous public and private      databases the moment a passenger books a flight. Exactly      which ones has not yet been determined, but     they may include the records of Department of Motor Vehicle      offices, banks and credit-rating agencies.       After the program is in place, which could be as early as      the end of this year, the Transportation Security      Administration will assign each passenger a risk level:      green, yellow or red. Travelers will not be informed of their      designations, which will be encrypted onto their boarding      passes. The T.S.A. says it is mindful of the obvious privacy      concerns raised by such a system, though it points out that      it will not be amassing new databases, but rather mining ones      already used routinely to profile consumers. The agency says      it is not interested in knowing whether you bounced a check      five years ago, or whether you have paid your parking      tickets, but in authenticating your identity.       Privacy principles are not necessarily sacrosanct, but this      plan runs the risk of overreaching. For one thing, it could      quickly lead to mistaken actions based on inaccurate      information.       More worrisome is the possibility that this system could      grow into a runaway vacuum cleaner, sweeping up all manner of      data that can then be misused by the government. Congress      recently put the brakes on the Pentagon's Total Information      Awareness project, a dangerously uncontrolled program that      was designed to track the activities of millions of      Americans. Lawmakers must ensure that the transportation      agency's profiling system does not become an all-purpose      equivalent.
