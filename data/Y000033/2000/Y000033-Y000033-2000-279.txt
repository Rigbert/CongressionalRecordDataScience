Yes, Mr. Chairman, I do. It is very unfortunate that the gentleman, who serves on my committee, raises the point of order. But I would like to suggest one thing. The Forest Service asked me for this amendment. It serves a point where the regulations do not allow the small sales for those that they believe should take place, especially blown down timber. The cost of putting up the sale and going through the competitive process would preclude most of these small operators, especially those in the environmental community that wanted this timber.  For the gentleman who says he is an environmentalist, I wish he had checked with the environmentalists. Apparently he did not. I think it is very unfortunate, but this is something asked for.  I will move a bill through the committee next Tuesday. The gentleman will have a chance to vote no on it, and I will beat him at that time and bring it to the floor under suspension. When that occurs, we will make this the law.
