President, the reason I am raising this issue--I realize the Senator from California has not had the misfortune I have had, of being constantly on the floor listening to the debate on this bill--but a major issue we have been grappling with is parity in the rules. This issue has not just come up with regard to the amendment of the Senator from California, it has come up over and over.  I am not in any way singling out the Senator from California to raise this issue. This has come up on every single issue we have been tackling on the floor, which is, if we are going to have more disclosure for the legislative branch, should we not have the exact same or comparable disclosures for high-ranking executive branch officials?  The issue I raised, I wish to assure the Senator from California, is no means unique to her amendment. It has come up over and over and, indeed, the first amendment that we were supposed to have voted on last night was an amendment by Senator Paul, making clear that this bill applied to theexecutive branch and then Senator Shelby had an amendment to make sure there was online disclosure by the executive branch.  This is an issue that has permeated the entire debate on the STOCK Act. It is not unique to the issue that has been raised by the Senator from California.
