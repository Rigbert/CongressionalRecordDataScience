 The court was very clear that they were not able to get a discharge for that purpose.  Mr. President, I see my friend from New Jersey, who is on the other side of the aisle but very supportive of our legislation, who needs time because he supports this legislation from our side of the aisle. So I am going to quit at this point. I ask if I can have the floor back after he has finished.
