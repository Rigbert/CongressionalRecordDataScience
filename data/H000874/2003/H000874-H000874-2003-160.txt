Speaker, I thank the leader for his information. I want him to know on this side of the aisle we are going to be joining the majority side of the aisle as we reflect upon the tragic loss of some of our fellow citizens and the tragic loss of all of us and our country on that September 11.  Mr. Leader, can you tell me what time on Tuesday Members need to be here to assure themselves that they will be able to offer the amendments on the Transportation-Treasury bill?  Mr. DeLAY. If the gentleman will yield further, I would say at least by 2 p.m. on Tuesday, because for Members who are offering the amendments or who wish to be heard in the debate, we will begin consideration of the Treasury-Transportation bill at 2 p.m. in the afternoon.
