 President, I rise today to introduce the Angel Island Immigration Station Restoration and Preservation Act, with Senator Boxer as cosponsor.  This legislation authorizes the use of up to $15 million in Federal funds for ongoing efforts to restore the Angel Island Immigration Station located on Angel Island within the San Francisco Bay.  I offer this as companion legislation to H.R. 4469 which has been introduced by Congresswoman Lynn Woolsey and to date has 45 cosponsors. Last week this bill was reported out of the House Resources Committee by unanimous consent.  The Angel Island Immigration Station is an important piece of Americanhistory, especially to our Nation's Asian American and immigrant communities.  In the mid 19th Century millions of people, including ancestors of my own staff, came to America in pursuit of the American dream. Most people are familiar with Ellis Island and the stories of immigrants coming to America and seeing the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor, but often forgotten are the experiences of those who made it to America by way of Angel Island. Just like those who came to New York City, there are many stories of triumph and tribulation associated with Angel Island.  However, for the Chinese and those from other Asian countries the story goes a bit further.  The economic downturn in the 1870s brought political pressures to deal with the increasing population of Chinese who were coming through the Golden Gate in search of a better life. Amongst the harshest of measures taken was the passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882.  The passage of this law and its subsequent implementation led to the creation of a national system to regulate the immigration of the Chinese.  Part of this process included opening the Angel Island Immigration Station in 1910 on Angel Island. The purpose of this new facility was to isolate Chinese immigrants from the City of San Francisco and the rest of the Bay Area.  After a difficult journey across the Pacific Ocean, potential immigrants were brought to the Station where they faced separation from their family, embarrassing medical examinations, grueling interrogations and long detainments that lasted months, even years, in living conditions that were considered deplorable.  Testaments to these experiences can be found today on the wooden walls of the barracks. Many of the detainees told their stories through poems that they carved on the barrack walls.  Using allegories and historical references, they described their aspirations for coming to America as well as expressed their anger and sadness at the treatment they received.  Concerns about the safety of the Station were realized when part of the Administration Building burned down in 1940 and all those being held were moved to a mainland facility.  Three years later Congress repealed the Chinese Exclusion Act. For the next 20 years the Station remained mostly unused except for a short term during World War II, when it was used as a prisoner of war camp.  In 1963, Angel Island became a State park and the California Department of Parks and Recreation assumed stewardship of the Immigration Station.  In 1997, the Station was a declared a National Historic Landmark and in 1999, Save America's Treasures named the Angel Island Immigration Station one of its Official Projects and provided $500,000 for the preservation of poems carved into the walls.  The Station is supported by the people of California as well as numerous private interests. The voters of California voted in 2000 to set aside $15 million for restoration of the Station through Proposition 12 and in addition approximately $1.1 million in private funds has been raised so far.  The amount authorized by this bill and the committed State resources will raise about half the amount needed to restore the Station. The remaining money will be raised through private means making this a true public-private partnership.  Today, approximately 200,000 visits are made each year to Angel Island by ferry from San Francisco, Tiburon and Alameda. In addition, 60,000 visits are made to the Immigration Station, about half of which are students are on guided tours.  The resources secured so far have set in motion designing and planning efforts to restore the Station.  The bill I am introducing today will allow the State park to accept Federal funding to complete the restoration of the Angel Island Immigration Station, so that the stories of immigration on Angel Island will be preserved for future generations.                                 ______                                       By
