 Speaker, today I recognize the outstanding work done by participants in my Student Congressional Town Meeting held this Spring at the University of Vermont. These participants were part of a group of high school students from around Vermont who testified about the concerns they have as teenagers, and about what they would like to see government do regarding these concerns.     Jessica Predom and Autumn Rozon Regarding Teenage Stereotypes       JESSICA PREDOM. People, when they hear the word ``teen,''      think of bombs, fires, smoking, sex. Although some teens have      experience with these things at a young age doesn't mean we      all have. People these days are so hypocritical. Everyone was      a teen, but it is like, if people hit 30, they forget what      being 18 is like. I know some kids have sex and do drugs, but      a majority do not. just because some teens do, teens like us      get classified into a group we would rather not be in.       AUTUMN ROZON. Just the other day, I was looking at the back      of Glade air freshener bottle, and it said: ``Warning.      Flammable. Keep away from small children and teens to avoid      substance abuse.'' I can see where the small-children      statement comes in, but keeping air freshener away from      teens? I mean, come on. I didn't know our reputation was that      bad. It's almost painful to see someone be turned down for a      job because he or she has green hair and two piercings.      Automatically, when you see a teen like that, you      automatically think: Druggie. What most people think is not      the true story. It is almost like an instance where someone      hears part of your conversation and reacts before they know      the whole thing. Now, my town is small, so when you are      driving down Main Street, you see some kids sitting outside      the grocery store, you think to yourself: They're up to no      good. When, really, they're just waiting for their friend who      works there.       A few years ago, there was an incident that we all      remember. The tragedy at Columbine was one of the biggest      scares to our country. Because of the shooting at Columbine,      teens around the world were looked as something that could      explode at any time. The headlines focus on the teen part of      the shooting, and not on the main issue of the two kids who      did it. By stereotyping like this, teens feel the need to      rebel. Rebellion is the cause of most kid's sexual      experiences and drug abuse.       The way our world looks at teens causes them to do certain      things. If people could stop looking at us as teens, and look      at us as young adults, we would start to accept ourselves and      our community more. I think everyone has a good side, and      people in our world are not letting teens express their good      side. Don't judge us because of what we wear or what we look      like. Take time to get to know us, and you will see that most      of us do not do drugs, do not have sex, and do not drink. We      have lives and we are trying to live them while we still can.      Daniel May Regarding Student Representation on School Boards       DANIEL MAY. Good afternoon, Congressman Sanders.       I am presenting the issue of student representation on      local school boards.       In our state of Vermont, there are 18 high schools that      have at least one student representative on their board,      while other high schools don't. I pity these schools who      don't, because, by having at least one student on the school      boards, there ought to be three impacts.       First, the boards will be able to make better decisions and      be able to implement them more easily. Second, members of the      student body will have raised political awareness of their      school and the surroundings of their city. And third, the      student representative will be provided with opportunities to      assume leadership roles and gain skills.       Students should have a right for making their voices heard,      because they are the people being affected by the school      board's decisions. Silencing the voices of people you control      isn't in the best interest of those governing bodies.      Encouraging participation is a lesson that teachers need to      take from the students.       I want to make sure that the students get their voices      heard. I fear that some school boards may be inconsistent in      allowing a student on the board. First of all, I'm concerned      that some school boards will fail to     provide orientation from the student-trustees. Some student      reps may begin their terms without any training. They will      just attend their first meeting, not understanding the      meeting procedures, nor jurisdictions, nor their own rules,      rights and responsibilities. Then they will spend their first      month learning how the board operates, and only be able to      play a more meaningful role towards the end of term.       My other concern is that student reps be excluded from the      debate and compromise that it is a part of decisionmaking.      Many student reps that feel their participation in the      decision-making process is limited to their formal role      during public meetings. They feel that their input is not      sought out formally when the trustees discuss issues and seek      support for their positions.       As long as these two issues do not become a concern, school      boards will become more efficient with a student      representative.                                  ____                                                Jamie Walbridge Regarding Graduated License       JAMIE WALBRIDGE. The issue that we, the teens of the      community of Barre, are raising today is the new graduated      driver's license. This is an issue that has been raised among      many households, and we feel it should be raised once again      to the Vermont legislators. We feel the graduated driver's      license law has many faults that affect the young teens as      well as their families.       The effect of this law on families in our community is that      the teens who have recently gotten their license and fall      under this law are restricted from bringing even their      siblings to school. There are some schools in Vermont, such      as Spaulding, that do not provide a bussing system, forcing      parents to go when one of the children is already going.      Parents still have to be present when their child and a group      of friends carpool to any sort of event.       In the next few years, all teenagers will be under this      law. Therefore, no one can carpool, and there will be more      cars on the road. With more cars on the road, the chance of      getting into an accident will increase, as well as an      increase in pollution going into the air. Here at Spaulding      High School, parking is already a major issue. Students are      having trouble finding a parking spot, and that's with      approximately half the drivers under the law. Can you imagine      the parking problems when every student has their own car?       Another problem we found with the graduated license is that      Vermont's restrictions are more harsh and for a longer period      of time than most other states that have issued the law, as      well. In Vermont the law states that we have our permits for      a year, then have passenger restrictions for six months. The      first three months of having your license include the      following restrictions: By yourself, or if there are other      people in the car with you, you need to have a licensed      driver of 25 years of age or older. For the second three      months of your license, you can only have immediate family      with you. In Wyoming, teens have their permits for ten days,      and no restrictions when they get their license. Do you think      that those teens are ready to drive at all? Kansas, Montana,      Nevada, Oklahoma, and Alabama have no restrictions at all.       When we were researching this law, we called the Department      of Motor Vehicles to get statistics, and we were told that      nothing could be released because they could not prove that      the graduated license was the reason for the decrease in      teenage driving fatalities.       Another problem with the law is that police officers are      not even familiar with the graduated license. To us, this      seems very unorganized. I was pulled over for having a light      out, and I got an $80 ticket for having passengers in my car.      I am grandfathered from the law, but I had no proof to show      the officer. I contested the ticket and got it voided, but it      was a big hassle for no reason.       We don't think that every aspect of this law is negative or      bad. We agree one hundred percent that, without having our      permit for a full year, we would not be ready to face the      responsibilities and the unexpected problems of the open      road. Our solution to this problem is to shorten the      restrictions after getting your license, shorten it from six      months to two or three months. We don't want to completely      abandon the whole law.       We think that, with all these restrictions on driving, that      it has taken away the fun of being 16 and having your      license. When you are a little kid, there are three birthdays      that you took forward to: When you are 15, you get your      permit. At 16, you get your license and can drive around with      your friends. At 18, you are officially an adult. The      excitement and freedom of turning 16 feels like it is being      taken away.                               ____________________
