 President, I understand Senator Baucus and Senator Murray are on their way and wish 5 minutes each to speak relative to this amendment. I ask unanimous consent that between now and 1 o'clock, they be allocated 5 minutes each and that the amendment then still would be the pending amendment.  I ask unanimous consent that we now proceed to the amendment of Senator McCain and that when those two Senators arrive and are recognized, they be allowed to speak for 5 minutes each on the Udall amendment.
