Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to engage the gentleman in a colloquy.  Mr. Chairman, the chairman of the Subcommittee on VA, HUD and Independent Agencies of the Committee on Appropriations and I reached an agreement on the NASA transfer authority contained in H.R. 2158 for the International Space Station which allows the NASA administrator to transfer up to $150 million from the science, aeronautics, and technology account and the mission support account to the International Space Station Program. This authority is contained on page 64, lines 8 through 22 of the Union Calendar bill.  I agreed not to raise a point of order against the transfer authority in exchange for a commitment by the gentleman from California [Mr. Lewis] that any conference report to H.R. 2158 containing transfer authority language would require NASA to obtain approval from both the House Committee on Science, in addition to approval from the Committee on Appropriations.  This agreement is critical to protect the oversight responsibilities of the authorization committee, and I thank the chairman of the Subcommittee on VA, HUD and Independent Agencies for his assurances that will require the NASA administrator to formally request, justify, and obtain prior approval from the Committee on Science before utilizing the transfer authority contained in this legislation.  In this way, the committees will be able to hold NASA accountable for any decision to transfer funds into the space station account. Is it the distinguished subcommittee chairman's commitment, based upon our agreement, not to support any conference report for H.R. 2158 which contains NASA transfer authority unless it also includes report language requiring prior approval, on a case-by-case basis, by the Committee on Appropriations and the Committee on Science of any transfers by NASA?
