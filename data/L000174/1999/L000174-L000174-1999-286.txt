President, the recent events in Kosovo have been a graphic reminder that crimes against humanity did not end with the Second World War. Our treatment of those persecuted by the Nazis has long been regarded as a travesty. Blatant American anti-Semitism led to post-war immigration quotas that virtually shut out Jews coming from concentration camps while embracing German sympathizers.  In contrast to this country's dismal record in accepting Jewish refugees following the last world war, the United States has tried harder and done better in recent years to provide refuge to those persons fleeing homelands that have been ravaged by violence. For example, over the past five years, approximately 83,247 Bosnian refugees have been admitted to this country. During the latest hostilities in Kosovo, the Clinton Administration provided leadership to other nations by pledgingto take in as many as 20,000 Kosovar refugees.  Unfortunately, criminals who wielded machetes and guns against innocent civilians in countries like Haiti, Yugoslavia and Rwanda have been able to gain entry to the United States through the same doors that we have opened to deserving refugees. We need to lock that door to those war criminals who seek a safe haven in the United States. And to those war criminals who are already here, we should promptly show them the door out.  Our country has long provided the template and moral leadership for dealing with Nazi war criminals. The Justice Department has a specialized unit, the Offfice of Special Investigations (OSI), which was created to hunt down, prosecute and remove Nazi war criminals who had slipped into the United States among their victims under the Displaced Persons Act. Since the OSI's inception in 1979, 61 Nazi persecutors have been stripped of U.S. citizenship, 49 such individuals have been removed from the United States, and more than 150 have been denied entry.  OSI was created almost 35 years after the end of World War II and it remains authorized only to track Nazi war criminals. Little is being done about the new generation of international war criminals living among us, and these delays are costly. As any prosecutor--or, in my case, former prosecutor--knows instinctively, such delays make documentary and testimonial evidence more difficult to obtain. Stale cases are the hardest to make.  We should not repeat the mistake of waiting decades before tracking down war criminals and human rights abusers who have settled in this country. War criminals should find no sanctuary in loopholes in our current immigration policies and enforcement. No war criminal should ever come to believe that he is going to find safe harbor in the United States.  Too often, once war criminals slip through the immigration nets, they remain in the United States, unpunished for their crimes. In Vermont, news reports indicate that a Bosnian-Muslim man suspected of participating in ethnic cleansing during the Serbian war now is in Burlington. He has been identified by many people, including his own relatives, as a member of a Serbian paramilitary group responsible for the torture, rape, and murder of countless innocent people. We see the possibility that refugees now may encounter their persecutors thousands of miles away from their homeland, walking the streets of America.  This is not an isolated occurrence. The center for Justice and Accountability, a San Francisco human rights group, has identified approximately sixty suspected human rights violators now living in the United States. We have unwittingly sheltered the oppressors along with the oppressed for too long. We should not let this situation continue. We waited too long after the last world war to focus prosecutorial resources and attention on Nazi war criminals who entered this country on false pretenses. We should not repeat that mistake for other aliens who engaged in human rights abuses before coming to the United States. We need to focus the attention of our law enforcement investigators to prosecute and deport those who have committed atrocities abroad and who now enjoy safe harbor in the United States.  Despite U.S. ratification of the United Nations' ``Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment,'' current immigration law provides that those who participated in Nazi war crimes and genocide are inadmissible to and are removable from the United States, yet those who have committed the criminal act of torture are not. This leads to cases like that of Kelbessa Negewo, a member of the military dictatorship ruling Ethiopia in the 1970s, who has been found guilty of torture in a private civil action by an American court but who remains in the United States nonetheless because the Immigration and Naturalization Act does not provide explicit authority to investigate, denaturalize or remove him. The Leahy ``Anti-Atrocity Alien Deportation Act'' would close this loophole and make those who commit torture abroad inadmissible to and deportable from our country.  The ``Anti-Atrocity Alien Deportation Act,'' which I introduce today with Senator Kohl, would amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to expand the grounds for inadmissibility and deportation to cover aliens who have engaged in acts of torture abroad. ``Torture'' is already defined in the Federal criminal code, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2340, in a law passed as part of the implementing legislation for the ``Convention Against Torture.'' Under this Convention, the United States has an affirmative duty to prosecute torturers within its boundaries regardless of their respective nationalities. 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2340A (1994).  This legislation would also provide statutory authorization for OSI, which currently owes its existence to an Attorney General order, and would expand its jurisdiction to authorize investigations, prosecutions, and removal of any alien who participated in torture and genocide abroad--not just Nazis. The success of OSI is hunting Nazi war criminals demonstrates the effectiveness of centralized resources and expertise in these cases. OSI has worked, and it is time to update its mission.  The knowledge of the people, politics and pathologies of particular regimes engaged in genocide and human rights abuses is often necessary for effective prosecutions of these cases and may best be accomplished by the concentrated efforts of a single office, rather than in piecemeal litigation around the country or in offices that have more diverse missions.  Unquestionably, the need to bring Nazi war criminals to justice remains a matter of great importance. Funds would not be derived from the OSI's current mission. Additional resources are authorized in the bill for OSI's expanded duties.  I have for many years sought to advance the search for war criminals who have clandestinely immigrated to our country. In 1996, the moving testimony of esteemed individuals like Rabbi Marvin Hier (the dean and founder of the Simon Wisenthal Center) led me to work closely on the drafting of the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act. More recently, I helped to ensure that the OSI would be able to further its efforts in investigating and denaturalizing Nazi war criminals with a budget increase of two million dollars for 1999, and I am attempting to do the same for the Year 2000.  I have also supported a strong and effective War Crimes Tribunal--with the necessary funds and authority to fully apprehend and prosecute war criminals. Expanding the mission of OSI, combined with a vigorous War Crimes Tribunal, represents a full-scale, two-prong assault on war criminals, wherever they may hide.  We must honor and respect the unique experiences of those who were victims in the darkest moment in world history. The Anti-Defamation League has expressed its support for my bill. We may help honor the memories of the victims of the Holocaust by pursuing all war criminals who enter our country. By so doing, the United States can provide moral leadership and show that we will not tolerate perpetrators of genocide and torture, least of all here.  In sum, the Anti-Atrocity Alien Deportation Act would:  Bar admission into the United States and authorize the deportation of aliens who have engaged in acts of torture abroad.  Provide statutory authorization for and expand the jurisdiction of the Office of Special Investigations (so-called ``Nazi war criminal hunters'') with the Department of Justice to investigate, prosecute and remove any alien who participated in torture and genocide abroad--not just Nazis; and  Authorize additional funding to ensure that OSI has adequate resources to fulfill its current mission of hunting Nazi war criminals.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a sectional analysis be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1375       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Anti-Atrocity Alien      Deportation Act''.     SEC. 2. INADMISSIBILITY AND REMOVABILITY OF ALIENS WHO HAVE                    COMMITTED ACTS OF TORTURE ABROAD.       (a) Inadmissibility.--Section 212(a)(3)(E) of the      Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)(E)) is      amended by adding at the end the following:       ``(iii) Commission of acts of torture.--Any alien who,      outside the United States, has committed any act of torture,      as defined in section 2340 of title 18, United States Code,      is inadmissible.''.       (b) Removability.--Section 237(a)(4)(D) of that Act (8      U.S.C. 1227(a)(4)(D)) is amended by striking ``clause (i) or      (ii)'' and inserting ``clause (i), (ii), or (iii)''.       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section      shall apply to offenses committed before, on, or after the      date of enactment of this Act.     SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF THE OFFICE OF SPECIAL                    INVESTIGATIONS.       (a) Amendment of the Immigration and Nationality Act.--     Section 103 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C.      1103) is amended by adding at the end the following:       ``(g) The Attorney General shall establish within the      Criminal Division of the Department of Justice an Office of      Special Investigations with the authority of investigating,      and, where appropriate, taking legal action to remove,      denaturalize, or prosecute any alien found to be in violation      of clause (i), (ii), or (iii) of section 212(a)(3)(E).''.       (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--       (1) In general.--There are authorized to be appropriated to      the Department of Justice for the fiscal year 2000 such sums      as may be necessary to carry out the additional duties      established under section 103(g) of the Immigration and      Nationality Act (as added by this Act) in order to ensure      that the Office of Special Investigations fulfills its      continuing obligations regarding Nazi war criminals.       (2) Availability of funds.--Amounts appropriated pursuant      to paragraph (1) are authorized to remain available until      expended.                                  ____    Sectional Analysis of Leahy Anti-Atrocity Alien Deportation Act       Summary: This bill would make two significant changes in      our country's enforcement capability against those who have      committed atrocities abroad and then entered the United      States. First, the bill would amend the Immigration and      Nationality Act to expand the grounds for inadmissibility and      deportation to cover aliens who have engaged in acts of      torture, as defined in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2340, abroad. Second,      the bill would direct the Attorney General to establish the      Office of Special Investigations (OSI) within the Criminal      Division and expand the current OSI's authority to      investigate, prosecute, and remove any alien who participated      in torture and genocide abroad, not just Nazi war criminals.       Sec. 1. Short Title. The Act may be cited as the ``Anti-     Atrocity Alien Deportation Act.''       Sec. 2. Admissibility and Removability of Aliens Who Have      Committed Acts of Torture Abroad. Currently, the Immigration      and Nationality Act provides that (i) participants in Nazi      persecutions during the time period from March 23, 1933 to      May 8, 1945, and (ii) aliens who engaged in genocide, are      inadmissable to the United States and deportable. See 8      U.S.C. Sec. 1182(a)(3)(E)(i) and Sec. 1227(a)(4)(D). The bill      would amend these sections of the Immigration and Nationality      Act by expanding the grounds for inadmissibility and      deportation to cover aliens who have engaged in acts of      torture abroad. The United Nations' ``Convention Against      Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or      Punishment'' entered into force with respect to the United      States on November 20, 1994. This Convention, and the      implementing legislation, the Torture Victims Protection Act,      18 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 2340 et seq., includes the definition of      ``torture'' incorporated in the bill and imposed an      affirmative duty on the United States to prosecute tortures      within its jurisdiction.       Sec. 3. Establishment of the Office of Special      Investigations. Attorney General Civiletti established OSI in      1979 within the Criminal Division of the Department of      Justice, consolidating within it all ``investigative and      litigation activities involving individuals, who prior to and      during World War II, under the supervision of or in      association with the Nazi government of Germany, its allies,      and other affiliatated [sic] governments, are alleged to have      ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise participated in the      persecution of any person because of race, religion, national      origin, or political opinion.'' (Att'y Gen. Order No. 851-     79). The OSI's mission continues to be limited by that      Attorney General Order.       This section would amend the Immigration and Nationality      Act, 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1103, by directing the Attorney General to      establish an Office of Special Investigations within the      Department of Justice with authorization to investigate,      remove, denaturalize, or prosecute any alien who has      participated in torture or genocide abroad. This would expand      OSI's current authorized mission. Additional funds are      authorized for these expanded duties to ensure that OSI      fulfills its continuing obligations regarding Nazi war      criminals.                                 ______                                       By
