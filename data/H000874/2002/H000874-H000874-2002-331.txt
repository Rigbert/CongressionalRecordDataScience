Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to my friend, Karen Hosler, an outstanding reporter at the Baltimore Sun.  Over three decades, Karen has chronicled the political system from small town Maryland to the Nation's Capital, with the Sun as her outlet since 1977.  She and I have traveled through Maryland state and national politics together, although on different sides of the street as reporter and politician.  We both graduated from the University of Maryland, albeit a number of years apart.  After a short stint as a staffer on Capitol Hill, she began her career as a journalist covering county government and politics at a weekly newspaper in the Maryland suburbs of Washington, the Prince George's County News, shortly after my own career in politics had begun in that county as a state senator.  The first time that we met I was a little bit less than friendly to the new reporter at the Prince George's County News. I was frustrated by an unbalanced story written by her predecessor just before the election. But Karen held her ground and we embarked on a relationship based on respect for the other's role in the democratic process that eventually would become a friendship.  Three years later, she joined the staff of a historic daily newspaper in Maryland's capital city of Annapolis, the Capital. Karen covered state politics, including the governor and the state legislature, for the Capital from 1974 to 1977 which matched my election to the presidency of the Maryland State Senate in 1975.  She was always a tough interrogator of a politician. She asked the hard questions that we didn't always like to answer, but she always got it out of us. Karen asked not just what but why. She took her responsibility as a reporter very seriously and her readers were the better for it. They were better informed and better able to make judgments about their representatives, their government and its policies.  In 1977, Karen joined the Sun, one of our country's preeminent newspapers. She began at the Sun where she originally started her career--covering local government.  Two years later, she was back in Annapolis covering politics and state government.  In 1983, Karen moved from Annapolis politics to national politics--after four years on the state political beat, Karen was assigned to cover the Maryland congressional delegation on Capitol Hill. I had been elected to Congress in a special election two years before.  For the next twenty years, she reported from Washington for the Sun from numerous vantage points, while I worked hard to represent the Fifth Congressional District well, and our paths crossed often.  After five years of following the congressional delegation she moved to the White House. Five years later, in 1993, she was back on Capitol Hill as the national congressional correspondent. I was in my fourth year as Chairman of the Democratic Caucus.  In 1998 she became the acting Deputy Washington Bureau Chief directing national, international and Washington regional coverage until January 1999, when she returned to the national political beat.  Now, after thirty years of outstanding political reporting at all levels, Karen is leaving her friends and colleagues in Washington to join the Sun's editorial board in Baltimore.  Karen will bring to the Editorial Board a perspective shaped by three decades of observation and analysis of every level of government.  Thomas Jefferson, who both used the press to proselytize and suffered under opponents' vicious attacks delivered through newspapers, said the following: ``. . . were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter.''  Jefferson knew that the press is an essential cog in democracy's engine, without which our country would not enjoy the quality of government and freedoms it has. It is the men and women behind the newsprint who perform the vital role of examiner of government and act as a crucial source of information for citizens.  Without the hard work and intellect of reporters and editors the vaunted principle of the freedom of the press would surely wither and die.  Karen Hosler, as one such reporter, has contributed immensely to educating the citizenry on local, state and national politics throughout her career at the Baltimore Sun.  I have great respect for Karen, the journalist, who through her political reporting has done more than her share to keep our democracy vital. And, as her friend, I wish her great success in the exciting new challenge on which she now embarks.  I wish Karen Hosler the best of luck in her new position at the Sun, where she will have a broader opportunity than ever before to shape opinion and inform her readers.                          ____________________
