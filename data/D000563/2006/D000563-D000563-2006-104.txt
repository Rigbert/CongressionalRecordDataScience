President, I submitted the language in this resolution to the Republican side. I have worked on three different versions of the language to find something that mirrors the language, the purpose clause, of the bill that was introduced by Senator Domenici and Senator Wellstone, calling on the Senate to try to enact legislation to meet that goal.  There may be Senators who vote for this resolution and want to offer an amendment or change it. That is the way this place works. But to suggest if you call for legislation to give people with mental illness a chance for compensation in your health insurance that it is not collegial--it is not collegial? I have offered this resolution and amended it twice in an effort to be as collegial as possible. But it is hard to understand.
