Chairman, reclaiming my time, I thank the gentleman from California [Mr. Lewis], and I would say that if I misinterpreted the gentleman's position, it may have been because of the vote in the committee. When my amendment came up before the committee, there was not a single Republican supporting the amendment which I have brought to the floor today. It was not a totally partisan rollcall, because some Democrats opposed my position, but not a single Republican supported my position in committee.
