 Let me describe a tragedy, a tragedy which hits a little close to home for me. My grandson is 9 years old.  This is a tragedy involving a 10-year-old little boy in Philadelphia. On February 11 of last year, this little boy, Faheem, was on his way to school, walking from home to school. As he came into the schoolyard through the gates, a gang member came up and shot him in the face. He remained conscious for a short period of time, lapsed into a coma, and died 5 days later. That is a tragedy.
