  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, today the House will take up an incredibly complicated $400 million bill which purports to provide seniors something they need: help in buying pharmaceuticals. We could do this more simply and more cost effectively. We could have the government negotiate lower drug prices on behalf of seniors as they do for the Veterans' Administration, a minimum of a 24-percent reduction for veterans' drugs and actually an average of about 50 percent.  There is a bigger group of Medicare people. We could do better. It would not cost anything.  We could also allow the free reimportation of FDA-approved, U.S.-certified, U.S.-manufactured drugs from Canada and other countries. Many seniors in my district are doing that now, saving an average of 50 percent. But, no. Instead, this bill is going to prohibit the reimportation. This bill is going to prohibit the government from negotiating lower prices for pharmaceuticals, all to protect the profits of the pharmaceutical industry at a time when many seniors cannot afford the drugs they need to maintain their health.                          ____________________
