If we were in a different political environment, I think the Republican Senators and Democratic Senators would agree that this should go through and go through quickly. But we have been caught up for weeks now in debate and controversy, and this bill has been tossed into that environment. That is the explanation because I do not think there is a single provision I read here that Republican Senators do not support, as the Democratic Senators support. That is why I made my suggestion.
