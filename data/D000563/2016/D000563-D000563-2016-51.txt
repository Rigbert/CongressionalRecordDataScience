President, it has been said that nations that forget its defenders will be itself forgotten. Well, I would like to take a moment to recognize one of those defenders who fought for and secured our freedom during World War II. First, I want to commend Richard Paul for his brave actions and quiet courage--and thank him for a debt that we can never fully repay. I also want to wish him an early happy birthday. On October 23, Richard Paul, first lieutenant of the 13th Army Air Force--from Quincy, IL--will turn 100 years old. What an achievement.  Today, I am honored to share his story. Let me take you back to November 29, 1942. On that November day, in the midst of World War II, rather than waiting to have his draft number called, Richard drove down to the nearest Army Air Force Cadet Training Program in Peoria, IL, and volunteered to serve. The next day, he was sworn into the program and told to await further orders. In January 1943, Richard received his orders and reported to Decatur, IL.  After stints in Jefferson Barracks, MO, and Galesburg, IL, Richard found himself in Texas for pilot training. On March 12, 1944, Richard graduated from flight school and spent the next 7 weeks in Liberal, KS, learning to fly the B-24 Liberator, an American bomber with the greatest bomb load carrying capacity and longest range of its time. By the spring of 1944, First Lieutenant Richard Paul and his crew flew B-24 Liberators on 36 combat missions, including two recon missions in the South Pacific theater. Richard also received the Distinguished Flying Cross for his heroism and extraordinary achievement while participating and supporting military operations in an aerial flight.  Although he didn't know it at the time, on March 20, 1945, Richard flew his final mission. The following day, he was told he was going back to the States. For all his wartime accomplishments, I think Richard would agree that his greatest achievement happened in flight school, marrying Esther Viola Jewell, who he simply called Vi. After getting permission from his base commander, the chaplain picked Richard and his bride up from the hotel she was staying at in Independence, KS. There was one problem: Richard and Vi didn't have witnesses. So Richard rushed back to the barracks and found two cadets to fill in. Disaster averted. And on Christmas Eve 1943, Richard and Vi were married. They would spend the next 64 Christmases together before Vi passed on December 14, 2008.  We owe a great debt to veterans like Richard, who came home after the war and built this Nation. When the war ended, Richard first looked for work as a pilot at a Minneapolis airline. But despite his incredible experience, he was told they received nearly 100 applications from former Army pilots every day and did not have enough jobs. Well, it was the airline's loss and a blessing for the people of Quincy. The following year, Richard became a pharmacist and spent the next 44 years working in Quincy at the Brown Drug Company--the same Brown Drug Company Vi worked at in 1940.  There are many advantages of having 100 years on Earth, but on top of the list may be the ability to spread love in so many ways. Whether it was through love of country--while serving as first lieutenant in the 13th Air Force during World War II; love of community--spending 44 years as a pharmacist at the Brown Drug Company; or love of family, raising 4 daughters with his wife, Vi, 8 grandchildren, and 18 great-grandchildren--what an extraordinary legacy.  I will close with this: I have heard the first 100 years are the hardest. But I am reminded of what an old ball player once said: ``Age is a case of mind over matter. If you don't mind, it don't matter.'' So when the big day arrives, I hope Richard celebrates with friends and family--and enjoys it. He has earned it.  Thank you, Richard, for your service and sacrifice, and congratulations on an outstanding milestone.                          ____________________
