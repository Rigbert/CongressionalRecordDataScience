 Ford):  S. 1171. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify the application of the passive loss limitations to equine activities; to the Committee on Finance.                        passive loss legislation  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senator Ford, I rise today to introduce a bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code to modify application of passive loss limitations to horse activities.  The horse industry is extremely important for my State, and for the thousands of Kentuckians who actively participate in horse-related activities--whether it is owning, breeding, or racing horses, or simply enjoying an afternoon trail ride or horse show. However, the horse industry has been adversely impacted by the changes made in the Tax Reform Act of 1986 with job losses occurring at racetracks and horse farms. Hundreds of breeding farms have gone out of business.  The horse industry is a $15.2 billion industry that employs and supports hundreds of thousands of workers. In Kentucky alone, a study done by the University of Kentucky found that $5 billion annually can be attributed to the direct and indirect effects of the horse industry. The study also emphasized that the majority of people involved in breeding horses operate small, family run farms, a detail that garners little attention. The equine industry is an extremely labor-intensive industry employing hundreds of thousands of people to do everything from exercising horses to track, employees to trainers. In Kentucky, over 80,000 jobs are related to the horse industry.  What supports the horse industry, including the job base, the breeding farms and the revenue stream in the form of taxes to all levels of Government, is the investment in the horses themselves. The horse industry relies on outside investment to operate, just as other businesses do. Without owners willing to buy, breed, and race horses, the hundreds of thousands who are employed fulltime by the industry cannot work. Without such investment, jobs and revenue are lost.  Since the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the horse industry has experienced a near devastating decline. Most horse owners and breeders believe that the limits on passive losses was a major reason for the decline, and chilled the interest of investors in horses. Since the mid-1980's, the number of horses bred and registered has decreased--leading to losses in jobs and revenues for states.  The 1986 act indicates that in order to satisfy the material participation requirement, a person's involvement must be regular, continuous, and substantial. The passive loss rules are difficult for many to satisfy because this is such a unique industry. It is difficult for many owners to ride, train, breed, or show their horses because of the expertise and physical ability that is required. This would alter these requirements to make them fair, workable, and enforceable.                                 ______      By
