Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson) for introducing this resolution.  This resolution honors the soldiers of the Army's Black Corps of Engineers for their contribution in construction of the Alaska-Canada Highway during World War II.  There is no doubt about the enormous contribution made by these soldiers and the lasting legacy they left to Alaska and the security of our Nation.  This is long overdue and I strongly support the gentlewoman's resolution and appreciate her efforts.  Mr. Speaker, may I suggest somebody should read the great story of this Corps of Engineers brigade and what they were able to do, the work they put in, the time they put in, and the excellent job they did in building a highway of approximately 1,400 miles in less than 365 days of a year.  Again, I commend the gentlewoman for introducing this resolution. It is long overdue. And for those who do not understand this, drive this highway someday and you will understand the work they put in.
