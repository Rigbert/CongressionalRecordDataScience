 President, I would like to congratulate the students from Central Academy in Des Moines, IA, who participated in the ``We the People: The Citizen and the Constitution'' national finals in Washington, D.C. The annual competition is the culmination of the students' extensive study of the American system of constitutional democracy. The team from Central Academy won the State competition, earning the honor of representing Iowa in the national finals on May 1-3. I am proud to say that performance of the Central Academy students in the national finals earned them the Regional Award for the central states, which is given to the best non-finalist team in each region. I offer my sincere congratulations to these exemplary students.  I had the opportunity to meet with these students when they were in Washington. They are a remarkable group of politically engaged young people and I am proud to have had them representing Iowa during the national competition.  The ``We the People: The Citizen and the Constitution'' program, run by the Center for Civic Education with the help of Federal funding, provides an outstanding curriculum that promotes civic competence and responsibility among elementary and secondary students. Students take away a solid understanding of the origin of American constitutional democracy as well as the contemporary relevance and application of our founding documents and ideals. In short, the We the People program produces better citizens.  In closing, I would like to personally recognize the Central Academy students who participated in this program, Oliver Borzo, Andrew Dahm, Andrew Eilts, Becki Gell, Andrew Greiner, Sean Noonan, Carole Peterson, Paige Richards, Maura Walsh, Shannon Wenck, Emma White, Molly White, Christopher Woods, Ru-Huey Yen, Ru-Shyan Yen and their teacher, Michael Schaffer. They can all be very proud of their knowledge and accomplishments. I would also like to recognize the ``We the People'' district coordinator, Ivette Bender, and the State coordinator for Iowa, Linda Martin, for all their work in getting an Iowa team to the national finals.                          ____________________
