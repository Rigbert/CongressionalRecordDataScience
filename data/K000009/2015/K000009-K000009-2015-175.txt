Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Dr. Jeff Reutter, pioneering and indefatigable Director of the Ohio Sea Grant College Program, Stone Laboratory, Center for Lake Erie Area Research, and Great Lakes Aquatic Ecosystem Research Consortium, on the announcement of his retirement.  Dr. Reutter's name has become synonymous with Lake Erie. He has spent his career fighting to develop the foundational data sets to support Lake Erie's recovery. During that time, Dr. Reutter has distinguished himself asa scholarly and popular leader; he is the foremost expert on the health of Lake Erie and our Great Lakes endowment.  Dr. Reutter has tackled many issues facing Lake Erie during a distinguished career where he has witnessed the first Earth Day, the passage of the Clean Water Act in 1972, the return of nesting eagles to Lake Erie following a ban on DDT, and many other changes in our Great Lakes system.  More recently, since the mid 1990s, Dr. Reutter has concentrated his efforts on finding solutions for Harmful Algal Blooms (HAB), caused by high nutrient run-off in the Western Lake Erie Basin, the largest watershed in the Great Lakes. Dr. Reutter's commitment and service to the people of Ohio and our Great Lakes will be celebrated for years to come. His talents will continue to be applied to those endeavors to which he has dedicated his life.  I would like to extend my heartfelt appreciation for his years of service and his unparalleled dedication to a healthy Lake Erie, a restored Great Lakes ecosystem and clean water for those who count on this amazing freshwater abundance--collectively, the most important freshwater body on the face of the earth.                          ____________________
