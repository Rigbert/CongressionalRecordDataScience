Chairman, I thank the gentleman for bringing this issue to our attention.  Invasive species, pests, and diseases have wreaked havoc across the Nation and continue to do so. I know that the emerald ash borer has been a tremendous pest throughout a good part of our country, certainly in State and private forests also.  We need to improve management in our forests, and we need those conditions to improve. So I am happy to accept the gentleman's amendment, and I hope we can reduce the emerald ash borer.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
