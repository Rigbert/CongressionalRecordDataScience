President, before the Senator from Massachusetts leaves, I want him to know, as the original Senate sponsor, I want to redouble my efforts to work with him and Senator Enzi and all of our colleagues. We may be able to see that there is a technological fix here that is going to make it possible to collect taxes owed.  There is a lot of good will on both sides. This is by no means the end of the issue. I am very pleased the Senator from Massachusetts is ending this discussion in a conciliatory way because we are going to have to stay at it. He has my pledge as the original sponsor of this effort to do it.
