Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I rise in support of S. 501, the Glacier Bay National Park Resource Management Act.  This legislation passed the Senate with no opposition last November. The legislation was amended to remove some provisions that were controversial and should now enjoy the support of the House.  The legislation requires the Secretary of the Interior and the State of Alaska to cooperate in the development of a management plan for commercial fisheries in the outer waters of Glacier Bay National Park, in accordance with Federal and State laws and any applicable international conservation and management treaties. The legislation also directs the Secretary of the Interior, once funds are made available, to develop a plan for multi-agency comprehensive research and monitoring program to evaluate the health of fishery resources in the park's marine waters.  Once that program has been completed, the Secretary has 7 years to undertake the research program.  In addition, the legislation will allow for the study of the impact of a subsistence harvest of seagull eggs by local residents.  This legislation passed the Senate without opposition. I urge the House to support this bill and forward it to the President for his signature.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
