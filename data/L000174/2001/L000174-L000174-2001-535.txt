I would like to know when that vote will occur. I am a man of great and deep abiding faith, and I even believe in miracles, but I would feel a little more comfortable if, instead of dealing with a miracle, we had a precise time.  I suggest we have a vote at 4:45, 5, 5:15 or something like that on the amendment of the Senator from New York, and following that, a vote on the amendment of the Senator from Connecticut, followed by votes on other amendments.
