I am pleased to hear that.  I know the Speaker observed--and I think he is probably right--that there will have to be a CR. In light of that, I would hope that the majority leader, in league with the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, perhaps with the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, and with the Speaker, would initiate the conversations now in preparation so that we would not have a crisis on September 30, but would, in a logical and, hopefully, a cooperative way, have gotten to what action would be taken with respect to a CR. I would urge my friend to pursue those discussions.  I would be glad to participate with him in those discussions with others on our side who will be involved in that process--our ranking member on the Appropriations Committee, our ranking member on the Ways and Means Committee, and our ranking member on the Budget Committee.  I yield to my friend if he wants to make a comment.  Mr. McCARTHY. No.
