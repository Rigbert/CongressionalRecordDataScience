 Brown, and Ms. Stabenow):  S. 269. A bill to provide funding for unemployment and training activities for dislocated workers and adults, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be placed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 269       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Retooling America's Workers      for a Green Economy Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds the following:       (1) In October 2008, the numbers of mass layoffs (involving      over 50 workers at one time) and initial unemployment claims      reached their highest levels since 2001. According to the      National Renewable Energy Laboratory, however, a major      barrier to more rapid adoption of clean and renewable energy      and energy efficiency measures is the lack of sufficient      workers skilled in green technology.       (2) In December 2008, unemployment figures showed a sharp      deterioration in the economy. The unemployment rate rose from      6.8 percent in November, to 7.2 percent in December, of 2008.      Employers shed 524,000 jobs in December 2008, and 1,900,000      jobs were lost over just the last 4 months of 2008. These job      losses were widespread across most major industry sectors.       (3) According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 11,100,000      people were unemployed in December 2008, an increase of      3,600,000 people since the recession started in December      2007. In December 2008, the number of workers who wanted to      work full-time but worked part-time because their hours were      cut or they could not find full-time jobs reached 8,000,000,      up 3,400,000 since December 2007.       (4) Analysts say that the Nation has yet to see the worst      of the economic fallout. The latest prediction from HIS      Global Insight forecasts that unemployment will be an      estimated 8.6 percent by the end of 2009.       (5) The reality of climate change and a shared desire to      protect the environment for future generations have the      potential to spur economic growth in green-collar jobs across      the industrial spectrum. In order to prepare United States      workers to build greener communities in both urban and rural      settings, the Nation will need to make an investment in      skills development for jobs in the current and future      economies.     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.       The purpose of this Act is to retool America's workers--     including dislocated workers, those who are long-term      unemployed individuals, and those who are low-skilled      individuals, limited English proficient individuals,      individuals with disabilities, or older workers--for green-     collar industries, for existing viable industries, and for      new and emerging industries so that the workers described in      this section can contribute to the long-term competitiveness      of the United States and its quality of life.     SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.

(2) Community college.--The term ``community college''      means a 2-year institution of higher education, as defined in      section 101 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C.      1001).       (3) Green-collar industries.--The term ``green-collar      industries'' means industries throughout the economy of the      United States--       (A) that promote energy efficiency, energy conservation,      and environmental protection, including promoting renewable      energy and clean technology;       (B) that offer jobs with substantial pay and benefits; and       (C) that are industries in which there is likely to be      continued demand for workers.     SEC. 5. ACTIVITIES FOR DISLOCATED WORKERS.       (a) General Authority.--The Secretary is authorized to      reserve $2,000,000,000 of the funds appropriated under this      Act for rapid response activities, for dislocated worker      employment and training activities under chapter 5 of      subtitle B of title I of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998      (29 U.S.C. 2861 et seq.), or for employment and training      assistance and additional assistance under section 173(a) of      such Act (29 U.S.C. 2918(a)).

(2) Priority.--A local board that receives an allocation      under paragraph (1) shall use the funds made available      through the allocation for dislocated worker employment and      training activities. In providing the activities the local      board shall give priority to providing the employment and      training activities, including on-the-job training, in viable      industries identified at the regional or local levels,      including green-collar industries.
