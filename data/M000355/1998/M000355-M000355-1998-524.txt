  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.  Mr. McCONNELL. The measure before us today is the Paycheck Protection Act, authored by the distinguished majority leader and the assistant majority leader. The Paycheck Protection Act is predicated on a fundamental tenet of any truly free society--that no person should be forced to support a cause or a candidate.  It is really quite that simple. Thomas Jefferson, perhaps, best enunciated thisprinciple with a characteristic eloquence that we will likely hear often during the course of this debate, and it certainly merits repetition.  Mr. Jefferson observed:       To compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the      propagation of opinions which he disbelieves is sinful and      tyrannical.  Sinful and tyrannical as it is, union bosses do it every day. Millions of Americans are on the receiving end of this tyranny as a portion of their paychecks are confiscated and used to advance a political agenda with which many of them disagree. That fact, Mr. President, should not be in dispute.  Ten years have passed since the Supreme Court's Beck decision in which the Court ruled that workers who are forced to pay union dues as a condition of employment cannot be forced to pay dues beyond those necessary for collective bargaining. Yet, most union workers still have no relief. Their unions provide them with little or no information of their rights.  A national survey last year revealed that most union workers are not even aware of their rights under the Beck decision. Even more deplorable, many union workers' efforts to exercise their constitutional rights under Beck have been met with intimidation and with stonewalling. In a telling illustration, a union worker testified before Congress in 1997, just last year, that ``almost immediately the lies started: anti-union, scab, freeloader, and religious fanatic were labels ascribed to me,'' said a union member. That poor fellow had to resort to a lawsuit to get his union dues reduced in accordance with Beck.  The onus, Mr. President, should not be on the workers. It should not be the workers' burden to pursue an after-the-fact refund or to wait until the end of the year and have to jump through hoops to get returned to him or her money that should not have been taken in the first place.  Our friends on the other side of the aisle are understandably alarmed at the prospect of their most powerful, aggressive and well-funded ally losing a significant portion of the political war chest after workers are freed from the compulsory dues tyranny.  Mr. President, we know what happens. Washington State voters, back in 1992, by an overwhelming margin--70 percent, by the way, supported this--approved a referendum to make it illegal for unions to extract dues for political purposes without obtaining prior written approval from union workers. After this emancipation, only 82 of Washington State's public employee union members gave the union permission to take their money for political purposes. Prior to the voters' action, 40,000 Washington State employees had been forced to stand by helplessly as a chunk of their paychecks were confiscated and used without their consent to advance the political causes of the union bosses.  The number of Washington State teachers union members contributing even a modest dollar amount to the union bosses' political fund dropped from 48,000 down to 8,000. Now, all politicians who benefited from the union largess, a largess born of forced contributions, intimidation, and a conspiracy of silence, will understandably tremble at the prospect of losing it.  For them, the sounds of paycheck protection roaring down the legislative tracks must be terrifying indeed. Nationwide, over 80 percent of the American people support a Federal Paycheck Protection Act.  But I am certainly not so naive as to think union workers will see this freedom coming out of Washington, DC, because President Clinton would surely veto it. The union bosses have been so generous to the Clinton-Gore campaigns over the years that the Lincoln Bedroom probably feels like home.  Fortunately for America's union workers, they may well see relief in those States with the referendum process or political leaders less beholden to union bosses than is the President of the United States.  So, Mr. President, there is a lot of action out in the States. Proponents of paycheck protection are heartened by the reception they are getting out in the States. It will be on the ballot in California this June. Californians will have an opportunity to strike a blow for freedom for union workers. Freedom's prospects are quite bright there.  But the union bosses will resist this freedom for the rank and file. The union bosses will fight it with everything at their disposal, including the hundreds of millions of dollars they have amassed for political use from the workers' dues. It is expected that union bosses will spend $20 million or more in California in their quest to defeat this freedom quest for the rank and file.  I am confident that Californians will not be duped by the union bosses and their millions. Paycheck protection rings true to regular folks and not even the most sophisticated, well-funded smear campaign will drown it out.  There is going to be paycheck protection referenda in other States as well, Mr. President. I think there are four or five that are going to be on the ballot this year. There are movements all across America in State legislatures to press forward with bills giving union members these basic, fundamental rights. So to have this kind of measure described as a ``poison pill'' is amusing indeed.  It is fundamental, Mr. President, that no one in this country ought to be forced to contribute to causes with which they might disagree. So we will press forward with this issue and hope for the best. But it will go forward on a State-by-State basis regardless of what happens here in Washington.  Now, Mr. President, let me just make a few more observations. I see that my friend from Tennessee is here, and I won't delay him too long. I do want to make some observations about the larger question of McCain-Feingold. The whole motive behind this reform agenda for the last 22 years has been a disappointment, Mr. President, in the Supreme Court decision of Buckley v. Valeo, which was, of course, a great victory for the American people. The Court said in the Buckley case that spending is speech. When you first hear that, you sort of scratch your head and say, ``Gee, could that be true?'' But when you think about it and when you read the decision, it is obviously the case that in a country of 270 million people, unless you can amplify your voice, you don't have much speech. Dan Rather and Tom Brokaw and Peter Jennings have a lot of speech--way more than any of us--because their speech is amplified every night to millions of Americans. But the Court said to put Americans in a straitjacket of spending limits is to say that they are left only with inadequate speech--in other words, a kind of continuing effort to go door-to-door, I guess, to carry your message to more and more Americans.  In fact, the Court said a spending limit would be about like saying you are free to travel, but you can only have $100. How free are you? You are not very free if you can't amplify your voice. The Court said you are going to have a constitutional first amendment right to amplify your voice, either with your own resources or that of others gathered together in a common purpose to advance a particular cause. The cause could be speaking for a candidate, or against a candidate, or advocating an issue, or opposing an issue.  In fact, the whole Court case was crafted in the direction of a wide amount of permissible political discourse in this country. Well, the reformers hated that decision, and they have been coming back and coming back and coming back over the years, and it has had different names in different Congresses. A few years ago it was Boren-Mitchell. Now it is McCain-Feingold. But, fundamentally, the philosophy is the same: What is wrong with the system is that we just don't have enough regulation. We just don't have enough restraint on the voices of all of these Americans who are running around expressing themselves, and we don't like it.  So McCain-Feingold has been constantly changing, and the version we currently have before us is a little bit different from earlier versions. The original version sought to put the Government in charge of the political speech of individuals, groups, candidates, and parties. The current version, which is the same version that was defeated in October, seeks to put the Government in charge of the political speech of parties and groups, leaving aside individuals and leaving aside candidates.  So let me focus just a minute, Mr. President, on the kind of speech that parties and groups engage in. It is said that, because of the scandals of 1996, we should take away from the politicalparties their ability to function in State and local races. It's called getting rid of soft money. What happened in 1996, Mr. President? As the distinguished majority leader pointed out, and as Senator Thompson's hearings have confirmed, we had arguable violations of existing laws; that is, contributions from foreigners, money laundering, and raising money on Federal property. All of that is against the law now. What that cries out for is enforcement of the law.  This bill--McCain-Feingold--doesn't have anything to do with the scandals of 1996. It is a totally different subject. This bill is seeking to restrain, to inhibit, to diminish the voices of American citizens in their effort to participate in the political process through their political parties, or through groups they may belong to.  Now, the courts have had a good deal to say about that, Mr. President. Let me start with the groups. The courts have said that a group or, for that matter, an individual can go out and engage in what's called issue advocacy, without having to ask permission from the Federal Government, without having to register with the Federal Election Commission, or subject itself to the rules that apply to candidates and to parties in Federal elections. The Court has said that as long as you don't say ``vote for'' or ``vote against,'' you are permitted wide latitude to applaud, condemn, say whatever you want to in the American political process.  There has been a whole line of cases on the question of issue advocacy. The Federal Election Commission doesn't like the law on issue advocacy. It has been pursuing groups over the years and it has lost every single case. In fact, the last case the FEC lost was in the Fourth Circuit, and they not only lost the case, but were required to pay the lawyer's fees of the other side because the FEC just didn't get it. They couldn't read the law.  It is very clear. We don't have the authority here in the Congress to keep people from criticizing us. We don't like it. We love to be able to control the entire election. But we don't own the election. The election is not the property of the candidates, and if people want to criticize us early or late, the courts are not going to allow us to interfere with that.  One of the mutations of this that is developing that we have heard about and read about may be offered by the senior Senator from Maine, Senator Snowe.  I gather, in addition to trying to change the rules on issue advocacy, that it would also, in proximity to the election, require the group to disclose.  Mr. President, the courts have already spoken on that issue. They spoke on it as early as 1958 on the question of whether you could require a group to disclose their sources of funds or their membership lists as a condition for criticism. In the case of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, NAACP v. Alabama in 1958, the court made it very, very clear that it is a real threat to citizens' groups and to their right to band together and express themselves to require them as a condition for expressing themselves that they disclose their membership.  The court said in that case, ``Compelled disclosure of membership in an organization engaged in advocacy of particular beliefs'' . . . is inappropriate. ``Inviolability of privacy in group association may in many circumstances be indispensable to preservation of freedom of association, particularly where a group espouses dissident beliefs.''  The court went on to say:       We think it apparent that compelled disclosure of      petitioner's Alabama membership is likely to affect adversely      the ability of petitioner and [*463] its members to pursue      their collective effort to foster beliefs which they      admittedly have the right to advocate, in that it may induce      members to withdraw from the Association and dissuade others      from joining it because of fear of exposure of their beliefs      shown through their associations and of the consequences of      this exposure.  In other words, Mr. President, there will probably be another effort here to shut down issue advocacy. Members may argue that we are not really telling them they can't speak; we are just saying they have to disclose if they speak. The courts have already said you can't do that; you can't require people to disclose their membership as a precondition for expressing their beliefs.  So it gets back to the fundamental point: We don't own these elections. Most of us do not like it when some group comes in. Even if they are trying to help us, we usually think they are botching it. We hate all of these voices that are outside of our campaigns and outside of our control. But that is the price you pay for free speech in a democracy--that is the price you pay for free speech in a democracy.  So all of these efforts to try to shut these groups up by forcing them to come under the Federal Election Commission, by forcing them into the hard money camp, by trying to make it difficult for them to express themselves in proximity to an election, there is no court in America that would uphold that. It is so clearly and blatantly unconstitutional that we ought not to do it.  The other entity that the most recent version of McCain-Feingold seeks to shut up are our great political parties. Soft money has become a pejorative term. Let me define it: Soft money is everything that isn't hard money. Hard money, by definition, is money raised and spent in support of Federal candidates. But, as we know, Mr. President, this is a Federal system. The two great national parties--the Democratic National Committee and the Republican National Committee--care who gets elected Governor of Tennessee and who controls the legislature in Tennessee. They may even care who gets to be mayor of Knoxville. They have at times even cared who the county commissioner was going to be in whatever county Knoxville is in. These are national parties. The only way you could eliminate non-Federal money by definition is to federalize everything. So that the Federal Election Commission would then be in charge of the city council races in Nashville.  That is a great step in the right direction--just what we need. The FEC would be the size of the Pentagon with reams of files in every race in America.  The second problem with eliminating non-Federal money is a practical problem. As I have already indicated, you will not be able to constitutionally eliminate issue advocacy from the American political scene. It cannot be done. If we tried to do that, it would be struck down. Maybe. We don't know. Some court could uphold an effort to eliminate so-called soft money for the national parties. I don't know. I doubt it.  But let's assume they would uphold it. Then, Mr. President, the situation would be this: The two great political parties, which exist only for the purpose of electing candidates, would be the only entities in America that could not engage in issue advocacy. Everybody else can--from the AFL-CIO to the Sierra Club to the Chamber of Commerce. Only political parties wouldn't be able to engage in issue advocacy.  So the candidates of those parties would be defenseless when groups hostile or individuals hostile to candidates of their parties came in and engaged in issue advocacy, particularly in proximity to an election. So the parties which exist for no other purpose other than to elect candidates would be restricted in engaging in issue advocacy presumably in defense of the candidates who wore their party label--a perfectly absurd result, Mr. President; a perfectly absurd and undesirable result of a quest to end non-Federal money.  Mr. President, fortunately, the Senate is not going to take that step. There is not a consensus for any of these so-called reforms. Fortunately, there is strong support for the first amendment.  I am glad that our friends in the press believe in the first amendment. They are the practitioners of the first amendment. They have from time to time believed that it only applied to them, which I have always found somewhat amusing.  I started last year asking reporters with whom I discuss this issue whether they have read Buckley. At the beginning of 1997 almost no one had. I am pleased to report that it got better. More and more reporters sat down and struggled their way through the Buckley case, and, all of a sudden, eyes popped open and they began to realize that the first amendment was not the sole prerogative--or property, shall Isay--of the fourth estate. It exists for all of us.  I have been perplexed, frankly, at the editorial support around the country for McCain-Feingold. The ACLU has been perplexed, too. I will just read a few observations from a letter of December 29 that they sent out to editorial boards around the country.  The ACLU said:       We're perplexed. As Washington prepares for another round      of campaign finance debate, we are deeply puzzled about why      so many--particularly in the media--continue to support      campaign finance legislation like the McCain-Feingold bill      that is patently unconstitutional, unlikely to pass and      doomed to failure in the courts.       Frankly, we're also worried. Polls are beginning to suggest      that the media's cavalier disregard for the free speech      implications of current campaign finance proposals is      encouraging an attitude among the public that could lead to      serious damage to freedom of the press. A recent Rasmussen      Research survey, for example, found that Americans believe      that one of the best ways to clean up campaigns is to      restrict newspaper coverage of elections.  Mr. President, I am not advocating that. But imagine the Washington Post calling for spending limits. It makes about as much sense as the Congress saying to the media, ``You are free to say whatever you want to but, by the way, your circulation is limited.'' And I wonder how the Washington Post would feel if the Congress decided it could only have a 5,000 circulation--not saying that Congress can have any impact on what the Washington Post can say--but that we just think the Post is speaking to too broad an audience, and it is spending too much. Obviously, I am being facetious. But it is the same principle. It is the very same principle.  Advocates of spending limits say we are not telling you what to do; we just think you are saying it too much or too many, but your audience is too widespread. We may all snicker about this issue. But, frankly, the public has a lot of skepticism about the press.  I am looking at an article by Richard Harwood in the Washington Post from last October referring to a study of public opinion commissioned in 1990 by the American Society of Newspaper Editors. It is part of the observance of the 200th anniversary of the Bill of Rights. Dick Harwood points out that a Lou Harris survey for that group more recently had some, as he put it, ``depressing findings.'' This is Harwood's observation about the Lou Harris poll of the American people. He said:       If they had their way, ``the people''--meaning a majority      of adults--would not allow journalists to practice their      trade without first obtaining, as lawyers and doctors must      license. Whether the preferred licensing authority would be      the government or some other credentialing agency is not      clear.  That was the majority view of the American public with regard to the licensing of the media.  Number two, referring to the survey:       They would confer on judges the power to impose fines on      publishers and broadcasters for ``inaccurate and biased      reporting'' and would liberalize libel laws to make it easier      for plaintiffs to win judgments against the press.  This is the majority view of the American people now. Third:       They would empower government entities to monitor the work      of journalists for fairness and compel us to ``give equal      coverage to all sides of a controversial issue.'' They also      favor the creation of local and national news councils to      investigate complaints against the press and issue      corrections'' of erroneous news reports.  That is the view of the American public, Mr. President.  Also, from this Rasmussen Research study, that I referred to earlier, there is a release from this institute of October 2, 1997, which has an interesting finding. It says:       Most Americans think that friendly reporters are more      important to a successful political campaign than money,      according to a Rasmussen Research survey of 1,000 adults. By      a 3-to-1 margin (61% to 19%) Americans believe that if      reporters like one candidate more than another, that      candidate is likely to win--even if the other candidate      raised more money in the campaign.  Further:       Americans are also generally suspicious of reporters. More      than seven-out-of-ten registered voters believe that the      personal biases of reporters affect their coverage of      stories, issues, and campaigns.  I cite this somewhat tongue and cheek to make the point that the first amendment applies to all of us. Just because the American public is skeptical of the press and its motivations doesn't mean that we want to restrict the press. By the same token, Mr. President, it is astonishing to find so many editorial boards around the country that do not understand that the first amendment doesn't just apply to the press. It applies to all of us.  So, Mr. President, when all is said and done and this debate is ended, the Constitution will still be intact and the ability of individuals, groups, candidates, and parties who participate in the American political process without regulation or interference by the Government will be preserved.                         Privilege of the Floor  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to allow a member of my staff, Melissa Figge, to have privileges of the floor during the duration of this debate on campaign finance reform.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). Without objection, it is so ordered.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I yield the floor.
