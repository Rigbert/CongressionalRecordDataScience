 President, I think it is very important that we continue to fund the committee's work for a couple of pretty obvious reasons. For one, documents are turning up like wildflowers everywhere. Every week or so, the Whitewater Committee receives a pile of ``mistakenly overlooked documents'' from the White House.  Mr. President, how is it that mistakenly overlooked Whitewater files labeled ``Whitewater Development Corporation,'' or that they fail to ensure that notes they took in meetings dedicated exclusively to the discussion of Whitewater, as part of a Whitewater damage control response team, are not produced as part of the subpoena's request?  Mr. President, if you were going to comply with a subpoena that is seeking documents related to Whitewater, would you not start with a Whitewater response team? It is obvious that you would.  Mr. President, that would seem to be the minimum in terms of compliance, would it not? Frankly, I am surprised that we are even debating today whether to continue funding for the Special Committee To Investigate Whitewater. Mr. President, it was only a little more than a month ago that the committee first learned of the existence of billing records that had been under subpoena for over 2 years. What was incredible about their discovery, Mr. President, was that these billing records were discovered by a White House aide in the personal residence of the White House, probably one of the most secure places in the world.  Mr. President, documents do not have legs. They cannot walk. They have to have somebody to carry them. The White House can argue that the billing records support the First Lady's prior statements until the cows come home. They can argue about what the word ``significant'' means, or about what ``minimal'' means. They can rewrite Webster's if they want to. But, Mr. President, that will not change the fact that these records we are talking about were under subpoena for close to 2 years and were not produced during that time. Regardless of motive, someone had custody of these records while they were under subpoena and chose not to produce them.  Mr. President, the mysterious appearance of these records prompted the independent counsel to subpoena the First Lady to testify before the grand jury. This unprecedented action by the independent counsel, I believe, underscores the seriousness and the importance of the billing records' reappearance to this committee's investigation.  What we do know about the billing records is this. Certainly, what we do know is certainly less than what we do not know. What information the committee has been able to glean thus far since the records' discovery is the following:  Mr. Foster's handwriting is found all over the billing records in red ink.  Mr. Foster's writing appears to direct questions to the First Lady about her billings of Madison Savings & Loan.  Mr. Foster was the last person that we know of that had possession of these records after the 1992 Presidential campaign. And the records were found on a table in the book room of the personal residence of the White House sometime in late July or early August.  Mr. President, the committee thus has a sense of who may have had the records last, but no answers to the who, what, where, and when of the billing records' reappearance. We need that information. More important is still what remains unanswered, like, for example, how did the billing records end up in the White House personal residence?  Where have they been for the past 2 years while they have been under subpoena?  Were the records in Mr. Foster's office when he died? If so, who took custody of these records after Mr. Foster's death?  Finally, and most important, who left the billing records on the table in the book room of the White House residence?  As the New York Times so aptly noted in its February 17, 1996, editorial, ``Inanimate objects do not move themselves, we all know that.''  These are serious questions, Mr. President, questions that the committee and the public deserve answers to. There is nothing partisan or politically motivated about trying to uncover the circumstances surrounding the much belated discovery of records under subpoena for over 2 years. Indeed, answers to these questions, I believe, are central to the committee's investigation.  If Mr. Foster did, in fact, have these records in his possession as of his tragic death, how did they move, Mr. President, from the White House counsel's office to the personal residence? Obviously, not on their own motion. Testimony given before the committee about the Foster office search and movement of files to the personal residence leads us to some sense of how they may, Mr. President, have made their way to the book room. The committee heard testimony from a Secret Service officer who swore that he saw Maggie Williams, the First Lady's chief of staff, carrying documents out of Mr. Foster's office the night of his death. Phone records obtained by the committee, Mr. President, showed a spate of early morning phone calls between Ms. Williams, the First Lady, Susan Thomases, and Bernie Nussbaum, immediately preceding Mr. Nussbaum's decision to renege on his agreement with the Deputy AttorneyGeneral of the United States, Mr. Heymann, on how the search of Mr. Foster's office would be conducted.  A senior White House aide testified that the day of the search, Mr. Nussbaum, White House counsel at that time, told him of his concerns coming from the First Lady--told of concerns coming from the First Lady and Susan Thomases--about law enforcement officials having unfettered access to Mr. Foster's office.  Department of Justice officials have testified before the committee as to suspicions and concerns that began to arise after the White House reneged on an agreement on how Mr. Foster's office would be searched--suspicion and concerns, Mr. President, that prompted the Deputy Attorney General of the United States at that time, Mr. Philip Heymann, to ask the then White House counsel, Mr. Bernie Nussbaum, ``Are you hiding something?'' A White House aide testified that later on in the day of the search of Mr. Foster's office, he assisted Ms. Williams in carrying boxes of materials from Mr. Foster's office to the personal residence, during which time Mrs. Williams offered the explanation that the materials were personal documents that needed to be reviewed by the Clintons.  Mr. President, Ms. Williams testified that documents were moved from Mr. Foster's office to a closet on the third floor, to the personal residence of the White House, where they were later reviewed and collected by the Clintons' personal attorneys. This testimony, Mr. President, in conjunction with the belated discovery of the billing records and other Whitewater documents, has only fueled suspicions that the White House has not been truthful about the search of Mr. Foster's office after his death.  Mr. President, the many unanswered questions that remain are in truth due in large part to the lack of cooperation and evasive tactics coming from the White House. While the committee has undertaken to conduct its investigation expeditiously, events like the mysterious discovery of the billing records, the miraculous location of over 100 pages of notes from top White House aides and Whitewater damage control team members, undermine the committee's ability to conduct a timely and thorough investigation.  Mr. President, these documents have been under subpoena, as I said, for over 2 years, and they only now, Mr. President, surface with explanations that confound credibility, such as ``Sorry, mistakenly overlooked.'' ``Didn't know you were looking for notes of those Whitewater meetings.'' Or, ``I thought they were already turned over to the White House counsel.''  Mr. President, the excuses are too little, and I believe they are too late. ``No harm, no foul'' just will not work for the White House anymore. The committee and the independent counsel will not and cannot, Mr. President, accept misunderstandings, miscommunications, mistakes, mismanagement, and general bungling as an excuse by the White House for not producing documents that we are legitimately entitled to. I think it is time for answers, not excuses.  Indeed, Mr. President, the White House's lack of cooperation and forthcomingness, its defensive posture and its behavior in response to the legitimate congressional and law enforcement inquiries has led us to where we are today. The White House's handling of the documents in Mr. Foster's office after his death and its continued and persistent pattern of obstruction and evasion perpetuate the belief they have something to hide.  Last summer, the committee heard testimony about the search of Mr. Foster's office after his death. I want to briefly read from the committee transcript testimony we heard from Deputy Attorney General Philip Heymann, because I believe it clearly reveals why this committee and many Americans continue to believe that the White House has not been truthful about what went on in the hours following Mr. Foster's death.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the entire script beginning on pages 41 of Mr. Heymann's testimony be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:        Excerpts of Testimony of Deputy Attorney General Heymann       Senator Shelby. Okay. At some point on the 21st, it was      determined that Roger Adams and David Margolis would be sent      over to the White House, as I said, to review documents      regarding the relevance and privilege dealing with the Foster      investigation, you said that are right.       Mr. Heymann. That's correct, Senator Shelby.       Senator Shelby. And the scope of this review, according to      your notes, would be looking for anything to do with this      violent death. You want to refer to your notes?       Mr. Heymann. Yes, I have my notes here and that's correct.       Senator Shelby. Is that correct?       Mr. Heymann. That's correct.       Senator Shelby. And it was--was it your understanding by      the end of the 21st that an agreement or understanding had      been reached between the Department of Justice, the Park      Police and the White House over how the search would be      conducted, the search of the deputy counsel's office?       Mr. Heymann. Yes, Senator Shelby, in the sense that we all      had agreed on how it would be done. And in what I still think      was a very sensible way----       Senator Shelby. Would you relate what you recall of how      the--what you agreed to or thought you had agreed to?       Mr. Heymann. I'd be happy to. I just wanted to make clear,      Senator Shelby, I didn't feel that I had a binding commitment      by Mr. Nussbaum or anyone else. We simply all had talked      about it by then and we all were on the same track, we all      were on the same page, we all thought it would be done in the      way I'm about to describe.       Senator Shelby. Did you think when you sent Mr. Adams and      Mr. Margolis over there that it would turn into an      adversarial relationship or something close to that?       Mr. Heymann. No, I did not.       Senator Shelby. You did not.       Mr. Heymann. You'd asked me to describe what the      understanding was, Senator Shelby.       Senator Shelby. Yes, sir, that's right. You go ahead.       Mr. Heymann. The understanding was that they would see,      these two senior prosecutors, not the investigators, but the      prosecutors would see enough of every document to be able to      determine whether it was relevant to the investigation or      not. Now, I've been handed some pages from my transcript, but      let's assume this is a document, it's about 30 pages long.      They would look at this and it says ``deposition of Philip      Heymann, re: Whitewater,'' and they would know that that      didn't seem to have anything, any likely bearing on the cause      of Vince Foster's death. If need be, they might have to look      a page or two into it. But the object was to maintain the      confidentiality of White House papers to the largest extent      possible with satisfying ourselves that we were learning of      every potentially relevant document.       If there was a relevant document, it would be set aside in      a separate pile. If the White House counsel's office believed      that it was entitled to executive privilege, and therefore      should not be turned over to us, we would then have to      resolve that: There would be a separate pile of documents;      some relevant and would go directly to the investigators some      relevant but executive privilege claims, in which case we      would have to resolve it perhaps with the assistants of the      legal counsel's office of the Justice Department.       Senator Shelby. Mr. Heymann, did you contemplate that this      would be done jointly or just done by the White House      counsel?       Mr. Heymann. I thought it was essential, Senator Shelby,      that it be done jointly with these two prosecutors being able      to satisfy themselves, and through them satisfy the      investigative agencies that whatever might be relevant was      being made available to us.       Senator Shelby. That it would be a bona fide investigation      and not a sham; is that right?       Mr. Heymann. Well, I don't----       Senator Shelby. Or be a bona fide investigation.       Mr. Heymann. That it would be an entirely--it would be a      review of documents that would be entirely credible to us, to      the investigators and to the American public.       Senator Shelby. Okay. Your notes mention, I believe, Mr.      Heymann, that Steve Neuwirth objected to this agreement, but      that Mr. Nussbaum agreed with Margolis that it was a done      deal; is that correct? You want to refer----       Mr. Heymann. That is what they reported to me when Mr.      Margolis and Mr. Adams returned that evening, the evening of      Wednesday the 21st, to the Justice Department.       Senator Shelby. What do your notes reflect, I was      paraphrasing them?       Mr. Heymann. It said they discussed the system that had      been agreed upon, I just described it to you. BN that stands      for Mr. Nussbaum, agreed. SN, that stands for Steve Neuwirth,      said no. We shouldn't do it that way. The Justice Department      attorneys shouldn't have direct access to the files. David      Margolis, the Justice Department attorney, said it's a      done deal and Mr. Nussbaum at that point said yes, we've      agreed to that.       Senator Shelby. Was it important to you and to the      Department of Justice that you represented that the documents      be reviewed independently, is that why it was important that      the Department of Justice look for relevance and privilege      jointly in this undertaking?       Mr. Heymann. Yes, Senator Shelby. Again, I did not think it      was necessary and do not     think it was necessary to review documents which we could      quickly determine had no relevance to Vince Foster's death.      So our attorneys would not have looked at those, that was a      clear part of the understanding. Or pages, yeah.       Senator Shelby. I didn't say. I understand that you      received a call from David Margolis the next morning from the      White House about the search; is that correct? You want to      refer to your notes?       Mr. Heymann. That's correct, Senator Shelby.       Senator Shelby. What was this call about?       Mr. Heymann. He and Roger Adams had gone over with the Park      Police and the FBI to do the review we planned.       Senator Shelby. This was pursuant to the understanding you      had with Mr. Nussbaum?       Mr. Heymann. Pursuant to the understanding of the 21st.       Senator Shelby. Okay.       Mr. Heymann. Mr. Margolis told me that Mr. Nussbaum had      said to me that they had changed the plan, that only the      White House counsel's office would see the actual documents.      Mr. Margolis had asked Mr. Nussbaum whether that had been      discussed with me and Mr. Nussbaum had said no. I told Mr.      Margolis at that point to put Mr. Nussbaum on the phone, and      I was----       Senator Shelby. Did he get on the phone?       Mr. Heymann. He got on the phone.       Senator Shelby. What did you say to him?       Mr. Heymann. I told him that this was a terrible mistake.       Senator Shelby. Terrible mistake. Go ahead.       Mr. Heymann. Well, please don't----       Senator Shelby. That was your words; is that right?       Mr. Heymann. Yeah--no, no, please don't assume that what I      now paraphrase would be the words I actually used. This is      740 days ago and it would be quite unreliable to think      they're the exact words. I remember very clearly sitting in      the Deputy Attorney General's conference room picking up the      phone in that very big room. I remember being very angry and      very adamant and saying this is a bad--this is a bad mistake,      this is not the right way to do it, and I don't think I'm      going to let Margolis and Adams stay there if you are going      to do it that way because they would have no useful function.      It would simply look like they were performing a useful      function, and I don't want that to happen.       The Chairman. You told this to the counsel?       Senator Shelby. You told this to Nussbaum; is that correct?       Mr. Heymann. I told this to Mr. Nussbaum.       The Chairman. But you volunteered this? In other words, it      did not come from Mr. Margolis or Mr. Adams? This was your      saying I'm not going to keep them here if this----       Mr. Heymann. I suspect, Senator D'Amato, that when I talked      to Mr. Margolis in the same phone conversation shortly before      I asked him to put Mr. Nussbaum on the phone he would have      said to me something like we have no useful role here, and it      would--I would have picked it up from that, and I would have      said I don't think I'm going to keep them there. Mr. Nussbaum      was, as always, entirely polite and he said--he was taken      back by my anger and by the idea that I might pull out the      Justice Department attorneys and he said I'll have to talk to      somebody else about this or other people about this, and I'll      get back to you, Phil.       Senator Shelby. Did he tell you who he was going to talk      to?       Mr. Heymann. He did not tell me who he was going to talk      to.       Senator Shelby. He didn't tell you or indicate it was the      President of the United States or the First Lady?       Mr. Heymann. He never indicated in any way who he was going      to discuss this with, nor has he ever.       Senator Shelby. Just the phrase I'm going to talk to      somebody?       Mr. Heymann. I'm--just the notion was I have to talk to      other people about this. I had obviously shaken him enough      that he wanted to consider whether he should come back to      what we had agreed to the day before on the 21st, but there      were other people involved that he had to talk to about that.       Senator Shelby. Was it your impression, Mr. Heymann, then      that Mr. Nussbaum would get back to you before any review of      the documents in the White House was conducted?       Mr. Heymann. He said to me specifically don't call Adams      and Margolis back to the Justice Department. I'll get back to      you.       Senator Shelby. Did he ever call you back?       Mr. Heymann. He never called me back.       Senator Shelby. Did you ever consent to the change in the      plan in how the search would be conducted, Mr. Heymann?       Mr. Heymann. I did not.       Senator Shelby. Did David Margolis or any other law      enforcement official have an impression of whether the      Department of Justice had consented to this search?       Mr. Heymann. Mr. Margolis was clear that the Department of      Justice had not consented to the changed arrangement. It      was--he obviously thought that he was to remain, even if it      was changed, because he did remain, but he knew that we had      not consented to the changed arrangement and did not approve      of it.       Senator Shelby. You later found out, sir, that the search      was conducted with Mr. Nussbaum calling the shots that night;      is that right?       Mr. Heymann. That's correct.       Senator Shelby. Did you talk to Mr. Nussbaum after that?       Mr. Heymann. I found that out at about--when Mr. Margolis      and Mr. Adams returned the evening of the 22nd----       Senator Shelby. Returned to your office?       Mr. Heymann. Returned to my office, I went home to an      apartment we were renting then and I picked up the phone and      I called Mr. Nussbaum and I told him that I couldn't imagine      why he would have treated me that way. How could he have told      me that he was going to call back before he made any decision      on how the search would be done and then not call back?       Senator Shelby. What did he say to that?       Mr. Heymann. I don't honestly remember, Senator Shelby. He      was, again, polite. He didn't--there was no explanation given      that I would remember. And I remember saying to him, Bernie,      are you hiding something. And he said no, Phil, I promise you      we're not hiding something.       Senator Shelby. Did you say to him--and you can refer to      your notes if you like--Mr. Nussbaum, you misused us? What      did you--if you said that, what did you mean by that? Do you      believe then that the White House had something to hide or      was worried about the investigation? What was your      impression?       Mr. Heymann. Well, when I said you misused us, or something      like that, I meant that he had used Justice Department      attorneys in a way that suggested that the Justice Department      was playing a significant role in reviewing documents when      they had come back and told me they felt like they were not      playing any useful role there.       Senator Shelby. Did you know later that the White House had      issued a statement that Justice--something to the effect that      the Justice Department was involved in the review of the      documents and not just observing, and then they did a      correction on that when someone objected, maybe it was your      office?       Mr. Heymann. The following morning it was called to my      attention that they had said that the Justice Department and      the FBI--I now know it--in the press release it said--well,      whatever it was, the Justice Department along with the FBI      and the Park Police had supervised the review of documents.       Senator Shelby. Was that a CBS News report?       Mr. Heymann. What I was shown at my deposition, Senator      Shelby, was, I think, a piece from the Washington Post. I      directed that the Department of Justice put out a correction      that we had not supervised, that we had simply been there as      observers while the investigation was carried out--while the      search was carried out by the White House counsel.
