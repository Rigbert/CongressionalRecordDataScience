 President, today, July 11, marks the second anniversary of the fall of the so-called safe area of Srebrenica, one of the three eastern enclaves in Bosnia.  By most estimates, following the fall of Srebrenica over 8,000 Muslim refugees fleeing the Serb forces simply disappeared. Many of these refugees were old men, women, and children, killed in acts of inhuman cruelty.  Even today, 2 years later, the vast majority of these people are still unaccounted for.  Others from Srebrenica were luckier--forced to flee their homes as part of a brutal policy of ethnic cleansing.  I am still haunted by an image from a picture that I saw in the newspaper shortly after the fall of Srebrenica. It was a picture of a young woman, a refugee from Srebrenica, around 20 years old, who climbed a tree, tied a rope around her neck, and hung herself. A photographer captured her lifeless body as it hung from the tree.  Mr. President, I look at that picture and I think: What kind of nation are we if we can not see to it that the people who practiced rape, practiced genocide, practiced ethnic cleansing, are not brought to justice? We know who these people are. We know where they live.  The fact is, of the 74 war criminals indicted by the International War Crimes Tribunal at The Hague, only 9 have been apprehended.  Where is the conscience of the world?  I first wrote to the President about this issue on September 11 of last year, following a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, at which administration witnesses provided testimony to the effect that there were no capable international or national institutions in Bosnia with both the authority and the ability to apprehend indicted war criminals.  The President responded to this letter that ``although the peace will not be complete until indicted war criminals are brought to justice,'' IFOR would not hunt down war criminals, and that U.S. policy would be to ``continue our efforts to press all parties to turn over indicted war criminals to the Tribunal.''  In the months since then we have seen how willing the parties to Dayton have been to turn over indicted war criminals.  When the IFOR mandate ended and IFOR was replaced by SFOR, I took up this issue with Secretary Perry, writing him on December 4 last year--again, following a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee--that I believed that it was essential that the follow-on force have clear, unambiguous authority for apprehending war criminals or to provide more effective support to other authorities in carrying out this task.  I received a response from the Department of Defense on February 18 of this year that again stated that the administration shared my concern on the importance of this issue, but that no additional efforts to apprehend war criminals would be forthcoming.  I also took this question up with the other Democratic and Republican women of the Senate. The nine of us sent a letter to the President on March 3 of this year in which we requested that the President:       . . . look at this problem as a top priority and indicate      to us precisely how the international community might ensure      the arrest and extradition to The Hague of those responsible      for crimes against humanity.  The President responded to us on April 11. His letter stressed the role ofthe International Tribunal in ``establishing accountability for war crimes and crimes against humanity . . .'' The President also stated that:       I share your sense of urgency and my Administration is      committed to assisting the Tribunals in the apprehension and      extradition of those indictees who remain at large. We are      currently examining a variety of options in this regard.  Frankly, I found the President's response to be inadequate. And in mid-April I wrote to both the President and the Secretary General of the United Nations urging an aggressive stand to see that indicted war criminals are brought to justice.  As I stated in my April 21 letter to the President, it is my belief that:       Unless the United States takes a position of aggressive      leadership on this issue in the international community, we      run the risk that future historians will conclude that the      lessons of current U.S. foreign policy are that crimes      against humanity, genocide, and the use of rape as an      instrument of war are acceptable--and that those who      perpetrate these crimes can do so with impunity.  We would, moreover, put at risk all the gains of the Dayton process if we do not bring these war criminals to justice.  The President responded to me on June 19, stating that, ``My foreign policy team is examining several options to assist and enhance the ability of the Tribunal to bring indicted war criminals into custody.''  Mr. President, I will ask that copies of those portions of this correspondence that I feel my colleagues will find most useful be printed in the Record at the end of my remarks.  Finally, to provide additional tools to the administration in the apprehension of war criminals, in May of this year Senator Lautenberg, Lugar, Leahy, D'Amato, Mikulski, and myself introduced the War Crimes Prosecution Facilitation Act of 1997. This legislation, which has since been included in the committee-passed Senate Foreign Operation Appropriations bill, conditions United States financial assistance to the states and entities of the former Yugoslavia with their cooperation with the war crimes Tribunal.  Mr. President, I do not know what humiliations and deprivations this woman whose picture I saw in the paper suffered. Perhaps she saw a loved one killed. Perhaps she was raped. All I know is that she could take no more.  In the memory of this nameless young woman, and in the memory of the countless thousands of others who were killed, tortured, and raped, we must make sure that peace and justice are restored in Bosnia.  And the bottom line is that there can be no peace and justice in Bosnia without the prosecution of those who committed crimes against humanity.  What happened in Srebrenica was not unique to the war that tore the former Yugoslavia apart. In town after town, village after village, atrocities were committed by all sides in a brutal civil war.  Unlike the countless other villages and towns wiped off the map in the campaigns of ethnic cleansing, however, the fall of Srebrenica--and the brutal atrocities carried on while the international community stood passively by--at long last galvanized the international community to end the war and bloodshed in Bosnia. What we saw in Srebrenica shamed the international community to action, and led to the negotiation of the Dayton accords.  Today, 2 years after Srebrenica and a year-and-a-half since Dayton, should be a day to look back at our accomplishments of the past 2 years and say that we have upheld our vow of ``never again.''  Instead, it is a day when we must admit that we have not done enough to honor the memory of the young women whose photograph I referred to earlier, or the other victims of ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia.  The horrors that tore Yugoslavia apart--the ethnic cleansing, the genocide, the rapes--have been well documented. The perpetrators of these horrors are well known. Yet only 9 of the 75 indicted war criminals in the former Yugoslavia have been apprehended and are in custody.  The rest remain at liberty, their whereabouts known, and many working in jobs with the police, government, and leading businesses in the former Yugoslavia. Many live and work within minutes of NATO camps manned by U.S. troops.  Despite its efforts to amass evidence, lead investigations, and issue indictments, at almost every turn the Tribunal has been stymied by the failure of the international community to apprehend indicted war criminals and bring them to justice.  Estimates are that up to 20,000 women in Yugoslavia were systematically raped as part of a policy of ethnic cleansing and genocide. In Srebrenica, for example, one woman told of Serb soldiers, dressed as U.N. peacekeepers, who came in a factory where refugees were gathered and dragged away two girls aged 12 and 14 and a 23-year-old woman. After several hours the three returned. They were crying, naked, and bleeding. One said, ``We are not girls anymore.''  According to the U.N. Commission of Experts, the victims of rape in Bosnia included girls as young as 6 and women as old as 81. Many women and girls were subjected to gang rapes while being held in detention camps. And, tragically, for many of the women of ex-Yugoslavia rape was merely a prelude to further torture and then death.  I believe the use of rape as an instrument of genocide and ethnic cleansing is a war crime of the highest order. And the failure to assure that those who have been indicted for rape as a war crime are apprehended, extradited, and made to stand trial, does a grave injustice not just to the women of Srebrenica, but to women around the world.  The administration has asserted that rape as a war crime must not be allowed to stand and that the peace in this troubled area ``will not be complete until indicted war criminals are brought to justice.''  Ultimately, it would be a hollow and cynical gesture to claim outrage over rape as a war crime but then to act as if the issue is not important enough to merit the commitment or resources to see that those who committed these crimes are apprehend and prosecuted.  Our commitment to Bosnia, after all, is not just about Bosnia. It is also about the principles that guide us and our conduct in the world. It is about what we, as Americans, value.  Yesterday, with the arrest of one indicted war criminal by SFOR, and the death of another who resisted arrest, the international community took a long-delayed step in the right direction in seeing that the perpetrators of these crimes against humanity are brought to justice.  I hope that the actions of SFOR in Prejidor yesterday sends a clear signal to those indicted war criminals who remain at large that today, on the anniversary of the fall of Srebrenica, the international community is serious about bringing them to justice.  Although I believe that the capture of indicted war criminals is primarily the responsibility of the governments of the former Yugoslavia, yesterday's action illustrate the important role that SFOR has to play in this process as well.  The SFOR mandate clearly states that if SFOR patrols, including U.S. troops, encounter indicted war criminals and the tactical situation permits they are to arrest them and extradite them to The Hague.  But we have also heard stories of SFOR commanders telling their troops that if they encounter an indicted war criminal they should leave the area immediately and take no action.  I can think of no better way to honor the memory of Srebrenica then if today SFOR turns over a new leaf, and vows to pursue its mandate vigorously and to the maximum degree possible.  If indicted war criminals are not brought to justice, the international community will have betrayed the legacy of Nuremberg, the victims of the war that tore Yugoslavia apart, and women worldwide. This will also set a dangerous precedent that will give encouragement to others elsewhere in the world who may consider the use of rape and genocide as tools of war.  In the aftermath of the Holocaust 50 years ago, the civilized world vowed that we would never again allow crimes against humanity to blacken our history.  In the aftermath of the tragedy of Srebrenica 2 years ago, we vowed that we would bring peace and justice to Bosnia.  Today, on the second anniversary of the fall of Srebrenica the international community must vow to redouble itscommitment to take immediate strong action to see that the indicted war criminals are brought to justice.  If not, as I stated in my letter to the President on April 21, 1997, we run the risk that future historians will look back on current U.S. policy and conclude that the ethnic cleansing and the use of rape as an instrument of war is acceptable--and that those who perpetrate this crime can do so with impunity. This would be a tragic betrayal of our history, our principles, and the people of Srebrenica.  I ask that the correspondence to which I earlier referred be printed in the Record.  The correspondence follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                                    Washington, DC, March 3, 1997.     Hon. William Jefferson Clinton,     President of the United States, The White House, Washington,          DC.       Dear Mr. President: We, the women of the United States      Senate, welcome your recent statement that you believe that      the establishment of a permanent international institution      for the prosecution of those who have committed war crimes      should be a high priority for the international community,      and to express our concern that those indicted for genocide,      systematic rape and other war crimes by the International      Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia are apprehended      and tried.       The Tribunal has clearly established that, for the first      time in history, the organized, systematic rape of thousands      of women was employed as an instrument of war, and that      genocide was used to ``ethnically cleanse'' areas of      conflict. These, we believe, are war crimes of the highest      order.       Investigators have documented rapes of over 50,000 women      and girls and the use of rape as a weapon in a brutal      campaign of ethnic cleansing. The war that tore Bosnia apart      is one more chapter in the reprehensible book of genocide.       Those who ordered and perpetuated these crimes must be      brought to justice. The War Crimes Tribunal has publicly      indicted 75 people, including 5 for genocide, but only 6 of      the indicted suspects are in custody and many war criminals      remain at large.       We understand your decision and concerns about the use of      U.S. troops to apprehend indicted war criminals in the former      Yugoslavia. Like you, we consider the safety of U.S. troops      to be of the highest priority and would not support their      security being compromised. We are sure that you will also      agree that, to ensure the peace they have worked so hard to      preserve does not dissolve as soon as they depart, it is      critical that the international community take action to      assure that war criminals not be allowed to continue to elude      justice.       We, the women of the Senate, ask that you look at this      problem as a top priority and indicate to us precisely how      the international community might ensure the arrest and      extradition to the Hague of those responsible for crimes      against humanity. We believe that it is critically important      that the United States aggressively exercise its leadership      in the international community to ensure that the indicted      are brought to justice.       We look forward to hearing your thinking and plans on this      very important matter.           Sincerely,         Barbara Boxer, Dianne Feinstein, Mary L. Landrieu, Carol            Moseley-Braun, Olympia J. Snow, Susan M. Collins, Kay            Bailey Hutchison, Barbara A. Mikulski, Patty Murray.                                                                    ____                                                  U.S. Senate,                                   Washington, DC, April 21, 1997.     Hon. William Jefferson Clinton,     President of the United States, The White House, Washington,          DC.       Dear Mr. President, Thank you for your letter of April 11      regarding the deep concern shared by the women of the Senate      that only 7 of the 75 indicted war criminals in the former      Yugoslavia have been arrested and extradited to The Hague to      stand trial. Unfortunately, I was deeply disappointed with      the substance of your response.       In our March 3 letter, the women of the Senate asked that      you view this issue as a priority and that the United States      provide leadership in ensuring that the international      community take steps to secure the necessary trials. The      essence of your response appears to be that the      administration continues to examine ``a variety of options.''       As you may recall, in an October 10, 1996, letter you      assured me that the administration ``will continue to assist      the War Crimes Tribunal and we will continue to look at all      other possible ways to help detain and deliver war criminals      to The Hague . . . the peace will not be complete until      indicted war criminals are brought to justice.''       In the seven months that have passed between your letter to      me of October 10 and your letter of April 11, not one      additional indicted war criminals has been arrested or      extradited to The Hague, and the United States has undertaken      no concrete steps to see that they are brought to justice.       The failure of U.S. leadership makes a mockery of the      Tribunal's efforts, and continued procrastination and      obstruction in bringing indicted war criminals to justice      threaten to undermine both the Tribunals effectiveness and      the Dayton peace process as well. Mr. President, justice      delayed is justice denied.       If, as you stated to me in your letter last October 10,      ``We cannot tolerate genocide, ethnic cleansing and the use      of rape as instruments of war,'' then it would appear that      current U.S. policy regarding the apprehension of indicted      war criminals in the former Yugoslavia is woefully      inadequate. In fact, current U.S. policy not only allows      those who perpetuated genocide, ethnic cleansing, and rape      to remain at liberty, but, as a recent Human Rights Watch/     Helsinki report notes, it allows them to occupy positions      of authority in running police forces, towns, and      businesses in former Yugoslavia.       The International War Crimes Tribunal for the former      Yugoslavia has clearly established that, for the first time      in history, the organized, systematic rape of thousands of      women was employed as an instrument of war, and that genocide      was used to ``ethnically cleanse'' areas of conflict during      the tragic conflict in ex-Yugoslavia.       Between 1991 and 1993, the United Nations Commission of      Experts documented 800 victims of rape by name, 1,673 who      were referred to but not named, and 500 cases of rape with an      unspecified number of victims. The youngest documented victim      was 5 years old, the oldest 81. The Commission also noted      that, due to the social stigma of rape, investigation and      documentation were difficult, and estimates are that up to      50,000 women in ex-Yugoslavia were systematically raped as      part of a policy of ethnic cleansing and genocide. The use of      rape as an instrument of genocide and ethnic cleansing, I      believe, are war crimes of the highest order. Those      responsible must be apprehended and tried.       Acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the      Security Council established the ad hoc International      Tribunal in 1993 to prosecute violations of international law      in the territories of the former Yugoslavia. This Tribunal      was an innovation that renewed the hope that, after the many      conflicts during the past half-century in which international      law was routinely flouted and justice was denied to the      victims of crimes against humanity, the legacy of Nuremberg      would be fulfilled.       Instead, the Tribunal has been stymied by the international      community's failure to arrest war criminals. Today only seven      of the seventy-five indicted individuals are in custody. The      Office of the Prosecutor continues to amass evidence, lead      investigations, conduct searches, issue indictments, and hold      in absentia hearings. But the failure of the international      community to take action to arrest those indicted and bring      them to trial in The Hague puts at risk not only the      credibility and effort of the Tribunal, but the concept of      international law and justice as well.       The failure of the international community to take actions,      moreover, has not been caused by any difficulty in locating      the indicted war criminals, or, even, in many cases, any      potential danger in making arrests.       In fact, it is my understanding that the whereabouts of      over 40 of the 68 unextradited indicted war criminals are      well known. Let me present several examples:       The camp commanders of the Omarska concentration camp,      where systematic rape of Bosnian women was a regular part of      a campaign of oppression, were working openly last year in      the local police force in Prijedor in Republika Srpska.      (Source: Coalition for International Justice (CIJ),      Washington Post)       Zeljko Mejakic, the commander of the Omarska camp indicted      for rape and crimes against humanity was the deputy commander      of the Omarska police station for much of last year. (Source:      Boston Globe)       Predrag Kostic, a camp guard at Omarska indicted for crimes      against humanity, is frequently sighted at the ``Express''      restaurant in Prijedor (Source: CIJ, New York Times).       Radovan Karadzic, indicted for genocide following the Serb      attack on Srebrenica and whose current home in Pale is well      known, is building a house in Koljani (near Banja Luka) and,      according to stories in the Associated Press, ``makes little      effort to conceal his daily movements.'' (Source: Human      Rights Watch, AP)       Stevan Todorovic, indicted for a series of atrocities,      lives in Donja Slatina, a three-minute drive away from Camp      Colt--a 1,000-troop, U.S.-manned SFOR base. To commute to his      job with Bosnian state security, Todorovic drives past the      base on a road regularly traveled by NATO patrols. (Source:      Washington Post)       Drago Josipovic, indicted for his role in the execution of      Muslim civilians, is a chemical engineer at the local Vitezit      explosives factory and lives in his family house in the      village of Santici. (Source: CIJ)       Radovan Stankovic, a member of the Serb paramilitary unit      Pero Elez, and who was in charge of a detention facility      where women were regularly raped, works as a policeman in      northwest Bosnia. According to a story in Reuters, his      whereabouts are well-known to the International Police Task      Force and U.N. officials. (Source: Reuters)       Blagoje Simic, who has been indicted for failing to halt      the torture and abuse of Muslim and Croat civilians,      continues to serve as municipal president in Bosanski Samac.      Simic was quoted in a Boston Globe article as saying, ``I'm      not uncatchable. But I think that someone important still      hasn't ordered those arrests to be done.'' Asked who that      might be by the Globe reporter, Simic replied ``President      Clinton.'' (Source: Boston Globe)       These are but a handful of the indicted war criminals who      have been regularly seen by credible journalists,      representatives of non-     governmental organizations, and others throughout the former      Yugoslavia. In fact, the U.S. State Department spokesperson      commented on March 14 of this year that: ``There are a number      of indicted war criminals who live in Croatia who have not      been turned over to the War Crimes Tribunal. And there are      certain individuals that we're watching very closely. We've      told the Croatian government that we know who these people      are. They've been named by the tribunal as indicted war      criminals. We know where they live.''       It has become clear that neither Serb authorities within      Republika Srpska in Bosnia and Herzegovina nor Croat      authorities in the Federation are meeting their obligations      to hand over indicted war criminals--and that the United      States is doing very little to force them to meet these      obligations.       Regular reports about the whereabouts of several indicted      war criminals indicate that many lead remarkably open lives.      Last fall the Coalition for International Justice published a      comprehensive report on the whereabouts, jobs, and everyday      habits of 37 of the indicted war criminals. Earlier this      year, Human Rights Watch/Helsinki issued a report documenting      that many of the people running the towns, police forces and      businesses of the Serbian portion of Bosnia are the same      people who orchestrated the horrors of ethnic cleansing. In      case you have not had the opportunity to see them, I have      attached copies of both these reports.       The United States, unfortunately, must bear a large share      of the blame for the fact that indicted war criminals remain      at large in the former Yugoslavia.       In the letter to my office last October 10, you stated that      ``IFOR will detain indicted war criminals and hand them over      to the International Tribunal if they are encountered by IFOR      personnel during the normal course of their duties and the      tactical situation permits.'' (This mandate regarding war      criminals, I understand, has been subsequently extended to      SFOR.) Even if we rule out some of the reported war      criminal sightings as false, it defies credulity to      suggest that so many people in the former Yugoslavia      except for SFOR have had regular contact with indicted war      criminals.       The SFOR rules of engagement regarding war criminals appear      to be interpreted so narrowly that it seems that an indicted      war criminal would, in effect, have to actively seek out and      surrender to SFOR if SFOR troops were to arrest them.       Indicted war criminals must be arrested and brought to      trial if the Tribunal is to have meaning as the ultimate      international arbiter of guilt or innocence in the commission      of war crimes. If indicted war criminals are not brought to      justice, the international community will have betrayed both      the legacy of Nuremberg and the victims of the war that tore      Yugoslavia apart. This failure will also set a dangerous      precedent that will give encouragement to others elsewhere in      the world who may consider the use of rape and genocide as      tools of war.       In addition, it is my firm belief that the continued      presence of indicted war criminals in former Yugoslavia will      set the stage for the renewal of violence, bloodshed, and      civil war when SFOR departs next year. We will have      sacrificed all the gains of the Dayton process because we      will have chosen to compromise with war criminals.       I once again call upon you to take an aggressive stand to      see that the indicted war criminals are brought to justice.      Specifically, I encourage you to:       Examine the feasibility of the United States and SFOR      taking a more active role to apprehend indicted war criminals      still at large as well as cooperating more closely with the      United Nations, the International Civilian Police Task Force,      and civilian authorities in the former Yugoslavia on this      issue;       Investigate appropriate additional sanctions, which can be      enforced either unilaterally or through the United Nations      system for the Republika Srpska and Croatia, unless and until      they cooperate fully with the Tribunal;       Explore the necessity of any additional U.S. assistance to      the International War Crimes Tribunal for the former      Yugoslavia; and,       Move quickly to implement the permanent international body      with the power, authority, and resources to investigate,      apprehend, and bring war criminals to trial that you spoke of      earlier this year.       I would also appreciate your clarification of the SFOR      rules of engagement for detaining war criminals.       Mr. President, you have been called upon to serve the      United States at a time of great international change and      uncertainty. Unless the United States takes a position of      aggressive leadership on this issue in the international      community, we run the risk that future historians will      conclude that the lessons of current U.S. foreign policy are      that crimes against humanity, genocide, and the use of rape      as an instrument of war are acceptable--and that those who      perpetrate these crimes can do so with impunity. Mr.      President, I know that you share my belief that leaving such      a legacy would be unacceptable.       I look forward to hearing your thoughts and plans on this      very important matter.           Sincerely yours,                                                 Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senator.                                                                    ____                                              The White House,                                        Washington, June 19, 1997.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Dianne: Thank you for writing again regarding indicted      war criminals in the former Yugoslavia. I continue to share      your concerns. My foreign policy team is examining several      options to assist and enhance the ability of the Tribunal to      bring indicted war criminals into custody.       We are increasing pressure on the parties by linking      multilateral and bilateral economic assistance to their      compliance with their obligation under the Dayton Accords to      turn over indicted war criminals. In addition, we have begun      working with the UN and its International Police Task Force      (IPTF) in Bosnia to improve the performance of the IPTF in      identifying indictees and their whereabouts.       We continue to work closely with the Tribunal, especially      the Office of the Chief Prosecutor, by providing a wide range      of assistance, including legal and investigative support. The      United States also provides the Tribunal intelligence and      information pursuant to Section 555 of the Foreign      Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs      Appropriations Act of 1997. On May 2 we contributed $450,000      to the Tribunal's forensic exhumations program in the former      Yugoslavia.       I have also nominated David Scheffer as Ambassador-at-Large      for War Crimes Issues. If confirmed, Mr. Scheffer will      coordinate our work in this area and focus on the tasks that      are critical to the success of both the Yugoslav and Rwanda      War Crimes Tribunals. Finally, knowing our mutual concern for      this grave issue, I have asked Robert Gelbard, my Special      Representative for Implementation of the Dayton Accords, to      give you a confidential briefing as soon as possible on our      specific plans to re-energize this critical component of the      Dayton peace process.       Thanks again for your letter and your continuing support      for our efforts to bring peace and justice to the people of      the Balkans.           Sincerely,     Bill.                          ____________________
