Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to two good friends of mine, Ray and Judy Ober. Ray and Judy passed away just 21 days apart from each other, a testament to their love for one another. Ray and Judy were a pillar of the community in Riverside, California and they will be deeply missed.  Judy was born in New York, and grew up in the San Fernando Valley, while Ray was born in Hollywood and raised in Van Nuys, California. They lived a blessed life in Riverside for 53 years and raised all four of their children there. Ray and Judy owned Ober Graphics, Inc. for many years, where Ray was the ``premier graphic artist of Riverside,'' while Judy went back to school and eventually earned her bachelor's degree from Cal Poly Pomona at the age of 49. After graduating, she passed the Certified Public Accountant (CPA) exam and went to work at Macher and Clark, where she worked for over 20 years. Their chosen careers, Ray a talented artist and Judy a CPA, may have appeared to be in stark contrast, but were the perfect recipe for a loving, lasting marriage.  Ray and Judy were long time members of Canyon Crest Country Club during the 1970s and 1980s where they played tennis and socialized with many great friends. Ray and Judy enjoyed spending time at their beach house in Newport and trips to Las Vegas. They took their children on many family vacations, celebrating their love of life. Judy held officer positions in various clubs including treasurer of the Riverside County Republican Party and president of the Riverside Soroptomists. Ray's passions were genealogy and ``playing the ponies.'' In their more recent years Judy enjoyed playing golf with her golf girlfriends, going on vacations with her high school girlfriends, spending time with her sisters and friends and playing games with her grandchildren. Ray more recently enjoyed photography, visits from his family and friends and trips to Pechanga. Judy and Ray were both amazing, multi-faceted, rare human beings who will be incredibly missed by all who knew them.  I am particularly thankful for the friendship I shared with both Ray and Judy. They were great supporters and, most importantly, dear friends. I will miss their generous spirit, kind nature and enduring friendship.  On April 15, 2012, there was a combined service celebrating the lives of Ray and Judy. They will always be remembered for their generosity, contributions to the community and love of family. Their dedication to their family and community are a testament to lives lived well and a legacy that will continue. I extend my condolences to Ray and Judy's family and friends; although they may be gone, the light and goodness they brought to the world remain and will never be forgotten.                          ____________________
