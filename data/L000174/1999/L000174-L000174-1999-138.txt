President, 10 years ago, Caryl Stewart, Executive Director of the Vermont Development Credit Union, had a dream for a grass roots community development ``bank'' to serve low and moderate income people in Burlington, Vermont. Who would have guessed them that her dream would become a growing credit union with over $10 million in assets and 5,000 members in 175 Vermont towns?  Through it all, the credit union, with Caryl at its helm, has stayed true to its vision of serving lower income families and small business entrepreneurs in Vermont. Not just with loans, but also with the personal attention and counseling needed to ensure that loanrecipients succeed, whatever their goals. It is that commitment to Vermonters and the communities they live in that has won the Credit Union the support and patronage of so many Vermont businesses and organizations.  It has also won the organization support from far beyond Vermont's borders. From Fannie Mae to the Community Development Financial Institutions program the Vermont Development Credit Union has received funding and won national recognition for its innovative lending and support programs.  Vermont Development came from very small beginnings in a very small city of our very small State. But like that State, it had very big ideas and has earned its place as a model for organizations providing credit and financial assistance to low and moderate income people throughout the country.  Happy Birthday, Vermont Development Credit Union and congratulations on 10 years of bringing hope and opportunity to thousands of Vermonters.                          ____________________
