I thank Senators Campbell, Schumer, Clinton, and Biden for cosponsoring our bipartisan measure. I also commend Representatives Manzullo and Nadler for their leadership on the House version of this bill, H.R. 3297.  Named for Chaplain Mychal Judge, who was killed while responding with the New York City Fire Department to the September 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center, this legislation recognizes the invaluable service of police and fire chaplains in crisis situations by allowing for their eligibility in the Public Safety Officers' Benefit Program. Father Judge, while deemed eligible for public safety officer benefits, was survived by his two sisters who, under current law, are ineligible to receive payments through the PSOB Program. This is simply wrong and must be remedied.  Indeed, Father Judge is among ten public safety officers who were killed on September 11, but who are ineligible for federal death benefits because they died without spouses, children, or parents. This bill would retroactively correct this injustice by expanding the list of those who may receive public safety officer benefits to the beneficiaries named on the most recently executed life insurance policy of the deceased officer. This change would go into effect on September 11 of last year to make sure the families of Father Judge and the nine other fallen heros receive their public safety officer benefits.  In addition, this bill would retroactively restructure the Public Safety Officers' Benefit Program to specifically include chaplains as members of the law enforcement and fire units they serve, and would make these chaplains eligible for the one-time $250,000 benefit available to public safety officer who have been permanently disabled as a result of injuries sustained in the line of duty, or to the survivors of officers who have died.  We have yet another unique opportunity to provide much-needed relief for the survivors of the brave public servants who selflessly risk and sacrifice their own lives everyday so that others might live or be comforted.  Finally, I applaud the National Association of Police Organization, the Fraternal Order of Police, and American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees for their leadership and strong support for public safety officers and their families. I ask unanimous consent that their letters in support of the Mychal Judge Police and Fire Chaplains Public Safety Officers' Benefit Act be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                      Grand Lodge,                                    Fraternal Order of Police,                                      Washington, DC, May 1, 2002.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing on behalf of the membership      of the Fraternal Order of Police to advise you of our strong      support for S. 2431, the ``Mychal Judge Police and Fire      Chaplains Public Safety Officers' Benefit Act of 2002.''       None of us in the public safety community will ever forget      the tremendous courage exhibited by our police, fire, and      rescue personnel as they responded to the devastating     terrorist attacks of 11 September. Nor will we forget the      examples of heroism and self-sacrifice exemplified by Father      Judge and the other dedicated public servants who lost their      lives on that day.       The legislation you have introduced affords Congress the      opportunity to further honor these American heroes by making      two important enhancements to the Public Safety Officers'      Benefits Program (PSOB). First, S. 2431 will specifically      recognize police and fire chaplains who were killed or      injured in the line of duty while responding to a fire,      rescue, or police emergency among those who are eligible for      PSOB benefits. In addition, the bill would expand the list of      those allowed to receive such benefits in the event of an      officer's death to include, in the event that there is no      surviving spouse or child, the individual designated by the      officer as a beneficiary under their most recently executed      life insurance policy.       On behalf of the more than 300,000 members of the Fraternal      Order of Police, thank you for your leadership on this issue      and for your continuing commitment to America's Federal,      State and local law enforcement officers. Please do not      hesitate to contact me, or Executive Director Jim Pasco, if      we can provide you with any additional information or      assistance.           Sincerely,                                                      Steve Young,     National President.                                  ____                                    National Association of Police                                          Organizations, Inc.,                                      Washington, DC, May 1, 2002.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, U.S. Senate, Russell          Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: On behalf of the National Association of      Police Organizations (NAPO), representing 220,000 rank-and-     file police officers from across the United States, I would      like to advise you of our wholehearted support for S. 2431,      the ``Mychal Judge Police and Fire Chaplains Public Safety      Officers' Benefit Act of 2002.'' This bill will recognize the      invaluable service of police and fire chaplains in crisis      situations by allowing for their eligibility in the Public      Safety Officers' Benefit program.       Created by congress in 1976, the PSOB program is      administered by the Bureau of Justice Assistance of the U.S.      Department of Justice and pays a one-time death benefit to      the families of public safety officers who die in the line of      duty.       S. 2431 is named after Franciscan Friar Mychal Judge who      was the Chaplain of the New York City Fire Department. Father      Judge was killed by the falling debris of the World Trade      Center on September 11, 2001, while giving last rites to      another firefighter who died in the terrorist attack.       NAPO thanks you for introducing this important piece of      legislation and expeditiously bringing it before the Senate      Judiciary Committee for full consideration. We commend you      for your continued and strong support of law enforcement and      look forward to working with you for the bill's passage.           Sincerely,                                               William J. Johnson,     Executive Director.                                  ____                                                       AFSCME,                                      Washington, DC, May 2, 2002.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: On behalf of the 1.3 million members of      the American Federation of State, County and Municipal      Employees (AFSCME) and the corrections and law enforcement      officers and emergency medical technicians that we represent,      I am writing to express our support for the Mychal Judge      Police and Fire Chaplains Public Safety Officers' Benefit Act      of 2002 (S. 2431).       Father Mychal Judge was a courageous and humane chaplain      and public servant who deserves the honor you bestow on him      posthumously by the introduction of this legislation which      expressly includes chaplains as eligible members of the law      enforcement and fire units for public safety death benefits      purposes. We know firsthand about his bravery because Father      Judge was an AFSCME member.       Not only does this legislation resolve any ambiguities      regarding coverage of chaplains, but it would also expand the      list of those who may receive benefits in the event of a      public safety officer's death in the line of duty. Currently,      if the officer does not have a surviving wife, children or      parents, no benefit would be paid as was the case with Father      Judge. Your legislation would allow this monetary benefit to      be paid to the individual designated by such officer as a      beneficiary under the officer's most recently executed life      insurance policy and then to the parents of the officer. As      you mentioned in your statement, approximately 450 public      safety officers killed in the September 11th attacks died      without spouses, children or parents so the $250,000 death      benefit will not be paid. Your legislation would correct this      inequity.       AFSCME wholeheartedly endorses the Mychal Judge Police and      Fire Chaplains Public Safety Officers' Benefits Act of 2002.      Thank you for recognizing the need for this legislative      change in the benefits program.           Sincerely,                                              Charles M. Loveless,                                          Director of Legislation.
