 billion. We have two growing categories of exports as the leading industrialized nation in the world, and one is waste. We are exporting more waste paper, bottles, cans and things to the world's fastest growing industrial giant, China, which they turn into high value added goods and ship back to us.  Our second greatest export, or actually the greatest export is U.S. dollars. We are borrowing $665.9 billion from overseas producers to bring goods into this country without adding to the economic industrial base, in fact to the detriment of the economic industrial base of the United States.  Japan today holds $820 billion, China $610 billion. China will soon eclipse Japan. Within 3 years, China will have a trillion dollars of IOUs from the United States Government. They will have not only a stranglehold over the production of goods, because we are buying so many things from them and so many U.S. companies have put capital into China instead of jobs here, but they will have a stranglehold over the dollar.  Let us image a confrontation over Taiwan, and the Chinese say we are not going to take you on militarily yet, it is 10 or 15 years until we have eclipsed you militarily, although we have eclipsed you industrially, but we are going to dump dollars tomorrow. We are going to take the dollar down to the value of a rupee or even less. They could threaten to dump that trillion dollars onto the world market, cause an economic catastrophe here at home and around the world. They would not have to fire a single shot.  This administration thinks it is just peachy. They say the U.S. is growing so fast, that is why we have these huge trade deficits. Yes, we are growing so fast on borrowed money and purchasing products made overseas. That is not exactly my idea of adding to the economic industrial base might of the United States of America and putting our own people into productive work. Members wonder why wages are dropping in the U.S. and people are not doing so well, because the good jobs, the manufacturing jobs, the high-paying jobs, the jobs with benefits, are going to China and other unfair trading nations.  And this administration, and to give them some due, the last administration was afraid to take on China on their unfair trade practices. They can steal products, like they have from companies in my own district, clone them in China, including translating the U.S. patents into Chinese, and this administration and the last will not lift a finger to stop that. This administration said bring them to the WTO, rules-based trade, and then we will go after them. They have only filed one complaint against China. The billions that they are pirating from our companies, one complaint and who was it for, Pfizer, the big drug company, the only company that this administration would file a complaint at the WTO on behalf of, not the electronics company in my district, not the wood products company in my district, not other companies all across America who are being pirated by the Chinese, just Pfizer who could probably take care of themselves, but these other little guys cannot.  We have a failed trade policy in this country. We cannot continue to borrow here at home, $1.3 million a minute with our current account deficit to run the government, and borrowing $2 billion a day from overseas from countries that are potential future enemies, or at least competitors, like China. It is crazy. It is not sustainable.  Even the great guru, Alan Greenspan, the head political economic hack in this town, has said it is not sustainable. When will this administration wake up?                          ____________________
