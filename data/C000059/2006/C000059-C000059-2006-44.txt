Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor Rear Admiral Michael G. Mathis, United States Navy, for his more than 30 years of active duty service to our country. Admiral Mathis most recently served as the deputy commander for Test and Evaluation at the Naval Sea Systems Command and he retired on January 26, 2006.  For over two decades, Admiral Mathis shaped the Navy's strategic planning of surface ship combat systems, from electronic warfare and tactical data systems to advanced radars and several generations of surface-to-air missiles. He is the rare combination of leadership at sea, exceptional engineering and scientific accomplishments, and success as a program executive and program manager. Serving tirelessly as a Navy and Joint leader, including as the Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Chief Engineer, Admiral Mathis kept the spotlight on the RDT&E required to meet the Department of Defense's current and future needs.  In his many years as the leader of the Surface Navy's acquisition professionals, as well as the Navy's senior expert in advanced and future weapons systems, Admiral Mathis instilled pride in generations of naval officers and civilian engineers. A strong proponent of technical proficiency in naval officers, he promoted the Navy's advanced science and engineering degree programs for junior officers.  Admiral Mathis's inspirational leadership and management of the 22,000 men and women of the Naval Surface Warfare Systems Command during wartime has directly contributed to the tremendous record of success in Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom, including the fielding of thermobaric weapons and innovative Force Protection advances developed in his warfare center laboratories. He put the weapons and tools in the hands of the warfighters when they were needed. Most recently, his talents and dedication to our warfighters were further put to use by our country as he served in the Joint Staff as Deputy Director, J-8 for Force Protection.  Throughout his career, the Navy's leadership selected Admiral Mathis for a series of key positions to mold the technical direction of the Navy's Theatre Missile Defense program. His foresight, vision, and management decisions led to the development and continuing success of missile defense programs vital to our Nation's defense. Key among his assignments was as the Director, Joint Theater Air and Missile Defense Organization, where he was responsible to the Chairman and Secretary of Defense for evaluating systems and emerging technologies to determine the optimum mix of surveillance, fire control systems, and the associated battle management system to counter aircraft, cruise missile and ballistic missile threats to our Nation.  More than just a leader providing the technical punch for the global war on terror, Admiral Mathis has focused on maintaining our Nation's technological edge in future weapons systems. He is the senior advocate and leader for the RDT&E in laser and directed energy weapons, inspiring industry and government engineers to solve engineering challenges and ensuring our next generation of warfighters has the weapons needed to win. He has championed the need for battle force, joint, and coalition interoperability and warfighting capabilities, serving as the Single Integrated Air Picture System Engineer forthe Chairman, JCS, and Commander, Joint Forces Command. He also led the development of the Joint Integrated Air and Missile Defense roadmap, and to identify joint solutions to surveillance and command and control challenges.  As the Joint Staff lead for Interagency Homeland Air Security issues, Admiral Mathis most recently worked in close cooperation with USNORTHCOM, NORAD, the Services, Federal Aviation Administration, Department of Homeland Security, and the Office of Homeland Security.  On behalf of a grateful nation, I want to express my appreciation for his dedicated service and I wish him well in his retirement from the Navy.                          ____________________
