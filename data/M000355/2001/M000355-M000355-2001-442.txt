 President, I would be happy to yield some time. I am unaware of speakers at the moment in opposition to the Torricelli amendment. There may be some. Actually, I know of one who wants to speak. He is not on the floor at the moment. So we will be casual about time, and I will make sure we can accommodate all speakers.
