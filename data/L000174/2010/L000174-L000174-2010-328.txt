President, I rise this afternoon to call the Senate's attention to a significant agreement that was signed late last Friday night to preserve the current government in Belfast and continue the long road toward permanent peace in Northern Ireland.  The 12 years since the signing of the Good Friday Peace Accords have not been easy ones for the people of Northern Ireland. The power-sharing government was suspended in 2002, the British resumed direct control, and violence has flared at times. However, all sides have been committed to working towards the blueprint for peace worked out in 1998--the Irish Republican Army formally ended its armed campaign in 2005, the St. Andrews Agreement returned control of the government to Northern Ireland, and all sides have resisted a resurgence of the brutality of the past.  In recent months, disagreements over a variety of issues have threatened to bring down the fragile government again--tensions over British control of prosecutors, the judiciary and the police, and the rights of the Protestant Orange Order to parade through heavily Catholic neighborhoods have prevented both sides from moving forward.  I commend the Northern Irish First Minister Peter Robinson of the Democratic Unionist Party and Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness of Sinn Fein who met at Hillsborough Castle near Belfast with Prime Minister of Britain, Gordon Brown, and Taoiseach Cowen of the Republic of Ireland, whose leadership has been vital. Friday's agreement set April 12 as the date for the transfer of the Judiciary and Police forces to local control, and laid out a plan and timeline for the resolution of disagreements on parades before ``marching season'' in July of 2011.  Northern Ireland's long peacemaking process has been difficult, demanding painful concessions by both sides. Yet both sides also seem to have reached a point where return to the conditions of the last 40 years is no longer an option. The last few years have seen opportunities for Northern Ireland to return to sectarian strife, and yet both sides, their leaders, and the people of Northern Ireland have looked over the edge and stepped back with the knowledge that no matter how difficult the road forward is, the road back must not be travelled.  I am proud of the critical role the United States has played in the process. Former President Clinton was intimately involved in the Good Friday Agreement, and Secretary of State Clinton deserves a great deal of credit for her part in these talks. All of us in this chamber also are proud of the role that former Senator George Mitchell played at crucial junctures earlier in this long process. I assure the people of Northern Ireland that this Senator--and all Americans of good will--remains committed to remaining with them every step of the way.                          ____________________
