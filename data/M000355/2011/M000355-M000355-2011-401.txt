 Richard Jay Corman of Nicholasville, KY. Mr. Corman is a successful businessman, a self-made man who started what is today a multimillion-dollar company. He is also living with cancer--and I do mean living, as for several years now he has continued to make the most of each day despite this disease, and he has become an inspiration for many.  Richard grew up on a farm that did not get indoor plumbing until he was in the fourth grade. Now he is the head of the R.J. Corman Railroad Group, a construction and railroad operation company he founded when he was 18 years old. When Hurricane Katrina struck in 2005, the Corman Railroad Group was there, repairing the railways that had been damaged in dangerous conditions, and Richard was the one leading the operation. He is known for his intensity, his determination, and his indefatigable energy.  Richard has so much energy he has barely slowed down even after being diagnosed with multiple myeloma nearly 10 years ago. Without treatment, he was told he may have only a year to live. He survives thanks to a fantastic medical team, and Richard himself is funding medical research that is not only keeping him alive but will benefit untold others. And Richard is still working and running marathons.  I am proud to call Richard Jay Corman a friend and I think his life story holds lessons and inspiration for others. I read an article in Fortune magazine recently that was a fascinating look at Richard's life and work. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                      [From Fortune, Mar. 7, 2011]                    The Ballad of Richard Jay Corman               (By Carol Loomis, senior editor-at-large)       Richard Jay Corman is hardly a household name. But this      entrepreneur, a son of Kentucky, has made himself a force in      the railroad industry, where in up-from-nothing fashion he      has created a thriving, highly respected company. Called R.J.      Corman Railroad Group, it's a construction and operating      enterprise that takes in around $300 million a year. Rick      Corman, 55, is its sole owner. Earnings? He will say only      that it's ``incredibly profitable.'' But we'll make an      informed estimate: This business, after taxes, has in more      than one recent year earned $50 million in profits.       A Kentucky friend of mine, impressed by Corman and aware      also that he was facing some complex estate-planning      problems, suggested he'd make a good story. You couldn't say      the idea was a natural for us: Corman's financial feats,      while first-class, don't exactly put him in the Fortune 500      league. Still, Corman seemed worth a trip, so last fall I      went to see him in his home state. And well before we      finished talking, I realized that he just might be--apologies      here to the Reader's Digest, which popularized this title--     the Most Unforgettable Character I've Ever Met in my more      than a half-century at Fortune. That may seem surprising      given that I've come to know more than a few standout CEOs      over the years. But the emphasis here is on the word      ``character.'' In the way he operates--and faces the world--     Rick Corman is truly larger than life.       And that's not just in business. Corman has also led a kind      of soap opera existence, whose chapters he began describing      to me in his twangy Southern drawl, and with a startling lack      of inhibition, within minutes of our starting to talk. We      were at his headquarters in the Lexington, Ky., suburb of      Nicholasville, in a small conference room adjoining a      cafeteria. He made sure I sat where I could look through a      glass wall down to a hangar in which there were parked two      private jets and a helicopter, all of them bright red (more      on that later). At that moment, I was too obtuse to grasp how      unusual those aircraft were. I mean, really, how many red      planes have you seen?       Asking a journalist's throwaway kind of question, I said      that driving to Nicholasville I had noticed a sign that said      REELECT KEVIN CORMAN FOR SHERIFF, and was he related? ``No,''      said Rick, ``but if I get into trouble, he will be.'' And      those were the first of many laughs that I got from the very      funny and quick Rick Corman, who laughs along at high      decibels and loves it.       Hours later, Corman ended our talk with a plan for getting      me back on the road. Standing in his red baseball cap and      red-and-white corporate jacket outside his red-trimmed glass      offices, he told me to drive behind him as he led me to a      locked back gate and a shortcut to Lexington. The ride      unrolled a pristine scene of success. Ignoring a profusion of      red 25-mph signs he himself had ordered installed, Corman      raced at twice that speed for more than three miles through      2,000 acres of manicured rolling fields, past red sheds and      red work-barns and red bridges and small, shapely roadside      maples cooperatively turned, of course, red. In the left sky,      a pilot in still another red Corman helicopter was practicing      powerless emergency landings on a road. There were two      snapshots in white: the three farmhouse rooms that Corman      grew up in (and that got indoor plumbing when he was in the      fourth grade) and the large frame house, featuring half-     octagon windows at the end of recently built wings, that he      lives in now.       And as the back gate opened and I started to wave thanks,      Corman unfolded his gangly 6-foot-3 frame from his Lincoln      Navigator SUV, came to my right window, and said, ``I just      had to add one more thing: I would not be alive today if it      weren't for Kathy Martin.''       So, yes, there is a dark side to this tale. Kathleen      Martin, a gastroenterologist, is Corman's Lexington doctor.      He has an incurable form of cancer: multiple myeloma, which      attacks the plasma cells in bone marrow and destroys bones.      The disease killed Wal-Mart (WMT) founder Sam Walton,      quickly, in 1992. But Corman was diagnosed nearly 10 years      ago, when he was only 45. With the aid of two bone marrow      transplants, the determined ministrations of both Dr. Martin      and Harvard's Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and the strong      will that allowed him to build a major business from scratch,      Corman has survived.       You can read about it on his company's website, where Dr.      Martin conveys the latest medical news about Corman. Last      July, following a period of remission for him, she posted a      new report saying that unfortunately a small amount of      recurrent cancer had been detected in his bone and that he      would therefore undergo new doses of radiation and      intensified chemotherapy.       Then, in October, the doctor triumphantly posted ``good      news.'' A PET scan had found Corman's myeloma to have again      gone into remission. ``We remain hopeful,'' Dr. Martin added,      ``that new therapies will become available to treat any      future relapses.''       Since R.J. Corman, the company, has no shareholders to      ponder this information, Martin's reports inform and reassure      the company's employees and customers--and even a board of      directors--who know Rick Corman to be the soul of the      company. True, he ostensibly retired about 14 years ago when      he suffered his third divorce and took over shared custody of      his three youngest children, then 6, 8, and 10. His      description of life as an idled, single father is that every      day he took the kids to the playground and sat there and      cried. And that was before he knew he had cancer.       Reports of his ``retirement'' are, in any case, highly      exaggerated. When his storm-team unit won a large and hugely      difficult Hurricane Katrina railway-repair job in 2005, he      was on site, leading the work, which produced revenues of      more than $100 million. ``He knows everything that's going      on,'' says W.W. ``Half'' Halfhill, a close friend. And Corman      circulates within the company's offices, and even its      cafeteria, like a boss--``Tell the cook not to fix so much      catfish at a time, because it gets cold,'' he ordered as our      interview turned into lunch. Says a veteran Corman employee,      Dickie Dillon: ``He's the motivator.''       Now, deeply aware of the doomsday clock, Rick Corman has      the untimely job of planning his company's future. Private      equity firms circle, some no doubt figuring they might sell      off pieces of the company. But out of loyalty to his 900      employees, Corman refuses to sell.       Instead, he considers alternatives, a subject that      inevitably leads to the soap opera part of his life. His two      oldest children, a daughter and son who bear his name but      were born to a woman he never married, do not seem slated to      run the business. The three others--the ones he once took to      the playground--are still young, only in their twenties. On      the other hand, he has a highly competent staff, headed by a      talented president with whom Corman communicates with ease:      She's 49-year-old Tammie Taylor, dark-haired and attractive--     and Corman has lived with her for nine years.       Corman has a Kentucky expression for almost every      situation, including his death. That would be no big deal for      the company, he says: ``One monkey don't stop no show.'' But      in reality, for the Corman empire, that's as flawed in logic      as in grammar.       Corman came from a farm family, which included a      grandfather who did odd jobs hauling goods and took Rick in      as a 25% partner when he was only 11. A few years later, high      school utterly bored him. He got married in September of his      senior year and, when she didn't turn out to be pregnant      after all, they got divorced. Totally impatient with      schooling, Corman missed 105 days out of a scheduled 175      during the 1973 school year but managed to graduate.       Having devoted his days playing hooky to learning the      excavation trade from an uncle, Rick rented a backhoe and a      dump truck and set out to do whatever jobs he could pick up.      The dump truck was red, and that became his color. ``You      can't be good if you don't look good,'' he says.       He edged into railroad work, rebuilding crossings and      driving grueling distances to wherever the job was, sometimes      sleeping in his truck and regularly braving terrible weather.      ``Railroads don't care--well, they really can't care--what      the weather's like when something needs fixing,'' he says.      Workers who couldn't take the punishment left. Corman kept      making himself the model for doing things right. A ``go-     getter'' by the description of many, including even himself,      he steadily picked up construction jobs and gained a      reputation for fast, expert service. It also helped that most      people simply liked him, sensing his innate intelligence,      quickly learning that he was totally honest, enjoying his      openness and humor and boisterous, cackling laugh.       In business, Corman was opportunistic. A Columbus company      to which the rail industry outsourced some of its derailment      business quit the city, and Corman was asked by railroad      friends to step into the void. He did, accepting the need to      acquire heavy, expensive equipment--machines that will lift a      derailed car, for example, so that the rails beneath it can      be repaired or replaced. That naturally led to ``crisis''      work. ``He's kind of like an oilfield firefighter,'' says      Matt Rose, CEO of Burlington Northern Santa Fe, of his friend      Corman. ``He's the Red Adair of the railroad industry.'' But      Corman also has a hand in more prosaic businesses, such as      selling rails and ties to railroads. In effect, he takes on      inventory costs they'd just as soon not bear.       By 1984, when Corman was paying 24% interest to finance new      trucks, he sought help from Luther Deaton, a lending officer      at Lexington's Central Bank & Trust. Deaton, now president of      the bank, recalls that ``a very self-confident and happy-go-     lucky'' Corman, then just short of 30, arrived for their      first meeting wearing boots, khaki pants, and a big belt      buckle flashing his initials, and with no financial      statements in hand. ``I just couldn't get comfortable with      him,'' Deaton remembers.       Deaton stayed skeptical until Corman got him to visit a      couple of work sites--``to see what we do.'' On his first      visit, to a sprawling Baltimore & Ohio wreck, Deaton saw      shiny red trucks and bulldozers and watched Rick work atop a      railroad car, rigging cables to start pulling derailed cars      out of a tunnel. Next, on a deathly hot August day, Deaton      drove to see a stretch of railroad being rebuilt. Deaton      found Rick pulling up spikes so that track could be re-laid,      while sweat poured out of the top of his work boots.      Explaining to Deaton that he couldn't right then talk to him,      Corman said that if he got     the job finished by midnight, he would get a bonus and in      turn be able to pay bonuses to his workers--those remaining,      because several had quit during the day owing to the harsh      conditions.       Deaton went home, comfortable, and says he told the      president of the bank, ``Look, we've got to help this guy. He      knows how to get it done. He's free to go be a great      success,'' and the boss said, ``Do it.'' The next day, a      Saturday, Deaton found Corman sitting in the engine he used      for an office, with blisters on his feet visibly oozing.      Deaton cut his interest costs on the trucks to 14% and      offered him a $500,000 credit line. ``We've never looked back      since then,'' says Deaton. ``He's a banker's dream.''      Translation, according to Deaton: Corman is a brilliant      businessman who borrows frequently, but is conservative and      always good for his debt.       Corman's improved financial position helped set him up for      his biggest opportunity, which materialized when the passage      of the deregulating Staggers Rail Act of 1980 caused the      industry to gradually reshape itself. Many railroads sold off      their ``short lines,'' usually meaning rail lines of 100      miles or less. These were like baubles to the trunk lines,      but they were nice baubles, being monopolies (as is the case      with almost all railroads), except for competition from      trucks.       Corman got in this game when a Seaboard System executive      who took to Rick said, ``I'm going to sell you a railroad.''      And that's how it happened that Corman, in 1987, paid      $300,000 for a 20-mile line in Kentucky, the first of eight      short lines, covering about 620 miles, he picked up.      Naturally, the engines on these lines are red. On the profit      side, though, the short lines began to deliver very black      profits, becoming Rick's biggest moneymakers.       Then came the cancer. It revealed itself in the spring of      2001 in Amsterdam, where Corman, generous to others all his      life, had taken a group of friends and relatives to see the      blooming of the tulips. He was running in a park one day,      when another runner passed him doing 5\1/2\-minute miles.      Corman immediately tried to match the pace. Within minutes he      was brought to his knees by excruciating pain in his back.       Managing to get home to Kentucky, he got two doctors on the      case. One, his family internist, Terrance Furlow, ordered a      blood test and a bone biopsy that strongly indicated multiple      myeloma. The other doctor was Kathleen Martin, a tall,      striking blond whom Corman had dated until they had recently      broken up in a friendly way. Corman knew the woman he calls      ``Kathy-leen'' to be a dedicated patient advocate. ``There's      no dam big enough if she's the beaver,'' he says, speaking      Kentucky. He wanted her at his side as he dealt with his      illness, and that's where she has been for nearly 10 years.       Dr. Furlow sent the two of them to the Mayo Clinic for a      bone marrow biopsy and a confirming diagnosis. There, Dr.      Stephen Ansell, a hematologist, told Rick soberly, ``It is      myeloma. It's not curable, but it's treatable.''       Rick said: ``Well, there are worse cancers than this,      right?'' Neither Ansell nor Martin spoke. ``It seemed like a      year passed,'' Corman recalls, ``until finally both came up      with pancreatic cancer.'' He said at least it was good to      know there was a worse one. But by that time he was breaking      up with laughter at their halting answer--and so were the      doctors. ``It's a gift of Rick's,'' says Martin. ``He gets      people to laughing no matter what.''       Dr. Ansell said that without treatment Rick might have a      year to live. Rick instantly became a fan of treatment. Dr.      Ansell allowed that a bone marrow transplant, which he      suggested be done at Mayo, would reset the clock and possibly      give Rick three years. The doctor added that Rick should      focus on spending his money and enjoying life. ``The      message,'' says Rick, ``was that my life was going to be      short.''       After that meeting, Corman and Martin, in effect, shopped      for time, hoping to find a specialist who might visualize a      better outcome. At the University of Arkansas for Medical      Sciences, a center of myeloma research, doctors said the      right treatment could give Corman seven years. And then he      and Martin went to Boston's Dana-Farber, whose myeloma chief,      Dr. Kenneth Anderson, looked down at Corman's file and said:      ``I see you're 45, Rick. I'm surprised that you'd be      satisfied dying at age 52. If you come here, we will do      everything possible to see that you grow old gracefully and      die of something other than multiple myeloma.''       And thus was struck a memorable bargain, for both sides.      Against terrible odds, Corman has survived; Dana-Farber has      received millions for the R.J. Corman Multiple Myeloma      Research Fund, most of the money contributed by Rick, some by      friends of his. He told Dr. Anderson at the outset: ``Every      year you keep me alive, Santa Claus will visit you.'' Corman      proceeded to deliver Dana-Farber at least $250,000 each      December, usually in packs of $100 bills (though he has      stopped the cash deliveries because of security concerns)      that he ostentatiously plunks down before his doctor, Paul      Richardson, and other staff members. And Rick would say,      ``Don't forget that this won't be coming if I die.''       Dr. Richardson, 48 and internationally known for his work      on multiple myeloma, has done his part by cycling new and      improved drugs (some developed at Dana-Farber) into the oral      and intravenous ``cocktail'' that Corman takes. Dr.      Richardson says he and Dr. Anderson have ``kind of taken this      disease by the scruff of the neck and given it a damn good      shake.''       Richardson's affection for his patient has in the interim      grown so deep that he never runs out of praise for him. He      watched Rick give $12,000 to a cancer patient he didn't know      for a transplant that might otherwise have not been      performed. Every week Rick funds a group luncheon for Dana-     Farber's doctors, picking up the check because the      institute's rules won't let it pay. ``Rick is a profoundly      good man,'' says Richardson, finding him a remarkable mixture      of ``humbleness and--I don't say this lightly--greatness.''       Richardson does not talk, meanwhile, of a cure because      there isn't one. Richardson says, ``I hope--well, actually I      pray--that he can have another five to 10 years.'' Rick, not      much into religion, says simply of his prospects, ``If you      make it to tomorrow, you've done good.''       All of Corman's doctors agree that he has come this far by      keeping himself remarkably fit. In 2002, five months after      his first bone marrow transplant, Corman ran the Boston      Marathon to aid a cancer fundraiser. He still runs five      kilometers almost every day, but his illness has caused his      pace to slow, from maybe 19 minutes for the distance to 27.      The drugs he takes also have intermittently caused him      intense, neuropathic leg pain, which he sometimes can ease      only by elevating his legs above his heart. He often does      that in deep La-Z-Boy recliners at home, in a space once      called the living room and now christened the ``cancer      room.''       The discovery of his illness brought about large changes in      both Rick's business and personal life. Dr. Richardson asked      to see Rick frequently in Boston, which raised the threat of      commercial flights exposing him to germs. No problem: Rick (a      pilot himself) constructed a city-airport-size 5,600-foot      runway on his property. For transportation, he bought two      planes for $12 million, a Challenger and a Learjet, naturally      decking them out in his color. That move was automatic, even      though a dark paint like red increases operating costs--     absorbing heat, for example, and making the plane more      difficult to cool. That's a reason, folks, you do not see      many red planes.       Though turning his grounds into an airfield kept Rick busy,      he wasn't spared periods of great sadness and despair about      his illness. On one 2001 Friday night several months after it      flared, with his young kids away at their mother's, he phoned      Tammie Taylor, then the chief of one of his company's      divisions. Finding her at the office, he asked her to come      the short distance to his house. ``Why?'' she asked. ``Is      anything wrong?'' ``Please just come,'' he answered. When she      got there, he says, he was ``sitting there bawling.'' To her      anxious question, he said simply, ``I'm scared.'' Things      moved on after that in quite a remarkable way: Taylor stayed      that night, and she's been there ever since.       As a manager, Taylor wins Rick's ultimate accolade: ``She's      a go-getter'' (a description that, were it in a thesaurus,      would be in the vicinity of ``industrious''). But she is the      first to say that the secret of R.J. Corman's success is,      simply, Rick. She spends her days, in fact, trying to hire      people who will bring his kind of ``passion and pride'' to      their work.       And what is to happen when Rick--this inspirer and      motivator--is not there to keep that culture going? The legal      answer is that a trust will take over ownership of the      company. It will exist for a near-unimaginable 200 years and      is likely to have Dana-Farber as its ultimate beneficiary. A      handful of trustees will run it--people that Rick knows well      and indeed trusts--and they will be paid handsomely, probably      dividing one-fifth of the company's pretax profits. That      would be big money. But Rick expects the trustees (who could      include some of his children) to devote all their might to      preserving and building the company. And if they do that, the      price will seem cheap to him. All the while, Rick says,      Tammie Taylor and her staff will run the company and can be      expected to do it very well.       He does not rule out the possibility that eventually one or      more of his children will move into management, though at the      moment the three oldest have careers that are not headed in      that direction. Amy, 33, is a marketing analyst at a      Lexington uniform company, Galls; Richard Jay, 30, is an      associate dean at Lenoir Community College in North Carolina;      Jay Richard, 24, drives a tractor-trailer for R.J. Corman.      The other two children are Ashley, 22 (called by her first      name, Shawna, by everybody but Rick), and April, 21. Both,      Rick thinks, might have the ``capacity'' for running a      business. Each, though, has entertained the thought of      becoming a doctor. Ashley is currently a clinical research      coordinator at Dana-Farber and a student of her father's      disease. April is a junior at Transylvania University in      Lexington.       Dale Hawk, formerly a CSX (CSX) executive and today an R.J.      Corman director, says Rick's kids will undoubtedly have to      earn their way into management if that's where they'd like to      be. Right now, he says, the company is well established and      will endure if Rick dies. But he also acknowledges that it      will miss Rick's flair and the personal relationships that he      has in the railroad industry. ``The company will go on,'' he      says, ``but it will never be the same without Rick.''       After my long Nicholasville interview with Rick, I saw him      three times more. In November, I traveled with him and Dr.      Martin to     Dana-Farber. As we waited in a corridor, every doctor who      passed greeted the two warmly. One doctor, a Kentuckian      himself, joked with Rick about the next bone marrow      transplant he might need, saying it would undoubtedly be easy      to find a donor of cells ``because we know that all      Kentuckians are related.'' (``Oooh, be careful,'' said Rick.      ``Mrs. Loomis, here--she's from the press.'')       I next saw Corman twice in New York City. On a Monday he      unexpectedly dropped by my office to introduce me to the      University of Kentucky's famous basketball coach, John      Calipari. The two men had flown to New York for the day to      shop at Brioni, the upscale tailoring establishment that      makes Rick's flamboyant, double-vent red sports jackets. I      thanked Calipari for a favor he'd done me. There had been a      time, early on, when Rick thought he might not cooperate with      this article. But friends had talked him into it, among them      Calipari, who argued, ``Somebody reading it might be      inspired.''       In my other New York visit with Rick, he came to breakfast      at my office cafeteria in December so I could do a little      wind-up reporting. Heads turned to marvel at his jacket as we      stood waiting for our bacon and eggs. He was in Manhattan to      take 130 people to the Radio City Christmas show and then to      dinner at Del Frisco's, an expensive restaurant nearby.       On that Friday morning he had the look of invincibility      that appears to have characterized him all his life, but that      sometimes, as you've read, is stripped away by sadness. Even      so, Rick Corman had made it to that December day and to the      others that passed before this story closed some weeks later.      He'd ``done good,'' by his way of reckoning. You can't help      but feel that he will keep on beating the odds. And, when his      luck runs out, the word will go up on the company website,      and the world will have lost some of its style.                          ____________________
