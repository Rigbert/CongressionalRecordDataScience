Mr. Chairman, the gentleman is not debating the point of order, and so I insist on the point of order.  The Acting CHAIR. The Chair is prepared to rule.  The Chair finds that this amendment includes language imparting direction to transfer funds. The amendment therefore constitutes legislation in violation of clause 2 of rule XXI.  The point of order is sustained, and the amendment is not in order.  The Clerk will read.  The Clerk read as follows:                    Afghanistan Security Forces Fund                     (including transfer of funds)       For the ``Afghanistan Security Forces Fund'',      $12,800,000,000, to remain available until September 30,      2013: Provided, That such funds shall be available to the      Secretary of Defense, notwithstanding any other provision of      law, for the purpose of allowing the Commander, Combined      Security Transition Command--Afghanistan, or the Secretary's      designee, to provide assistance, with the concurrence of the      Secretary of State, to the security forces of Afghanistan,      including the provision of equipment, supplies, services,      training, facility and infrastructure repair, renovation, and      construction, and funding: Provided further, That the      authority to provide assistance under this heading is in      addition to any other authority to provide assistance to      foreign nations:  Provided further, That up to $15,000,000 of      these funds may be available for coalition police trainer      life support costs: Provided further, That contributions of      funds for the purposes provided herein from any person,      foreign government, or international organization may be      credited to this Fund and used for such purposes: Provided      further, That the Secretary of Defense shall notify the      congressional defense committees in writing upon the receipt      and upon the obligation of any contribution, delineating the      sources and amounts of the funds received and the specific      use of such contributions: Provided further, That the      Secretary of Defense shall, not fewer than 15 days prior to      obligating from this appropriation account, notify the      congressional defense committees in writing of the details of      any such obligation: Provided further, That the Secretary of      Defense shall notify the congressional defense committees of      any proposed new projects or transfer of funds between budget      sub-activity groups in excess of $20,000,000: Provided      further, That each amount in this paragraph is designated as      being for the global war on terrorism pursuant to section 301      of H.
