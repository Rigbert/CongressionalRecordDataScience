 I ask the Senator from California this: We had a big debate about welfare reform and welfare ``Cadillacs.'' We are talking about welfare ``tankers'' here--$11 million--or $66 million going to these major oil companies. I say to the Senator from California, how many times have we done this? How many times have we postponed this decision by the Department of the Interior to give to the taxpayers of this country the fair share they are entitled to for these oil companies to use our lands--the lands of people who live in Illinois, California, Idaho, and Texas--to drill oil. How many times has the industry come in and, with an amendment similar to the one before us, tried to stop this recalculation?
