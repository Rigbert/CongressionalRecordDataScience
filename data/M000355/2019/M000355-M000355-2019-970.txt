 We are currently considering Stephen Dickson, of Georgia, to lead the Federal Aviation Administration. After him, we will turn our attention to two district court nominees. Wendy Williams Berger is the President's choice for the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida. She is a two-time graduate of Florida State University, with nearly three decades of courtroom experience, half of which has come on the bench.  Brian Buescher has been tapped for a vacancy in the District of Nebraska, where he has spent nearly two decades practicing law. Throughout his career, he has gained expertise in a wide array of legal areas and has earned admiration within the Nebraska legal community and beyond.  Those who know Mr. Buescher praise his ``intelligence, integrity, professionalism, attentiveness, [and] character.'' The mayor of Omaha, where he has spent his entire legal career said: ``Mr. Buescher would be an impartial judge capable of setting aside personal opinion.''  Despite his objective qualifications and all this praise, our Senate Democratic colleagues were not satisfied. Here was the bombshell that offended some of our colleagues with respect to this nominee. Listen to this. The nominee is a practicing Catholic.  My goodness, imagine that--in the United States of America, a person of faith, serving in government. Really?  In particular, some of our Democratic colleagues raked him over the coals in committee for his membership in the Knights of Columbus. It is shocking that a nominee for Federal district court would be a member of the Knights of Columbus.  Of course, we all know the Knights--a noted worldwide ``extremist sect'' of Catholics, which is about 2 million men strong, known among other things for their love of their Catholic faith, their unparalleled commitment to charitable work, and for hosting barbecues and pancake breakfasts.  Outrageous. I can't believe I need to repeat it in the U.S. Capitol, but there is nothing about living out one's faith that is disqualifying for public service--nothing. To the contrary, what the Constitution does forbid is imposing any kind of religious test for public office.  It is the Democrats' opposition to this nominee's faith, not his faith itself, that rubs against the grain of our Constitution. Fortunately, this tactic didn't fly. Our colleagues on the Judiciary Committee saw this tactic for what it is and voted to report Mr. Buescher favorably to the floor. I will be proud to vote to confirm him later today.                          ____________________
