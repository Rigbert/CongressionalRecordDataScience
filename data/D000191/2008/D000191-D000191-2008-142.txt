Mr. Doug Macdonald deserves this honor. Oregonians are grateful for his contributions to the wise and sustainable use of our Nation's forests.  Doug Macdonald's personal and professional career accomplishments are as diverseas they are noteworthy. His loyal service and sacrifices for over three decades working in the communities of Oregon are a testament to all who use and appreciate our public lands. I would like to take a moment to reflect upon Doug's career as he makes the transition to life beyond Government service.  Born in Yakima, Washington, Doug learned to speak Japanese before he spoke English because he spent time in Japan as a toddler while his father was serving in the Armed Forces. His family then moved to upstate New York where Doug gained appreciation for the outdoors at their home near the Catskill Mountains. After high school, Doug started college in Boston but the lure of the Pacific Northwest pulled him back to where he calls home.  Doug joined the Army National Guard where he served his country for 6 years. He graduated with a civil engineering degree from the University of Washington and in 1975 started his Forest Service career as a civil engineer trainee on the Willamette National Forest.  Doug's career in the Pacific Northwest Region of the Forest Service included positions in the regional office in Portland, Oregon, and on the Malheur National Forest in John Day, Oregon. In 1986, Doug returned to the Willamette National Forest as the Assistant Forest Engineer and eventually was promoted to the Forest Engineer. In the 1990s, Doug was part of an international team that traveled to Indonesia for 3 or 4 weeks per year to train Indonesian foresters to design and build environmentally sensitive roads. He retires as the Zone Engineer for the Willamette, Siuslaw, and Mt. Hood National Forests. as well as the Columbia River Gorge Scenic Area.  Early in his career, Doug was instrumental in developing and implementing new forest road designs that were efficient, cost effective, and more environmentally sensitive. Doug also played a significant leadership role in bringing together research science and engineering to improve hydrologic function and fish passage on forest roads and culverts. In the last several years, Doug has worked tirelessly to enhance the facilities of the Forest Service. He has forged new partnerships and inspired innovation and creativity to reduce costs and improve the vital facilities for the entire Pacific Northwest Region. In my own district, Doug was responsible for initiating a partnership to build an interagency center to house the new offices for the Forest Service, the BLM, and the Oregon Military Department. His efforts helped save tax payers millions of dollars in facilities costs.  Among Doug's numerous and exemplary accomplishments, none are more evident than the relationships he has built and his commitment to others that he tirelessly displays. Doug has touched so many people both in and outside the Forest Service. His caring for people has resulted in immeasurable benefits to the people of Oregon and our Nation.  Madam Speaker, it is with great honor for me to present these credentials of Doug Macdonald to the House of Representatives today. It is clear through all of his accomplishments that he has dedicated himself to furthering the benefits we enjoy on public lands. All of his actions reflect a true leader with a sense of purpose, commitment, and conscience.  As Doug departs from public service, I ask my colleagues to join me in delivering an appreciative tribute from a grateful nation, and best wishes to him and his family for a productive and rewarding retirement.                          ____________________
