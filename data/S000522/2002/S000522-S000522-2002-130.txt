Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. And first I want to thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Cox) for his very eloquent remarks and for his sponsorship of this very important and, I think, very timely recognition of the great work that Bob Hope has done.  Mr. Speaker, Bob Hope is famous for entertaining all Americans, but we all know his most significant contribution to the United States has been in improving the morale of members of our armed forces by entertaining our troops overseas, especially during the holidays.  Leslie Townes, also known as Bob Hope, was born in Eltham, England on May 29, 1903. In 1907, he moved to Cleveland, Ohio, and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1920. During World War II, Bob Hope attempted to enlist in the armed forces, so he could serve his adopted country, but was informed that his greatest service would be as a civilian entertainer for the troops.                              {time}  1900  Whether at war or at peace, from World War II through the Persian Gulf War, Bob Hope committed himself for nearly 60 years to boosting the morale of the U.S. Armed Forces. It began in1941 when Mr. Hope and a group of performers went to March Field in California to do a radio show for the troops in training there. During World War II, his weekly radio show was broadcast from Armed Forces installations around the United States and at U.S. bases overseas. During this period he developed a rapport that led the United Service Organization, USO, to ask him to lead 45 tours in more than 40 countries to entertain American servicemen and women. His spirit of selflessness was especially notable during his annual Christmas specials which began in 1948 and kept him on the road during this Christian holiday for more than 20 years in a row. He has entertained, as the gentleman from California (Mr. Cox) pointed out, an estimated 10 million American GIs.  Mr. Speaker, here is a quote from a lonely sailor in France who had received a letter and some photos from a recent Bob Hope visit during World War II. His words portray the feelings of so many Americans fighting at that time:  ``Your programs are the kind that make us think of home but they also make us feel that home is much closer than it really is. It is people like you and Mr. Colona and Miss Langford besides the one we love back home that makes it worth winning this war and believe me we are going to do it. I want to say thanks from the bottom of my heart for all the trouble you have gone through to make this strange sailor have a pleasant time for being so far away from home.''  Mr. Speaker, Bob Hope made over 700 television appearances. As we all know, he is a best-selling author, he starred in 60 motion pictures, and the ``Guinness Book of Records'' cites him as the most honored entertainer in the world. Mr. Hope has received more than 50 honorary doctorates and is the recipient of innumerable awards, including prestigious honors from the major veterans service organizations. His humanitarian work, Mr. Speaker, was recognized, and fittingly, with the Congressional Gold Medal.  Public Law 105-67, Mr. Speaker, bestowed on Mr. Hope status as an honorary veteran of the United States Armed Forces. As we know, he resides in California with his bride of 68 years, Delores.  Mr. Hope, what an appropriate name for all that he has done to boost the morale of American fighting men and women. We say to him, ``Thanks for the memories.''  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
