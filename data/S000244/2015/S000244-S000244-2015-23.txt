 Madam Speaker, I rise today in favor of H.R. 350, the Human Trafficking Prevention, Intervention, and Recovery Act of 2015 introduced by Representative Kristi Noem of South Dakota.  As we have heard on the floor repeatedly this week, human trafficking generally and child sex trafficking specifically is a horrible crime that sadly exists in all corners of our country. Studies suggest that over 290,000 youth are at risk of human trafficking in the United States, with children as young as 12 years old becoming victims of commercial sexual abuse. While Federal, State, and local law enforcement have made great strides to combat and eradicate human trafficking, there remains work to be done on this front.  As in all things, to effectively combat human trafficking, we must first fully understand the problem. H.R. 350 requires the existing Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking to survey and catalogue the methods being employed by our Federal and State governments to deter individuals from committing trafficking offenses and to report on best practices that can improve the response. The bill also directs the Government Accountability Office to report on Federal and State efforts to fight trafficking, including the grant programs aimed at assisting victims and fighting this crime.  Finally, in order to help young victims move on from their trauma, H.R. 350 clarifies that existing Federal trafficking grants may be used for programs that provide housing for victims of sex trafficking. Currently, 29 States do not have shelter beds dedicated to the victims of sex trafficking. This provision would help address that travesty.  Similar legislation was passed in the House last Congress but was not enacted into law.  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle here and on the other side of the Capitol to pass this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                         House of Representatives,                                 Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                 Washington, DC, January 26, 2015.     Hon. Bob Goodlatte,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, Rayburn House Office          Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for consulting with the      Committee on Foreign Affairs regarding H.R. 350, the Human      Trafficking Prevention, Intervention, and Recovery Act of      2015. As a result of those consultations, I agree that the      Foreign Affairs Committee may be discharged from further      consideration of that bill, so that it may proceed      expeditiously to the House floor.       I am writing to confirm our mutual understanding that, by      forgoing consideration of H.R. 350, the Foreign Affairs      Committee does not waive jurisdiction over the subject matter      contained in this, or any other, legislation. Our Committee      also reserves the right to seek an appropriate number of      conferees to any House-Senate conference involving this bill,      and would appreciate your support for any such request.       I ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter      be included in the Congressional Record during floor      consideration of H.R. 350.           Sincerely,                                                  Edward R. Royce,     Chairman.                                  ____                                         House of Representatives,                                   Committee on the Judiciary,                                 Washington, DC, January 26, 2015.     Hon. Ed Royce,     Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs, Rayburn House Office          Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Royce, Thank you for your letter regarding      H.R. 350, the ``Human Trafficking Prevention, Intervention,      and Recovery Act of 2015.'' As you noted, the Committee on      Foreign Affairs was granted an additional referral of the      bill.       I am most appreciative of your decision to discharge the      Committee on Foreign Affairs from further consideration of      H.R. 350 so that it could proceed expeditiously to the House      floor. I acknowledge that although you waived formal      consideration of the bill, the Committee on the Foreign      Affairs is in no way waiving its jurisdiction over the      subject matter contained in those provisions of the bill that      fall within your rule X jurisdiction. I would support your      effort to seek appointment of an appropriate number of      conferees on any House-Senate conference involving this      legislation.       I will include a copy of our letters in the Congressional      Record during consideration of H.R. 350.           Sincerely,                                                    Bob Goodlatte,                                                         Chairman.
