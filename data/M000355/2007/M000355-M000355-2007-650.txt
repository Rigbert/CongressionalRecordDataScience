 President, let me echo the remarks of my friend, the majority leader. We will vote on the DeMint amendment 1 hour from now. I am pleased to hear that we will be moving forward on a number of amendments to be offered on this side of the aisle.  There are 17 pending amendments to the substitute and more than 80 additional amendments filed at the desk.We need to start disposing of them in an expedited fashion if we are to move on to passage of the bill next week. I look forward to working with the majority leader toward that end.                          ____________________
