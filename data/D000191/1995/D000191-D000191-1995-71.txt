Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me.  Mr. Chairman, we have been told that this is a success that has bolstered the dollar. Actually, if you remember, the dollar reached record lows versus the German mark and the Japanese yen about a month and a half ago, and many of the pundits said that there were three reasons. First was NAFTA, second was our U.S. deficit, and third was our international deficit. But they emphasized NAFTA. They said, we have inextricably, through the bailout, linked the U.S. dollar to the peso, we have linked our currency to the currency controlled in secret by an oligarchy, one that has been known to profit and artificially benefit billionaires in its own country and oppress its own people. The standard of living of the people of Mexico has dropped 40 percent since December.  This is not a success. It is simple. If you are against the Mexican bailout, vote yes on Sanders. If you want to implicitly or explicitly take the only opportunity you will be offered this year to vote on this, if you want to endorse the bailout, vote no.
