 President, I rise today to introduce legislation that will help stop criminals from exploiting the Internet to illegally sell prescription drugs. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by Senator Sessions, Senator Schumer, and Senator Cornyn.  I first became concerned about the issue of illegitimate online pharmacies in 2001, when one of my constituents, high school student Ryan Haight, died from an overdose of the controlled substance Vicodin. He had purchased the Vicodin from a rogue online pharmacy after simply filling out an online questionnaire in which he described himself as a 25-year-old male suffering from chronic back pain. The doctor prescribing the drug never met or personally examined Ryan.  Ryan's death was a terrible tragedy. He was a remarkable young man, an honors student and an athlete. He looked forward to going to college. Instead, his life was cut short.  In response, I introduced legislation, beginning in 2004, to better regulatethe online sale of prescription drugs that are controlled substances.  In 2008, the Ryan Haight Online Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act, Ryan Haight Act, was enacted into law, and it became effective in April 2009. Senator Sessions was the lead cosponsor on that legislation.  The Ryan Haight Act makes it a violation of the Controlled Substances Act to dispense a prescription for a controlled substance by means of the Internet without a practitioner having conducted at least one in-person medical evaluation of the purchaser. The act also requires online pharmacies to register with the Drug Enforcement Administration, DEA, and comply with DEA regulations.  The Ryan Haight Act has helped to prevent illegitimate online sales of prescribed controlled substances. However, illegitimate online sellers continue to sell other types of prescription drugs, and stronger laws are needed to stop them.  The sale of prescription drugs online by web sites acting unlawfully is a dangerous and widespread problem. The National Association of Boards of Pharmacy and other non-profit organizations that monitor the Internet have consistently found that about 96 percent of all Internet pharmacies don't require a prescription, aren't appropriately licensed, and sell unregulated drugs.  Theses illegitimate online pharmacies continue to cause serious harm. The National Association of Boards of Pharmacy reports that from the start of its Internet Drug Outlet Identification Program in April 2008, it has received 509 customer inquiries about online prescription drug sellers, and 21 of those customers have reported injuries. Some of these injuries were very serious leading to hospitalization, with customers suffering worsening symptoms caused by the ailment the medications were intended to treat, as well as severe side effects.  The easy accessibility of prescription drugs through illegitimate online drug sellers also contributes to a growing prescription drug abuse problem. A study published in the May 2011 edition of the Journal of Health Affairs suggests that the growth in high-speed Internet access has fueled prescription drug abuse. Conducted by investigators from Massachusetts General Hospital and the University of Southern California, the study found that, over a 7-year period, States with the greatest expansion in high-speed Internet access also had the largest increase in admissions for treatment of prescription drug abuse.  We should be particularly concerned about this problem when it comes to young people, who are frequently online unsupervised and vulnerable to rogue drug sellers on the Internet.  Not surprisingly, there is also a significant amount of fraud associated with illegitimate online drug sellers. Some of these websites simply take money without providing anything in return.  Web sites that dispense counterfeit drugs are an even more dangerous problem. These counterfeit drugs are frequently manufactured in unsanitary conditions and may contain contaminated ingredients, or the wrong ingredients. A recent CBS News story found that counterfeit drugs can contain paint, floor wax, and boric acid. So, instead of the appropriate medicine needed for their health problem, online consumers are receiving substances that may harm or even kill them.  The legislation I am introducing today will address these problems, and help stop illegitimate online drug sellers.  There are two main components to the legislation. First, it amends the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act to add a definition of ``valid prescription,'' requiring at least one in-person medical evaluation of the patient. This is the same approach taken in the Ryan Haight Act with prescription drugs that are controlled substances. It will prevent illegitimate online pharmacies from selling drugs over the Internet with sham prescriptions.  The second critical element is the establishment, by the Food and Drug Administration, of a registry of legitimate online pharmacy websites. This will protect consumers who will know that they are dealing with lawful online pharmacies and help law enforcement crack down on the illegitimate websites.  The exploitation of the Internet by rogue online drug sellers continues to be a dangerous and deadly problem and we should not wait for more lives to be lost or ruined before we act.  Consumers deserve access to safe and legitimate online pharmacies and protection from illegitimate websites that sell counterfeit or otherwise illegitimate medication, and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2002       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Online Pharmacy Safety      Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds that--       (1) consumers in the United States are targeted by      organized international crime networks that use Internet      websites to sell illegal and often dangerous drugs under the      guise of being legitimate online pharmacies;       (2) illegal online drug sellers offer products that do not      meet the safety standards established by United States laws,      and recent reports from the National Association of Boards of      Pharmacy show that 92 to 95 percent of Internet websites      offering to sell prescription medications online are      illegitimate and operate in clear violation of United States      laws enacted to protect patients;       (3) criminals are attracted to the high profit margin of      business through illegitimate online drug sales, as      counterfeit drug sales alone are estimated to have generated      $75,000,000,000 in 2010, an increase of 92 percent from 2005;       (4) the World Health Organization estimates that 50 percent      of the prescription medicines sold online by Internet      websites that hide their physical address are counterfeit;       (5) research by The Partnership at Drugfree.org found that      1 in 6 consumers in the United States, a total of about      36,000,000 Americans, has bought or currently buys      prescription medication online without a valid prescription;       (6) the prevalence of illegal online drug sellers, and      their sale of counterfeit or otherwise illegitimate      medicines, is a growing public health threat;       (7) people have been seriously injured or killed by      products sold by illegal online drug sellers;       (8) the accessibility of controlled substances and other      drugs without a valid prescription by illegal online drug      sellers contributes to a growing prescription drug abuse      problem in the United States that is endangering teenagers      and public health;       (9) the anonymous and unregulated nature of the Internet      contributes to the counterfeit drug trade and enables      counterfeit medicines to reach United States consumers      through illegitimate online drug sellers posing as legitimate      pharmacies;       (10) counterfeit drugs that are sold through illegal online      drug sellers are manufactured by criminals who deliberately      and fraudulently misrepresent the product in order to trick      consumers into thinking they are purchasing a legitimate and      safe medicine;       (11) these counterfeit drugs are frequently manufactured in      unsanitary conditions and may contain the wrong ingredients,      lack active ingredients, have insufficient or contaminated      active ingredients, or contain too many active ingredients;       (12) counterfeit drugs obtained from illegal online drug      sellers have been found to contain harmful ingredients      including arsenic, boric acid, brick dust, cement powder,      chalk dust, floor polish, leaded road paint, nickel, shoe      polish, and talcum powder;       (13) United States citizens deserve access to safe and      legitimate online pharmacies and protection from illegal      Internet websites that sell counterfeit or otherwise      illegitimate medication;       (14) while the Ryan Haight Online Pharmacy Consumer      Protection Act of 2008 (Public Law 110-425) has helped to      prevent illegitimate online sales of prescribed controlled      substances, illegal online sellers continue to sell other      types of prescription drugs and stronger laws are needed to      stop them; and       (15) greater education and awareness regarding illegal      online drug sellers will help to protect the United States      drug supply chain from infiltration by unregulated and      counterfeit products.     SEC. 3. VALID PRESCRIPTIONS.       Section 503(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act      (21 U.S.C. 353(b)) is amended--       (1) in paragraph (1), in the matter following subparagraph      (B), by striking ``shall be dispensed'' and all that follows      through ``the pharmacist.'' and inserting the following:      ``shall be dispensed only pursuant to a valid prescription      that is (i) a written prescription of a practitioner licensed      by law to administer such drug; (ii) an oral prescription of      such practitioner which is reduced promptly to writing by the      pharmacist; (iii) an electronic prescription issued by a      practitioner licensed by law to administer such     drug; or (iv) the refill of any such written, oral, or      electronic prescription if such refilling is authorized by      the prescriber either in the original prescription,      electronic prescription, or by oral order which is reduced      promptly to writing by the pharmacist.''; and       (2) by adding at the end the following:       ``(6) In this paragraph:       ``(A) The term `valid prescription' means a prescription      that is issued for a legitimate medical purpose in the usual      course of professional practice by--       ``(i) a licensed practitioner who has conducted at least 1      in-person medical evaluation of the patient, subject to      paragraph (7);       ``(ii) a covering practitioner; or       ``(iii) a practitioner engaged in the practice of      telemedicine.       ``(B)(i) The term `in-person medical evaluation' means a      medical evaluation that is conducted with the patient in the      physical presence of the practitioner, without regard to      whether portions of the evaluation are conducted by other      health professionals.       ``(ii) Nothing in clause (i) shall be construed to imply      that 1 in-person medical evaluation demonstrates that a      prescription has been issued for a legitimate medical purpose      within the usual course of professional practice.       ``(C) The term `covering practitioner' means, with respect      to a patient, a licensed practitioner who conducts a medical      evaluation (other than an in-person medical evaluation) at      the request of a licensed practitioner who--       ``(i) has conducted at least 1 in-person medical evaluation      of the patient or an evaluation of the patient through the      practice of telemedicine, within the previous 24 months; and       ``(ii) is temporarily unavailable to conduct the evaluation      of the patient.       ``(D) The term `practice of telemedicine' has the meaning      given that term in section 102 of the Controlled Substances      Act.       ``(7) For purposes of paragraph (6), an in-person medical      evaluation of the patient is not required if--       ``(A) the prescribing practitioner is issuing a      prescription or dispensing a legend drug in accordance with      the Expedited Partner Therapy in the Management of Sexually      Transmitted Diseases guidance document issued by the Centers      for Disease Control and Prevention; or       ``(B) the prescription, administration, or dispensing is      through a public health clinic or other distribution      mechanism approved by the State health authority in order to      prevent, mitigate, or treat a pandemic illness, infectious      disease outbreak, or intentional or accidental release of a      biological, chemical, or radiological agent.       ``(8) The Secretary may by regulation establish exceptions      to the requirements described in paragraph (6) with respect      to a drug, based on criteria established by the Secretary.''.
