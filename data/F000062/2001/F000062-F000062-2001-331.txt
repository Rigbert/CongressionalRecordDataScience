 President. I rise, along with Senators Hutchinson of Texas, Senator Kyl of Arizona, and Senator Bingaman of New Mexico, to introduce the Southwest Border Judgeship Act of 2001.  This legislation would enact the United States Judicial Conference recommendation of nine permanent and nine temporary judgeships for the five Southwestern border districts of Southern California, Arizona, New Mexico, Western Texas, and Southern Texas.
