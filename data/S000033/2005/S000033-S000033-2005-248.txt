 Speaker, I am proud to rise in praise of the White River Junction Veterans Administration Medical Center, which has received the Robert W. Carey Trophy Award for Organizational Excellence. This award, named after a former Secretary of Veterans Affairs, was presented to recognize the truly excellent care that the White River VA Center provides to veterans in Vermont and the Connecticut River Valley. This award is the highest quality award the Department of Veterans Affairs can bestow.  In the two previous years, the White River VA Center was recognized for excellence for the quality of its care by winning back-to-back Carey Achievement Awards. This year it took the top award in the nation.  Under the leadership of Gary De Gasta, the staff at the center--doctors, nurses, health professionals, administrative support--are committed to providing the very best in health care. They are attentive to veterans and their needs; they offer state-of-the art medical care; they honor the service of the brave men and women who answered, and answer, our nation's call decade after decade.  I am very proud of the excellent work done by those who work at the White River VA Center. They are deserving of this highest of commendations, and we in Vermont are very proud of them. We are equally proud that this high level of performance helps to deliver the very best in health care to our veterans.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Page E1]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                DELIVERING HIGH-QUALITY CARE TO VETERANS                                 ______                                                           HON.
