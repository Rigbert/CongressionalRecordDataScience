Glenn Poshard for all he has done for Southern Illinois University and for his 40 years of public service to Illinois.  After more than 7 years as president of Southern Illinois University, Dr. Poshard will be retiring next year. Under Dr. Poshard's leadership, Southern Illinois University has been able to keep tuition costs low and the university's finances sound, despite the financial problems that have plagued the State.  Throughout his career, Dr. Poshard worked for the people of southern Illinois. He was born in Herald, IL, and graduated from Carmi Township High School. He left Illinois to serve his country in the U.S. Army in Korea,where he received a commendation for outstanding service.  Following his military service, Dr. Poshard returned to Illinois and used the G.I. bill to earn a bachelor's degree in secondary education, a master's degree in health education, and a Ph.D. in higher education administration. He received all three degrees from Southern Illinois University at Carbondale.  Appointed to the Illinois State Senate in 1984, Dr. Poshard held the seat until the people of the 22nd Congressional District sent him to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1989. During his 10 years in Congress, Dr. Poshard was a strong proponent of campaign finance reform. When he ran for Governor in 1998, he limited individual donations to his campaign and refused to accept contributions from political action committees.  Following his tenure in Congress, Dr. Poshard and his wife Jo founded the Poshard Foundation for Abused Children. For the last 14 years, the Poshard Foundation has helped children who have been victims of abuse, abandonment, or neglect in southern Illinois.  After a 40-year affiliation with the university, Dr. Poshard is leaving his beloved SIU in good shape. At SIU, Dr. Poshard has been a student, a student worker, a civil service worker, an adjunct professor, vice chancellor for administration, and now as he retires--the second longest serving president in the history of the Southern Illinois University system, an experience he calls ``the greatest honor of my life.''  I congratulate Glenn on his distinguished career and thank him for dedicating his life to public service. I wish him and his family all the best.                          ____________________
