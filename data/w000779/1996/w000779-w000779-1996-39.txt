I want the majority leader, Senator Lott, to understand that I have no interest in prolonging this. I do want to protect the rights of these vulnerable patients and get that done today. But I have no desire to prolong this.  Mr. President, we are going to continue, as the majority leader requested,to work to try to fashion something that is acceptable. We thought we had something a minute ago, but, apparently, we have some more work to do.  With that, I withdraw my reservation. I appreciate the majority leader trying to help us by setting that aside.
