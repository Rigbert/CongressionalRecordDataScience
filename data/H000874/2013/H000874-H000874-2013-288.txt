 Mr. Speaker, the recognition for the victims of this terrible tragedy that befell our whole country on September 15, 1963, is absolutely appropriate, and it is an opportunity for us to say once again the respect we have for these young girls, the respect we have for their families. I say ``our whole country'' because a wound opened in the soul of America that day from a heinous act of racism and terror.  Those who set a bomb inside the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church that Sunday did so because they believed in a Nation where not all are created equal, where not all are entitled to life and liberty. On that day, many Americans who had turned away with indifference could no longer look away.  Since that day, we have forcefully declared to future generations that America will not be that Nation that looks away. In America, we strive to protect our children from hurt and harm no matter the color of their skin, their faith, their national origin. We hold fast to the values and memory of these four little girls who were killed that day, not the twisted, warped, hateful ideals of their killers.
