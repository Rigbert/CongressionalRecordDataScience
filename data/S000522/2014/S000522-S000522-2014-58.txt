I thank my good friend for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Venezuelan Human Rights and Democracy Protection Act and to thank my distinguished colleague, Chairwoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, for her bold leadership in calling attention to the deplorable human rights situation in Venezuela and for creating this meaningful diplomatic tool to assist the Venezuelan people in resisting tyranny; first, the tyranny imposed by Hugo Chavez, and now that of his understudy in oppression, Nicolas Maduro.  At its core, this important initiative authorizes targeted sanctions to those who are responsible for violence and abuse, namely, members of the Maduro regime. The regime's silencing of democracy advocates, such as Leopoldo Lopez, is a violation of fundamental human rights and is an example of what makes this piece of legislation so fitting and so necessary.  I also support the bill's redirection of funds towards supporting civil society groups in Venezuela involved in promoting respect for democracy and fundamental freedoms, most importantly, the respect for the right to life, expression, and the right of religious liberty.  Indeed, I want to underscore the church's role as a voice independent of the State of Venezuela and how it has been unafraid to speak up on behalf of the oppressed and those protesting injustice. The Maduro regime has sought to silence the church, which remains a force independent of the government and a witness to the truth. The House of Representatives honors and deeply respects the key role that the church and faith-based civil society groups are playing in the fight for democracy and human rights in Venezuela.  As we all hope to see a free and democratic Venezuela, I strongly urge my colleagues to support the Ros-Lehtinen legislation, H.R. 4587.
