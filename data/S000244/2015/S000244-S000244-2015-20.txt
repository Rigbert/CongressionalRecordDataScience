 Madam Speaker, this is another example of bipartisan cooperation in the House of Representatives. I do wish to commend the principal author of the bill, Mr. Paulsen from Minnesota, an original cosponsor; Ms. Moore from Wisconsin; and my colleague, the ranking member of the Crime Subcommittee, Ms. Jackson Lee of Texas.  We have all worked together. Hopefully, we can send this bill over to the other body, and they will promptly pass it.  With that, I yield back the balance of my time.
