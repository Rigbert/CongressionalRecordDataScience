 What I don't understand, on whatever time I have remaining, and I thank the Senator for her response--I do not understand why that standard, A, would require redundancy, to have two standards to be met--if the language was added by the Senator from Pennsylvania which says--which when read as a whole in the context of external events is ``unmistakably unambiguous and suggestive of no plausible meaning other than an exhortation to vote for or against a specific candidate.''  Granted three other circuits or four other circuits ruled differently than the ninth circuit, but it seems to me the most damaging decision--the most damaging thing that has happened to the electoral process has been Buckley. The single most damaging thing that has occurred in our effort to clean up the glut of money and the hemorrhaging of influence in the electoral process has been the Buckley decision.  Things were going relatively well until that decision occurred and then the dam broke.  So I just want to say I think it is more appropriate to err on the side of being more specific and more inclusive, so that everyone understands that if it says ``vote against the Republican candidate'' but doesn't mention the Republican candidate for the Senate, that in fact it is covered. If it says vote against the person who said the following but doesn't name the person who said the following--if those ways are used to get around what is now the attempt of having a prohibition on such activity and the hemorrhaging of money, it seems to me that is well captured by the ninth circuit language.  I would rather run the risk of seeing that happen because this is the most damaging thing I have seen happen.
