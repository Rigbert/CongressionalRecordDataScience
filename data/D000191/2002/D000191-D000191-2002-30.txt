Speaker, we ran a trade deficit last year of $40 billion with the OPEC countries, the same countries that are fixing oil prices to stick it to American consumers and the remaining industry that we have in this country with extortionately high prices for fuel; and the Bush administration, they are all for free trade. They love the WTO, the secret tribunals. They want to get hormone-laced beef in from Europe, and other things that are in favor of corporate America; but guess what, they will not file a complaint with the WTO against OPEC for price fixing which is prohibited by the World Trade Organization and by GATT. Why not?  Well, maybe there is something to do with the oil industry that I am not quite aware of, but we are running a $40 billion trade deficit. These people are making no secret of the fact that they are restraining production to drive up the price, and that violates the WTO. It is an open and shut case. All the U.S. has to do is file it on behalf of its consumers. Consumers of the United States cannot file a case. Even those industries that are still left in this country cannot file a case. Only the Bush administration can file the case, and they are refusing to take on the OPEC countries and to file against them for price gouging of the American people.  Also on that list, kind of interestingly enough, we ran a $5.754 billion trade deficit with Iraq. The President is talking about invading Iraq, and we are running a $5.750 billion trade deficit with them. There is something weird about that.
