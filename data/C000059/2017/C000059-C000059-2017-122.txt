Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to Hilda Eisen, who passed away last month in California at the age of 100. Hilda owned and operated Norco Ranch for many years and she will be deeply missed.  Prior to immigrating to the United States, Hilda was born and raised in the Polish village of Izbica-Kujawska. During the Nazi occupation of Poland, Hilda was imprisoned in a ghetto before escaping to hide with Jewish Partisans in the forest. Tragically, Hilda's entire family was killed during the war. Her classmate and future husband, Harry, survived the Auschwitz concentration camp before reconnecting with Hilda. Together, they moved to America in 1948 where they would invest their savings to buy 100 chickens and start a business in California.  In the early days of the family business, Harry would ride around town on his bicycle selling eggs. In a short amount of time, the business outgrew its facility and the Eisens purchased a five-acre ranch in Norco, California to build a chicken farm. Over the years, the business would be known as Norco Ranch and grow into a major supplier of eggs to regional supermarket chains. The business had nearly 400 employees before it was sold to Land-O-Lakes in 2000. In 2012, Harry passed away at the age of 95. Before Harry's passing, the Eisens became involved with the Lodzer Organization of Southern California, a group of Holocaust survivors that supported Jewish charities locally and in Israel.  I had the distinct privilege of knowing Hilda for many years and I will deeply miss her. I extend my heartfelt condolences to the entire Eisen family, including her three daughters: Ruth Eisen, Mary Cramer, and Frances Miller. Although Hilda may be gone, her selfless dedication to our nation and the human spirit will long be remembered.                          ____________________
