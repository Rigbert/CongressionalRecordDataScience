 President, I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania for raising this issue. He is correct that my staff has been working with these organizations to obtain a fuller understanding of their transaction. We have learned that there is widespread abuse involving donations of patents and similar property. We made this provision effective May 7, 2003, so that abusive donations could not be rushed to completion if a later effective date was chosen.  We will continue our discussion with these organizations, and will objectively consider their concerns and whether further clarifications are appropriate as the bill moves to conference.
