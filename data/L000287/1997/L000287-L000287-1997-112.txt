Mr. Speaker, I am proud to announce that Gail A. Hoffman, a resident of Georgia's Fifth Congressional District, once again has been recognized for her work to improve communities in Atlanta. The National Crime Prevention Council and Ameritech have selected Ms. Hoffman to receive the Ameritech Award of Excellence in Crime Prevention. Ms. Hoffman's efforts to work with troubled communities and to bring individuals from all walks of life together makes her worthy of this acknowledgment.  Ms. Hoffman is the president and executive director of the Bridging the Gaps project. BTG is a nonprofit organization with a mission to empower ethnically diverse communities, public and private organizations, and law enforcement with the ability to improve the quality of life for Georgia's refugee and immigrant communities.  BTG was created in 1987, after Ms. Hoffman and then Detective M.C. Cox began convening meetings with the Multicultural Crime Task Force to help confront increasing gang activity in the Asian community. Through these meetings, Ms. Hoffman recognized that, because of cultural differences and communication barriers, non-English speaking people feared the police and felt unsafe because they believe that they are not protected from crime. As a result, Ms. Hoffman developed BTG and several related projects.  To help bridge the cultural divide, BTG created a computerized language bank that contains the names of bilingual officers and civilians interested in translating for public safety officers and the courts. Law enforcement training courses, including language specific classes and community education programs, have helped eliminate communication barriers and cultural stereotypes among non-English speaking people and public safety officers. BTG has published a ``Personal and Home Safety Orientation Manual for Refugees and Immigrants'' manual in 11 different languages.  BTG also has convened approximately 120 meetings between public safety officials and ethnic communities. The project provides homework assistance, peer counseling, and English as a second language assistance to Southeast Asian youth who are vulnerable to gang recruitment activities. BTG provides youth support groups in five counties to assist over 150 refugees make positive life choices.  States throughout the country are interested in creating similar programs like BTG. Thanks to Ms. Hoffman's problem solving and leadership, better communication and understanding exist among Atlanta's diverse ethnic groups.  I thank Ms. Hoffman for the hard work and dedication that allowed her to earn the Ameritech Awards of Excellence in Crime Prevention. I applaud the National Crime Prevention Council's dedication to helping individuals fight crime and build community. I appreciate Ameritech's commitment to supporting crime prevention initiatives. I ask my Colleagues to join me in congratulating Gail Hoffman and other hard-working individuals who make a difference in their communities.                          ____________________
