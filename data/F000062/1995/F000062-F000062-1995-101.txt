 President, I introduce the James Guelff Body Armor Act which would ban the mail order sale of bullet-proof vests to all individuals except law enforcement or public safety officers including paramedics. This legislation would require that the sale, transfer, and receipt of bullet-proof vests to anyone other than a law enforcement or public safety officers be conducted in person. This Act will make it more difficult for criminals to obtain this body armor which hinders law enforcement's ability to disarm and capture them.  For those who may not have heard the story of Officer James Guelff, I would like to provide just a few details about this tragic story.  On November 13, 1994, Officer James Guelff, a 10-year veteran of the San Francisco Police Department, was shot to death in a fire-fight by a heavily armed gunman wearing a bullet-proof vest on a major street corner in the middle of San Francisco.  Captain Richard Cairns was the commanding officer on the scene. Earlier this year, Captain Cairns participated in a roundtable discussion with me about the violence of assault weapons.  This is how Captain Cairns described the scene:       (The assailant) was firing as fast as you could pull the      trigger. He had semi-automatic assault weapons. He had an AK      223 rifle, with 30 round clips. He had a Steyr AUG which is a      sophisticated weapon, that he didn't get to. The officers      managed to keep him away from that. He had an uzi that      jammed, and he had two other semi-automatic pistols, and he      had thousands of rounds of ammunition that were in magazines.      And they were all in 30-round magazines already. He didn't      have to stop and load magazines. We ended up having 104      officers at the scene and he probably had more ammunition      than all 104 officers put together. And our officers did run      out of ammunition and they got more ammunition from other      responding units to try and keep him down. He was finally      killed by the SWAT teams that got there, who got above him .      . .   Captain Cairns continued:       He had a bullet proof vest, he had a Kevlar Helmet on and      he was hit by our officers twice in the helmet and six times      in the vest. He was finally killed by a shot that came      through his shoulder and into his chest and killed him.      Officer Guelff was hit several times and then killed with a      bullet through the left eye out of the assault rifle. Officer      Guelff fired off six of his rounds and when he went to re-     load--the suspect fired on him and killed him.  That story, simply put, is the reason this legislation is being put forward today.  California is not the only State to experience assailants--including heavily-armed gang members--who are wearing bullet proof vests and other body armor.  In Colorado, a man entered a grocery store where his wife worked, killed her, the store's manager, shot a bystander and then fatally shot a sheriff's sergeant before being physically tackled from behind and brought to the ground. Gunfire from law enforcement was to no avail because of his body armor.  In Long Island, NY, an armed high school student after being pushed out of his girlfriend's house by her father, shot 12 rounds into the house before a sheriff's investigator shot the young man in the shoulder, just avoiding his bullet-proof vest, killing him. The sheriff who shot the gunman commented after the incident that the bullet-proof vest the young man was wearing was `` * * * better than anything we've got now, other than what's in the SWAT locker.''  How are law enforcement officers to protect the public when the criminals have better body armor than do the police?  States and localities have already begun the effort to control the sale of body armor. The State of Michigan, for instance, has a law which increases the sentence of a criminal who wears body armor during the commission of a crime. And, in Baltimore, MD, the city council reacted quickly and severely to a billboard advertising the sale of bullet-proof vests as ``Life Insurance for the 90's'' with a 1-800 number printed at the bottom by introducing a city ordinance which bans the sale of bullet-proof vests to anyone unless they have the permission of the police commissioner.  Not only have States and localities begun to control the sale of body armor, at least three Nation-wide stores have already pulled bullet-proof vests from their shelves. Those stores that responded to the requests of law enforcement officials to cease the sale of body armor are The Sharper Image, Wall-mart and Sam's Club.  There were over 200 rounds of ammunition fired by the gunman that killed Officer James Guelff before other police officers were able to injure the assailant. I cannot say that Officer Guelff would still be alive if this criminal had not been wearing a bullet-proof vest. I imagine, however, that law enforcement would have more easily shot and disabled this gunman if he had not been protected by body armor. I attended Officer Guelff's funeral. Maybe, if these bullet-proof vests were not so accessible, Officer Guelff would be entering his 15th year of service.  At this time, I wish to acknowledge the leadership of Representatives Stupak and Pelosi who have introduced similar legislation, H.R. 2192, in the House of Representatives. I also ask that following my remarks, my legislation be printed in the Record .  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``James Guelff Body Armor Act      of 1995''.     SEC. 2. UNLAWFUL MAIL-ORDER SALE OF BODY ARMOR.       Title 18, United States Code, is amended by adding at the      end the following new chapter:                       ``Chapter 44A--Body Armor``Sec.``941. Unlawful act.     ``S. 941.
