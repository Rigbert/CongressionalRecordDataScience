President, November is National Home Care and Hospice Month, which gives us the opportunity to honor the home health and hospice caregivers and volunteers who make such a remarkable difference in the lives of their patients and their families. The highly skilled and compassionate care that home health and hospice agencies provide has helped to keep families together and enabled millions of our most frail and vulnerable individuals to avoid hospitals and nursing homes and stay just where they want to be in the comfort and security of their own homes.  Home health and hospice have consistently proven to be compassionate and cost-effective alternatives to institutional care. In fact, a recent survey conducted for the Maine chapter ofAARP found that 9 out of 10 Mainers would prefer to receive services at home as opposed to a nursing home or other residential care facility. Moreover, by helping patients to avoid more costly hospitals and nursing homes, home health and hospice save Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurers millions of dollars each year.  Over the past several years, I have had the opportunity to meet and visit with a number of home health and hospice patients and providers around my State. I have seen firsthand what a difference the highly skilled and compassionate care that these health professionals provide makes to the lives of their patients and families. That is why I am such a committed and passionate advocate for home health and hospice care. I therefore urge all of my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to these wonderful health care professionals and volunteers during the month of November as we celebrate National Home Health and Hospice Month.                          ____________________
