President, I rise today to introduce a bill to address the situation encountered when certain members of our Federal law enforcement community are no longer able to perform their assigned duties. These members of the Federal law enforcement community to which I refer are not people, but canines.  The purpose of this legislation is simple. The bill will streamline the regulations that govern the adoption of Federal law enforcement canines by their handlers. Currently, these animals are considered Federal property and when their tenure of service has ended, they are considered surplus Government property. Under current Federal regulations, Government agencies are forced to comply with procedures to ensure maximum return for the Government's investment in the animal at auction.  These animals have received special security training to best equip them for the demands of their duties. Because of the hazards associated with their duties, this specialized training often makes these animals unsuitable as pets for those not trained to handle these animals.  Because of the highly specialized training these animals receive, they should not be simply auctioned to the highest bidder. Currently, if no trained handler comes forward and offers the highest bid for the animal, the possibility exists that it will spend the rest of its life caged, or even worse, destroyed.  Under this legislation, the eligible animals would be donated to their handlers, who would then assume all costs and responsibilities associated to the care of that animal. This practice is commonplace for local law enforcement agencies nationwide.  This is not a drastic departure from previous Government procedure. In 1993, the General Services Administration granted a waiver for Border Patrol canine handlers to purchase their partners for a nominal fee. Unfortunately, this waiver has expired and has not been renewed.  Mr. President, this is a commonsense solution to a very simple problem. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and ease the restrictions concerning the adoption of Federal law enforcement canines.                          ____________________
