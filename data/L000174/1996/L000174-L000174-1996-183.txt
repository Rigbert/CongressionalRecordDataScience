President, the description sounds good but for the same reason that the Senate last year by a vote of 66 to 32 voted down a similar amendment, we ought to do it again.  What it does, it denies food stamps to unemployed workers when they are looking for work. You have a recession, you have a disaster such as a hurricane, or somebody has just been laid off from the factory that they worked in for 10 years, as they are looking for a new job, they cannot get food stamps. That is a time that they need it the most. We could actually have such a situation as we had in the earthquakes in California. People's businesses were destroyed, their homes were destroyed, somebody has been working for 10 or 15 years, and they would be told: Sorry, you are not working 20 hours a week; you do not get food stamps.  We defeated this by a 2-to-1 margin in the Senate, Republicans and Democrats, last year. We should do it again this year. If Senator Helms' motion is to table his own amendment, this is one time I agree with him--we ought to do just that.
