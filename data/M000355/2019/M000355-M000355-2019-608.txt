 President, yesterday evening, Speaker Pelosi announced that the House of Representatives will begin what she called ``an official impeachment inquiry.'' But, really, we know that House Democrats have been indulging their impeachment obsession for nearly 3 years now--a never-ending impeachment parade in search of a rationale.  The very day President Trump was inaugurated, the Washington Post ran a news story with this headline: ``The campaign to impeach President Trump has begun.'' That was the day of his inauguration. Later that year, there were articles of impeachment introduced over the President's language. So clearly, this has been an ongoing project for House Democrats since practically the moment that Secretary Clinton lost the election.  For months, Democrats insisted that Special Counsel Mueller's investigation or the work of the Senate Intelligence Committee would prove their theories about a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia. It didn't happen. The facts disappointed them, but the impeachment parade kept marching along.  Yesterday, even though a bipartisan committee investigation into the new whistleblower allegations is underway--and just hours after the President offered to publicize the details of his phone call with the President of Ukraine--the dam finally broke. Speaker Pelosi couldn't hold back the far left any longer. Before any of us even had the facts in hand, she caved to the left and announced an impeachment inquiry.  If this all sounds familiar, that is because at the time--literally, 1 week ago--the same Democrats were shouting about impeaching Justice Kavanaugh. That rush to judgment was based on a sketchy story in a major newspaper that promptly had to publish an enormous correction. But 1 week later, here they go again, threatening impeachment without the facts in hand.  Senate Republicans support the established proper procedures for considering this whistleblower report. In the meantime, while our friends across the Capitol rush to judgment and divedeeper into their nearly 3-year-old impeachment addiction, we will stay focused on the American people's business.                          ____________________
