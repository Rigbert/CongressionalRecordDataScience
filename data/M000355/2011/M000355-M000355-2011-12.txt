 President, I might just echo the remarks of the majority leader. We have been in useful discussions about how to wrap up the session. He has covered the two major issues that remain. We hope to be able to pass a combination of appropriations bills, and we are working hard to figure out a way to resolve the remaining differences on the payroll tax extension and the related issues that are important to both sides. We are confident and optimistic we will be able to resolve both on a bipartisan basis.
