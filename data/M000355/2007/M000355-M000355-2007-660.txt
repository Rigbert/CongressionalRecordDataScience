 I think the 96-to-2 vote Thursday night pretty well sums up the broad bipartisan support we had for this important legislation.  With regard to the minimum wage, I encourage Members on our side to come to the floor today not only to debate the package but to also offer their amendments. I hope we can have a full, constructive debate as Members offer their various proposals to the bill.  Let me ask my friend, the majority leader, did he indicate that the first vote will probably be before the policy luncheons?
