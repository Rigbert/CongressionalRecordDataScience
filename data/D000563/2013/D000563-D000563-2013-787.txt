President, with a heavy heart, I rise today to say a few words about a wonderful, talented public servant who unexpectedly passed away recently.  Joseph Christ was a longtime prosecutor in St. Clair County, IL, home of the city that I grew up in, East St. Louis.  In his almost 20 years as an assistant State's attorney, he worked hard to keep criminals off our streets and help victims' families find justice.  Then, just two weeks ago, he was sworn in as an Associate Judge on Illinois' 20th Circuit and began his new journey.  His colleagues from the prosecutor's office said great things about his time there and what a great judge he would make.  But the next weekend, while on an out-of-town trip a few days after being sworn in, he passed away from natural--though certainly unexpected--causes.  We will never know all the good things he would have accomplished as judge, but we can reflect on the good he did while he was with us.  Surely his record indicates that he would have accomplished many more good deeds in the years to come.  He was taken from his wife and children too soon. They are in my thoughts and prayers.                          ____________________
