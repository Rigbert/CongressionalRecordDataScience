Madam Speaker, I'd like to take a moment to honor the life of Mrs. Julia Washington Bond, a gracious daughter of the South who contributed significantly to the cultural and academic life of metropolitan Atlanta. Mrs. Bond is perhaps best known today as the mother of Julian Bond, the Chairman of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), my former colleague in the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee, and a stalwart advocate for civil rights and social justice in America.  For decades, Mrs. Bond helped form the center of cultural life in Atlanta. She was born in Nashville, Tennessee on June 20, 1908, and attended Fisk University, like her parents before her. There she met and eventually married a young instructor who would become one of the foremost educators of his time, Horace Mann Bond. Dr. Bond led several prominent institutions of higher education as their president--Fort Valley State College in Georgia and Lincoln University in Pennsylvania, and served as the first dean at Dillard University. In 1957, he was named the Dean of the School of Education of Atlanta University, and he and his wife became pillars of the Atlanta community.  In the 1950's and 60's, African Americans, regardless of their prominence, could not stay in hotels or motels in the South. So, when they traveled to Atlanta, they had to stay in homes around the city. As the first lady of many universities and the wife of a leading educator, Mrs. Bond hosted some of the greatest artists and thinkers of the Harlem Renaissance--W.E.B. DuBois, Arna Bontemps, Langston Hughes, W.C. Handy, Jacob Lawrence, Romare Bearden, Duke Ellington and a host of others. Her elegant style and manner offered a unique, intimate atmosphere for students and educators to engage these celebrities and help knit their bond to Atlanta society. She was kind almost to a fault, in the most genteel Southern tradition, and her beauty inspired an iconic painting by a principal artist of that period, Aaron Douglass.  In 1964, she returned to college and received a degree in library science from Atlanta University. During her tenure, she assisted hundreds and thousands of students. She worked in the university library system there until she retired in 2000. The people of the 5th District mourn the passing of Mrs. Julia Bond. She died at the age of 99 on November 2d. She raised three successful children--Jane Bond Moore, Horace Julian Bond, and James Bond. She also had eight grandchildren. She will be deeply missed.                          ____________________
