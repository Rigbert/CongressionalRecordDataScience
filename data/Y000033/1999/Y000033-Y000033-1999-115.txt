Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, the other traps do not work. So the gentleman does not know what he is talking about. The other traps do not work. It is impossible for them to transport those traps out to the areas they have to trap in, and they are not effective.  The Conibear trap, which my colleague just talked about, is the most unselective trap of all. If one is a good trapper, they can set these traps to where they catch what they are seeking. They can do that. The Conibear catches anything and everything that touches it. That is what the gentleman does not understand.  The leghold trap is not the most humane trap. The Conibear trap is a killer and it kills everything that steps into it. Not a leghold trap. If they are after mink they use one. If they are after a little larger, one and a half. It goes right on up. And they set them appropriately for the species they are trying to catch.  This is a bad amendment. Like I said, the administration, every Fish and Wildlife person involved is against it. This amendment should be defeated, if not for good sound wisdom and science, but for the poor people of my State. Go ahead and take away their livelihoods. Feel proud of yourselves. Eliminate their chances. If it makes my colleagues feel good, then go right ahead and do it. But remember, they will have that on their conscience, especially when any scientist or any biologist will tell them that the leghold trap is the proper method to be used.  I think the gentleman should reconsider his amendment, and I urge the defeat of his amendment.
