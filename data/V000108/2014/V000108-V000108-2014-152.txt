Speaker, it is with great respect that I take this time to recognize the 2014 Distinguished Citizen Award recipients, presented annually by the Boy Scouts of America Calumet Council. To commemorate this special occasion, the organization hosted a celebratory event on Monday, November 3, 2014, at the Center for Visual and Performing Arts in Munster, Indiana.   Since 1992, the Boy Scouts of America Calumet Council has presented the Distinguished Citizen Award to individuals who have made a significant positive impact on the community in Northwest Indiana and across the state. This year, the Boy Scouts of America Calumet Council honored Michael and Jill Schrage.   Michael Schrage, president and chief executive officer of Centier Bank, is a truly innovative business leader. Mike became the fourth generation of his family to own and operate the First Bank of Whiting, which was renamed Centier Bank years later. This family-owned bank has grown throughout the years, and today Centier includes over fifty branches in Indiana. Under Mr. Schrage's leadership, an award winning lender division was established, a financial literacy program was introduced, and the company has been named one of Indiana's best places to work for the past eight years. This is unquestionably due to Mike's value-based work ethic, and the importance he places on Centier's most important resource: its employees. Additionally, Mike gives much of his time and efforts to charitable endeavors, including the Saint Jude House, the American Red Cross, the YMCA, and the Boy Scouts of America, to name a few.   Jill Schrage is a true humanitarian in every sense of the word. She gives selflessly and passionately of her time and efforts to various organizations and civic activities throughout Northwest Indiana and beyond, including the American Heart Association, the American Cancer Society, TradeWinds, Speaking of Women's Health, the Girl Scouts of America, the Women's Association of the Northwest Indiana Symphony, Opportunity Enterprises, and the Valparaiso Art Advisory Committee, among others. For her truly exceptional devotion to such worthy causes, Jill serves as an inspiration to us all.   Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring the Boy Scouts of America Calumet Council and its 2014 Distinguished Citizen Award recipients, Michael and Jill Schrage. For their lifetime of leadership and outstanding dedication to serving those in need, Mike and Jill are worthy of the highest praise.                          ____________________
