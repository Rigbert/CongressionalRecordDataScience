Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, under the Help America Vote Act of 2002, of which I and the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ney) were sponsors, NIST is required to conduct several important research and technical projects connected to election reform. NIST is already busy working with the new Election Assistance Commission to advance HAVA's objectives. However, much more must be done if NIST is to fulfill its important role.  As we learned in the controversial 2000 election, voting systems in many parts of the country are antiquated and obsolete. There continues to be controversy about various technologies. NIST can make a critical difference.  As the 2004 election fast approaches, there are concerns in some quarters about the security and reliability of some voting systems. Properly directed, NIST will make a significant contribution, ensuring that new voting systems are rigorously tested, easy to use and maintain, and secure.  I strongly urge NIST to follow the spirit and substance of the report language and give priority consideration to the Help America Vote Act in fiscal year 2005.  Mr. Chairman, I would follow up with the gentleman from Ohio (Chairman Ney) that I look forward to working with him and the gentleman from Oklahoma (Chairman Istook) as we consider the Transportation-Treasury bill and the additional appropriations for the Election Assistance Commission to attempt to get some of the money that NIST needs for 2005 out of the funds that are authorized for the Election Assistance Commission.  Again, I want to thank the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wolf), the chairman of this subcommittee, and I want to thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. Serrano), the ranking Democrat, for their leadership and assistance in this effort, and I thank the gentleman for his leadership and for yielding me time.
