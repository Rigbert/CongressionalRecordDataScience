President, I rise to pay tribute to an outstanding woman in Rhode Island, Sister Mary Mercia Moran, R.S.M., who is celebrating her 50th year as a Religious Sister of Mercy.  Originally from New York City, Sister Mary Mercia entered the Religious Sisters of Mercy in Providence on September 8, 1948. She made her Final Profession on August 15, 1954. Sister Mary Mercia has dedicated her life to educating the children of the Diocese of Providence. Since 1951, she has taught at several schools including: St. Patrick in Providence, St. Matthew in Cranston, St. Mary in Pawtucket and St. Brendan in East Providence. Since 1967, Sister Mary Mercia has been teaching Second Grade at Sacred Heart School in East Providence.  I was fortunate enough to be her student at St. Matthew's School. She was, and is, an inspiring, demanding, and nurturing teacher. Generations of Rhode Island children have prospered because of her faithful dedication.  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in commending Sister Mary Mercia for her many contributions to the children of Rhode Island and selfless dedication to helping others.                           ____________________
