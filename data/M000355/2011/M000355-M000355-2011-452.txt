 President, we are making good progress on this bill. This bill is being handled as we have been accustomed in the old days tohandling bills in the Senate. I commend the majority leader for that. We are going to be able to work our way through it with amendments related to the subject from here on in and wrap it up, as he suggests, the week of February 14.
