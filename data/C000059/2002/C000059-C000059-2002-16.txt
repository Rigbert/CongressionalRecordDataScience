Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to the community of Riverside County, CA, are exceptional. The County of Riverside has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give time and talent to making their communities a better place to live and work. Marcia McQuern is one of these individuals. On October 1, 2002, Marcia will be retiring after 30 years of dedicated service to the community as the Publisher, Editor, President and CEO of The Press Enterprise, the dominant news source for the Inland Empire. Her outstanding work in communicating with the public, in addition to her personal involvement in the community, will be celebrated at a luncheon her honor on October 8, 2002.  Marcia obtained her bachelor's degree in political science from the University of California, Santa Barbara and served as the editor of the student newspaper. She later obtained her master's degree from Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism.  In her 30 years of exemplary employment with The Press Enterprise, Marcia has worked as the executive editor, managing editor/News, deputy managing editor/News, and city editor as well as holding numerous reporting positions.

Marcia's tireless work as the Publisher, Editor, President and CEO of The Press Enterprise has contributed unmeasurably to the betterment of Riverside County. Her involvement in community organizations makes me proud to call her a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that all of the residents of Riverside County are grateful for her service and salute her as she departs The Press Enterprise. I look forward to working with her in the future for the good of our community.                          ____________________
