 President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts. I thought the remarks were excellent. I think they were really right on. The tragedy of this is that people do not listen. I hope, Senator Kennedy, your words were heard.  Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Michigan, Mr. Levin.
