President, my friend from Alabama is correct. I believe that we have an honest, fair reform to the reaffirmation process and procedure. I know there has been a great deal of work dedicated to this end, and I am pleased we have arrived at this common ground. I have some concerns about the time limits for approval of these reaffirmation agreements. I had hoped this timing issue would be resolved, but I share Senator Sessions' desire to see this amendment passed with the technical corrections. I would ask my friend if he shares my interest in addressing this timing issue in conference?
