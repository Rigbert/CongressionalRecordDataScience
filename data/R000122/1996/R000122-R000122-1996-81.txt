Speaker, I want to take this opportunity to let my colleagues know about the outstanding work of the Rhode Island Chapter of the American Red Cross during the terrible winter of 1995-96.  Even though spring is now officially here, it will be a long time before Rhode Islanders forget this past winter.  The harsh weather shattered all previous records for Rhode Island winters. We had the heaviest cumulative snowfall in recorded Rhode Island history, 93.2 inches; 75.6 inches was the previous record. Starting with last November 13, Rhode Island had 37 days of snowfall, with 11 major snowstorms rolling through our State.  In addition to the harsh weather, this past winter has also brought terrible environmental and human tragedy to Rhode Island.  On January 19, the oil barge North Cape ran aground on a southern Rhode Island beach, spilling over 800,000 gallons of home heating oil into our State's pristine coastal environment. Once this disaster began, it set into motion an emergency response and cleanup process that lasted days and involved over 1,000 Federal, State and local officials, private contractors, and U.S. Coast Guard personnel.  In terms of human tragedy, this past winter has been a season of terrible home fires in Rhode Island. According to the office of Rhode Island's Fire Marshal, the winter of 1995-96 was a time when the loss of life and destruction of property in Rhode Island due to fire showed a marked increase over previous years.  The one constant throughout all of Rhode Island's winter hardship was the hard work of the staff and volunteers of the Rhode Island Chapter of the American Red Cross.  The Red Cross was there during all the winter storms. When a snow plow hit an electrical transformer, knocking out power to a Bristol nursing home, the Red Cross helped evacuate the nursing home residents. When Pawtucket snow removal crews working round-the-clock needed cots to rest on before going back out on the road, the Rhode Island Chapter of the American Red Cross got it done.  The Red Cross was also there during the North Cape oilspill. Throughout the cleanup, 110 Rhode Island Red Cross Chapter volunteers were on the scene providing over 8,500 meals, enabling work crews to stay at their jobs from sunup to sundown.  And the Red Cross was there for all of Rhode Island's tragic winter fires. From last November until the end of winter, the Rhode Island Chapter of the American Red Cross helped an estimated 400 Rhode Islanders get back on their feet after a total of 125 fires.  It is in the aftermath of a fire that Rhode Island's Red Cross Chapter provides perhaps its most valuable ongoing service to our State. Last year, 26 Rhode Islanders died as a result of fire. When this tragedy does occur, the Red Cross is there with counseling for survivors and for emergency response crews. The volunteers and staff of the Rhode Island Chapter of the American Red Cross also provide food, shelter, and clothing--often in the middle of the night--for Rhode Islanders whose homes have been destroyed by fire.  The Rhode Island Chapter of American Red Cross performs all these tasks, with a small staff, a very limited budget and an army of dedicated volunteers. I commend the chairman of the board of the Rhode Island Chapter of the American Red Cross, Richard Moore, its executive director, Barbara G. DeCesare, and the entire staff of the Rhode Island Chapter of the American Red Cross, for all their hard work. Most of all, I would like to thank all of Rhode Island's Red Cross volunteers, for helping our State make it through a difficult winter.                          ____________________
