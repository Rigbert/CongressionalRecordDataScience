Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4661, the ``Internet Spyware Prevention Act of 2004.'' This narrow criminal legislation will deter and allow the prosecution of the worst forms of behavior involving spyware by providing additional tools and resources to criminal prosecutors. I would like to thank the Gentleman from Virginia, Mr. Goodlatte, for introducing the legislation before us today.  Technologies designed to enhance the speed and efficiency of data transfer have fueled the explosive growth of the Internet. Unfortunately, the sad reality is that the same software and technology innovations that have enhanced and personalized usage of the Internet can also provide opportunities for abuse and illegal behavior.  Like many other ills on the Internet these latest malicious behaviors cannot be stopped by federal legislation alone. In fact, there is no one silver bullet--legal, regulatory, or technological--to end the misuse of spyware or the related practice of ``phishing.'' But greater consumer awareness and use of available technological countermeasures clearly hold the greatest promise for curbing these abusive practices. Congressional efforts will only help if they focus on behavior--not rapidly changing technology.  H.R. 4661 is a good start because it focuses on behavior that is criminal, not on technologies. Unlike some other proposals, this bill does not set up new requirements that dictate how things appear on a computer screen or that bombard a user with unwanted notices. Nor does this bill pose the same dangers of strict liability for legitimate companies who make a mistake. In short, it represents a measured solution to the problem it seeks to correct.  I believe that this narrow legislation updating necessary criminal law provisions and emphasizing increased enforcement, rather than broad regulation, is the correct legislative response at this time. I urge may colleagues to support H.R. 4661 and reserve the balance of my time.
