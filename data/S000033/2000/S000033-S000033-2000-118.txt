 Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time.  Mr. Speaker, it is time that we in Congress get our priorities straight. Today, despite the so-called economic boom, tens of millions of Americans are working longer hours for lower wages than was the case 25 years ago. They are working two jobs or they are working three jobs and they are desperately trying to keep their heads above water.  In the United States today, 44 million Americans have no health insurance, and millions more are underinsured. The United States has the greatest gap in the industrialized world between the rich and the poor, and 20 percent of our children live in poverty, the highest child poverty rate of any major country.  Millions of senior citizens in this country and middle-income families cannot afford the prescription drugs they need, and the U.S. Congress has made the health care crisis even worse by cutting in 1997 several hundred billion dollars from Medicare. Throughout this country, veterans who put their lives on the line defending this Nation are unable to get the quality health care they need and deserve.  In the United States today, we are experiencing an affordable housing crisis, with millions of hard-working families paying more than 50 percent of their limited incomes just to pay the rent; and some of the more unfortunate low-income workers are people sleeping out on the streets or in their automobiles.  In this country we talk a whole lot about education, but millions of American middle-class families cannot afford to send their kids to college and many of our kids who graduate find themselves deeply in debt.  In other words, Mr. Speaker, the middle class of this country, the working families, our senior citizens, our veterans, our young people, low-income people, have some very serious problems.                              {time}  1515  Unfortunately, when these constituents cry out to Congress and ask for help, they are told over and over again that there is just no money available to help them, that we just do not have the resources. But when it comes to military spending, it appears that the defense contractors who want to design the most exotic and expensive weapons systems in the history of the world are able to obtain all of the funding they want. When it comes to defense spending, we apparently have billions to spend on the construction of a national missile defense system that many scientists believe will not work and is not needed; billions to spend on aircraft carriers and fighter planes that just coincidentally are built in the States and districts of powerful Members of Congress; billions to spend on military projects that coincidentally are built by contractors who contribute huge sums of money to both political parties. When it comes to military spending, we apparently have the resources to increase the defense budget by 7 percent, a $22 billion increase from last year.  Mr. Speaker, I believe that the U.S. needs a strong and superior military system. We must be prepared for the new threats and challenges that lie ahead. We must provide decent pay, good housing, good quality health care and child care and other vital services to our men and women in uniform.  We must do a much better job than at present in understanding the cause of Gulf War illness which is why I am offering an amendment later on in this bill so that we can better understand the cause of that illness which is affecting 100,000 Americans.  But the bottom line, Mr. Speaker, is enough is enough. Today when we look at our military budget, it is not just that we spend more than 18 times as much as the military spending of all of our potential adversaries combined; but when we combine our spending with NATO, who will be our allies in any major international conflict, the numbers are absolutely incredible. The bottom line is that we as a Nation have got to get our priorities right. There is a limited sum of money out there, and we must make sure that we spend it appropriately. We cannot turn our backs on our seniors, on working people, on the children and simply look toward the military budget.  I would ask that this bill be defeated, sent back to the committee and brought forth again for a more appropriate response.
