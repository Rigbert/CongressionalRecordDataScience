Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration and Related Agencies. She does an extraordinary job. We are pleased with her help on this bill. I appreciate the gentlewoman commenting on this, and her very important intervention.
