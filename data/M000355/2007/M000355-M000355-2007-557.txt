 President, with regard to the two votes we will have at 10, my understanding is both these amendments have been cleared on both sides. I know I can speak for the Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Sununu, that he was prepared to take a rollcall vote.  With regard to moving forward on this legislation, I encourage Members on our side of the aisle who have amendments to come down, get them in the queue. We will have a number of amendments, as the majority leader has indicated, next week. The best way to proceed, if a Senator is on this side of the aisle and has an amendment, is to come on down and offer it and get it in the queue.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
