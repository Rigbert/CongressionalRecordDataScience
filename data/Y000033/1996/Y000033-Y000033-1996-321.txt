Mr. Speaker, I am introducing legislation today which would rename an existing portion of wilderness in the Brooks Range of Alaska's Arctic Wildlife Refuge the ``Mollie Beattie Alaska Wilderness.'' Mollie Beattie, until recently the Director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, combined advocacy in her role as the chief steward of America's Federal programs for fish and wildlife with a compassionate belief that people were an inseparable part of the natural environment. Mollie held a special place in her heart for the Brooks Range wilderness area of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, America's largest. This legislation provides for the naming of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge Wilderness established in the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act--Public Law 96-487--in her honor. As Mollie's knowledge of Alaska grew, so did her love for our unique areas and for the special people who choose to call Alaska home. I hope that her willingness to try to understand my State better will encourage others to grow in the same way.                          ____________________
