 I ask the leader one last question on why I mentioned the Washington Times story about the motivation for this. Was he aware that one of the circuit court nominees whom we held up for a number of appropriate reasons--that even after that nominee was convicted of criminal fraud that occurred while his nomination was pending, we were still criticized for holding up that nominee? It is kind of you are damned if you do and damned if you don't.
