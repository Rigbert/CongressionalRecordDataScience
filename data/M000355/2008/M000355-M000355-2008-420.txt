 REID. No. I want the record to reflect I would never consider putting a piece of legislation on the floor without talking to my chairmen. I talked to Senator Dodd, I talked to Senator Leahy, I talked to Senator Baucus about what was going to be in this. So that is so farfetched that it is hard for me to conceive of how my friend could say that.  Mr. McCONNELL. I didn't say it. I did not say it. That is why I was trying to get the majority leader to yield. I said I don't know whether you consulted with your chairmen. I am fairly confident you didn't consult with the ranking member, so my remarks don't need to be corrected since I didn't say it.
