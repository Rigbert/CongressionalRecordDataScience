 President, at the same time, we have to reverse this trend by which fewer and fewer people own more and more wealth, while more and more people have less; while poverty increases and while the middle class shrinks.  The true greatness of a country does not lie in the number of millionaires and billionaires that it has; rather, a great nation is one in which justice, equality, and dignity prevail.  I close with a quote that none other than President George W. Bush made on January 20, 2001. I quote from President Bush:       In the quiet of American conscience, we know that deep,      persistent poverty is unworthy of our Nation's promise. Where      there is suffering, there is duty. Americans in need are not      strangers, they are citizens, not problems, but priorities.      And all of us are diminished when any are hopeless. And I can      pledge our Nation to a goal: When we see that wounded      traveler on the road to Jericho, we will not pass to the      other side.  George W. Bush.  The President was right to make that pledge, but since he made that statement, we all know that over 5 million more Americans have slipped into poverty, including over 1 million children.  Let us turn that pledge to reality. We can begin to do that by raising the minimum wage, and we can begin to do that by coming up with a plan, with a program, with legislation which eliminates childhood poverty in America and lowers the gap between the rich and the poor.  I thank the Chair.
