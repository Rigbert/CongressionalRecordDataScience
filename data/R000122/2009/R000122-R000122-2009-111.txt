President, today I introduce the Informed Health Care Decision Making Act of 2009. I am introducing this legislation along with my colleague Senator Mikulski because every American deserves to have the full information regarding drugs and devices prescribed by their provider.  Even though the amount of money spent to reach the public about drugs and devices is greater than five billion dollars annually, the most fundamental information--information about how well the drug or device actually works--is generally absent. In 2007, the Institute of Medicine conducted a workshop regarding the public's understanding of drugs and confirmed the importance for patients and physicians of having standardized and quantitative information about the product before making health care decisions.  Researchers at Dartmouth University have documented that replacing the current narrative information contained in drug advertisements with simplified, factual information, will enable patients to play an active role in health care decision making. In fact, similar to the nutrition facts boxes that are required on our Nation's packaged food supply, this research demonstrated that a drug facts box will actually help physicians make better health care choices.  If the research is not enough proof that this type of streamlined information will be beneficial, the Food andDrug Administration's, FDA, Risk Communications Advisory Committee, a committee specifically designed to counsel the agency on how to strengthen the communication of risks and benefits of FDA-regulated products to the public, unanimously recommended that the FDA adopt standardized, quantitative summaries of risks and benefits in a drug facts box format.  As such, the Informed Health Care Decision Making Act of 2009 would require the FDA to determine if the information provided in a drug facts box, or a similar format, would improve health care decision making by clinicians and patients, and report to Congress on that determination. If the report determines that a specific standardized, quantitative format would be beneficial, the FDA must issue regulations to implement the format.  Regardless of the FDA's determination, it is important for clinicians and patients to be able to compare the similarities, differences, benefits, and risks of drugs and devices. As such, the legislation would require the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality to establish a multi-stakeholder process for developing and periodically updating methodological standards and criteria for comparative clinical effectiveness research. This would include standards and criteria for the sources of evidence and the adequacy of evidence that are appropriate for the inclusion of comparative clinical effectiveness information in labeling and print advertisements.  Upon completion of these standards, the legislation requires drug labels and print advertisements to include information on the clinical effectiveness of a product--compared to other products approved for the same health condition for the same patient demographic subpopulation--or a disclosure that there is no such information, if another product has not been approved for the same use. The potential of such a disclosure should be a powerful incentive for manufacturers to fund comparative effectiveness research.  It is my hope that as we embark upon meaningful health care reform, my colleagues will join me in supporting this bill and other initiatives to improve the health care decision making of both patients and clinicians.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1142       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Informed Health Care      Decision Making Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds the following:       (1) National randomized controlled trials have found that      replacing the brief summary of drug advertisements with a      drug facts box improved consumer knowledge and judgments. In      such trials, consumers who were presented with a drug facts      box more accurately perceived the side effects and benefits      of a drug, and were more than twice as likely to choose the      superior drug.       (2)(A) In 2007, the Institute of Medicine conducted a      workshop that highlighted that the public has a limited      understanding of the benefits and risks of drugs. The      workshop also highlighted that it is important to--       (i) provide patients and physicians with the best possible      information for making informed decisions about the use of      pharmaceuticals;       (ii) employ quantitative and standardized approaches when      trying to evaluate pharmaceutical benefit-risk; and       (iii) develop and validate improved tools for communicating      pharmaceutical benefit-risk information to patients and      physicians.       (B) The general agreement of the workshop was that the Food      and Drug Administration should pilot test a drug facts box.       (3) On February 27, 2009, the Food and Drug      Administration's Risk Communication Advisory Committee made      the following unanimous recommendations:       (A) The Food and Drug Administration should adopt a single      standard document for communicating essential information      about pharmaceuticals.       (B) That standard document should include quantitative      summaries of risks and benefits, along with use and      precaution information.       (C) The Food and Drug Administration should adopt the drug      facts box format as its standard.     SEC. 3. PRESENTATION OF DRUG BENEFIT AND RISK INFORMATION.       (a) In General.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services      (referred to in this Act as the ``Secretary''), acting      through the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, shall determine      whether standardized, quantitative summaries of the benefits      and risks of drugs in a tabular or drug facts box format, or      any alternative format, in the labeling and print advertising      of such drugs would improve health care decision making by      clinicians and patients and consumers.       (b) Review and Consultation.--In making the determination      under subsection (a), the Secretary shall review all      available scientific evidence and consult with drug      manufacturers, clinicians, patients and consumers, experts in      health literacy, and representatives of racial and ethnic      minorities.       (c) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of      enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to the      Congress a report that provides--       (1) the determination by the Secretary under subsection      (a); and       (2) the reasoning and analysis underlying that      determination.       (d) Authority.--       (1) In general.--If the Secretary determines under      subsection (a) that standardized, quantitative summaries of      the benefits and risks of drugs in a tabular or drug facts      box format, or any alternative format, in the labeling and      print advertising of such drugs would improve health care      decision making by clinicians and patients and consumers,      then the Secretary, not later than 1 year after the date of      submission of the report under subsection (c), shall      promulgate regulations as necessary to implement such format.       (2) Objective and up-to-date information.--In carrying out      paragraph (1), the Secretary shall ensure that the      information presented in a summary described under such      paragraph is objective and up-to-date, and is the result of a      review process that considers the totality of published and      unpublished data.       (3) Posting of information.--In carrying out paragraph (1),      the Secretary shall post the information presented in a      summary described under such paragraph on the Internet Web      site of the Food and Drug Administration.     SEC. 4. STANDARDS FOR COMPARATIVE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS                    INFORMATION.       (a) In General.--The Secretary, acting through the      Commissioner of Food and Drugs, shall establish and      periodically update methodological standards and criteria for      the sources of evidence and the adequacy and degree of      evidence that are appropriate for inclusion of comparative      clinical effectiveness information in labeling and      advertisements under subsections (f), (n)(3), and (r) of      section 502 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (as      amended by section 5).       (b) Requirements.--The standards and criteria established      under subsection (a) shall ensure that comparative clinical      effectiveness information provides reliable and useful      information that improves health care decision making,      adheres to rigorous scientific standards, and is produced      through a transparent process that includes consultation with      stakeholders.       (c) Consultation.--In carrying out subsection (a), the      Secretary shall consult with manufacturers of drugs and      devices, clinicians, patients and consumers, experts in      health literacy, and representatives of racial and ethnic      minorities.       (d) Definition.--For purposes of this section, the term      ``comparative clinical effectiveness'' means the clinical      outcomes, effectiveness, safety, and clinical appropriateness      of a drug or device in comparison to 1 or more drugs or      devices, respectively, approved to prevent, diagnose, or      treat the same health condition for the same patient      demographic subpopulation.
