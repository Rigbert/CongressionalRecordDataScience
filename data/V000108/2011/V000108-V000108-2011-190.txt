Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I stand before you today to honor Purdue University Calumet (PUC) Chancellor, Dr. Howard Cohen and his wife, Patricia Cohen. On Saturday, May 7, 2011, Chancellor and Patti Cohen will be honored at an event for their many years of service in the field of education at Purdue University Calumet. Chancellor Cohen, with the support of Patti, has had a tremendous impact on numerous students and educators throughout Northwest Indiana and across the nation and their efforts are to be highly commended.  From 2001 to 2010, Patricia Cohen's commitment and partnership in support of her husband has been instrumental in the growth and development of Purdue University Calumet. Patti graduated summa cum laude with a bachelor's degree in nursing from the University of Wisconsin and also earned a master's degree in occupational therapy from Boston University. With her background in the medical field, Patti continues to share her knowledge with PUC and is a member of the PUC Honorary Nursing Organization: Sigma Theta Tau, Bet Mu Chapter. She is also a past member of the PUC Health and Wellness Committee. In addition, Patti has represented PUC on trips to universities in China, Poland, Spain, Oman, and Costa Rica. She has also established, planned, and hosted numerous campus and community events.  Howard Cohen is among less than a handful of academicians who I have dealt with over the last generation who I would describe as the ``best.'' Howard has used his inestimable intellect to impart wisdom to others. His leadership has introduced permanent positive changes throughout Northwest Indiana and our state. His vision has provided all of us with a guide to an improved and gentler future.  Additionally, Chancellor Cohen's professional and academic career led him to become a prominent, innovative leader in the field of education. In 1966, he graduated summa cum laude with a bachelor's degree in philosophy from the University of Minnesota and went on to earn a master's degree and a doctoral degree from Harvard University. Since 2001, Dr. Howard Cohen has been Chancellor at PUC and also holds an appointment as Professor of Philosophy. Over the past ten years, Chancellor Cohen has dedicated his time and passion into making PUC the high quality, full-service university that it is today. PUC has expanded tremendously under the leadership of Chancellor Cohen. During his tenure, Chancellor Cohen has established student housing, constructed the Academic Learning Center and established nine centers and institutes of applied research. Labeled his signature project, Chancellor Cohen was influential in the implementation of the innovative experiential learning initiative, a program that blends traditional learning with hands-on, applied learning, which is now a curriculum requirement for all students seeking a bachelor's degree.  In addition to their truly impressive devotion to education and to Purdue University Calumet, Howard and Patti passionately serve the people of Northwest Indiana though their involvement in numerous community organizations. They have been married since 1968 and have two beloved children and two grandchildren.  Mr. Speaker, at this time, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in commending Chancellor Howard Cohen and Patricia Cohen. Their inspiration continues to fuel the future of education and their life work has provided exceptional new opportunities in Northwest Indiana and across the nation. For their selfless, lifelong commitment they are worthy of the highest praise.                          ____________________
