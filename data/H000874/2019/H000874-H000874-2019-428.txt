Speaker, before I end, we have just been through a very difficult week in which one of our Members was reviewed and disapproval was passed almost unanimously, I think, with just one vote opposed to it, on our side.  I must mention: I don't want any argument or we don't need to debate on this, but, unfortunately, at a height, I know, of a lot of emotion, one of our Members, a respected Member of our caucus, Tony Cardenas--who is, by the way, from California--was met with a call from the other side of the aisle to return to Puerto Rico.  We ought to all be cognizant of the fact that we need to be civil to one another. We need to be polite to one another, even. We can disagree very strongly and, obviously, we do on issue to issue.  But we have been sent here by 750,000, give or take, of our fellow citizens, and I respect all of you for having been selected by 750,000 people. I may disagree with them on selecting the policies that you pursue, obviously--I understand that--but I would hope that we could refrain from any implications which have any undertones of prejudice or racism or any kind of ``-ism'' that would diminish the character and integrity of one of our fellow Members.
