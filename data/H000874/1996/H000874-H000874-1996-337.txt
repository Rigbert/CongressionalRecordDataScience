Speaker, I rise in support of the conference report today. I want to thank the chairman and the ranking member for their concern about a provision that was of particular concern to me.  This House is obviously undergoing a change in management. As a result, many of our hardworking, loyal, nonlegislative House employees have been through a period of great unrest and unease.  As passed by this House, this bill originally contained language regarding the privatization of certain aspects of the Architect of the Capitol, including the maintenance workers. I am pleased that as a result of the work of the conference, and particularly Mr. Serrano, that the report before us today now contains language protecting the current employees so that they will not be displaced by an privatization.  The bulk of this work force are older, minority employees who would be hard pressed to find new jobs at this stage in their careers. They have served this institution and its particular needs well. It would have been unfair at this time to proceed with privatization without properly protecting these employees. I am glad that the conference report now contains language providing that important protection.  Furthermore, as the Architect studies further privatization options, which I hope are not proceeded with, I believe it is important that we continue to consider the unique nature of the congressional buildings, the loyalty of the existing work force and the particular needs of our institution. I do not believe all the answers lie in outsourcing these services and will continue to work with the members of the subcommittee and on the House Oversight Committee on which I serve, to ensure fair and reasonable treatment for our hardworking employees.  Mr. Speaker, again, I thank the members of the conference for their sensitivity to these concerns and look forward to continuing to work with them.                          ____________________
