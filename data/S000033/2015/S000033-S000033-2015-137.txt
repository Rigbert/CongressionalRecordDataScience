 President, this amendment could not be simpler.  The scientific community has been very clear in telling us that climate change is the great environmental crisis of our time. It is caused by human activity, it is real, and it is already causing devastating problems in the United States and throughout the world.  This amendment establishes a deficit-neutral reserve fund to recognize that climate change is real, it is caused by human activity, and that Congress needs to take action to cut carbon pollution.  Let us stand with science. Let's pass this amendment.
