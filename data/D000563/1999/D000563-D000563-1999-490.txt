DORGAN. That is exactly the case. It is the case that we are in the circumstance which now exists because there are some here in the Senate who simply do not want to have to vote on the issues we are talking about with respect to the Patients' Bill of Rights. They want to have a slogan so they can vote for something titled the Patients' Bill of Rights but one that will not have any strength; one that will really not have any provisions to provide people with the basic rights they ought to be provided with respect to this health care issue.  We have talked at great length about the too many instances in this country where health care decisions are not made by a doctor in a patient's room in the hospital or by a doctor in a doctor's office at a clinic, but where the answer to what kind of patient care will be allowed is to often, in too many circumstances, made by an accountant making medical judgments somewhere in an insurance company office 1,000 miles away. That is what is wrong with the system.
