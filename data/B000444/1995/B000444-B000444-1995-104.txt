 I do not want to confuse the Senator. There are two amendments: One, the Biden amendment referred to earlier was debated yesterday. That amendment has a number of offsets in it which we discussed for 2 hours yesterday. That is the one I just amended to accommodate a DeWine proposal.  There is a second issue here and that is a managers' amendment going to the funding in this bill for the police program.  I have reached an agreement, to the best of my knowledge, with the Senator from Kansas, with the Senator from Texas, the manager of the bill, and with the Senator from South Carolina. I have that agreed upon language between the manager and the parties I suggested. That goes to another big chunk of the difference of the debate. All that relates to is, one sentence --it takes out the block grant language for the police and reinstates the original language. That is a separate issue than the Biden amendment. I am not sure if I am answering the Senator's question. If that is the answer, I am prepared to move that amendment right now. That is, the so-called managers amendment and ask for a voice vote on it.  I am not looking for a rollcall vote because we have all agreed as of at least 10 minutes ago. Does that answer the question of the Senator from Mississippi?
