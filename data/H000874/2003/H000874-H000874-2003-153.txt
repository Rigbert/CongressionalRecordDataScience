Speaker, under regular order, we were told at the beginning of this session that the leadership of the House and the message from the Speaker of the House, Dennis Hastert, was that we were going to allot 15 minutes for votes with only 2 minutes, and that at 17 minutes, the voting tally would close, and we were all urged to be on time so that the work of the House could be done efficiently and effectively.  Mr. Speaker, my inquiry is, is that regular order still in place? Is that still the policy of the leadership of this House?
