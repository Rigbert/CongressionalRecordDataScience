President, I would note that Senator Klobuchar is here and she, I believe, wanted to participate in the discussion about the IMF, but we shortly have a vote, and we would very much like to proceed. The majority leader is here also.  I am prepared to speak now on the pending Reed amendment that we are going to go to a vote on at 11:15.
