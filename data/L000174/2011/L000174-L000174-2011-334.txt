By doing so, we were able to vitiate the cloture motion and avoid another unnecessary filibuster. Had agreement not been reached, this would have been the first filibuster in history of a Solicitor General nomination.  Mr. Verrilli is by all accounts one of the finest lawyers in the country, whose extensive experience as an advocate for a wide variety of clients will serve him well as Solicitor General, the top advocate for the United States. In a long and distinguished career, Mr. Verrilli has argued numerous cases before the Supreme Court, Federal appeals courts and State appellate courts. He clerked for Judge J. Skelly Wright on the DC Circuit and for Justice William Brennan on the U.S. Supreme Court. Mr. Verrilli's impressive breadth of experience both in Government and in private practice led the Judiciary Committee to report his nomination by a vote of 17-1 nearly a month ago. Seven of the eight Republican members of the committee joined in supporting Mr. Verrilli's nomination.  The Judiciary Committee heard from many respected lawyers from across the political spectrum in support for Mr. Verrilli's nomination. Eight former Solicitors General from both Republican and Democratic administrations, among them Republicans Charles Fried, Kenneth Starr, Ted Olson, Paul Clement and Gregory Garre, concluded: ``Mr. Verrilli is ideally suited to carry out the crucial tasks assigned to the Solicitor General and to maintain the traditions of the Office of the Solicitor General.''  More than 50 prominent Supreme Court practitioners urged the Senate to confirm Mr. Verrilli's nomination, including conservatives like Maureen Mahoney, Peter Keisler, and Miguel Estrada. They wrote:       Don's approach to practicing law throughout his career--his      meticulousness in understanding and presenting facts      accurately and his insistence on coherently laying out      reasons for the positions he is urging--proves beyond      question that Don will protect and promote the rule of law.  I will ask that copies of the letters in support be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.  Don Verrilli is exactly the kind of superbly qualified, serious professional we should be encouraging to serve the American people in their government. I expect that he will be confirmed by a strong bipartisan majority of the Senate.  Like all of the nominations reported by the Judiciary Committee and pending on the Senate's Executive Calendar, Mr. Verrilli's nomination has been through the Judiciary Committee's fair and thorough process. We reviewed extensive background material on his nomination. All Senators on the committee, Democratic and Republican, had the opportunity to ask him questions at a live hearing. All Senators had the opportunity to meet with Mr. Verrilli individually, as well. Many also took advantage of the opportunity to ask him questions in writing following the hearing.  We then debated and voted on his nomination. I thank the members of the committee for their work, consideration and judgment. Many cited their meetings with Mr. Verrilli and his serious and thoughtful answers to hundreds of written questions for the record as a basis for their support of his nomination. The result of the process was that Senators, having raised whatever concerns they had and whatever differences they have with the policies of the Obama administration, voted nearly unanimously in favor of confirming Mr. Verrilli based on his qualifications, experience and appreciation for the responsibilities of the Solicitor General.  I appreciate the effort made by the Republican members of the Judiciary Committee in considering the Verrilli nomination on its merits and voting to support him, with one exception. I appreciated the thoughtful statement by the ranking Republican at our markup, nearly 1 month ago, in which he set forth his concerns and the painstaking process he followed to evaluate the nomination and his judgment to support him. Senator Grassley attended the hearing, met personally with the nominee, and engaged in extensive written questioning, as well. In his statement he commended Mr. Verrilli ``for his serious approach to the task of providing responses'' and for his ``thoughtful answers.'' After that rigorous process, Senator Grassley became more comfortable that Mr. Verrilli ``understands the duty of the Solicitor General.'' He emphasized that Mr. Verrilli had made clear to him that ``he would not lend his name or that of the office to carrying out any order which he believed to be based upon partisan political considerations or other illegitimate reasons'' and that rather than do so, he would resign from office. Senator Grassley concluded that he has ``every expectation that Mr. Verrilli, if confirmed, will honorably live up to his duties, obligations, and assurances.''  The committee process left no doubt that Mr. Verrilli has an extensive knowledge of the law and an understanding of the independence required to represent the interests of the government and the American people as the Solicitor General of the United States. He is well qualified and well suited to serve in the role of what is often called ``the tenth Justice.''  The Senate has a longstanding practice of giving deference to the President to make nominations for positions in the executive branch. However, as we have seen with more and more of President Obama's nominations, Senate Republicans have dramatically departed from our Senate standards. This does great harm to the interests of the American people, the ability of good people to serve, the capacity of the government to fulfill its responsibilities and the proper functioning of the Senate. Subjecting consensus nominees to unnecessary and damaging delays and unjustified and harmful filibusters is wrong. I am glad the Senate leaders have been able to come to agreement to avoid the threatened filibuster of this qualified nominee to serve as Solicitor General of the United States.  Before the Memorial Day recess, the Senate should have confirmed the nomination of Lisa Monaco to be the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the National Security Division at the Justice Department. That is a key national security position. The Judiciary Committee held a hearing on Ms. Monaco's nomination in April and reported her nomination unanimously in early May. Her nomination has since been considered by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence at an additional hearing and was reported unanimously by that committee, as well, nearly 2 weeks ago. After such a thorough process, there is no doubt that President Obama has made a first-rate choice to fill this very critical national security position. The value of Ms. Monaco's wealth of experience and institutional knowledge has been supported by the many former Justice Department officials who have written in support of her nomination, including former Attorney General Mukasey, who served during the President George W. Bush administration. Without cause or explanation, the Republican leadership still has not consented to a vote on this important national security nomination.  Even more egregious is the unprecedented filibuster of the nomination of Jim Cole to be Deputy Attorney General, the No. 2 position at the Justice Department also with key national security responsibilities. There is no excuse or justification for the continued failure to act on Mr. Cole's nomination to fill this critical position. It was blocked last year when it was pending for 5 months in the Senate. The nomination was reported favorably by the Judiciary Committee again in March, and incredibly, has been filibustered for another 10 weeks while the country faces concerns about terrorism in the aftermath of the President's successful operation against al-Qaida and Osama bin Laden. It is hard for me to understand how, at a time when experts are concerned that al-Qaida will seek reprisals, the Senate has not acted to ensure that President Obama has his full national security team in place. Instead, Senate Republicans have chosen to delay action on those nominations and to seek to use them as leverage against the administration.  I have urged Senate Republicans to reject this partisan approach and to come together to work with our President to keep America safe. In the aftermath of 9/11, we expedited law enforcement nominations, confirming an additional 58 officials to posts at the Justice Department before the end of 2001. We should have done the same with the nominations of Lisa Monaco and Jim Cole. We should treat Mr. Cole's nomination with the same urgency and seriousness with which we treated all four of the Deputy Attorneys General who served under President Bush. All four were confirmed by the Senate by voice vote an average of 21 days after they were reported by the Judiciary Committee. No Deputy Attorney General nomination has ever been subjected to a filibuster before. It is wrong and should end.  I am confident that Mr. Verrilli's qualifications, experience, ability, temperament and judgment will lead to an overwhelming bipartisan vote in support of his confirmation to serve as the next Solicitor General of the United States.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record copies of the letters to which I referred.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                 February 8, 2011.     Re Nomination of Donald Verrilli as Solicitor General.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Washington,          DC.     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,     Ranking Member, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary,          Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Grassley: We write      in enthusiastic support of the nomination of Don Verrilli to      become the next Solicitor General of the United States. We      write as lawyers who are deeply familiar both with the work      of the Solicitor General and with Don's own work and      character. Some of us have worked jointly with Don, some of      us have appeared opposite him in cases, all of us have seen      his work. We believe that Don is ideally suited to carry out      the crucial tasks assigned to the Solicitor General, chiefly      the representation of the United States in the Supreme Court,      and to maintain the traditions of the office that the      Solicitor General leads. We urge the Senate to confirm him as      Solicitor General.       With experience representing a wide variety of clients, and      several years serving the United States from within the      government at its highest levels, Don is unusually      experienced in the vast range of legal issues over which the      Solicitor General is responsible on behalf of the United      States. He is a quick study, careful listener, and acute      judge of legal arguments. He is a masterful writer and oral      advocate who knows the importance of clarity, candor, vigor,      and responsiveness. The array of departments and agencies the      Solicitor General represents, the Congress that enacts the      laws being executed, and ultimately the Supreme Court in the      performance of its functions all rely on these qualities in a      Solicitor General, and all would be well served by Don      Verrilli in that position.       As important, the successful functioning of the Solicitor      General's office requires an ability to see the effects of      particular arguments on the overall interests of the United      States, both across agencies and over the long term. Shaping      arguments to respect those interests, and to protect the      special credibility the office has acquired over the decades      of its existence, while maintaining clarity and force in      presentations, demands the whole range of knowledge,      intelligence, judgment, and other capacities that Don has in      abundance. More generally, the rule of law depends on a      consistent commitment to reason in the unfolding of legal      principles. Don's approach to practicing law throughout his      career--his meticulousness in understanding and presenting      facts accurately and his insistence on coherently laying out      reasons for the positions he is urging--proves beyond      question that Don will protect and promote the rule of law.       Finally, Don has a deeply ingrained habit of civility. Not      only in court, but in private interactions, with co-counsel,      colleagues, and lawyers who are adverse to his clients, Don      maintains his equanimity and politeness and engages in calm,      reason-based discussion. His character will serve the highest      traditions of the Solicitor General's office.       We expect that the Senate, after full inquiry, will see all      the virtues we know from firsthand experience that Don      possesses. He is the consummate professional, and we hope      that the Senate will confirm Don promptly to serve as the      Solicitor General.           Sincerely,     Richard G. Taranto,       Farr & Taranto.     Carter G. Phillips,       Sidley Austin LLP.

Re Nomination of Donald B. Verrilli Jr. for the Position of          Solicitor General.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Chairman,     Hon. Charles Grassley, Ranking Member, U.S. Senate Committee        on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Grassley: We have      served as Solicitors General in the administrations of      Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, William Clinton,      and George W. Bush. We write in strong support of the      nomination of Donald Verrilli to become Solicitor General of      the United States.       Some of us have worked alongside Mr. Verrilli as co-     counsel; some of us have appeared opposite him in cases; all      of us are familiar with his work, his demeanor, and his well-     deserved reputation as a leading member of the Supreme Court      bar. We believe Mr. Verrilli is ideally suited to carry out      the crucial tasks assigned to the Solicitor General and to      maintain the traditions of the Office the Solicitor General.       Mr. Verrilli's long experience representing a wide array of      clients, in combination with his recent experience serving in      senior positions in government, render him particularly well      qualified to address the range of legal issues over which the      Solicitor General is responsible on behalf of the United      States. His well-deserved, stellar reputation as both a      writer and oral advocate, and his deeply ingrained civility      and dedication to the rule of law will well serve all three      branches of government. We wholeheartedly endorse his      confirmation.           Respectfully,                                                    Seth P. Waxman                                                              For:                                        Charles Fried (1985-1989).                                     Kenneth W. Starr (1989-1993).                                     Drew S. Days III (1993-1996).                              Walter E. Dellinger III (1996-1997).                                       Seth P. Waxman (1997-2001).                                    Theodore B. Olson (2001-2004).                                      Paul D. Clement (2004-2008).                                     Gregory G. Garre (2008-2009).
