  According to the NDI, inside Iraq there is an explosion of democratic politics.       . . . NDI will find fertile ground for democracy promotion      initiatives on a scale not seen since the heady days of the      fall of the Berlin wall.  That bears repeating, that the National Democratic Institute finds within Iraq today an explosion of democracy, and fertile ground for democracy promotion initiatives on a scale not seen since the fall of the Berlin wall.  Another finding of the NDI that I think is noteworthy is that the Iraqis are grateful for their liberation.
