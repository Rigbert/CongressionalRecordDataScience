I appreciate the very favorable comments she has made about my legislation. What is interesting about this is it is supported by a whole host--Senator Sanders is supporting it, as well as on the far right we have Senator Coburn and Senator DeMint. So we are not the only ones who feel this way.  But the point I would like to make and ask you if you agree is, $700 billion--you heard me describe how to put that in and understand how much that means to the American people. It is $5,000 for each family who files a tax return. We have an opportunity to save half of that right now. I would encourage the Senator from Maryland to join in this effort because I think it can get done and it could get done during this time.
