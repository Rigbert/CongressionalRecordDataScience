Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2069, a bill to permit the conveyance of land in which the fire station in Powell, Wyoming, is located. This bill is necessary because the existing patent contains a requirement that does not allow the city to sell this land and use the proceeds to move the volunteer station to a better, safer location.  The current fire estimation is too small to hold the fire department's new equipment and is located at Powell's busiest intersection. This situation has created a safety issue for both people traveling through Powell, and for the fire department when it goes out on calls. On numerous occasions, the fire department has been caught in traffic and was unable to respond quickly to calls.  This land was originally deeded to the Powell township by the Bureau of Reclamation in 1934 with the stipulation that the land be used in perpetuity for public purposes.  Mr. Speaker, S. 2069 will waive this condition of the patent, thereby allowing the land to be sold and proceeds used to purchase a lot in a better location to serve the needs of the community.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
