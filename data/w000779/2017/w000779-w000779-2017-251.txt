President, I thank my friend from Massachusetts. In fact, I have to leave the floor right now to wrap up business for a very important Finance Committee meeting tomorrow. It is a markup where we are going to be looking at ways as part of the transformation of Medicare--what I call updating the Medicare guarantee--that some of the technologies my friend from Massachusetts talked about are going to be available to seniors.  I know our friend from New Hampshire has arrived, and she has been a very strong advocate of principles of net neutrality.  I yield the remainder of my time to her.
