Speaker, recent days the new House majority has shown a distinct lack of bipartisanship.  However, today, the Republicans are waking up to the need for reform and are offering legislation to ban gifts to Members of Congress. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting both House Resolution 250 and the Gingrich amendment which will send a strong signal to our constituents that we don't want gifts, we don't need them, and, most importantly, that this House is not for sale.  Regrettably, there are those in this House who do not want reform. They want to continue the practices of the past. The want all Members to be tainted by their need to get free travel and lodging at golf, tennis, and sking charity events. They would have us believe that Members of Congress somehow deserve different treatment than the average American--this is just plain wrong--and I urge my colleagues to reject it.  Today's vote is long overdue, but there are other reform efforts that need to be acted upon, particularly campaign finance reform.  Last year, I voted for a campaign finance reform bill, supported by Common Cause, which would have set spending limits and reduced the influence of special interests in political campaigns. This bill never made it to the President, but I am hopeful that we can work together in a bipartisan manner to develop a fair campaign finance reform plan this year. We need campaign finance reform if we truly care about changing the nature of politics and encouraging Americans to stay involved in the system.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support true gift ban legislation, and I look forward to passing a campaign finance reform bill. Thank you.
