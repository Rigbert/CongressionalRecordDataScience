 President, I take a back seat to no one on issues associated with improving the lives of seniors and the disabled.  As ranking member on the Aging Committee, I oversaw critical hearings into deep and persistent problems in our Nation's nursing homes. I was the principal author of the Medicare Part D prescription drug bill which is currently providing our seniors and people with disabilities with affordable prescription medications.  On the disability front, one of my proudest achievements is the enactment of legislation I sponsored along with the late Senator Ted Kennedy, the Family Opportunity Act, which extends Medicaid coverage to disabled children.  In large part, through my efforts, the Money Follows the Person RebalancingAct, and the option for States to implement a home- and community-based services program were included in the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005.  Along with Senator Kerry, I have introduced the Empowered At Home Act which, among other things, revises the income eligibility level for home- and community-based services for elderly and disabled individuals.  If I thought that the CLASS Act would add to this list of improvements to the lives of seniors or the disabled, I would be first in line as a proud cosponsor of the CLASS Act.  But the CLASS Act does not strengthen the safety net for seniors and the disabled.  The CLASS Act compounds the long-term entitlement spending problems we already have by creating yet another new, unsustainable entitlement program.  The CLASS Act is just simply not viable in its current form.  It is almost certain to attract the people who are most likely to need it--this is known as adverse selection.  That will cause premiums to increase and healthier people to drop out of the program.  It is the classic ``insurance death spiral.''  On November 13, the administration's own Chief Actuary confirmed this. The Chief Actuary issued a dire warning in a report on the CLASS Act in the House bill which is virtually identical to the Senate version.  The Chief Actuary said:       There is a significant risk the problem of adverse      selection would make the CLASS program unsustainable.  The CLASS Act has been characterized by the Washington Post editorial page as a ``gimmick.''  For the first 10 years, the CLASS Act saves money at the beginning because it collects premiums before benefits start getting paid out.  But sometime afterwards, it starts to lose money.  We all know what happens from there. It will become the taxpayers' responsibility to rescue the program as it fails.  Look at the financial struggles of Social Security. Look at Medicare. Look at Medicaid.  Now go home and look at your children and grandchildren.  Voting to protect the premiums of a program that you know will fail is irresponsible.  Creating the unsustainable CLASS Act is irresponsible.  Adding the ticking timebomb of yet another unfunded liability to our children and grandchildren through the CLASS Act is irresponsible.  The responsible vote is to strike the CLASS Act from the bill; I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record two items. First is an article from Fortune magazine on the CLASS Act. Second is a letter signed by seven of my Democratic colleagues objecting to the CLASS Act.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 [From Fortune Magazine, Sept. 3, 2009]                  The Crazy Math of Health-Care Reform                            (By Shawn Tully)       Embedded in the health-care plan moving forward is a truly      gravity-defying new device: a costly entitlement program      portrayed as a way to save money. So how can you raise      billions with a program that can't even pay for itself? Only      by using the crazy math that governs in the world of health-     care reform.       The gimmick was hatched on July 15 when the Senate      Committee on Health, Education, Labor & Pensions approved a      federal insurance plan for long-term care called the      Community Living Assistance Services and Supports Act, or      CLASS Act.       The plan, which would provide modest benefits to people who      can't perform such simple daily tasks as bathing or feeding      themselves, was one of Sen. Ted Kennedy's last crusades. It      quickly became a favorite among Democrats, who are now adding      the CLASS Act to the leading proposal in the House, H.R.      3200, passed by the Energy & Commerce Committee.       While no one doubts the bill's humane intentions, its      ardent champions have another motive as well. A budget      gimmick allows them to claim that CLASS Act helps pay for      health-care reform.       The Democrats are promising a ``deficit neutral'' plan,      which means that according to rules set by the Congressional      Budget Office, they need to find about $1 trillion in new      taxes and savings over the next ten years. Right how, the      House legislation stands around $250 billion short.       The CLASS Act looks like a gift: It brings in $58 billion      in net tax revenues by 2019, lowering the deficit by an      equivalent amount because only minor costs will be booked      during that period. Under the CBO rules, the CLASS Act      technically covers one-quarter of the $250 billion shortfall      in funds needed to pay for health-care reform.       The gimmick lies in looking only at the CBO's ten-year      budget window. The extra revenues are an illusion because of      the disaster lurking just beyond that horizon.       In fact, none of the $58 billion is available to pay for      the House bill. The CLASS Act is so poorly designed that the      $58 billion reserve and all future premiums won't come close      to covering the generous benefits it's promising.       Here's why the mechanics of the CLASS Act assure its      eventual collapse.       Under the bill, all working Americans would have the option      of contributing a payroll tax averaging $65 a month for long-     term care. The eventual benefit for most recipients would be      $75 a day or $27,000 a year.       It could be used towards nursing-home expenses, but the      main goal is to allow infirm Americans to get the care they      need from aides or therapists in their own homes so they're      not forced into nursing homes.       But the CLASS Act's premiums aren't remotely high enough to      cover a likely deluge of claims. ``It's a microcosm of many      of the weaknesses in the health-care reform bills,'' says      Steve Schoonveld of the American Academy of Actuaries (AAA),      which did an excellent analysis of the CLASS Act.       The plan's main problem is that it encourages what's known      as ``adverse selection''--it will attract an extremely high      proportion of people who are sick and near retirement, and a      relatively small share of the young and healthy needed to      create a sound insurance plan.       One big weakness is that the CLASS Act doesn't screen for      medical problems, or even require information about them.      Hence, workers or their spouses can sign up even if they're      already ill. By contrast, private plans require strict      testing.       Participants in the CLASS program can also start collecting      benefits after just five years, a period the AAA deems far      too short. Workers and their spouses can also stop paying      premiums, then rejoin when they get sick with no penalty.       As a result, the AAA expects that the plan will be swamped      by people who know they have medical problems when they sign      up, and demand benefits right after they've paid for five      years.       The AAA says that the plan would become insolvent by 2021--     just beyond the CBO's budget window--and would have to raise      its premiums to $180 a month to meet its costs, a 177%      increase.       That would put the CLASS Act into a death spiral, since      virtually all younger and even moderately healthy      participants would drop out. It would become a program      exclusively for the old and sick, driving premiums still      higher.       The most likely outcome is that we'll never get to the $180      premiums needed to fund the plan. Congress will be forced to      pay enormous subsidies to keep the premiums low enough to      encourage young and healthy people to sign up. Pressure will      also be intense to raise the benefits to pay for more      nursing-home expenses.       Instead of funding the shortfall in the House bill, the      CLASS Act will create a giant budget shortfall of its own.      Unfortunately, gimmickry like this is the kind of thing that      has fanned public fears about health-care reform doing more      harm than good.                                  ____                                                  U.S. Senate,                                 Washington, DC, October 23, 2009.     Hon. Harry Reid,     Majority Leader, The Capitol,     Washington, DC.       Dear Leader Reid: We write regarding the merger of the      Finance and HELP Committee health reform bills. We know you      face a great many difficult decisions now, one of which is      whether to include provisions from the HELP Committee bill      known as the CLASS Act in the merged bill.       We urge you not to include these provisions in the Senate's      merged bill, nor to use the savings as an offset for other      health items in the merger.       While the goals of the CLASS Act are laudable--finding a      way to provide long term care insurance to individuals--the      effect of including this legislation in the merged Senate      bill would not be fiscally responsible for several reasons.       CBO currently estimates the CLASS Act would reduce the      deficit by $73 billion over ten years. But nearly all the      savings result from the fact that the initial payout of      benefits wouldn't begin until 2016 even though the program      begins collecting premiums in 2011. It is also clear that the      legislation increases the deficit in decades following the      first ten years. CBO has confirmed that the legislation      stand-alone would face a long-term deficit point of order in      the Senate.       Some have argued that the program is actuarially sound. But      this is the case because premiums are collected and placed in      a trust fund, which begins earning interest, and because the      HHS Secretary is instructed to increase premiums to maintain      actuarial solvency. We have grave concerns that the real      effect of the provisions would be to create a new federal      entitlement program with large, long-term spending increases      that far exceed revenues. This is especially the case if      savings from the first decade of the program are spent on      other health reform priorities.       Slowing the growth of health care costs should be a top      priority as we move forward with health reform. Inclusion of      the CLASS Act would reduce the amount of long-term cost      savings that would otherwise occur in the merged bill. The      CLASS Act bends the health care cost curve in the wrong      direction and should not be used to help pay for other health      provisions that will become more expensive over time and      increase deficits.       Thank you for your consideration. We hope that fiscally      responsible measures to improve access to long-term care can      be considered in the future.           Sincerely,     Kent Conrad.
