 Marcelle and I had the pleasure of meeting Andrew and his mother Lucie Whiteford at the bicentennial celebration for Richmond's Old Round Church, and we were so impressed with him. Andrew was born with Down syndrome, and his family started Andy's Dandys as a means for Andrew to have meaningful employment and to provide jobs for other young adults with special needs. His work is in line with the best of Vermont's spirit of service to others, and for that I ask that the article by Lynn Monty from the August 22, 2013, edition of the Burlington Free Press be printed in the Congressional Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                   [From the Burlington Free Press,                              Aug. 22, 2013] Richmond Bakery Cooks Up Job-Training Program and Successful Business       A mother's creative approach to helping her son transition      to adulthood, and all-natural dog treats, are the recipe for      success at Andy's Dandys.       Lucie Whiteford launched the Richmond bakery to help her      son Andrew (Andy) Whiteford, 21, who was born with Down      syndrome, find meaningful employment after high school      graduation.       The business was inspired by her boy's affection for his      rescued hound named Rosie and his love for reading recipes      and baking.       ``I hope for him to be fulfilled, happy, healthy, as      independent as he wants to be, and to continue to be in a      social environment surrounded by people who understand him      and love him,'' Whiteford said of her son.       This Bridge Street bakery is on a mission to illustrate      employability, while producing a high-quality Vermont      product. The original goal of supporting Whiteford in his      growth from high school to adult work life has evolved to      serving other young adults with special needs, and teaching      them real work-based skills that they can take with them in      their job search for future employment.       ``The mission of Andy's Dandys is to employ and train      people to be employable,'' business partner Lesha Rasco said.      She is Whiteford's special educator at Mount Mansfield Union      High School where he will graduate next year.       ``It's the revenue stream that makes the mission part      possible,'' Rasco said. ``In the future we hope that it will      build.''       Rasco designs and implements individualized work training      programs at Andy's Dandys for other young adults with special      needs. She has been an instrumental part of Whiteford's      growth and of developing his business.       The business has grown organically, Rasco said. ``Lucie has      been buying things and paying herself back.''                      Baker, decorater, deliverer       Andrew Whiteford bakes and decorates Andy's Dandy treats      and also makes deliveries and works to promote the business      at trade shows and seasonal events.       Andy actually goes by Andrew.       ``His name is Andrew. We don't call him Andy,'' Lucie      Whiteford said.       ``Call me Andy,'' Andrew Whiteford said with a smile.       ``He is yanking my chain,'' Lucie Whiteford said. ``The      business was named Andy's Dandys because we wanted some link      to Andrew, because this was for him, and because it has a      nice ring to it. Should we decide to one day make something      other than pet treats, we won't have to change the name.''       On a recent morning, a baker's apron was folded in half,      and tied around his waist, not around his neck, just the way      he requested. Andrew Whiteford was just as meticulous about      dipping each one of the many freshly baked molasses dog bones      into bright orange yogurt frosting, as he was about donning      his apron.       ``There are all kinds of colors, like blue, orange, and      sometimes brown,'' he said. ``I want to sell these in Las      Vegas and on a Hawaii beach someday. I am not joking. It's      true.''                        Preservative free treats       Joking or not, Andy's Dandys has taken off.       The business started in 2008. Andrew Whiteford began by      selling the treats in school and at Saint Michaels's College,      where his father Tim Whiteford is an associate professor of      education.       By fall of that year a few hundred of the colorful dog      treats sold from a couple Chittenden County convenience      stores. Overall, 8,500 treats sold that year.       The bakery uses human-grade ingredients and the treats are      preservative-free.       Today, the bakery turns out thousands of treats each week,      which sell at about 95 stores in Vermont, New Hampshire,      upstate New York, and Maine. Thirty-two thousand treats sold      in 2012.       ``This year we are pacing about 20 percent ahead of where      we were last year, and last year was a 100 percent increase      over 2011,'' Lucie Whiteford said.                    Custom shaped for your business       The bakery has started offering custom-shaped treats that      reflect a business' name or product. For example, a flying      pig dog treat for the Northfield Savings Bank instead of the      standard milk-bone biscuit, she said.       ``It's about offering customers a Vermont-made product to      demonstrate support for a small Vermont business such as      ours,'' she said. ``They gave us a shot, and I understand      that customers really love them.''       Lucie Whiteford came on staff full-time last month after      leaving her position as an account executive at Fox 44 TV.      She hopes to begin drawing a salary as the new quarter starts      in September.       ``It's profitable now which is why I was able to leave my      job to do this full time,'' she said. ``Now that I can work      on this business full time, I expect to be able to double      sales again in a year's time.''                           The biggest reward       More than revenues, Lucie Whiteford's biggest reward is      watching her son succeed in adulthood. She said raising a      child with a disability has been enlightening and rewarding.       ``We celebrate what most people consider mundane      accomplishments, such as learning to speak well enough to be      understood, learning to button a shirt or tie a shoe,'' she      said.       Andrew Whiteford has always pushed himself to achieve goals      singing a solo at the senior recital, snowboarding down a      black diamond trail, and teaching himself how to dip dog      treats with two hands at once, his mother said.       ``He continues to exceed our expectations, reminding us      that we should be mindful about not setting the bar low just      because he has a disability,'' she said. ``As a family we      have all grown so much in terms of learning patience,      patience and more patience.''       Andrew Whiteford has come into his own in the past few      years, his sister Marie Johnson said. ``He has a definite      interest in this business now,'' she said. ``He has developed      a sense of ownership.''       Their mother agreed. ``Andrew turned a corner this summer.      He decided he wanted to     come here and work with me. It was what it was all for, and      me sticking with it, and having it be a part of our lives,      and having it become the thing he has decided to do it, I      couldn't be happier,'' she said.       Andy's Dandys manufactures and packages the treats at the      Bridge Street shop, and will be opening a retail store at      that location in mid-September.                               Correction       This story has been updated to reflect the following      correction: Lucie Whiteford launched the Richmond bakery      Andy's Dandys. Her name was misspelled in two instances in a      previous version of this story.                          ____________________
