President, if the Senator will further yield for a question through the Chair, I am sure the Senator is mindful that, in fact, a year ago in February we passed this bill, and we are very proud of our work product. I am sure it could have been better. We produced a very good product on a bipartisan basis, and then we failed to reach agreement with the White House and our colleagues in the House of Representatives.  My concern--which I am sure the leader shares--is that if we don't move in a similar timely fashion this year, we could enact it too late and lose another construction season which would be harmful to our economy and to the number of very good paying jobs that could be created across America with this bill.  I encourage my friend from Tennessee, and in the form of a question, I ask him if my hope is well placed that we can move quickly on this measure.
