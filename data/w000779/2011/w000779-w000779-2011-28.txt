President, on November 4, one of the Oregon National Guard's most remarkable military leaders will retire: BG Charles Yriarte.  General Yriarte has served the citizens of Oregon, and the United States, in the Oregon National Guard for over 40 years. He joined as a private and has held numerous positions, including troop commander, battalion commander, brigade commander, and is ending his service as an assistant adjutant general.  Oregonians hold the men and women of our National Guard in high regard, and General Yriarte is one example of why. While serving as a model citizen soldier, he has raised his children, maintained a civilian career as a U.S. Forest Service civil servant and also assisted his family with their cattle ranch in Burns, OR. His dedication to his family runs deep. When General Yriarte was promoted to the rank of Brigadier General, the ceremony was held at St. Charles Hospital in Bend, Oregon, so his father, who was undergoing treatment, could be present. But, when duty has called, General Yriarte has always answered, many times at great sacrifice to himself. Joining the Forest Service in 1974 was his dream job, but after the attacks of September 11, 2001, he took on a number of critical full-time assignments in the Oregon National Guard.  General Yriarte deployed to Iraq shortly after the war commenced and was placed in charge of Joint Base Ballad, in an extremely hazardous environment, with the duty of making the base functional for U.S. and allied soldiers. General Yriarte worked to improve relations with local leaders to lessen the daily mortar attacks and reduce the threat to his soldiers and the base in the early stages of the war. This outreach was a tremendous success and led to a strong relationship and enduring friendship with many of the local community leaders. His tireless effort to secure the base ensured the safety of several thousand servicemembers on base and reduced the attacks and violence outside the perimeter. General Yriarte accomplished thismission in spectacular fashion and he successfully returned his unit to Oregon with no casualties.  In each command, the units under him excelled in every way. His mentorship of young officers and noncommissioned officers has been truly exceptional. The soldiers that he has taught are now serving in the most important positions in the Oregon National Guard. These soldiers will have positive impacts on the institution for decades to come. General Yriarte's legacy will be lasting and profound within the Oregon National Guard.  To understand General Yriarte's ability to inspire, here is what he said during his unit's homecoming event:       Every person in this room has sacrificed. I wouldn't be      here today without your sacrifices. You did this country      great, and I applaud you. This room is filled with heroes      both past and present. I went to Iraq because I love my      country. I found out that the Iraqis are good people and like      everyone are looking for safety for themselves and their      families. I already knew, but it was proven that American      soldiers never quit. They do their job. You are this nation's      greatest generation, and you became leaders when you came      home. Our soldiers are doing that now. Our nation is great,      we remain great. . . .  These words also say an enormous amount about him.  So, if I can use the general's own words, let me say that general, you have sacrificed. Your country is better because of your many sacrifices. You have done your State and Nation proud. You are a giant to all you have touched and your love of home and country are an inspiration. You have protected everyone in your charge. You have always given your best. Our Nation will remain great because we have men and women like you in every generation. Like the great military leaders before you, your words and action will positively influence our Nation far into the future.  Therefore, it is my honor and great privilege to commend BG Charles Yriarte, assistant adjutant general, Oregon National Guard, for his more than 40 years of service to our country. Mr. President, today, I join my fellow Oregonians in recognition and celebration of the great achievements of Brigadier General Yriarte, as he begins this new chapter in his life with his beloved wife Christine.                          ____________________
