President, I yield myself such time as necessary out of the time we have available.  I listened to my good friend from Kentucky, and he is my good friend. We have been together on more issues than we have been apart.  I note one thing: As I recall, in reading the reviews of the movie ``Matrix''it was filmed in Australia, so this amendment, I assume, notwithstanding the graphic picture with Keanu Reeves, would not be covered?  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Vermont that particular movie was not made on Federal property. I am sure my friend from Vermont would not be arguing that it ought to have been made on Federal property.
