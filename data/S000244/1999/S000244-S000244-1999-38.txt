Chairman, I yield myself 15 seconds. The leadership has informed me that unless we get this bill done by 2:45, we will rise and we might not come back. So I would implore the Members that we keep the chatter down to a minimum and have this bill on a fast track if it is at all humanly possible.  Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from California (Mr. Calvert), the subcommittee chairman.
