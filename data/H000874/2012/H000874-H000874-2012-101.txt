 The United States continues to stand strongly with our ally Israel. And I am proud to have led an effort earlier this year with the majority leader to strengthen U.S.-Israel military and intelligence relations.  I urge all of my colleagues to unite behind this bill, just as we did behind that one. A nuclear-armed Iran is not an option for the Middle East, for the international community, and for the United States.
