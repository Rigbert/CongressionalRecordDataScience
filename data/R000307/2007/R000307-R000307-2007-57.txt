I just want to make clear, understandably, I would probably vote no--well, not probably--I would vote no on the resolution. But again, the thing that disturbs me is when we get to the what-ifs. What if we pass your resolution? What if we pass somebody else's resolution? What happens if we get the troops out? Hopefully they would not be in a situation where we have to send them back.
