Mr. Speaker, today I want to pay special tribute on the 10th anniversary of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. During the past decade, the institution and its dedicated staff members have worked tirelessly to promote remembrance of the Holocaust and to draw lessons for the future from this very dark chapter of mankind's recent history. When the Museum was dedicated and formally opened in late April 1993, this event culminated over 10 years of preparation that started in 1980 with the chartering of the institution by a unanimous Act of Congress. Recognizing the work of the Museum this week is very fitting, as it is the week of Holocaust Remembrance Day, a time for honoring the millions of Jews who died almost 60 years ago under Nazi tyranny.  As set forth in its mission statement, the Holocaust Memorial Museum has become America's national institution for the documentation, study, and interpretation of Holocaust history, and is this country's memorial to the millions of people murdered during the Holocaust. The Museum and its International Archives Project focuses on all individuals who suffered during the Holocaust, in addition to the six million executed Jews, the horrific Nazi treatment of millions of Roma, disabled, religious and political prisoners, and prisoners of war. The Museum plays a critical role in advancing and disseminating information, documenting the historicity of the Holocaust, while also preserving the memory of individuals who suffered.  While insuring that the lessons of the past will not be forgotten, the Museum has actively and creatively developed ways to work towards a better future. The institution's dedication to dealing with the horrors of genocide, whether in Nazi Germany, Bosnia, Rwanda or Cambodia is a critical part of the effort to mobilize international action against this plague on all humanity. The Committee on Conscience plays a particularly significant role in bringing timely attention to acts of genocide or related crimes against humanity.  The Museum has rightfully become one of Washington's most revered attractions. The hundreds of thousands of visitors who have toured the Museum since its opening have left with an unforgettable experience and the opportunity to reflect on the deep moral questions stemming from the tragedy of the Holocaust. The Museum's research center has served as a critical resource for scholars who try to help us better understand the lessons of this terrible chapter of human history. The creation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum has also encouraged other countries to move to establish comparable institutions including, most significantly, in Berlin, Germany.  The U.S. Helsinki Commission, which I co-chair, has worked with the Museum on several occasions, from pushing for the release of documents from the Romani concentration camp in Lety, Czech Republic, to urging Romania to give greater meaning to its stated commitment of rejecting anti-Semitism by removing Antonescu statues from public lands. In response to the alarming spike of anti-Semitic incidents found last summer in Europe, myself and other Members of the Commission have been very active in urging governments and elected officials to denounce the violence and ensure their laws are enabled to prosecute the perpetrators. In support of this effort, I have introduced H. Con. Res. 49, urging, among other things, European states to ``promote the creation of educational efforts throughout the region encompassing the participating States of the OSCE to counter anti-Semitic stereotypes and attitudes among younger people, increase Holocaust awareness programs, and help identify the necessary resources to accomplish this goal.'' It is my hope that other countries will copy the unique and effective model of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.  Congress has designated April 27th to May 4th as ``Days of Remembrance,'' when our nation will commemorate again the victims of the Holocaust. May we use this time of reflection that will reinforce our common determination to learn from history's harsh lessons.                          TRIBUTE TO TOM SHARP                                 ______                                                            HON. SCOTT McINNIS                              of colorado                    in the house of representatives                       Wednesday, April 30, 2003  Mr. McINNIS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize Tom Sharp, a helicopter pilot from Telluride, Colorado and thank him for the contributions he has made to local search and rescue efforts. Tom recently risked his life and his helicopter to save two avalanche victims trapped on a steep slope near Telluride Ski Area, and today I would like to honor his service before this body of Congress and this nation.  Tom has been a pilot with Helitrax, a heli-ski guide service, for over twelve years. When he was called to assist in the rescue of two skiers caught in an avalanche, he immediately responded along with two Helitrax guides, braving a dangerous landing near one of the injured skiers before picking up more rescuers and dropping off more medical supplies. Then Tom made a daring attempt to reach the other skier, flying close to dangerous jagged rock in spite of unpredictable afternoon winds. Though he was unsuccessful, Tom and his fellow rescuers dropped supplies to the stranded skier that allowed him to climb out of the couloir and communicate with rescuers.  Mr. Speaker, pilots with the expertise and skill of Tom Sharp are crucial to successful search and rescue operations, and it is a great privilege to honor Tom here today. His years of experience and his willingness to take risks are a tremendous asset to the citizens of Telluride and to all of Colorado.                          ____________________
