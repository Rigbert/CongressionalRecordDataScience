 President, as a practical matter, I repeat what I said earlier. The offering of amendments to the rest of the tree would be a waste of time. Several of the amendments my colleagues want to offer would not be germane postcloture.  We are, as a result of the actions of the other side, on a glidepath to two cloture votes on Tuesday. But we will have an opportunity to discuss amendments that would have been offered could they have been offered and that would have been offered, if this parliamentary situation would have allowed it.  I encourage, in addition, Senator Burns, who has already talked about his amendment, and Senators Sessions, Thompson, Lieberman, Nickles, Hatch, and Hagel to take the opportunity--if not today at least on Monday--to come over to the Senate and describe the amendments they would have offered and put them in the Record so everyone is aware of the opportunities that were missed.  I was listening with some interest to the Senator from Arizona earlier in describing what he perceived to be the position of the business community in this country with regard to non-Federal money. The Senator described the views of a business group which until a few months ago no one had ever heard of, and more specifically the recommendations of a subcommittee of that group that was dominated by businessmen who have contributed to Democrats over 2-to-1 and leaving out of the description the remainder of that business groups' views on campaign finance reform, which are for public funding, taxpayer funding, of elections and spending limits, which is such a bizarre position these days. It hasn't even been advocated by the other side in the last few years. I think it is safe to say that this little-known business group does not represent the views of American business.  Let me take a few moments to outline the views of American business on the issue before us.  There are 10 business groups representing over 4 million businesses, and 40 million employees representing the Business and Industry Political Action Committee, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Mining Association, the National Restaurant Association, the National Association of Realtors, the National Association of Manufacturers, the National Association of Business Political Action Committees, the Associated Builders and Contractors, the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors, and the National Association of Broadcasters, a media group, all of whom signed the following letter:       As the leading business associations in America, we oppose      the current campaign finance reform legislation being debated      in the Senate and strongly oppose that which recently passed      the U.S. House of Representatives. * * * the tenets of      McCain-Feingold and the House-passed Shays-Meehan Bill run      contrary to the First Amendment guarantees of freedom of      speech.                           *   *   *   *   *       Further regulating issue advocacy should be rejected as an      infringement on the basic right of free speech. We are also      concerned that these bills decrease opportunities and      incentives for citizen participation in the election process.                           *   *   *   *   *       Just as over-regulation distorts the commercial      marketplace, so can over-regulation distort the marketplace      of political ideas.                           *   *   *   *   *  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letter be printed in the Record, as well as an excellent letter from the National Association of Manufacturers on the same subject, and a letter by the Chamber of Commerce on the same subject.  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                       Business-Industry Political                                  Action Committee of America,                                  Washington, DC, October 7, 1999.     Hon. --     U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear --: As the leading business associations in America,      we oppose the current campaign finance reform legislation      being debated in the Senate and strongly oppose that which      recently passed the U.S. House of     Representatives. While most of the nation's business      community agrees with the need for some meaningful reform of      the Federal laws regarding campaign finance, the tenets of      McCain-Feingold and the House-passed Shays-Meehan Bill run      contrary to the First Amendment guarantees of freedom of      speech.       This week, the U.S. Supreme Court will be hearing yet      another case on the constitutionality of limiting free      speech. Further regulating issue advocacy should be rejected      as an infringement of the basic right of free speech. We are      also concerned that these bills decrease opportunities and      incentives for citizen participation in the election process.       Comprehensive campaign finance legislation has not been      passed since 1974 and contribution caps established at that      time have not been adjusted for inflation. The maximum      contribution of $1,000 in 1974 is worth only $303 today.      These artificially low ceilings have forced candidates and      political parties to seek alternative ways to finance      effective participation in the election process. Candidates      now have more voters to reach and the cost of campaigning      continues to rise.       Just as over-regulation distorts the commercial      marketplace, so can over-regulation distort the marketplace      of political ideas. Rather than regulating more, we would      suggest both complete and immediate disclosure of all      campaign contributions and raising or eliminating limits on      individual and PAC contributions.       Eliminating or further limiting financial alternatives      basically used to fund get-out-the-vote drives or issue      awareness efforts, without corresponding actions to raise      personal and corporate limits, only exacerbates the funding      shortfalls of current campaigns and the increasingly lower      voter turnout.

Verstandig,            Senior Vice President, Govt. Affairs, National            Association of Realtors; Jerry J.

Fritts, President and CEO, National Association of            Broadcasters.                                  ____                                              National Association                                             of Manufacturers,                               Washington, DC, September 20, 1999.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: On behalf of the more than 14,000      members of the National Association of Manufacturers,      including approximately 10,500 small manufacturers, I want to      applaud your efforts in protecting the First Amendment rights      of individuals and organizations to participate in the      political process by opposing attempts to further regulate      campaign finance and political speech.       I want to share our thoughts on campaign finance reform      with you:       1. While the NAM has no formal policy on soft money,      manufacturers know that just as over-regulation distorts the      commercial marketplace, so can over-regulation distort the      marketplace of political ideas. The so-called soft money      issue emerged in response to earlier regulatory restrictions      imposed on the political system. Adding another layer of      regulations to cover the failures of previous regulatory      efforts will inevitably lead to further distortions. The NAM      believes that raising limits on individual and PAC      contributions is long overdue. The NAM supports full      disclosure of campaign contributions.       2. The NAM is completely opposed to total or partial      government funding of congressional campaigns. The NAM      believes that our representative form of government functions      best when candidates seek voluntary contributions from      private citizens or citizen groups. Government funding      through tax dollars of candidates for the U.S. Senate and      House of Representatives would constitute drastic and costly      change in our electoral process. Such unwarranted federal      intrusion into the election process would also reverse the      present healthy trend toward a reduction in the many      pervasive levels of bureaucracy in the federal government. On      PACs: As many as 20 million Americans participate in nearly      4000 PACs. That is almost half of the total number of people      who voted in the last election cycle. PAC participation is an      exercise in free speech and voluntary political activity that      has brought millions into the political process.       3. The Supreme Court has decided that money is a form of      speech. So, limitations on giving as a form of political      speech, whether voluntary or coerced, are limitations on the      ability to exercise free speech. Those of us in industry that      have been highly impacted by government regulation know that      elections have consequences and limitations on our ability to      be involved in the process is consequential to the support      and election of pro-growth candidates.       4. Issue advocacy restrictions are very worrisome and      almost certainly unconstitutional. If the NAM ran ads today      about health care or Social Security reform that mention a      Congressman's vote on those issues but do not urge the      election or defeat of the Congressman, that's perfectly legal      under current law (for example, ``thank-you'' ads      manufacturers have run in recent years). Under previous      versions of the McCain-Feingold plan, this would change.      Running ads more than 60 days before a general election would      be constitutionally protected free speech, but running      identical ads less than 60 days before an election would be      highly regulated speech. NAM has no formal policy on      restrictions on issue advocacy, but is very troubled by them.       5. The role of organized labor in the political process is      not adequately addressed by proponents of reform. The      involuntary collection of union dues for political purposes      is anathema to democracy. NAM policy states that ``The      involuntary collection and use of funds by labor unions for      political purposes should be prohibited by statute. The NAM      supports the codification of the Beck Supreme Court decision      and further paycheck protection measures that ensure that      union members cannot be forced to have mandatory union dues      go to political causes or organizations they do not      support.''       In recent years, these five areas of concern have been the      principal reasons why the NAM has opposed campaign finance      reform legislation and the NAM Key Vote Advisory Committee      has named campaign finance reform a Key Manufacturing Vote.      The NAM has long advocated individual freedom and      participation by all citizens in the legislative and the      political process. Therefore, we must again oppose the      McCain-Feingold legislation.       For all these reasons, oppositiion to McCain-Feingold, like      the Shays-Meehan bill in the House, will be designated a Key      Manufacturing Vote in the NAM voting record for the 106th      Congress.       We greatly appreciate your leadership on this important      issue.           Sincerely,     Jerry J. Jasinowski.                                  ____                                        Chamber of Commerce of the                                     United States of America,                               Washington, DC, September 14, 1999.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: On behalf of the U.S. Chamber of      Commerce, the world's largest business organization      representing more than three million businesses of every      size, sector and region, I want to applaud your efforts in      protecting the First Amendment rights of individuals and      organizations by opposing attempts to regulate ``issue      advocacy.''       The U.S. Chamber has long advocated individual freedom and      unrestricted participation by all citizens in the legislative      and the political process. Therefore, we oppose the McCain/     Feingold legislation. By restricting issue advocacy, we      believe the legislation is an infringement on the      constitutionally protected right of free speech of      individuals and organizations.       After numerous press reports we feel it is imperative to      clarify our differences with some groups. The Chamber      believes in reasonable campaign finance reform proposals. We      support a system that relies on full disclosure, voluntary      participation, and the confidence in the electorate to make      sound decisions through the free exchange of ideas and      information. We believe true reform protects the First      Amendment rights of American citizens, organizations and      parties.       The Chamber does not support taxpayer financing of      congressional races as it would dangerously extend the      government's role in the traditionally voluntary political      process based on individual choice. We believe spending      limits are unconstitutional and we will continue to adamantly      oppose restrictions on the use of ``issue advocacy'' as an      infringement on First Amendment rights.       We greatly appreciate your leadership on this important      issue.           Sincerely,                                                              Tom.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it has been suggested that somehow members of the business community believe they have to contribute to political campaigns. Nothing could be further from the truth. I am familiar with a number of companies that do not contribute non-Federal money, as is their right. We appreciate those who do choose to support our party and give us an opportunity to engage in issue advocacy, voter turnout, and other projects that are funded by non-Federal money, which gives us an opportunity to compete in the marketplace of ideas and gives us a chance to win elections. For those who do choose to participate, we want to thank you.  I also suggest to those who do not want to, don't feel obliged to. There are plenty other members of the business community who want to get involved, who want to help advance the cause that my party stands for, and we are grateful for their support.  I don't know whether we are going to have any more speakers. I want to check with our floor staff and see if we might not be at a point to wrap it up.
