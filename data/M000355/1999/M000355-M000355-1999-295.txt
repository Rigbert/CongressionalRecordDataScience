 President, I rise today to pay tribute to the Rev. H. Donald Cockerham for 30 years of dedicated service to the members of Zion Missionary Baptist Church in Louisville. His devoted congregation recently honored him by writing and performing a play about his life, and I am proud to join in their celebration of this milestone anniversary for both Rev. Cockerham and the church body.  Rev. Cockerham, born in McComb, Mississippi, first came to Louisville in 1969, to preach at a foreign missions rally. At that time, he was the minister at Calvary Baptist Church in Chicago, but after filling-in as speaker at Zion one Sunday, Zion began to pursue Cockerham as a candidate for pastor. Although he was serving another church, he said he felt called to accept the invitation to lead Zion's congregation.  By all accounts, Zion flourished under Rev. Cockerham's leadership. During his 30 years as pastor, the church building changed significantly, with the construction of a new wing. Also, the addition of a new organ and piano have surely been a blessing to the church choir when they perform their well-known presentation of the ``Messiah'' each Christmas. During Rev. Cockerham's time as pastor, Zion has also significantly increased opportunities for youth through additional ministry programs.  Rev. Cockerham was not only deeply involved in his church, but was also an integral part of the community. Over the years, he has been involved in the WHAS Crusade for Children, a project which raises funds to help with the care and treatment of handicapped children in Kentucky and southern Indiana. Reverend Cockerham has won numerous awards and distinctions during the past 30 years, and was recognized most recently by the Louisville YMCA as a 1999 Adult Black Achiever.  I am certain that the legacy of commitment to faith that Rev. Cockerham has left will continue on, and will encourage and inspire those who follow. Reverend, best wishes for many more years of service, and know that your efforts to better Zion Missionary Baptist Church and the Louisville community will be felt for years to come. On behalf of myself and my colleagues in the United States Senate, thank you for giving so much of yourself for so many others.  Mr. President, I also ask that an article which ran in Louisville's Courier-Journal on June 12, 1999, be printed in the Record following my remarks.  The article follows:               [From The Courier-Journal, June 12, 1999]       Faith in Action--Church Honors Pastor's 30 Years With Play       At Zion Missionary Baptist Church, members are busy showing      their pastor how much they appreciate his hard work and      dedication.       The Rev. H. Donald Cockerham will celebrate 30 years as      pastor of the church tomorrow, and the congregation wants      this to be a celebration Cockerham will never forget.       ``It is rare for a pastor to have remained at a church for      30 years, so I wanted to know how I could make this      anniversary more special,'' said Beverly Jones, anniversary      chairwoman.       When Troy Bell, co-chairman of the anniversary committee,      suggested that they write a play as a tribute to Cockerham,      she couldn't resist.       Bell, who has a background in musical theater, wrote,      directed and starred in the play, which is based on the      Broadway musical ``Purlie Victorious.''       ``I changed the title to `Hubert Victorious' because it is      our pastor's first name, and I rewrote this play to correlate      with the pastor's life,'' Bell said. ``This adaptation was a      combination of fiction and non-fiction.''       For a month, Bell and others worked to make the play a      success.       ``I contacted actors and actresses . . . and we went to the      DAV to find clothes and wigs reminiscent of the 1960s,'' Bell      said.       They performed the play Monday night at Derby Dinner      Playhouse.       Cockerham cried and then he laughed and then he cried      again, Bell said.       ``It was a hilarious play,'' Cockerham said. ``Although I      had known about the play for     weeks, I did not know that it would be about me. I was      surprised.''       Sheivel Johnson, publicity and program director for the      church, said faith explains why Cockerham is still pastor      after 30 years.       Cockerham said the congregation's love and compassion for      the community makes his job more pleasurable.       ``A love affair between the people and myself began,      almost,'' when he came to Zion, he said.       The 68-year-old pastor, a native of McComb, Miss., was      pastor of Calvary Baptist Church in Chicago when he was asked      to join Zion in 1969.       ``I came to Louisville to preach at a foreign-mission      rally. At the time, Zion did not have a pastor,'' he said.      ``Their candidate could not speak at their service because he      became ill. When the pulpit committee discovered that I was      in town, they asked me to speak and I accepted.''       Impressed by his sermon, the church body asked him to      become their pastor, but he declined initially.       ``I did not want to change churches because I was their      (Calvary's) first full-time pastor. I had dedicated myself to      building that congregation.''       But shortly afterward, Cockerham changed his mind,      believing that coming to Zion was his fate. ``It occurred to      me that Zion did not have to ask me to be their pastor simply      because they needed one. I believed that the Lord was moving      me in a different direction.''       In 1969, Cockerham received a unanimous vote by Zion's      governing body.       Under Cockerham's leadership, the church has greatly      expanded youth activities and made improvements to the      building including a new annex and a new organ and piano.       Over the years, he has received many awards, including      being named an Adult Black Achiever this year by the YMCA.       For Bell, Cockerham's many accomplishments and recognition      come as no surprise.       ``If there was ever a pastor that was loved unconditionally      by his church family, it is him,'' he said. ``He is the      father to the fatherless.''       Zion Missionary Baptist has been celebrating Cockerham's      anniversary with services all week. The grand finale will      begin at 11 a.m. tomorrow, with dinner served after morning      worship.                          ____________________
