 President, I agree with Senator Dodd. We work on the Banking Committee with this. The SEC has asked us to hold off. We all want to give relief under Sarbanes-Oxley for small businesses. The SEC, PCAOB are in the process of doing this, and this is probably going to happen in the next couple of weeks.  I don't disagree with what Senator DeMint is trying to do, but I think it is premature. The timing is not good. But the timing is always good if we work with the SEC on something they know a heck of a lot about. This is a very complex issue.  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to be printed in the Record.)
