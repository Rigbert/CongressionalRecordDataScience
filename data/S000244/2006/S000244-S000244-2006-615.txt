Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Georgia (Ms. McKinney).  Ms. McKINNEY. Mr. Chairman, many of my colleagues have expressed some bit of surprise at the virulence coming from the Republican Members of the Georgia delegation. Well, let me just say that I am not surprised at all, because I was born in Georgia and I live there. I served in the Georgia legislature with a few of them.  But let me also say that just this week the second attempt by the Georgia legislature to impose a voter ID bill on the people of our State was struck down by the courts in violation of the Voting Rights Act.  We also learned in 2002, in my own election, with the crossover vote, that crossover voting can be used as effectively as the all-white primary was in days past.  So we need the Voting Rights Act. We need it because we are looking at the State of Georgia. We see what you are doing. And now the Nation also sees that the State of Georgia desperately needs to be under the Voting Rights Act because some things still have not changed.
