President, I have been talking for a couple of days now about two amendments that if the American people knew we had the option to do this, they would be very enthusiastic about joining us.  We supposedly have a stimulus bill that should be coming in two categories, one in tax provisions that would stimulate the economy, and the other is in work that needs to be done. I am talking specifically about highways.  I am the ranking member of the Environment and Public Works Committee.
