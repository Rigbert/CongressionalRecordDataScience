President, today I honor Andrea Rogers, the CEO and founding executive director of the Flynn Center for the Performing Arts. I have had the privilege to congratulate Andrea over the years on her many accomplishments within the arts community, including her most recent award from the Vermont Arts Council, the Walter Cerf Lifetime Achievement in the Arts award. Today, I once again recognize her decades of invaluable service to Vermonters and I wish her future success as she retires from her executive director position at the Flynn Center for the Performing Arts after 30 years of dedicated service.  In 1980, Andrea led a campaign to purchase an old movie house in downtown Burlington, with the hope of turning it into a home for performing arts groups. She was successful, and the old building became an independent theatre. Andrea organized many fundraising efforts to restore the antiquated space, and within the next 5 years, the Flynn succeeded in hosting over 350 performances presented by 50 different organizations. Today, 30 yearslater, the Flynn Theatre is known as the Flynn Center for the Performing Arts and is firmly embedded into Chittenden County and Vermont's cultural landscape.  Since its founding, the Flynn has expanded and renovated its space, hosted thousands of diverse performances, opened an art gallery and created many educational programs. Because of Andrea's leadership, the Flynn has received several awards across the state, the country, and even the world. It was the only organization honored by both the Ford Foundation and the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation in 2000. The Flynn's educational program has also been recognized by the Dana Foundation as one of eight outstanding arts programs in the country, and has recently received the Outstanding Historic American Theatre Award at a national conference put on by the League of Historic American Theatres.  I am proud to say that all of these accomplishments happened under Andrea's tenure. She is widely recognized for her passion for performing arts and community development, and her dedication has had an extraordinary impact on the arts in Vermont. Marcelle and I have spent some of our most memorable evenings at the Flynn, and Andrea's enthusiasm for her work and for her colleagues will be dearly missed. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the following article to permanently recognize Andrea's contribution to the State of Vermont.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                    [From the Burlington Free Press]                Flynn Center Director Exits, Stage Right                           (By Sally Pollak)       A monoprint of a jazz trombone quartet hangs above Andrea      Rogers' desk in her office at the Flynn Center for the      Performing Arts. The piece is alive with color--golds and      purple--and appears at first to be an abstract work. But a      second look reveals players, instruments, music stands: art      and music in vibrant harmony. ``I love the alive feeling of      it,'' Rogers said. ``I have all this artwork, and no place at      home to put it.''       Rogers has until the end of the month to find wall space in      her Burlington house. The last day of June will be the final      day of Rogers' tenure as executive director of the Flynn. She      will be succeeded by John Killacky, who has been manager of      the arts and culture program for the San Francisco      Foundation. Rogers, who will turn 70 on July 14, has guided      the Flynn since before its creation--when she and other      community members recognized potential in a dilapidated Main      Street theater being used as a cinema. ``The Flynn was of      interest to me--the potential of the theater to serve as a      performing-arts center,'' Rogers said. She was intrigued by      the idea of preserving a historic building, one whose      existence was threatened, and adapting it to community use.       ``It's something that I saw that needed to be done. I never      dreamed I'd be the director. . . . ``Burlington was my home,      and I could see there was a need. If people want something,      and there's a reasonable chance that they can come together      to make it happen, it can happen. There were many times when      I cried, and wondered if we could pull it off. But I went to      the public: Every step forward we made, it was because the      community was behind us. It was very organic.'' Thirty years      after accepting the job she never dreamed of, Rogers is      stepping down as the only executive director the Flynn has      had.       She has both envisioned the nonprofit performing-arts      center, and guided its growth: The Flynn has a $6 million      endowment, an education department that presents student      matinees, offers classes and develops and implements arts      curriculums in local schools.       The theater presents its own season of shows, commissions      work and plays host to artists' residencies. The Flynn's own      programming has grown from about three shows a year to 50 to      60 annual performances, Rogers said. It serves as a      performance space for other organizations, such as the      Vermont Symphony Orchestra and Lyric Theatre. The smaller      FlynnSpace is a venue for more experimental pieces, where      about 40 percent of the shows are Flynn presentations.       ``I love the Flynn,'' said Jaime Laredo of Guilford, VSO      music director and a violinist and conductor who performs      around the world. ``It's one of the most vibrant arts centers      anywhere, not just in the state of Vermont. ``It's so amazing      what goes on there, the range of things--from symphonies to      country music to Broadway shows to recitals to jazz. I don't      know many places like that. I think it's fantastic. And I      think what Andrea has done is miraculous.''       Bob Dylan and Phish played at the Flynn in the 1990s;      Mikhail Baryshnikov has performed on its main stage three      times; the World Saxophone Quartet blew free jazz on a      winter's night in the late '80s. The contemporary dancer/     choreographer Bill T. Jones presented his first full version      of ``Last Supper at Uncle Tom's Cabin/The Promised Land,''      outside of New York City, at the Flynn. The major work, co-     commissioned by the Flynn and addressing hot-button issues,      included workshops with Jones and dozens of community members      naked on stage as part of the performance.                           Art and community       The Jones piece could serve as Exhibit A in what people say      is Rogers' most important contribution to Burlington:      bringing together art and community, with each step of the      building of the Flynn a commitment to that ideal.       ``Andrea has allowed her life to be defined by the mission      of what the Flynn Center is all about,'' guitarist Paul      Asbell said. ``You do it out of love and a sense of mission.      It is her vision that has been implemented.'' Asbell knows      the Flynn as a performer and an audience member, and he knows      Burlington before the Flynn existed.       ``The contribution to Burlington is too deep to even count      it all,'' Asbell said. ``It's been remarked thousands of      times that for the size of the city, it's incredible the type      of cultural events and musical events and artistic awareness      in Burlington. It's unbelievable what we've grown accustomed      to.''       Along the way, the Flynn has earned a national reputation      among arts organizations and arts funders for its      programming, its audience-building and its community      engagement.       ``To this day, the Flynn stands as model of how to do it      right, how to have a strong artistic program and at the same      time be a central node for community,'' said Philip Bither,      senior curator of performing arts at the Walker Art Center in      Minneapolis. He is the former Flynn director of programming/     artistic director of the Burlington Discover Jazz Festival.       ``We talk about attempting to create cultural commons,      places that a diverse range of audiences can gather and      celebrate live performing arts,'' Bither said. ``The Flynn is      that. It's really a remarkable success story. Andrea has been      there from Day 1, and has really had the vision to see how to      get to that place.''       The audience ranges from wealthy patrons who attend      frequent performances to children in Burlington's Old North      End. Kids not only attend shows, but also participate in      mini-artist workshops: Third-graders at the Integrated Arts      Academy recently had a song swap with singers in the African      Children's Choir--trading and singing songs together.       ``For many children, the only time they walk down Church      Street is when they go with their class to the Flynn,'' said      Joyce Irvine, principal of IAA.                          Active till her exit       With retirement three weeks away, Rogers has little time to      think about her exit. In fact, pending retirement never      looked so active. She tracks jazz festival ticket sales every      day, comparing numbers with last year and the year before--an      activity that shows Rogers takes nothing for granted,      including next season's existence.       ``It takes a lot to keep this going,'' Rogers said. ``It's      not a shoo-in. We start from scratch every year, raising an      operating budget.'' Rogers is immersed in putting together      next season's sponsorship, and then comes the budget for      fiscal 2011. ``The biggest part of what I do is supporting      everybody else,'' Rogers said. She has evening jazz festival      events and shows to attend. ``That part never felt like      work,'' Rogers said. She notes a particular change that will      come with retirement: ``I have to pay now. I'm going to be a      good patron.''                         A community organizer       Rogers came to her work at the Flynn through community      organizing. She grew up in New Britain, Conn., and attended      college at the University of Michigan, where she studied      history, history of art and French. After college, Rogers      moved to New York City, where she lived for almost 10 years.      She worked for the American Field Service, doing community-     service work with teenagers.       She moved here in 1970, interested in living in a small      city and drawn to Burlington by a beloved great aunt and      uncle who lived here, and by her love for skiing and sailing.      Soon after arriving, Rogers started working in community-     based drug-prevention efforts. The job combined her interests      in community organization and working with young people. She      liked the community involvement, setting up and organizing      systems--but the core issue was not where her true interests      lay, Rogers said.       After four years working in drug-abuse prevention, Rogers      became founding director of the Church Street Center for      Community Education, a university-affiliated center that      preceded the Firehouse Center for Visual Arts. Her      involvement with a community effort, spearheaded by Lyric      Theatre, to purchase and renovate the Flynn led to her hiring      as its first director. She was writing grants for the project      and doing other organizational work when Rogers was asked if      she'd open an office, she recalled.       ``Well,'' she replied, ``you have to pay me.'' It was only      a ``pittance,'' she said, but it was enough to persuade her      to devote herself to the Flynn effort. Syndi Zook, executive      director of Lyric Theatre, was a Lyric performer when the      company endeavored to return the theater--then owned by      Merrill Jarvis--to a live performance space. ``We wanted to      put on plays,'' Zook said. ``We didn't want to be engaged in      the multimillion-dollar campaign that it would take to bring      that     beautiful building back to its historic stature.'' That was      left to the newly created Flynn board, and to Rogers.       ``What we were trying to do was save it from the wrecking      ball,'' Zook said. ``What Andrea has done is save this      beautiful historic landmark that is just a jewel in the      center of the city.''       During her years at the Flynn, Rogers said her artistic      sensibility grew to include an appreciation for contemporary      dance. She had always enjoyed music--listening, singing and      playing piano--and contemporary art. ``I found the merging of      music and movement and abstract ideas to be really eye-     opening and exciting,'' Rogers said. ``I came to really      appreciate it, and not to feel the need to totally understand      it.''                          Courage and ambition       Ambiguity and complex, challenging works would become part      of the Flynn's programming. Although Rogers said she had the      authority to manage programming, she chose not to exercise      it. This is the purview of artistic director Arnie Malina and      Bither, his predecessor.       Bither came to the Flynn in 1988 from the Brooklyn Academy      of Music, where he curated experimental music and avante-     garde jazz. Conversations with Rogers before he was hired      indicated the direction she wanted to take the theater. It      was not necessarily what one might have predicted, given the      Flynn's previous programming, Bither said.       ``She said she wanted the kind of new thinking, and      sometimes provocative programming,'' Bither said. ``She      wanted the freshest, most interesting artists that are      happening, not just in New York City but around the world.''       The notion that this kind of programming would work in a      city the size of Burlington was ``a leap of faith, to say the      least,'' Bither said. In those days, management would pin up      fliers for Flynn shows on trips to the supermarket, part of      the effort to fill the house, Bither recalled.       A fund to honor Rogers, Andrea's Legacy Fund, was created      by the Flynn board to raise money for programming and      education, initiatives the board identified as key to Rogers'      tenure. Board chairman Fred ``Chico'' Lager said the goal of      raising $1.5 million in cash is nearly met. With deferred      donations, Andrea's Legacy Fund totals almost $2 million, he      said.       ``Andrea is fiercely committed that we not retreat in any      way, as is the board,'' Lager said. ``She's leaving us in      great shape. The legacy fund will ensure that we will be able      to sustain everything that we are doing, and actually      continue to grow.''       Rogers has her own ideas about her legacy, which she      believes is centered on connecting themes: artistic      excellence and community involvement. ``You never had one      without the other,'' she said. And though events are planned      around her retirement, including a free evening of      entertainment June 26 at the Flynn, called ``Exit Laughing,''      Rogers has her own ideas about how she'd like to leave:      ``Personally,'' she said, ``I would've put a barrel on my      head and snuck out the door.''                          ____________________
