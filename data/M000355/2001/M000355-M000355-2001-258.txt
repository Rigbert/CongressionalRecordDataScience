 I am sure she also shares my opinion that the people who would benefit from a hard money contribution limit increase the most would be challengers who typically have fewer friends and not nearly the network that we incumbents have. They have a smaller group of friends and supporters to try to start with as a way to pool enough resources to get in the game. Does the Senator not think that the principal beneficiaries of an increase in the hard money contribution limits to candidates really will be challengers?
