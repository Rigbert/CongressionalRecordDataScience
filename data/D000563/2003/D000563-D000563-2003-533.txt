DORGAN. Seniors have already made that judgment. They have already decided that. So we want to take $6 billion and give it to private health insurers at a time when Senators have been coming to the Chamber and saying we cannot improve this plan because we do not have any money. I have quotes of all the Senators, and I shall not name them all. I could read lots of quotes from the last 2 weeks of Senators. Why can't we improve it? Because we are limited by money. So now we have $12 billion more? That is what happens when you go into a room, shut the door, make a little deal, and say this is how we want to use this money: We are going to take $6 billion and try an experiment that we failed at previously. It makes no sense to me. It is a byzantine failure, in my judgment, to do it this way.  What I am proposing in my amendment is use the money to actually improve the program for senior citizens. We can drive down the cost of the prescription drug policies and improve the coverage.
