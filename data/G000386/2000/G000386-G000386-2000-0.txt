 President, I have been asked to propound this unanimous consent request which, I have been told, has been approved on both sides.  I ask unanimous consent that immediately following the vote on the passage of the bankruptcy legislation, the Senate proceed to the consideration of H.J. Res. 127, the continuing resolution. I further ask unanimous consent that the resolution be read a third time and that the Senate then proceed to a vote on passage of the resolution, with no intervening action or debate.
