President, I know it is late, and I will be very brief. I want to make a quick response to my colleague and friend from Pennsylvania, Senator Santorum. I am sorry I had to leave the floor while he was speaking.  What I am about to say I would be happy to say with Senator Santorum in the Chamber and would be happy to respond to tomorrow. The Senator from Pennsylvania made the point that he thinks the golden rule here is, the principle here is that every judicial nominee is entitled to a majority vote up or down.  That is an interesting idea, and it might be appealing to some people if they do not know the rules of the Senate. For 214 years, we have said if you bring an amendment, a bill, or a nomination to the floor of the Senate, it is subject to Senate rules. And Senate rules are very clear. Any Senator can take the floor and begin a debate and hold the floor as long as that Senator physically can, unless 60--now 60 members of the Senate--vote otherwise. So you need an extraordinary majority--60 Senators--to stop a filibuster. That is the way it has always been.  In the beginning it was different. Senators could not stop a filibuster until 1919. In 1919 it took 67 votes; a few years back we changed that to 60 votes. But it has always taken more than a majority to stop a filibuster.  In ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,'' Jimmy Stewart is on the floor, holding the floor as long as he did. That is the Senate. That is the tradition of the Senate.  The Senator from Pennsylvania says it has always been a majority vote. Sadly, he is mistaken. There has always been the opportunity for filibuster on a nomination.  So he was mistaken in that assertion.  The second thing the Senator from Pennsylvania was mistaken about was his oft-repeated comments that never, ever, not once in the history of the Senate--we hear it from the Senator from Pennsylvania and others has a filibuster been used on a judicial nomination. It has never been done until the Democrats recently did it to a number of President Bush's nominees.  Unfortunately, again, history is not on the side of the Senator from Pennsylvania. On 12 different occasions, beginning in 1881, filibusters have been used to stop judicial nominations. In 1881, it was Stanley Matthews to be a Supreme Court Justice; 1968, Abe Fortas to be Chief Justice of the Supreme Court was subjected to a filibuster; right on down through the Clinton administration, when, in fact, on two different occasions--maybe more, as I look at this list--there were filibusters applied to Clinton nominees. So for the Republican side of the aisle to consistently state what history tells us is not true is unfortunate.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record this history of filibusters and judges so anyone who follows congressional proceedings can read the names and circumstances for each and every judge who has been subjected to a filibuster in the history of the Senate.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                   History of Filibusters and Judges       Prior to the start of the George W. Bush administration in      2001, the following 11 judicial nominations needed 60 (or      more) votes--cloture--in order to end a filibuster:       1881: Stanley Matthews to be a Supreme Court Justice.       1968: Abe Fortas to be Chief Justice of the Supreme Court      (cloture required \2/3\ of those voting).       1971: William Rehnquist to be a Supreme Court Justice      (cloture required \2/3\ of those voting).       1980: Stephen Breyer to be a Judge on the First Circuit      Court of Appeals.       1984: J. Harvie Wilkinson to be a Judge on the Fourth      Circuit Court of Appeals.       1986: Sidney Fitzwater to be a Judge for the Northern      District of Texas.       1986: William Rehnquist to be Chief Justice of the Supreme      Court.       1992: Edward Earl Carnes, Jr. to be a Judge on the Eleventh      Circuit Court of Appeals.       1994: H. Lee Sarokin to be a Judge on the Third Circuit      Court of Appeals.       1999: Brian Theadore Stewart to be a Judge for the District      of Utah.       2000: Richard Paez to be a Judge on the Ninth Circuit Court      of Appeals.       2000: Marsha Berzon to be a Judge on the Ninth Circuit      Court of Appeals.       Because of a filibuster, cloture was filed on the following      two judicial nominations, but was later withdrawn:       1986: Daniel Manion to be a Judge on the Seventh Circuit      Court of Appeals Senator Biden told then Majority Leader Bob      Dole that ``he was ready to call off an expected filibuster      and vote immediately on Manion's nomination.''--Congressional      Quarterly Almanac, 1986.       1994: Rosemary Barkett to be a Judge on the Eleventh      Circuit Court of Appeals ``. . . lacking the votes to sustain      a filibuster, Republicans agreed to proceed to a confirmation      vote after Democrats agreed to a daylong debate on the      nomination.''--Congressional Quarterly Almanac, 1994.       Following are comments by Republicans during the filibuster      on the Paez and Berzon nominations in 2000, confirming that      there was, in fact, a filibuster:       ``. . . it is no secret that I have been the person who has      filibustered these two nominations, Judge Berzon and Judge      Paez.''--Senator Bob Smith, March 9, 2000.       ``So don't tell me we haven't filibustered judges and that      we don't have the right to filibuster judges on the floor of      the Senate. Of course we do. That is our constitutional      role.''--Senator Bob Smith, March 7, 2000.       ``Indeed, I must confess to being somewhat baffled that,      after a filibuster is cut off by cloture, the Senate could      still delay a final vote on the nomination.''--Senator Orrin      Hatch, March 9, 2000, when a Senator offered a motion to      indefinitely postpone the Paez nomination after cloture had      been invoked.       In 2000, during consideration of the Paez nomination, the      following Senator was among those who voted to continue the      filibuster: Senator Bill Frist--Vote #37, 106th Congress,      Second Session, March 8, 2000.
