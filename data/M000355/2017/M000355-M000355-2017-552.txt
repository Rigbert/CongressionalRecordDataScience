 President, colleagues, we regret to hear that our friend from Arizona will conclude his Senate service at the end of his 6-year term.  I would like to say, on behalf of myself and I think many of my colleagues, we just witnessed a speech from a very fine man--a man who clearly brings high principles to the office every day and does what he believes is in the best interest of Arizona and the country.  I am grateful the Senator from Arizona will be here for another year and a half. We have big things to try to accomplish for the American people. From my perspective, the Senator from Arizona has been a great team player, always trying to get a constructive outcome no matter what the issue before us.  So I thank the Senator from Arizona for his service, which will continue, thankfully, for another year and a half, and for the opportunity to listen to his remarks today
