Speaker, it is my distinct pleasure to announce that the Silver Bell Club, Lodge 2365 of the Polish National Alliance of the United States, will be hosting the 30th Annual Hank Stram-Tony Zale Sports Award Banquet on May 19, 2003, at the Radisson Hotel in Merrillville, Indiana. Twenty outstanding Northwest Indiana High School athletes will be honored at this notable event for their dedication and hard work. These outstanding students were chosen to receive the award by their respective schools on the basis of academic and athletic achievement. All proceeds from this event will go toward a scholarship fund to be awarded to local students.  This year's Hank Stram-Tony Zale Award recipients include Lyndee Lee Arnold of Highland High School, Jennifer Barta of Hammond Morton High School, Jared Byczko of Merrillville High School, Lauren Curosh of Whiting High School, Brittany Drobac of Hobart High School, Lori Granich of Bishop Noll High School, Regina Gregorczyk of Andrean High School, Derrick Holeman of Hammond Gavit High School, Biljana Jasnic of Portage High School, Jovan Jeftich of Valparaiso High School, Brad MacFarlane of Griffith High School, Michael Marszalek of Lowell High School, Sean O'Drobinak of Crown Point High School, Tim Piatek of Munster High School, Chad Pruzin of Crown Point High School, Tiffany Redlarczyk of Lake Central High School, Maggie Reichersamer of Hammond High School, Jason Renn of Valparaiso High School, Todd Schafer of Wheeler High School and Kari Schmidt of Hammond High School.  The featured speaker at this gala event will be Hall of Fame defensive lineman Dan Hampton. Hampton was a menacing, yet versatile, defender who served 12 seasons aggressively protecting the line of scrimmage for the Chicago Bears. An All-American out of the University of Arkansas, he was selected by the Bears in the first round of the 1979 National Football League Draft. Hampton's contribution to the defense as a rookie paved the way for his Hall of Fame career. He recorded 70 tackles, two sacks, two fumble recoveries, and three passes defended in his first campaign, then eclipsed that performance in his sophomore season by recording 73 tackles and leading the Bears with 11.5 sacks. He also earned his first of four Pro Bowl appearances. Dan Hampton will probably be remembered best as a huge part of the Bears' 1985 defense that allowed just 198 points in 16 regular season games, and 10 points in three playoff games, including a dominating performance over the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XX.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my distinguished colleagues to join me in commending the Silver Bell Club, Lodge 2365 of the PolishNational Alliance of the United States, for hosting this celebration of success in sports and academics. The effort of all those involved in planning this worthwhile event is indicative of their devotion to the very gifted young people in Indiana's First Congressional District.                          ____________________
