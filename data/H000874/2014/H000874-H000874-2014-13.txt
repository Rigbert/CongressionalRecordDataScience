 I note in his comments, with respect to next Thursday, that we do not expect to meet on Friday, which I understand, but it does not specifically reference that that will be the end of the session of this Congress and, therefore, conclude the 113th Congress.  Is the expectation, Mr. Leader, that, in fact, Thursday will be the adjournment date for the 113th Congress?  I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY of California. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  The answer to his question is: yes, it is.
