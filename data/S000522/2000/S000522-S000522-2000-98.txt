Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I rise to engage in a colloquy about the funding levels of the bill for the Helsinki Commission. The Commission's budget this year included unobligated funds from previous years, per the understanding of the conference committee.  Do I understand correctly that the chairman and others on the committee will work together in the conference to ensure that the Commission has the necessary resources to continue operations at the current level of activity and staff?
