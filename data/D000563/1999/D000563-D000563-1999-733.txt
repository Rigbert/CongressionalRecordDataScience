President, this past Saturday, January 16th, marked the one-year anniversary of the signing of the Baltic Charter.  I attended that historic ceremony at the White House and our efforts that day were important not only to Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia but to the U.S. as well. This is an issue dear to me; my mother came to this country from Lithuania in 1911 and I've visited this country and the Baltic region several times.  Now Mr. President, the Baltic Charter solidified the international relationship between the U.S. and the Baltic nations by defining the political, economic, and security relations between our countries. It affirmed ashared commitment to promoting harmonious and equitable relations among individuals belonging to diverse ethnic and religious groups. It also stressed the promotion of close cooperative relationships throughout the Baltic region, on such issues as economics, trade, the environment, and transnational problems like the bilateral relations between the Baltics and its neighboring states.  President Clinton welcomed the Baltic nations' efforts to improve relations with Russia. The four presidents involved discussed developments in Northeastern Europe, and President Clinton pledged more U.S. involvement in that region's development and cooperation with its neighbors.  The Baltic Charter does not commit the Baltic states to NATO membership. I believe these nations would be included in NATO, but they will have to meet the same criteria and standards expected of other states that wish to join NATO.  A year ago I noted that this charter would bring the U.S. and the Baltic nations closer than ever before. And, Mr. President, I'm happy to report that the United States has made good on its promise to these nations and I hope we'll do everything we can to strengthen these great new democracies and reaffirm their desire to become full members of the European Union and NATO.  For over 50 years, we have recognized the sovereignty of the republics of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. These great nations are now at the threshold of realizing their important role in the peace and security of Eastern Europe. Therefore, I am proud to submit S. Con. Res. 2 and hope that all members will seize this opportunity to support the Baltic states and their endeavors to further democracy and peace in the region.                          ____________________
