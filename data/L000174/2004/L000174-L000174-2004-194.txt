President, I rise to express my continued disappointment in the Republican leadership's ability to manage the Senate floor effectively. As my colleagues are aware, we have only a few weeks left in this legislative session. Instead of negotiating short-time agreements on a finite number of important amendments, the Republican leader has decided that he would rather slam the door shut for all nongermane amendments.  The Republican leader's actions have frustrated Members on both sides of the aisle who sincerely want to have a productive legislative session. The citizens of this country did not elect us to engage in a staring contest. We should be using our remaining floor time to accomplish consensus legislation.  I note that yesterday the Senior Senator from Idaho observed the following:       We have watched an unusual process this morning. There are      a good many of us in a bipartisan spirit who are reacting to      and I am one of those who does not appreciate what the      majority leader has now just done.  Senator Daschle, who has frequently called for civility and bipartisan action on the floor, similarly expressed frustration. I could not agree with them more.  Senators have a right to have their legislation be considered by their colleagues. And despite the majority leader's actions, even Senators in the minority should be allowed to offer amendments to the class action legislation before us.  Senate Craig acknowledged as much when he ``recognized that Senators, unless effectively blocked by [the] procedural action that has just occurred, do have the right to offer amendments. Germane or relevant and non-relevant.''  Yesterday, the senior Senator from Idaho hoped to offer an amendment with wide bipartisan support that would help protect the security of our country. He should be allowed to offer this legislation. Similarly, other Members of this body should be allowed time for the normal amendment process.  Time and again, the Republican leadership has accused my colleagues of obstructing and refusing to give certain measures an up-or-down vote. Well, this most recent procedural tactic is the majority leader's latest attempt at looking busy with full knowledge that nothing will be accomplished.  Senator Frist's drastic action yesterday has stymied the legislative process and threatened the underlying class actions bill that many of my colleagues have worked so hard on over the past few years.  I am disappointed that the Republican leadership has decided that we can afford to waste another week of floor time when bipartisan measures could have been considered and enacted.  Mr. President, yesterday I received a letter on behalf of 16 environmental protection organizations--American Rivers, Clean Water Action, Defenders of Wildlife, Earthjustice, Earthworks, Environmental Working Group, Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace, League of Conservation Voters, National Environmental Trust, Natural Resources Defense Council, Sierra Club, The Ocean Conservancy, The Wilderness Society, 20/20 Vision, and the U.S. Public Interest Research Group--in opposition to this class action bill.  These environmental protection advocates declare that this bill ``is patently unfair to citizens harmed by toxic spills, contaminated drinking water, polluted air and other environmental hazards involved in class action cases based on state environmental or public health laws.''  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                     July 7, 2004.      Environmental Harm Cases Do Not Belong in Class Action Bill       Dear Senator: Our organizations are opposed to the      sweepingly drawn and misleadingly named ``Class Action      Fairness Act of 2004.'' This bill is patently unfair to      citizens harmed by toxic spills, contaminated drinking water,      polluted air and other environmental hazards involved in      class action cases based on state environmental or public      health laws. S. 2062 would allow corporate defendants in many      pollution class actions and ``mass tort'' environmental cases      to remove these kinds of state environmental matters from      state court to federal court, placing the cases in a forum      that could be more costly, less timely, and disadvantageous      to your constituents harmed by toxic pollution. State law      environmental harm cases do not belong in this legislation      and we urge you to exclude such pollution cases from the      class action bill.       Class actions protect the public's health and the      environment by allowing people with similar injuries to join      together for more efficient and cost-effective adjudication      of their cases. All too often, hazardous spills, water      pollution, or other toxic contamination from one source      affects large numbers of people, not all of whom may be      citizens of the same state or may be from the same state as      the defendants who caused the harm. In such cases, a class      action lawsuit in state court based on state common law      doctrines of negligence or nuisance, or upon rights and      duties created by state statutes in the state where the      injuries occur, is often the best way of fairly resolving      these claims.       For example, thousands of families around the country are      now suffering because of widespread groundwater contamination      caused by the gasoline additive MTBE, which the U.S.      Government considers a potential human carcinogen. According      to a May, 2002 GAO report, 35 states reported that they find      MTBE in groundwater at least 20 percent of the time they      sample for it, and 24 states said that they find it at least      60 percent of the time. Some communities and individuals have      brought or soon will bring suits to recover damages from MTBE      contamination and hold the polluters accountable, but under      this bill, MTBE class actions or ``mass actions'' based on      state law could be removed by the oil and gas companies to      federal court in many of these cases.       This could not only make these cases more expensive, more      time-consuming and more difficult for injured parties, but      could also result in legitimate cases getting dismissed by      federal judges who are unfamiliar with or less respectful of      state law claims. For example, in at least one federal court      MTBE class action, a federal court dismissed the case based      on oil companies' claim that the action was barred by the      federal Clean Air Act (even though that law contains no tort      liability waiver for MTBE). Yet a California state court      rejected a similar federal preemption argument and let the      case go to a jury, which found oil refineries, fuel      distributors, and others liable for damages. These cases      highlight how a state court may be more willing to uphold      legitimate state law claims. Other examples of state law      cases that would be weakened by this bill include lead      contamination cases, mercury contamination, perchlorate      pollution and other ``toxic torts'' cases.       In a letter to the Senate last year, the U.S. Judicial      Conference expressed their continued opposition to such      broadly written class action removal legislation. Notably,      their letter states that, even if Congress determines that      some ``significant multi-state class actions'' should be      brought within the removal jurisdiction of the federal      courts, Congress should include certain limitations and      exceptions, including for class actions ``in which plaintiff      class members suffered personal injury or personal      property damage within the state, as in the case of a      serious environmental disaster.'' The Judicial      Conference's letter explains that this ``environmental      harm'' exception should apply ``to all individuals who      suffered personal injuries or losses to physical property,      whether or not they were citizens of the state in      question.''       We agree with the Judicial Conference--cases involving      environmental harm are not even close to the type of cases      that proponents of S. 2062 cite when they call for reforms to      the class action system. Including such cases in the bill      does no more than benefit polluters in state environmental      class actions at the expense of injured parties in those      cases for no reason other than to benefit the polluters. No      rationale has been offered by the bill's supporters for      including environmental cases in S. 2062's provisions. We are      unaware of any examples offered by bill supporters of      environmental harm cases that represent alleged abuses of the      state class actions.       More proof of the overreaching of this bill is that the so-     called ``Class Action Fairness Act'' is not even limited to      class action cases. The bill contains a provision that would      allow defendants to remove to federal court all environmental      ``mass action'' cases involving more than 100 people--even      though these cases are not even filed as class actions. The      S. 2062 contains a narrow exception to the ``mass action''      removal rule if the injury to the plaintiffs is caused by a      ``sudden, single accident,'' but has no exception for      injuries caused by toxic exposure that occurs over days,      months, or years, as frequently happens in environmental harm      cases.       For example, the bill would apply to cases similar to the      recently concluded state court trial in Anniston, Alabama,      where a jury awarded damages to be paid by Monsanto and      Solutia for injuring more than 3,500 people the jury found      were exposed--with the companies' knowledge--to cancer-     causing PCBs over many years. Documents uncovered in the case      showed that Monsanto kept the public in the dark for decades      regarding what the company knew about PCBs, so the ``sudden,      single incident'' exception would not apply in large measure      because of the companies' own bad behavior. There is little      doubt in the Anniston case that, had S. 2062 been law, the      defendants would have tried to remove the case from the state      court serving the community that suffered this devastating      harm. It is, at best, unjustified to reward this kind of      reckless corporate misbehavior by giving defendants in such      cases the right to remove state law cases to federal court      over the objections of those they have injured.       The so-called ``Class Action Fairness Act'' would allow      corporate polluters who harm the public's health and welfare      to exploit the forum of federal court whenever they perceive      an advantage to doing so. It is nothing more than an attempt      to take legitimate state court claims by injured parties out      of state court at the whim of those who have committed the      injury.       Cases involving environmental harm and injury to the public      from toxic exposure should not be subject to the bill's      provisions; if these environmental harm cases are not      excluded, we strongly urge you to vote against S. 2062.
