 President, today I have the honor of submitting a resolution expressing the sense of the Senate that the Department of Education develop and disseminate educational materials and programs designed to make students in elementary and secondary schools aware of the contributions of veterans and their importance in preserving American peace and prosperity. The resolution also designates the week that includes Veterans Day as ``National Veterans Awareness Week'' to serve as a focus for these educational activities.  Why do we need such an educational effort? In a sense, this action has become necessary because we are victimsof our own success with regard to the superior performance of our Armed Forces. The plain fact is that there are just fewer people around now who have had any connection with military service. For example, as a result of tremendous advances in military technology and the resultant productivity increases, our current Armed Forces now operate effectively with a personnel roster that is one-third less in size than just 10 years ago. In addition, the success of the all-volunteer career-oriented force has led to much lower turnover of personnel in today's military than in previous eras when conscription was a place. Finally, the number of veterans who served during previous conflicts, such as World War II, when our military was many times larger than today, is inevitably declining.  The net result of these changes is that the percentage of the entire population that has served in the Armed Forces is dropping rapidly, a change that can be seen in all segments of society. Whereas during World War II it was extremely uncommon to find a family in America that did not have one of its members on active duty, now there are numerous families that include no military veterans at all. As a consequence of this lack of opportunity for contacts with veterans, many of our young people have little or no connection with or knowledge about the important historical and ongoing role of men and women who have served in the military. This omission seems to have persisted despite ongoing educational efforts by the Department of Veterans Affairs and the veterans service organizations.  This lack of understanding about military veterans' important role in our society can have potentially serious repercussions. In our country, civilian control of the Armed Forces is the key tenet of military governance. A citizenry that is oblivious to the capabilities and limitations of the Armed Forces, and to its critical role throughout our history, can make decisions that have unexpected and unwanted consequences. Even more important, general recognition of the importance of those individual character traits that are essential for military success, such as patriotism, selflessness, sacrifice, and heroism, is vital to maintaining these key aspects of citizenship in the Armed Forces and even throughout the population at large.  Among today's young people, a generation that has grown up largely during times of peace and extraordinary prosperity and has embraced a ``me first'' attitude, it is perhaps even more important to make sure that there is solid understanding of what it has taken to attain this level of comfort and freedom. The failure of our children to understand why a military is important, why our society continues to depend on it for ultimate survival, and why a successful military requires integrity and sacrifice, will have predictable consequences as these youngsters become of voting age. Even though military service is a responsibility that is no longer shared by a large segment of the population, as it has been in the past, knowledge of the contribution of those who have served in the Armed Forces is as important as it has ever been. To the extent that many of us will not have the opportunity to serve our country in uniform, we must still remain cognizant of our responsibility as citizens to fulfill the obligations we owe, both tangible and intangible, to those who do serve and who do sacrifice on our behalf.  The importance of this issue was recently brought home to me by Samuel I. Cashdollar, a 13-year-old seventh grader at Lewes Middle School in Lewes, Delaware, who recently won the Delaware VFW's Youth Essay Contest with a powerful presentation titled ``How Should We Honor America's Veterans?'' Samuel's essay points out that we have Nurses' Week, Secretaries' Week, and Teachers' Week, to rightly emphasize the importance of these occupations, but the contributions of those in uniform tend to be overlooked and many businesses remain open on Veterans Day. In a time when, for some, Veterans Day has simply become an excuse for another department store sale, we need to make sure that we don't become a nation where more high school seniors recognize the name Britney Spears than the name Dwight Eisenhower.  Now, it is appropriate to ask, ``We already have Veterans Day, why do we need National Veterans Awareness Week?'' Historically Veterans Day was established to honor those who served in uniform during wartime. Although we now customarily honor all veterans on Veterans Day, I see it as a holiday that is focused on honoring individuals, the courageous and selfless men and women without whose actions our country would not exist as it does. National Veterans Awareness Week would complement Veterans Day by focusing on education as well as commemoration, on the contributions of the many in addition to the heroism and service of the individual. National Veterans Awareness Week would also present an opportunity to remind ourselves of the contributions and sacrifices of those who have served in peacetime as well as in conflict; both groups work unending hours and spend long periods away from their families under conditions of great discomfort so that we all can live in a land of freedom and plenty.  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to support this resolution; our children and our childrens' children will need to be well informed about what veterans have accomplished in order to make appropriate decisions as they confront the numerous worldwide challenges that they are sure to face in the future. I ask unanimous consent that the text of Samuel Cashdollar's essay be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the essay was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                How Should We Honor America's Veterans?                       (By Samuel I. Cashdollar)       The 11th of November each year is designated as Veterans      Day and is a Federal holiday. Employees of the U.S.      Government get the day off and post offices and most banks      are closed. The President visits Arlington National Cemetery      and lays a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Parades      are held in some places. This isn't adequate recognition of      the contribution veterans have made to America.       Each State is free to decide which Federal Holidays it      wants to recognize. In many States, government offices,      schools, and businesses remain open on Veterans Day. Even      where it's officially observed, Veterans Day comes and goes      with most people not even thinking about the tremendous      sacrifices made by the men and women who served in Armed      Forces and fought for America's freedom.       Today, people celebrate numerous weeks, such as Nurses      Week, Secretaries Week, Teachers Week, etc. These are      important events, but are they any more important than      honoring brave men and women who gave so much for their      country? America is free because of these courageous      individuals who should be honored with their own week.       The U.S. Congress should pass a law establishing a      ``Veterans Week''. All schools should be required to spend a      portion of each day reminding students that it was ordinary      people who fought, were wounded, and even killed in defense      of America. This could be done in each grade level so that      every student would learn something about the wars that our      nation has fought. It could be part of a history class as      well as a lesson about the responsibility of each person to      protect our country. Teachers could easily find stories to      share with students who have no idea what war is like. If      teachers needed help, I'm sure organizations like the VFW      would be glad to participate and even speak to the students.       Veterans Week should be given special attention on      television, too, just like Black History Month. I've learned      a lot about the history of Black Americans from the stories      they feature on television. Movies about heroic battles      should be broadcast all week long. Veterans could talk about      their experiences in those wars.       In conclusion, it's very sad that many Americans know      little or nothing about the great wars our country has fought      in. I believe Veterans Week would do a lot to change that.                          ____________________
