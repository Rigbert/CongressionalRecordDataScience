President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the Committee to Preserve Asylum and various attachments in support of my amendment, signed by the American Friends Service Committee, the American Jewish Committee, Amnesty International, Associated Catholic Charities of New Orleans, Jesuit Social Ministries, Jewish Federation of Metropolitan Chicago, Indian Law Resource Center, and a number of others in support of my amendment be included in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 Committee to Preserve Asylum,                                    Washington, DC, April 8, 1996.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Russell Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: We are an ad hoc coalition of religious      groups, human rights organizations, concerned physicians, and      immigration and civil rights advocates that have come      together to oppose the new bars to applying for asylum      contained in S. 269.       The right to seek asylum is an internationally recognized      human right, incorporated into U.S. law by Congress in the      1980 Refugee Act. It protects individuals fleeing persecution      on account of race, religion, nationality, political opinion,      or membership in a particular social group. Each year the      U.S. grants asylum to about 8,000 people, less than 1% of      legal immigrants. The new bars to asylum contained in S. 269,      the Immigration Control and Financial Responsibility Act,      would seriously undermine human rights protections for these      bona fide refugees.       The new bars to asylum, found in sections 133 and 193 of      the bill, would give low level immigration officers the      authority to exclude and deport without a fair hearing      refugees who were forced to flee persecution without valid      travel documents. For reasons illustrated in the attached      documents, this section would effectively deny asylum to many      human rights victims. It will also cost more money. Senator      Leahy will offer an amendment on the Senate floor that will      preserve procedural protections for people escaping religious      and political persecution.       We urge you to vote for the Leahy amendment.           Sincerely yours,       American Civil Liberties Union.       American Friends Service Committee.       American Jewish Committee.

The new bars to asylum would      punish people whose only means of fleeing repressive      governments is by using invalid travel documents.       Many true refugees are forced to flee persecution without      valid travel documents either     because they do not have time to acquire them or because      applying for them would threaten their lives.       Under current law, a person who arrives in the United      States without valid travel documents and fears persecution      in his or her home country may go before an immigration judge      and prove eligibility for asylum. The asylum seeker may be      represented at the hearing at no cost to the government.       The new bars to asylum would preclude such a person from      even applying for asylum until he or she has proven that he      or she has a ``credible fear'' of persecution and used the      invalid travel documents to flee directly from a country      where there is a ``significant danger'' of being returned to      persecution. This all may have to be proven immediately after      a stressful journey, and without the assistance of counsel or      an interpreter, and without the involvement of any judicial      or quasi-judicial officer.       The new bars and summary procedures are problematic for      several reasons.       A ``false papers'' rule would harm human rights victims. By      definition, asylum seekers frequently fear persecution by the      government of their home country--the same government that      issues travel documents and checks identity papers and exit      permits at the airports and border crossings. It should be      recalled that the United States has long honored Raoul      Wallenberg, who saved countless lives during the Holocaust by      issuing unofficial travel documents so that refugees could      flee further persecution.       Meritorious asylum seekers would be returned to      persecution. The INS has made serious errors while trying to      apply the ``credible fear'' test. Under current law, asylum      seekers who arrive in the U.S. without valid travel documents      are detained pending their hearing unless they prove a      ``credible fear'' of persecution in their home country. Human      rights organizations have documented many cases in which      people were denied parole under this standard, but later were      granted asylum at their hearing before an immigration judge.      Under the new bars to asylum, they would have been returned      to persecution. A summary of some of these case studies is      attached.       The Department of Justice opposes the new bars to asylum.      Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick wrote in her February      14 letter to Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin G. Hatch that      the Justice Department opposes sections 133/193, noting that      ``Absent smuggling or an extraordinary migration situation,      we can handle asylum applications for excludable aliens under      our regular procedures.''       The new bars would deny protection to refugees who had to      change planes on route to the United States. Before being      able to apply for asylum, a refugee who used false documents      would have to prove that they were needed to leave her      country or to transit through another country. This      requirement would prejudice both asylum seekers who flee      countries that do not have direct carrier routes to the U.S.      and those who must travel over land through countries that do      not have asylum laws, that may be friendly with the      government they are fleeing, or that are hostile to people of      their background or nationality. Refugees from Asian and      African countries in particular face this situation.       The new bars to asylum are inconsistent with U.s.      obligations under international law and will inevitably lead      to errors. The new bars lack the minimal procedural      safeguards to prevent the mistaken return of a genuine      refugee to certain persecution. The UNHCR ``fears that many      bona fide refugees will be returned to countries where their      lives or freedom will be threatened'' if the new bars to      asylum become law. (Letter to Sen. Hatch, Chairman Judiciary      Cmte, March 6, 1996).                      vote for the leahy amendment       Bob, a student at the University of Khartoum in Sudan, was      an active member of the Democratic Unionist Party, an anti-     government organization. After participating in a peaceful      student protest, he was arrested by the Sudanese government.      He was detained in a 6 by 11 foot cell with 10 other      prisoners for 2 months. During his imprisonment, he was      repeatedly interrogated and tortured--he was hung by his      hands and feet, beaten and electrically shocked. As a result      of the torture, his elbows are permanently deformed. He      remained active in the democratic movement after his release      from prison. Then, as he was walking to a democratic union      meeting, he was again arrested and imprisoned. A few months      later, while he was still in prison, he suffered a nervous      breakdown because of the torture he suffered. He was      transferred to a hospital, but remained under arrest. Wearing      a nurse's uniform that his mother had smuggled into the      hospital, Bob escaped from imprisonment.       Bob's colleagues from the democratic union smuggled him      onto a freighter bound for Germany. In Germany, he borrowed      another person's ID card to leave the ship. Knowing that the      anti-immigration and NeoNazi movement in Germany had      heightened and that it would be impossible to receive asylum      there, Bob flew from Germany to the United States. He arrived      without a passport. When he exited the plane, he immediately      told the INS that he wanted to apply for asylum. He was      placed in detention. Bob was not released from detention      because the INS interviewer determined he did not have a      ``credible fear'' of persecution. He was granted asylum by an      immigration judge.       Alan, an Indian national, had been persecuted in Kashmir      because of his religion. On several occasions, he and his      family members were imprisoned and tortured by the Indian      government. In July 1994 when the military police sought to      detain him, he evaded arrest. A few months later his family's      home was bombed.       Fearing for his life, Alan fled to the United States using      a false passport. He told the INS he wanted asylum      immediately. He explained to the INS officials that he and      his family had been persecuted by the Indian government. The      INS officers at the airport did not think he was credible.      The officials verbally abused Alan and denied him food and      water until he was brought to a detention center the next      day. Alan was not released from detention because the INS did      not think he had a credible fear of persecution even though      he presented the INS with reports about religious persecution      in Kashmir. Alan was later granted asylum by an immigration      judge.       Sam, a Nigerian national, was an active member of a pro-     democracy organization that was determined to ensure      democratic elections in Nigeria. Shortly before the      elections, the leader of the democracy organization was found      murdered, and several members were arrested and subsequently      disappeared. The State Secret Service went to Sam's house on      election day searching for him. When Sam learned that the      secret service was searching for him, he immediately went      into hiding, afraid that if they found him, he too would      ``disappear'' as his colleagues had.       Sam fled to the United States right out of hiding. He      changed planes in Amsterdam. He traveled with a false U.S.      passport. He was afraid that the Nigerian government would      arrest him if he tried to leave the country with his own      identification papers. When he arrived in the United States,      he immediately told the INS that he wanted asylum. He was      placed in detention. The INS interviewed him to determine      whether he had a credible fear of persecution; the INS      concluded that he did not. He was granted asylum by a federal      court.
