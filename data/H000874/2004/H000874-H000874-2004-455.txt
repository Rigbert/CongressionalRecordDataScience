Speaker, this year marks the 50th anniversary of the establishment of the Maryland-National Capital Building Industry Association. Throughout its existence, the Association has worked to make the dream of independent homeownership for residents of Maryland and Washington, DC a reality.  Under the leadership of building industry pioneer Carl M. Freeman, the MNCBIA received its charter from the National Association of Homebuilders in 1954. And since its inception, the organization has remained true to its mission statement, which reads: ``The Maryland-National Capital Building Industry Association (MNCBIA) is dedicated to organizing, influencing and improving economic growth and legislative, regulatory, social and educational opportunities for all segments of the building industry and the community it serves.''  The MNCBIA is truly demonstrative of the diversity of its trade: The Association is comprised of more than 730 companies representing the interests of more than 18,000 employees of the residential development and building industries. Throughout its existence, the MNCBIA has worked to create an entrepreneurial environment in our area that encourages innovation and competition.  The Association should be strongly commended for its role in the regional economy. In addition to representing the homebuilding industry in local communities, Members are engaged in single and multifamily building, land development, remodeling, rehab and renovation and general light construction. Associate members are companies and individuals who provide materials, products, financing and many other services, including subcontracting, to builders and developers.  Mr. Speaker, because of the hard work of its members, the MNCBIA has contributed to a vibrant building sector in our metropolitan area, and boosted demand for goods and services from the building products industries and other sectors such as construction; consulting engineering, architecture and real estate law.  Successful relationships between the homebuilding industry and residents of Maryland and Washington, DC, are essential for smart growth and mutual satisfaction with the development process. The MNCBIA strives to foster open communication and understanding between these two groups.  The Association has also taken great care to protect the integrity and craftsmanship of the region's home and building designs by establishing the Annual Custom Builder Awards of Excellence, which recognizes local custom builders and remodelers for excellence in construction, architecture, and design.  Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank the Maryland-National Capital Building Industry Association for its numerous contributions to communities in Maryland and Washington, DC during the past 50 years. Housing means more than just a roof over your head: It signifies that you can provide for your family independently. I look forward to working with the Association in the future in its efforts to build safe, affordable homes for the citizens of Maryland and Washington, DC--so that those families can claim their part of the American dream.                          ____________________
