My team lost to his last night. Yankee Stadium was filled to capacity, 56,292 people. The number of lives that have been lost since Roe v. Wade, 44.4 million, and picture this, it would be like filling Yankee Stadium every single day for 788 days full of children who are then slaughtered. The horrific loss of life, that is a staggering loss of life, is beyond almost any of our comprehensions to grasp, and yet that is what has happened in the 30 years since Roe v. Wade.  It has been done in what seems to be the pristine environment of an abortion clinic. We know that is not often case. Many of these so-called doctors are anything but. They are at the lower level of the medical chain, if you will, food chain, and I have known some abortion doctors, some of whom have actually become pro-life, and they talk about the squalor, the killing that goes on every day and the mental impact it even has on them.  So I just want to say to my colleagues that tomorrow we take, I think, a major step forward in trying to stop some of this killing, and I think the logical among us, the logical people out there in America, will begin connecting the dots and saying if it is so horrific to kill a baby with partial-birth abortion, why is suction okay? Why is D & E and all the other methods that are no less gruesome but a little bit more invisible because they do not happen as late in the stage of the pregnancy and they are not as visible as a partial-birth abortion, why are they any less of an act of child abuse? And this is all about child abuse. Again, there are two victims in every abortion, and my hope is that tomorrow we take a step forward in protecting these children from this cruelty.  I thank my good friend.
