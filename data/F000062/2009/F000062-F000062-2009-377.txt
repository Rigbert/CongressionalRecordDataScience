 President, I rise today as chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence on the Senate's confirmation of Leon Panetta to be the next Director of the Central Intelligence Agency.  Mr. Panetta is well-known to many of us for his long, distinguished record of public service, including eight terms in Congress and service as a presidential chief of staff.  Mr. Panetta knows well the inner workings of government at the highest levels. He has an impeccable reputation for integrity, and I am confident that he is the right man at the right time to lead the CIA.  Leon Panetta is a product of my home State, California, born in Monterey. His parents, Carmelo and Carmelina, ran a local cafe and later purchased a walnut ranch, which he still owns. He majored in political science at Santa Clara University, where he graduated magna cum laude in 1960.  In 1963, he received his JD from Santa Clara University as well. After law school, he served in the United States Army from 1964 to 1966, and attended the Army Intelligence School.  In 1966, Mr. Panetta joined the Washington, DC, staff of Republican Senator Thomas Kuchel of California.  In 1969, he served as Director of the Office of Civil Rights in the Office ofHealth, Education and Welfare in the Nixon Administration.  From 1970 to 1971, he worked as the executive assistant to New York City Mayor John Lindsay. Afterward, he returned to Monterey, to private law practice.  In 1976, he ran and won election to the U.S. House of Representatives, and he served in the House for 16 years. During that time, he also served as chairman of the Budget Committee.  In 1993, he joined the Clinton administration as head of the Office of Management and Budget. In July 1994, Mr. Panetta became President Clinton's chief of staff.  He served in that capacity until January 1997, when he returned to California to found and lead the Leon and Sylvia Panetta Institute for Public Policy at California State University Monterey Bay.  Mr. Panetta and his wife, Sylvia, have three sons and five grandchildren.  It is very fair and safe for me to say that he has a reputation for intelligence and integrity.  In speaking with Mr. Panetta and President Obama multiple times, I am convinced that Mr. Panetta will surround himself with career professionals, including Deputy Director Stephen Kappes. He has committed to keeping the senior leadership of the CIA in place, but at the same time has vowed to bring new policies and new leadership to the Agency.  I know Mr. Panetta has immersed himself in CIA matters since being nominated, and his top priority, if confirmed, will be to conduct a complete review of all the Agency's activities.  Moreover, I strongly believe that the CIA needs a Director who will take the reins of the Agency and provide the supervision and oversight so that this agency, which operates in a clandestine world of its own, must have.  President Obama has made clear that his selection of Leon Panetta was intended as a clean break from the past--a break from secret detentions and coercive interrogations; a break from outsourcing its work to a small army of contractors; and a break from analysis that was not only wrong, but the product of bad practice that helped lead our Nation to war.  President Obama said when announcing this nomination that this will be a CIA Director ``who has my complete trust and substantial clout.''  This is a hugely important but difficult post. The CIA is the largest civilian intelligence agency with the most disparate of missions.  It produces the most strategic analysis of the intelligence agencies and it is the center for human intelligence collection. It is unique in that it carries out covert action programs, implementing policy through intelligence channels. The Intelligence Committee held confirmation hearings on Mr. Panetta's nomination on February 5 and 6.  Our responsibility was clear: to make sure that Leon Panetta will be a Director who makes the CIA effective in what it does--but also to make sure that it operates in a professional manner that reflects the true values of this country.  The committee did its work. It questioned Mr. Panetta on a broad array of issues he will confront as Director of the CIA, and it submitted followup questions, all of which were answered.  These questions, and Mr. Panetta's answers, can be found at the Intelligence Committee Web site.  I urge all Members of the Senate, as well as the public, to review them in order to obtain a better understanding of his views about the office to which he has been nominated.  I am pleased to report that yesterday the Intelligence Committee voted unanimously to report favorably the nomination of Leon Panetta to be the Director of the CIA. He has the confidence of the committee, and we believe we will be able to work closely with him during his tenure.  Leon Panetta will mark a new beginning for the CIA as its next Director.  He has the integrity, the drive and the judgment to ensure that the CIA fulfills its mission of producing information critical to our national security, without sacrificing our national values.                          ____________________
