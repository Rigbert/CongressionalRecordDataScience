 He has been an excellent chair of the committee.  It is our understanding that these points were never brought to the committee. However, I am told the Energy Department has told my staff that the budget request is valid due to the Department's need for operational flexibility.  I want everybody to know that the floor is open. If you filed an amendment, please come down to speak on it. If you want to file one, please do so as quickly as possible.
