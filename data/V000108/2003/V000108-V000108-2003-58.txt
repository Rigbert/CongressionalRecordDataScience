Speaker it is with great pride and honor that I congratulate Mr. Wallace E. Evans on his contribution to the residents of Northwest Indiana. Wallace will be retiring on July 1, 2003 as Local 881 United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) International Union's Executive Vice President. There will be a celebration dedicated to honoring his achievements on Friday, June 27 in Oak Brook, Illinois.  After 13 years of working as a Frozen Foods manager at Burger Supermarkets in Munster, Indiana, he was hired on full-time as the Organizer and Business Representative for Local 1460 of the Retail Clerks Union of Lake County. In 1980, Wallace became the President of Local 1460, and the first contract he negotiated as President increased the membership wage by $2.10 over the three-year contract. During his tenure, he dedicated himself to improving the working and financial conditions of the membership. After his time served as President, he became the Secretary-Treasurer of Local 1550 of UFCW, from 1986-1989.  After the merger of Local 1550 and Local 881 of UFCW in 1989, Wallace served as a Collective Bargaining Negotiator until he was named Director of Collective Bargaining in 1994. In 1996, he was named Executive Vice President and Director of Collective Bargaining.  Not only has Wallace had many positive accomplishments in his career with the union, he has also actively contributed to his community through many service organizations. He has served as the Union Trustee for the UFCW Union and Employers Calumet Region Insurance Fund since 1974, as well as holding the office of Democratic Precinct Committeeman in Highland, Indiana. He has also been a community leader through his role as Vice President of the Northwest Indiana Federation of Labor AFL-CIO (Retail Wholesale Sector). Although Wallace has dedicated his life to his career and his community, he has never neglected to provide support and love for his family. Wallace and his wife, Sheila, have been married for 36 years, and have two sons, Steven and Jason.  Mr. Speaker, Wallace Evans has been an active force in his union, as well as a positive leader for the Northwest Indiana community. I respectfully ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating him on his well-deserved retirement. His service to his career and devotion to Indiana's First Congressional District deserves the highest commendation, and I am proud to represent him in Congress.                          ____________________
