In 1997, a certain Governor of Texas, who has now moved to Washington, had a Patients' Bill of Rights established in Texas. Maybe the Senator from New York can help me with these numbers, but I believe in the 4-year period of time that the State Patients' Bill of Rights has been in effect in Texas, there have been 1,300 appeals of decisions by insurance companies and only 17 lawsuits filed in 4 years.  So the argument that giving the people the right to go to court will mean a flood of cases brought in court has been disproven in the home State of the President. Does the Senator from New York recall that?
