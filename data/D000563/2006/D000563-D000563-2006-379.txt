President, it has been my honor to serve on the Appropriations Committee and on this subcommittee. It is an important subcommittee, one of the most important subcommittees in terms of our national defense.  A decision was reached, probably before I was elected to the Senate, that we would dedicate funds within this appropriation for medical research. Some have questioned them over the years. I have never questioned them. I believe it is important that we pursue medical research, not only at the National Institutes of Health--which, incidentally is facing a cutback in medical research funds in this President's budget this year--but also when it comes to our military medical research. They are very competent. They have been very good. They have included in their research enormous opportunities, opportunities which relate directly to the soldiers in combat and opportunities which relate to them and their families.  Breast cancer research is included in this. I totally support it. I applaud it. I voted for it. There is no question about that. What I am talking about here is traumatic brain injury to soldiers. This is something that has become the signature wound of this conflict in Iraq. The amount of money which I am asking for, $2 million, pales in comparison to the millions and millions of dollars earmarked in this bill for universities, specific universities for specific medical research.  The Senator from Alaska cannot tell me that every dollar in medical research in this bill is peer reviewed. It is not. You know it and I know it. Decisions were made by the committee to earmark certain research at specific universities. I will tell the Senator, I didn't question that. I deferred to his judgment and the judgment of Senator Inouye on that.
