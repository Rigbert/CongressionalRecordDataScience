Last year, the House and Senate overwhelmingly passed resolutions to express America's unwavering support for the people and Government of Poland, and to offer our heartfelt sympathies for the families and loved ones of those who perished.  April 10 has long been a day of memory for the Polish people and those of Polish descent, because on that day 71 years ago the Soviets carried out a horrific act against the Polish people. I am talking about the Katyn Forest massacre. Last year, Polish President Lech Kaczynski was leading a Polish delegation to Russia for the 70th commemoration of that massacre. This was to be an historic event because it was also to be the first time that a Russian leader was to attend the commemoration.  The truth of the Katyn Forest massacre was hidden and lied about for decades. And today, the entire world knows that in 1940 the Soviet secret police were ordered by Joseph Stalin to systematically round up and murder all of Poland's officers, intellectuals, national leaders, teachers, university presidents. As many as 22,000 people were killed in that heinous crime.  For decades, the Soviets tried to cover up their guilt by blaming this atrocity on the Nazis. There is plenty of blame for them too, but the truth of Katyn was never told.  I am proud that this country and this House have long demanded that the truth about the Katyn massacre be exposed. In 1951, it was this House of Representatives that established a select committee to conduct and investigate the facts, evidence, and circumstances of the Katyn Forest massacre. One year later, the committee unanimously concluded that the Soviets had been responsible. Unconscionably, the Soviets continued to deny their actions until President Mikhail Gorbachev made a statement on April 13, 1990.  We knew that the 70th commemoration of this atrocity was to be historic. But the world was further shocked that this tragic day was to witness yet another obliteration of the leaders of the Polish Nation. Last April 10, the Polish President's airliner, a Russian Tupelov TU-154M that had been recently overhauled in Russia, crashed as it was landing near Smolensk. Everyone on board, all 96 people, were killed, including Poland's President, its first lady, the deputy foreign minister, the deputy defense minister, the director of national intelligence, dozens of members of Parliament, the chiefs of staff of the Army and Navy, along with the president of the Polish bank.  Also on board the plane was Anna Walentynowicz, the former dock worker whose firing in 1980 sparked Poland's heroic Solidarity strike that ultimately overthrew the Communist Government of Poland. Ryszard Kaczorowski, who served as Poland's final President in exile before the country's return to democracy, was killed, as well as Wojciech Seweryn, a Chicago artist whose father was killed in Katyn.  I want to honor their memory today and the memory of all those who were killed at Katyn. And I want to express our support for the Polish people and the Polish Government as it seeks full answers surrounding the plane crash, particularly access to the black boxes that were taken by Russia, and the government's other physical materials held related to this tragedy.  Poland is a strong U.S. ally. Polish leaders like Thaddeus Kosciuszko helped fight for our country's freedom when our Republic was founded over 200 years ago. And America stood with Poland's Solidarity movement as it fought against the oppression of the Communists. In the face of these dual tragedies, at Smolensk April 10, 2010, and Katyn in 1940, America stands with the liberty-loving people of Poland.                          ____________________
