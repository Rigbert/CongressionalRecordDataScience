 President, I rise today to pay tribute to one of Kentucky's proud military veterans--Barry E. Owens. Owens hails from Magoffin County, and served his country with honor in the Vietnam war.  Although millions of young Americans were drafted into service during this time, Barry decided to leave nothing to chance and volunteer. He served in the U.S. Army from 1968 until 1970, achieving the rank of specialist 4.  In 1969, he was deployed to Vietnam with the 2nd and 35th Regiments of the 4th Infantry Division. In a time when the war became increasingly unpopular, Owens always retained his sense of duty. ``I served my country with pride and honor,'' he said.  Owens is a member of Veterans of Foreign Wars and the Salyersville chapter of the Disabled American Veterans. His commitment to this country is worthy of praise from this body. Therefore, I ask that my Senate colleagues join me in honoring Barry Owens.  The Salyersville Independent recently published an article detailing Specialist Owens's service in Vietnam. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows:           [From the Salyersville Independent, July 3, 2014]              Owens Volunteers for Draft, Goes to Vietnam                           (By Heather Oney)       Barry E. Owens, born and raised in Royalton, Magoffin      County, volunteered for the draft during the Vietnam War in      1968 with the U.S. Army, climbing to the rank of Specialist 4      by the time he was discharged in 1970.       He attended basic training at Fort Bragg, North Carolina,      then advanced training for supply specialist and armory      school at Fort Lee, Virginia.       From 1969 until discharged, Owens served in Vietnam with      the 2nd and 35th Regiment 4th Infantry Division.       After a few days upon reporting, Owens's company commander      decided that for the next year he would be a better fit as an      11 Bravo Infantry soldier, working ``out in the boonies,'' as      opposed to sitting around an office in a base camp.       Owens said he can remember the soldiers lining up in a      field to get their hair cut by Vietnamese civilians. Since      there was no electricity, they had to use the hand clippers      where you have to squeeze them to make them work. His      sergeant was in line and getting impatient.       ``I told him I was a barber before going into the      military,'' Owens laughed. ``So I started at the back of his      head and came out with a half moon, and that's where I      stopped. I threw the clippers and ran. The next time I saw      him his head was shaven, I think that's when they started      shaving heads.''       Owens was stationed in the Central Highlands of Vietnam,      including areas around Pleiku, Kon Tum City, Buon Me Thuot,      and many firebases in this region, including VC Valley and      areas on the border of Cambodia and Laos.       ``The Vietnam veterans returning home from this country      were not greeted and welcomed home with parades or such      fanfare,'' Owens remembers. ``Many of us were met at airports      with degrading slurs, cursed and spat upon.''       It would be another 20 years before the Veterans      Administration would acknowledge Post-Traumatic Stress      Disorder (PTSD) and other disabilities and afford medical      care to this era of veterans. Many Vietnam veterans fell into      drug and alcohol abuse, often even resulting in homelessness,      with many committing suicide and dying at an early age.       ``I served my country with pride and honor,'' Owens said.       He is a life member of the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW),      and the Disabled American Veterans (DAV) Chapter 15      Salyersville. He has been married to his wife, Shirley, for      over 20 years and has three daughters, Melissa, Misty, and      Jennifer.                          ____________________
