Mr. Speaker, I would like to call the attention of my colleagues to an eye-opening article that appeared in the July issue of Resource Review. It details the extent of the ongoing spruce beetle infestation in southcentral Alaska and reports that beetle activity increased 40 percent last year. Over 32,433 acres are infested in the Chugach National Forest alone, with mortality exceeding 60 percent in some stands. The current total for all of southcentral Alaska is a new record--892,831 acres of dead and dying trees. This is not a record we should be proud of.  The infested areas of southcentral Alaska are now far too large to permit wildfires to burn naturally. With so much dead wood lying on the forest floor a fire could burn hot enough to sterilize the soil and threaten the health of some of Alaska's priceless salmon stocks. Such a fire is a disaster waiting to happen. Unfortunately, waiting for disasters instead of preventing them seems to be the preferred policy of the current Secretary of Agriculture.  Every day the beetle infests more and more timber while those entrusted with our National Forests do less and less about it. Rather than taking necessary action under existing law, the Secretary of Agriculture has put up roadblocks every step of the way. He recently directed managers on the Chugach National Forest to cancel the few salvage operations they had planned. Some of these sales, it was reported to me, were in the planning process for years. Canceling them may be sound politics but it is irresponsible forestry. Playing politics with National Forests is playing with fire--I do not want to see Alaskans get burned.  Even without major fires Alaskans are suffering the effects of the beetle infestation: property values are declining as the insect spreads from Federal to private lands; the visitor industry is losing business as once beautiful viewsheds turn brown and decay; and local residents are forced to sit by and watch their favorite recreation and hunting areas become wastelands. All this as Washington bureaucrats bicker and pass the buck.  Through responsible application of salvage logging the spreading sickness in southcentral Alaska can be cured, averting the risk of fire and creating jobs and a healthy forest to pass on to our children. I encourage my colleagues to read the article, the text of which follows my remarks, and hope that it will inspire them to join me in supporting sound forest management under the emergency timber salvage law as well as other long-term initiatives promoting forest health.      Beetle Activity Spreads, 892,831 Acres Infested in One Year       While Alaskans continue to debate the merits of cutting      dead, beetle-killed timber across private and public lands in      Southcentral Alaska, spruce beetle activity increased 40      percent in 1995 over the devastating levels detected the      previous year.       Approximately 892,831 acres of on-going and newly infested      areas were detected last year, the highest level of activity      on record. The most extensive areas of beetle infestations      are in Southcentral Alaska (683,281) acres) and the Cooper      River basin (170,767 acres). More than 25 million spruce      trees have been infested.       The Forest Service's 1995 Forest Health Management Report      revealed that beetle activity in the Chugach National Forest      doubled in 1995 to more than 32,433 acres. It noted that      beetle activity is increasing throughout the Turnagain Arm      area, including Girdwood, Twenty Mile, Ingram Creek, Sixmile      River drainage and Hope. The Forest Service also noted the      beetle infestation is intense throughout many areas of the      Kenai Peninsula, including Kachemak Bay. From Tustumena Lake      to Homer, beetle activity is extreme. More than 400,000 acres      of spruce are infested with many stands having more than 60%      mortality.       A significant increase in beetle-killed timber was found on      the west side of Cook Inlet and the infestation more than      doubled in the Anchorage Bowl where more than 8,000 acres of      spruce were hit. Areas in Anchorage with the heaviest      activity are Hillside, Fire Island, Kincaid Park, and the      Eagle River and Eklutna River drainages.       With a dry, warm summer at hand, foresters believe severe      outbreaks of beetle activity will continue throughout the      summer. While there is ongoing debate on the fire danger      posed by standing, beetle-killed timber compared to green      timber, foresters agree that fire danger over the long term      is heightened considerably once the dead trees fall over on      top of each other and fill the floor of the forest.       Three salvage logging proposals have been proposed for the      Chugach National Forest to harvest beetle-killed timber, but      the Forest Service--in the face of intense pressure from      environmental groups--has scrapped one plan, severely reduced      the scope of another and is considering new public comment on      a third.       Under the salvage law passed by Congress last year, the      Forest Service had initially identified about 1,300 acres of      12,000 heavily-infested forested acres in the Sixmile area      for logging. That proposal has now been reduced to a mere 182      acres--2% of the infested trees in the Sixmile area. A      logging plan for the heavily-infested Seattle Creek drainage      has been discarded, but the Forest Service is     reviewing public comments for a third proposal in the      Resurrection and Palmer Creek valleys near Hope.       Environmentalists are not satisfied with the Forest Service      decision to scale back logging plans and have admitted they      won't be happy until ALL logging plans are dropped.       The Alaska Center for the Environment (ACE) has formed the      Forest Defense Network to whip up public opposition against      logging and influencing public policy. In a recent mass      mailing, ACE noted the Forest Defense Network is kicking into      high gear with a door-to-door campaign. Media campaigns are      being developed and demonstrations are being planned among      other events and programs. ACE is asking Alaskans to join its      network, write letters, participate in direct actions and      ``help stop senseless logging.''       The Campaign has generated scores of letters to the      Anchorage Daily News and the Forest Service in opposition to      logging. ACE has asked its members to host letter writing      parties targeting not only the Anchorage Daily News, but      newspapers outside Alaska, including the Los Angles Times.       The cover of the ACE mailer featured a picture of a      clearcut with the superimposed headline, ``It's Time To      Clearcut Our Kenai Peninsula: Do You Agree or Disagree?'' The      mailer was filled with emotion and left readers with the      impression that a healthy and green forest was being clearcut      at alarming rates by the worst polluters in the entire      Pacific Northwest.       Absent from the mailer was the fact that logging is      occurring in areas heavily infested by the spruce bark beetle      and that the infestation is transforming Kenai Peninsula      viewsheds into grave-yards of brown dead or dying trees.       Forests concede logging cannot stop the infestation, but      emphasize that a combined program of harvesting and      reforestation can restore forest health much faster than if      no action is taken.       Forest scientist explain that new harvesting programs      utilizing modern forest management initiatives to protect      wildlife and fisheries is a reforestation program that will      lead to a young, healthy and vigorous-growing forest. Since      most of Southcentral Alaska is now a fire suppression area,      they say logging would take out the dead trees, as opposed to      nature's way--fire. If no logging is allowed, many timber      stands on the Kenai may revert to grasslands.       With its varied patterns of land ownership, the Kenia      Peninsula is a great ecological, long-term experiment in      forest management. While extensive logging is occurring near      Homer on State and private land, very little cutting is      taking place on the much larger expanses of the Peninsula.      Only a fraction of the beetle infested spruce will be cut on      the Chugach while no commercial logging will occur on the      Kenia National Wildlife Refuge and Kenai Fjords National      Park, Foresters will be watching the different rates of      regrowth, company areas actively managed for logging and      reforestation with those forests left to stand as gray      ghosts.                          ____________________
