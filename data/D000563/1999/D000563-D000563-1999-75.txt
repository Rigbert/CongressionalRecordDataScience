President, I thank my colleagues from the State of Mississippi who are justifiably proud of Walter Payton. His home State of Mississippi can look to Walter Payton with great pride. There is a great deal of sadness in my home State of Illinois, particularly in the city of Chicago, with the passing of Walter Payton at the age of 45.  Later today, I will enter into the Record a statement of tribute to Mr. Payton, but I did not want to miss this opportunity this morning to mention several things about what Walter Payton meant to Chicago and Illinois.  He was more than a Hall of Fame football player. He ran for a record 16,726 yards in a 13-year career, one of those years shortened by a strike, and yet he established a record which probably will be difficult to challenge or surpass at any time in the near future.  The one thing that was most amazing about Walter Payton was not the fact he was such a great rusher, with his hand on the football and making moves which no one could understand how he pulled off, but after being tackled and down on the ground, hit as hard as could be, he would reach over and pull up the tackler and help him back on his feet.  He was always a sportsman, always a gentleman, always someone you could admire, not just for athletic prowess but for the fact he was a good human being.  I had the good fortune this last Fourth of July to meet his wife and son. They are equally fine people. His son, late in his high school career, in his junior year, decided to try out for football. The apple does not fall far from the tree; he became a standout at Saint Viator in the Chicago suburb of Arlington Heights and now is playing at the University of Miami. I am sure he will have a good career of his own.  With the passing of a man such as Walter Payton, we have lost a great model in football and in life--the way he conducted himself as one of the most famous football players of all time.  The last point I will make is, toward the end of his life when announcing he faced this fatal illness, he made a plea across America to take organ donation seriously. He needed a liver transplant at one point in his recuperation. It could have made a difference. It did not happen.  I do not know the medical details as to his passing, but Walter Payton's message in his final months is one we should take to heart as we remember him, not just from those fuzzy clips of his NFL career but because he reminded us, even as he was facing his last great game in life, that each and every one of us has the opportunity to pass the ball to someone who can carry it forward in organ donation, and the Nation's commitment to that cause would be a great tribute to him.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
