Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.  The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California will be postponed.                    Amendment Offered by Mr. LaMalfa  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.  The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.  The Clerk read as follows:       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the      following:       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may      be used to implement, administer, or enforce the requirement      in section 323.4(a)(1)(ii) of title 33, Code of Federal      Regulations, or section 232.3(c)(1)(ii)(A) of title 40, Code      of Federal Regulations, that activities identified in      paragraph (1)(A) of subsection (f) of section 404 of the      Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1344(f)(1)(A))      must be established or ongoing in order to receive an      exemption under such subsection.  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 223, the gentleman from California and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.  Mr. LaMALFA. I thank the gentleman from Idaho, Chairman Simpson.  Mr. Chair, the House has previously passed language to require the Army Corps of Engineers to apply the Clean Water Act as the Congress has passed it, not as the Corps may wish it to have been written. Unfortunately, the Corps has disregarded these efforts and imposed regulations that could actually prevent farmers from changing crops or fallowing fields during, especially, California's historic drought.                              {time}  0130  Section 404 of the Clean Water Act exempts from regulation the following: ``Normal farming, silviculture, and ranching activities such as plowing, seeding, cultivating, minor drainage, harvesting for the production of food, fiber, and forest products, or upland soil and water conservation practices.''  No additional requirements are included, and these activities are specifically identified as exempt. However, the Corps and the EPA have used creative interpretations to drastically increase their jurisdiction beyond what Congress has intended.  In fact, the Corps states the following on their Web site:       If a property has been used for cattle grazing, the      exemption does not apply if future activities would involve      planting crops for food.       An operation is no longer established when the area on      which it is conducted has been converted to another use or      has lain idle.  Now, under this interpretation, a farmer switching from one crop to another, such as corn or tomatoes, would no longer be engaged in normal activities and could be subject to regulation.  As I mentioned earlier, in this time of record drought in California, a practice such as leaving a field fallow, as is happening now across California due to the historic droughts, means that replanting the following year, if possible, would be seen by the Corps as a new--not existing--activity triggering regulation and permitting requirements. This is not the intention of what Congress had years ago with the Clean Water Act.  This overreach could even prevent farmers from switching to less water-intensive crops, if they saw fit, during California's droughts for fear of an impossible morass of regulatory requirements or, with the involuntary cuts that have been underway, see that they would again be required to have new permits because of this misinterpretation by the Corps.  Mr. Chairman, the House has supported amendments I have sponsored on two other occasions. Language addressing this issue previously passed by voice vote and was included in the CR/Omnibus; yet the Corps has refused to recognize clear congressional intent and abandoned its interpretation.  My amendment, for the third time, will seek to prohibit funding for these creative interpretations. I urge your support of this effort to once again make clear the will of Congress.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
