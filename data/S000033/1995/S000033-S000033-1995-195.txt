  We talk about Federal aid to housing. The leadership here in the Congress says, we cannot afford affordable housing anymore. In fact, one of the lovely proposals was to cut back on Federal aid to homeless people with AIDS. We just cannot afford to provide any money to keep those people alive.  Let us talk about another interesting Federal housing program. That is the mortgage interest deduction up to mortgages of $1 million. Now, most of the people that I know in the State of Vermont, they do not have million dollars homes. Maybe it is $100,000 a house; maybe it is a $200,000 house. That is true throughout America. But interestingly, if you got a million dollar mortgage, the house can be worth more than a million dollars, you can deduct the interest on a million dollars of your mortgage.  Who gets that benefit? Think it is low income people? Middle income people? No. Obviously, upper income people who own the large houses are the major beneficiaries of that program. That is called welfare. But that is a different type of welfare, because you are helping the wealthiest people in America.                              {time}  1800  Another program that I have paid a little bit of attention to is called OPIC, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. The gentleman from New York [Mr. Owens] and I were talking about the decline in our economy for working people. We are seeing corporations investing $750 billion abroad while they are throwing American workers out on the street.  The American taxpayers would be delighted to know that they subsidize this Federal agency, OPIC, $50 million a year, and what does this agency do? Its main job is to help American corporations invest in politically unstable countries abroad.  We have AT&T, DuPont, GTE, Ford, the largest corporations in America, while they are busy throwing American workers out on the street, they are getting taxpayer help in order to invest in politically unstable countries. If there is revolution or civil war in those countries, we have provided insurance for them, and in fact have a $6.3 billion insurance liability, and on and on it goes.  The point that the gentleman from Oregon [Mr. DeFazio], the gentleman from New York [Mr. Owens], and I are trying to make is that we can move toward a balanced budget, but we can do it in a fair way. We do not have to savage Medicare, Medicaid, Head Start, WIC, student loans, food stamps, and many, many other programs that tens of millions of Americans depend upon.  One of the programs that the Republican leadership has proposed to eliminate is the LIHEAP program, which provides fuel assistance for low-income people; 40 percent of the recipients are senior citizens.  In my State of Vermont it gets pretty cold in the winter, 20 below zero, 30 below zero. We have a lot of low-income senior citizens who cannot afford the money for oil and gas to heat their homes. That will be eliminated. However, we can continue to provide an enormous amount of money for corporate welfare.
