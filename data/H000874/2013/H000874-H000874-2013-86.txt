Speaker, it is time to let this House and not just a small faction of the House, which I tell my responsible friends on the Republican side of the aisle, you ought to reject, you ought to say enough is enough, you ought to say let's move on, you've had your votes, we lost.  Let us live up to the responsibility that our Founders instilled in this great people's House and continue to be the democracy that is the envy of the world. Let us make sure that when people look at America they look at America as a country that works, at an America that can be united, at an America that believes ``e pluribus unum'' still is our motto.
