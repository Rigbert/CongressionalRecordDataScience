Speaker, it is with tremendous respect that I take this time to recognize one of Northwest Indiana's most distinguished citizens, State Representative Dan Stevenson, and to thank him for his service as a member of the Indiana General Assembly. After eighteen years as a member of the Indiana House of Representatives, Dan has decided to retire from elective office. Known for being a great leader and a true public servant, Representative Stevenson's presence in Indianapolis will surely be missed by his colleagues and the people he has so loyally served.  A lifelong resident of Northwest Indiana, Mr. Stevenson graduated from Highland High School in 1977 and later attended Calumet College of Saint Joseph. Later, Dan, like many hardworking people of Northwest Indiana, began working at Inland Steel Company, now ArcelorMittal. It is here where he witnessed the needs of the working class, for whom he tirelessly labored as a public servant. Even outside of his role in the General Assembly, Representative Stevenson has been a steadfast advocate for working men and women. As a member of United Steelworkers of America Local 1010, Dan has served his co-workers as a grievance committee representative. Fully aware of the importance of keeping people informed, Dan has also served as the editor of the union newspaper. Dan Stevenson's dedication to those who toil for a living is to be commended.  First elected to the Indiana House of Representatives in 1994, Dan leaves a lasting impression. Described by his colleagues as a quiet, yet driven leader, it was apparent upon his arrival in Indianapolis that a true champion of working people had arrived. A truly well-rounded legislator, Representative Stevenson currently serves as the Ranking Minority Member on the Utilities and Energy Committee, as well as a member of the Environmental Affairsand the Interstate and International Cooperation Committees. As a member of the House, Representative Stevenson has fought tirelessly for economic justice, earning him many distinguished accolades, including: the Service to Labor Award from the Northwest Indiana Federation of Labor, the Legislative Achievement Award from Indiana University Northwest, the Legislative Award from the Indiana Library Federation, and the Legislator of the Year Award from the Indiana Association of Police Chiefs.  While his constituents will miss his dedicated leadership, I am certain that Dan will treasure the additional time he will get to spend with his beloved wife, Dawn; his children, Michelle, Lola Ann, and Dan, Jr.; and his adoring grandchildren, Erik, Karen, Austin, and Ethan.  Mr. Speaker, I respectfully ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring Indiana State Representative Dan Stevenson for his dedicated life of service. Dan's tireless efforts on behalf of those he represented is worthy of our admiration, and it has been a pleasure to work with him throughout his years in office.                          ____________________
