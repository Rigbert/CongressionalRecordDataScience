I thank the Senator from Nevada for his comments.  But I have before me the budget. It is now in four different books. I have the lead book. By the time you get to page 14 of the President's budget, right in the front end of it, in the introduction, ``Winning the War On Terror,'' is a long section on removing the threat of Saddam Hussein. It talks about Operation Iraqi Freedom, the removal of Saddam Hussein, and the responsibility of the United States in Iraq.  If I understand the Senator from Iowa correctly, despite the fact this is in the opening introduction of the budget, you can pour through this entire budget and not find a single penny--not one cent--that is going to be spent by the United States of America in waging the war in Iraq after September 30 of this year.  Is that my understanding of what the Senator from Iowa said?
