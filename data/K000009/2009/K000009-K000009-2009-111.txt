As Co-chair of the Ukrainian Caucus, it is my honor to recognize this day. In the darkest hours of the cold war, Ukrainians behind the Iron Curtain have received VOA broadcasts of accurate, balanced and comprehensive news and information. The VOA reports that Ukrainian dissidents imprisoned in Siberian camps and human rights activists who worked clandestinely to avoid arrest say they drew strength from its broadcasts.  As the Communist system began to fissure, VOA notes it continued to provide Ukrainians with the news and information that their own censored, government-controlled media would not provide. Through the decades VOA was there to tell Ukrainians stories about the Hungarian Revolution in 1956, the Prague Spring of 1968, the rise of the Solidarity movement in Poland in the 1980s, the cover up of the Chornobyl nuclear power plant explosion in 1986, the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, and the Ukrainian independence and democracy movement which played a key role in the collapse of the U.S.S.R. in 1991. Through Ukraine's struggles with independency, VOA was a vital source of accurate news and responsible commentary.  Today, VOA continues to reach millions of Ukrainians each week. The radio broadcasts that began in the early cold war period have been replaced with daily television broadcasts and reporting on VOA's web site. Ukrainians still look to VOA not only to hear about the Washington perspective on what is happening in Ukraine, but also to comprehend America's story--its foreign policy objectives, national politics, social challenges, culture, arts, educational opportunities, business successes and achievements in science, technology, and medicine. The United States continues to serve as an important example for Ukrainians on maintaining a vibrant, prosperous, pluralistic society. Through its strict adherence to journalistic excellence over the past 60 years, the Voice of America's Ukrainian Service has been a key institution in U.S. public diplomacy. Today, its mission remains critical as ever, and we proudly mark this milestone anniversary.                          ____________________
