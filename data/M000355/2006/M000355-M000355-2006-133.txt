 President, I ask the entire Senate to join me today in congratulating one of Kentucky's amazing young heroes. SGT Leigh Ann Hester of Bowling Green, KY, is traveling to the Nation's Capital to receive the USO's Service Member of the Year Award at the organization's 2006 USO World Gala this September 28.  Sergeant Hester is being honored for her valorous service in combat in Iraq, which earned her the Silver Star medal. The Silver Star is the Army's third-highest award for gallantry, and Sergeant Hester is the first female soldier to win the medal for valor in combat since World War II.  A retail store manager in Bowling Green, Sergeant Hester joined the U.S. Army in 2001 and was assigned to the Kentucky National Guard's 617th Military Police Company, based in Richmond, KY. In March 2005, she was on the southeastern outskirts of Baghdad, shadowing a convoy of tractor-trailers carrying supplies for American forces.  The convoy was ambushed by about 50 heavily armed terrorists. They attacked from a trench alongside the road and rained down machine-gun fire and rocket-propelled grenades on the convoy for a sustained 3 minutes. Several truck drivers were killed, more were wounded. Thinking they had the upper hand, the terrorists moved towards the convoy, preparing to take hostages.  Suddenly three armored humvees roared up to the carnage. Sergeant Hester, as team leader of the second humvee, maneuvered her team into a position to draw the enemy's fire and begin fighting back with grenades and M203 rounds.  Sergeant Hester and her squad leader got out of their humvees and rushed the trench about 20 meters away from them to clear out the enemy. They worked their way through the insurgents, throwing grenades and firing M4s. When she ran low on ammunition, she ran back to a humvee to reload, exposing herself to enemy fire from multiple directions. Because this squad had been so well disciplined, Sergeant Hester was able to reach blindly into any of the humvees and know exactly where to grab more ammunition.  Finally, the soldiers of the 617th had put down enough fire that the enemy fell silent. It turns out that Sergeant Hester and her team, just 10 in all, had not only put themselves in the middle of a firefight against greater numbers and all survived, they had scored the highest death toll of insurgents in Iraq in many months. They killed 27, captured several wounded, seized a sizableweapons cache, and secured valuable intelligence.  Sergeant Hester's actions were cited as having ``saved the lives of numerous convoy members.'' For her bravery, she was awarded the Silver Star medal on June 16, 2006.  Sergeant Hester's courage, dedication, and sacrifice on behalf of her country and her fellow soldiers make her a hero and a role model that every young Kentuckian can emulate. I am proud that a woman of such character and determination hails from the Bluegrass State, and I know the entire Senate joins me in thanking her for her service in defense of America and America's ideals.                          ____________________
