President, will the Senator yield for a couple of questions?  First of all, let me applaud the Senator from New York for bringing this to the attention of the American people. I have been presiding and listening, and join the Senator in offering this amendment. I applaud him for it. But I would like to back up a little ways and recall something to see if the Senator from New York agrees with this; that when Carlos Salinas first went in the perception was that his policies were stabilizing the economy, the peso was stable, and all of a sudden we had investors from Europe and other places who had never theretofore bought Mexican debt. So they came in.
