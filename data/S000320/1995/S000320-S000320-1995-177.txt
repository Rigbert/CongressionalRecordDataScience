 President, today I am introducing a bill to address the seemingly perpetual problem of immigration. We are often told the United States of America was established by immigrants. Indeed, immigration has been the cornerstone of America. I could not agree more about the positive impact immigrants have played in America, nor will I dispute the positive role immigrants will play in the future.  We are taught to believe that immigration to America has been, and should be, a perpetual and unlimited right.  However, our capacity, as a country, to process and assimilate the heavy flow of immigrants is not sustainable. Excessive demands on social, medical and welfare services accentuate the necessity to address the problem immediately.  A quick survey of the condition of State budgets, particularly those of California, Florida, Illinois, New York, and Texas will illustrate the overwhelming demands on education, health care, welfare, prisons, and other social infrastructure. California, Florida, and Texas are actually suing the Federal Government for billions of dollars they have had to spend for such immigrant related costs.  The dilemma before us is not limited to illegal immigrants as the media often implies. While approximately 300,000 illegal immigrants come here each year, we actually admit almost 1 million legal immigrants a year. Legal immigration creates a demand more than three times greater than illegal immigration. Simply put, States do not have the resources to provide services to an additional 1.3 million persons a year.  Some will say that these immigrants do not come over here for a hand out, but that they come over to work and live the American dream. However, if we assume this to be true--that they come to America to work--then this means they increase the supply of the labor force. Of the 974,000 immigrants that were granted legal permanent residence in 1992, 672,303 were between the ages of 20 and 64.  If these immigrants enter the job market, their entry effectively reduces wages by increasing the labor supplied. At a time when real income is stagnant if not declining, immigration policy should not contribute such a strong downward pressure on real income. Such a policy does not make fiscal or social sense.  The scenario just mentioned is the optimist view. If one chooses to assume the opposite, that immigrants choose not to work, the inevitable result is an increase in the demand of social services. As mentioned earlier, the demand is already too high for many states.  Neither of the two scenarios paint a pretty picture. Indeed, both of these scenarios are costly to the American taxpayer.  As a result, I am introducing legislation to provide relief to the American taxpayer. This bill would lower the amount of legal immigrants from about 1 million to 325,000. This figure would include around 175,000 spouses and children of U.S. citizens which has traditionally been the case.  The bill also includes a 50,000 level for refugees/asylees, 50,000 for highly skilled workers and 50,000 for other relatives of U.S. citizens.  In addition, my legislation would reduce the admissions backlog by freezing it at the current level. New applications would not be accepted until the end of the moratorium unless the applicant came from one of the allowable categories under this legislation.  This legislation would ease the demands on State governments while also minimizing the negative economic consequences immigrants have on the labor force. Although this is only a temporary 5-year remedy, it will allow us the time needed to pass a complete, long-term solution to the problem.  I support comprehensive reform efforts, but believe immediate relief is needed.  It is important that we strive for a rational and equitable immigration policy that takes into account the economic and social needs. We must do this without compromising the social and economic stability of this country and the quality of life for every American.  In order for immigrants to live the American dream, there has to be a healthy, prosperous economy and a diverse, harmonious society.  To offer anything less, would be to cheat them of the American dream. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.                                 ______      By
