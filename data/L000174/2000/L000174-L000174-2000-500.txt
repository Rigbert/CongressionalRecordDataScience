President, the reason I get concerned about this is, now, having in excess of 80 votes to go forward with this, we ought to have the courage and the honesty to stand up and vote. Senators are paid to vote ``aye'' or ``nay.'' They are not paid to vote ``maybe.'' It would be a cowardly and disgraceful step to vote ``maybe'' because we want to avoid saying what the Senate is being asked to do--to close the door to two such extraordinary people. I always respect Senators who vote ``yes'' or vote ``no.'' I will not respect Senators who vote ``maybe.'' That is beneath the dignity of the Senate.  There are only 100 of us who are elected to represent a quarter of a billion Americans. Let us have the courage to stand up and vote either for or against these two extraordinary nominees. Let us not play silly parliamentary games and tell the American people we do not have the guts to vote, that we are going to vote ``maybe.'' I did not get elected to serve in the Senate to vote ``maybe.'' I did not serve for 25 years in a body that I revere to vote ``maybe.''  I am certainly not going to stand here and allow with no comment these two people to be held hostage one more time. Vote for them, or vote against them. I certainly urge my colleagues to vote for them.  In all my years on the Judiciary Committee extending back over several decades, I do not know of two finer nominees who have come before the Senate, Republican or Democrat. And I voted for most nominees, Republican and Democrat, during that time.  Vote for these two people. At least in that way, apologize for holding them hostage all of these years. But, for God's sake, don't shame us all by voting for some kind of parliamentary gimcrackery saying we will postpone it indefinitely. Vote ``yes'' or vote ``no.'' Don't vote ``maybe.''  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
