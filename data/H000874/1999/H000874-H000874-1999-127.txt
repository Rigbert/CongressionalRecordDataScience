Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Taylor) for his contribution. I do not think we have any stronger fighter for personnel in the House and the average personnel, the guys and gals who really make it happen when this Nation needs to have it happen. I thank the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Taylor) for also pointing out that there is no free lunch; that actions have consequence. While it is nice to talk about cutting taxes, it is difficult to do that when talking about $800 billion and then $2 trillion and say at the same time we want to save Social Security, save Medicare, pay down the debt so we can keep interest rates low and bring them down even further, and maintain a strong defense.                              {time}  2030  Madam Speaker, I hope that, when they try to say that, I know the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Taylor) will remind them on a regular basis that it is easy to say and tough to do.  Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Hill), one of our most able, new Members.
