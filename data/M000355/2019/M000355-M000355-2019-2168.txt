 President, once we complete our work on S. 1, the Senate will turn to the Natural Resources Management Act, under the leadership of Chairman Murkowski and the Natural Resources Committee.  This legislation combines more than 100 individual lands bills. It will allow communities across America to responsibly develop their land and natural resources while maintaining a balance with locally supported conservation.  On a national scale, this legislation will achieve things such as permanently reauthorizing the Land and Water Conservation Fund and codifying sportsmen's recreational access to Bureau of Land Management and National Forest areas nationwide. On a local scale, communities across America are looking forward to specific provisions.  I am particularly proud that the legislation will include two bills I introduced to safeguard historic Kentucky landmarks and designate Camp Nelson and Mill Springs Battlefield as national monuments. I know virtually every one of our colleagues is enthusiastic about local achievements it will deliver in their States as well.  This bipartisan legislation is a major priority dating back to the last Congress, when nearly 90 Senators cosponsored its components, and I am glad we will be able to turn to it soon.                          ____________________
