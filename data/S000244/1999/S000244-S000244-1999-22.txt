Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 356 requires NASA to convey property at the Ames Research Center to Stanislaus, California. NASA retains the right to use the property for aviation activities on mutually acceptable terms. The conveyance does not relieve any Federal agency of its responsibility for any environmental remediation of soil, groundwater, or surface water.  NASA relinquishes legislative jurisdiction over the property to the State of California. Any additional terms may be negotiated by the NASA Administrator to protect the interests of the United States.  The bill is sponsored by the gentleman from California (Mr. Condit). Last Congress, the Committee on Science supported this bill; and the House passed it. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
