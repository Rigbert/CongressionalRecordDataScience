Madam Speaker, I rise tonight as former and incoming Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Human Rights Committee to ask my distinguished colleagues of the House to take a few moments to read a brilliant, incisive, extraordinarily well written defense of the child in the womb by Lord Nicholas Windsor of the UK, great grandson of King George V.  Calling the abortion of unborn children ``the single most grievous moral deficit in contemporary life,'' he appeals to conscience and admonishes us to the ``greatest solidarity and duty of care because they are the weakest and most dependent of our fellow humans.''  Lord Nicholas notes that ``permissive abortion is a fact of life so deeply embedded and thoroughly normalized in our culture that--and this is the most insidious factor in that normalization--it has been rendered invisible to politics in Europe. Even mentioning it has become the first taboo of the culture.''  And how can that be?  Lord Nicholas faults ``determined campaigns of propaganda at the outset to harden consciences, and gradually to enforce a conformism that fears to question what is said to be a settled issue.''  Settled? Not here in the U.S., Madam Speaker, and hopefully not for long in Europe either.  On what he calls a ``moral world turned upside down,'' Lord Nicholas says, ``the greatest irony may be that a broad consensus exists, in a highly rights-aware political establishment, in favor of one of the gravest and most egregious abuses of human rights that human society has ever tolerated. Didn't Europeans think they could never and must never kill again on an industrial scale? What a cruel deceit, then, that has led us to this mass killing of children . . . .''  ``This is the question of questions for Europe;'' he writes, ``the practice of abortion is a mortal wound in Europe's heart.''  And he goes on to persuasively advocate for a new ``abolitionism'' for Europe akin to the movement to abolish slavery. But the notes are ever mindful of the need to meet the needs of women: ``The task for us is not merely to abolish. We must also creatively envisage new and compelling answers to the problems that give rise to this practice . . . .''  A brilliant essay. A must read for those who treasure and promote human rights. And equally applicable to us--in the United States--which mourns, or will mourn someday, killing over 53 million children by abortion since 1973.Lord Nicholas Windsor Warns Europeans Not to Forget Their Most Pressing                          Moral Issue: Abortion                   [From First Things, Dec. 1, 2010]                       (By Lord Nicholas Windsor)       At the close of the last century, as the reckoning was      drawn up in Europe for the actions and reactions of the      twentieth century, could we not have been forgiven for      tending a little toward the view that we had, after      everything, acquitted ourselves rather well? Hadn't we a long      list of accomplishments to admire in the years after 1945? We      had expunged Fascism, at immeasurable human cost, and we had      made profound reparation for its effects. We had washed our      hands of colonialism and vastly improved the material lot of      the poor in our own countries. We had built robust      democracies and welfare states and novel institutions in      Europe to defuse nationalisms and guarantee peace among      former belligerents. We had advanced the rights of women--     indeed, the whole spectrum of rights. We had won the Cold      War.       Much more could be added, I think. Poised just then before      the new millennium, seeing what vast work had been done in      our societies, mightn't it have seemed quite possible that      the greatest moral cancers in our civilization had been at      least contained and possibly eradicated? Hadn't history, at      least this moral cycle of history, really reached an end?       In the decade since the turn of the millennium, the      cultural mood has been less happy, for a variety of reasons.      Even at its most confident, however, the West generally      recognized that some work remained to be done. So, for      example, the position of the poorest in the world, it is      held, will gradually and continually improve if enough effort      is made, not least by the developed world. For the mitigation      of global warming and climate change, political determination      will suffice to alter the carbon-hungry lifestyles that cause      the problem.       The point here is that moderate political activity is      believed to be the sort of thing required to address these      problems, and there is a reasonable degree of optimism that      such political activity will be usefully brought to bear,      without the need to resort to force.       A remaining category of problems still to be dealt with      could be bundled together as ``Rogue Regimes, the Taliban,      and al-Qaeda.'' This category rightly causes public alarm and      engenders calls for robust and, where necessary, lethal      response. But these are not threats that appear existential      and have not as yet provoked a real sense of public crisis.      Neither have they brought about mass political action in the      West. They are still, I believe, seen as problems that will      ultimately be solved, or at least kept at bay, without huge      social upheaval on our home soil and certainly with nothing      like the warfare resorted to by previous generations.       Is it still possible then that we can point to anything of      any real significance that had been overlooked, anything      dangerous smuggled into this new phase of history that has      caught us unawares? I would say that this is indeed the case,      and I would like to focus especially on a matter and a      practice that constitutes the single most grievous moral      deficit in contemporary life: the abortion of our unborn      children.       This is a historically unprecedented cascade of destruction      wrought on individuals: on sons, daughters, sisters,      brothers, future spouses and friends, mothers and fathers--     destroyed in the form of those to whom we owe, quite simply      and certainly, the greatest solidarity and duty of care      because they are the weakest and most dependent of our fellow      humans. All else that we concern ourselves with in the lives      of human beings derives from the inescapable fact that first      we must have human lives with which to concern ourselves. By      disregarding this self-evident fact of the debt owed      immediately to the unborn--which is to be allowed to be born      (and let us not forget that all of us might have suffered      just the same fate before our birth)--humanity's deepest      instincts are trampled and shattered.       This was only an implausible glimmer in the eyes of the      most radically progressive thinkers and activists a century      ago. Today legal, permissive abortion is a fact of life so      deeply embedded and thoroughly normalized in our culture      that--and this is the most insidious factor in that      normalization--it has been rendered invisible to politics in      Europe. Even mentioning it has become the first taboo of the      culture.       There are consciences in Europe, it must be stressed, that      glow white-hot for justice and strive continuously for this      darkest fact of our public life to appear in public debate as      clearly as it does across the Atlantic in the United States.      For most of our contemporaries, however, this is a matter      that impinges little. The effectiveness of determined      campaigns of propaganda at the outset to harden consciences,      and gradually to enforce a conformism that fears to question      what is said to be a settled issue, has worked wonderfully      well.       And this enforcement of a new status quo succeeds so well      due, surely, to benefits enjoyed as a result--benefits of an      order that make acceptable even the killing of innocents, by      their protectors, on a scale that freezes the imagination.      How much then must depend on its remaining so, remaining      beyond question? This is the nub of that ideological word      choice. So much else can be chosen in a given life if the      option to dispose of unwanted children is dependably      available. So many intoxicating freedoms are newly      established, if only abortion is never again denied to women      and to men.       But what of the cost? As with the cost of previous great      willful destructions of human life, of whole classes of human      life, the fact that it must and will be borne is a certainty,      whatever the nature and scale of it. Of course, in the first      order of consequences, the price paid by the victims is not      obscure: We must never forget that the heaviest price is paid      by those whose lives are not to be lived.       In the second order of consequences, however, we must look      closely at the hidden burden faced by those, especially      mothers, who participate in these acts and the losses      affecting present and future society. How will a society      regard itself, or value its own distinctive culture, when it      has placed this fearful act at its center--consciously      approving, even celebrating, its own most egregious moral      failing? Will it have the confidence simply to regenerate      itself? To survive by producing the next generation of      children in sufficient numbers?       I would like to emphasize that we must never mistake the      secondary effects of this moral enormity for the primary, as      this would surely be to instrumentalize the victims and fail      again in our duty of respect toward them. It would be an      absurdity such as if the real tragedy of the Shoah were felt      first of all to lie in the social consequences. No, what we      must first lament is the mass destruction of human beings who      had first been deemed worthless. The fact in itself is     what we must keep before our eyes, before and apart from our      regard to anything that may derive from it.       We live in what is truly a moral world turned upside down,      and the greatest irony may be that a broad consensus exists,      in a highly rights-aware political establishment, in favor of      one of the gravest and most egregious abuses of human rights      that human society has ever tolerated. Didn't Europeans think      they could never and must never kill again on an industrial      scale? What a cruel deceit, then, that has led us to this      mass killing of children, for a theoretical greater good,      which in this case is simply the wish not to be bound by a      pregnancy unless it is fully and freely chosen and which,      outside of that parameter, is declared, by fiat, to be null      and void.       The sophistry is overwhelming: If I choose and desire my      child, then ipso facto I have granted it the right to live,      and it will live. But the inverse is equally the case, by      means of nothing more or less than my choice: Caesar's thumb      is up, or Caesar's thumb is down. And when it comes to      exporting this idea, we do it with zeal and determination      through such institutions as the United Nations and the      European Union.       The granting to ourselves of the right wantonly to kill,      each year, millions of our offspring at the beginning of      their lives: This is the question of questions for Europe.      The practice of abortion is a mortal wound in Europe's heart,      in the center of Hellenic and Judeo-Christian culture.       Having so recklessly carried this poison out of the      twentieth--the ugliest of all centuries--let us, for the sake      of all that has been good and beautiful and true about the      culture of the West, be clear that there is an urgent moral      priority here. Call it a ``New Abolitionism for Europe''--the      word abolitionism emphasizing the continuity between the      challenge faced now with the generational campaigns waged so      clear-sightedly in late-nineteenth-century America to rid      itself of the injustice of slavery. The abolitionists, I      believe, exemplify the courage and imagination required, even      if they do not provide perfect templates for what we face      now.       This is a task that calls for a broader approach to the      safeguarding of life, as taught to us by those earlier      struggles to apportion value where it previously had not been      deemed to exist. We must re-enliven the valuing of life, and      this cannot restrict itself to the question of abortion,      despite its moral centrality. It must have regard to every      threat to the integrity of human beings, at all stages of      their being and in all circumstances.       The task for us is not merely to abolish. We must also      creatively envisage new and compelling answers to the      problems that give rise to this practice, when the easiest      solutions may be destructive or distorting ones. And the goal      is that human life, without any exception, may be as      treasured and respected as the highest moral thought has      perennially called for it to be, and as our consciences      surely sound the echo.
