A health insurance issuer shall provide a      notice of such option to individuals who enroll in the plan.      An enrollee who exercises such conversion option shall pay      the full periodic charges for the nongroup policy.       ``(2) Exceptions.--A health insurance issuer shall not be      required to offer a nongroup policy under paragraph (1) if      the termination under the plan occurred because--       ``(A) the enrollee failed to pay any required monthly      premiums under the plan;       ``(B) the enrollee performed an act or practice that      constitutes fraud in connection with the coverage under the      plan;       ``(C) the enrollee made an intentional misrepresentation of      a material fact under the terms of coverage of the plan; or       ``(D) the terminated coverage under the plan was replaced      by similar coverage within 31 days after the date of      termination.       ``(f) Payment of Premiums.--       ``(1) In general.--Employers shall collect premium payments      from their employees through payroll deductions and shall      forward such payments and the contribution of the employer      (if any) to the Administrator. The Administrator shall      develop procedures through which such payments shall be      received and forwarded to the health insurance issuer      involved.       ``(2) Failure to pay.--       ``(A) In general.--Failure to pay premiums shall be treated      as a debt owed to the United States in the same manner as the      failure to repay a loan made to an individual under the      Higher Education Act of 1965 is treated as such a debt.       ``(B) Procedures.--The Administrator shall establish      procedures--       ``(i) for the termination of employers that fail, for a two      consecutive month period (or such other time period as      determined appropriate by the Administrator), to make premium      payments in a timely manner; and       ``(ii) for recovering the cost of unpaid and uncollected      premiums through an adjustment in the rates charged for the      subsequent year in accordance with section 3007(b)(1)(C).     ``SEC. 3005. EMPLOYER PARTICIPATION.       ``(a) Participation Procedure.--The Administrator shall      develop a procedure for employers and self-employed      individuals to participate in the program under this title,      including procedures relating to the offering of health      benefits plans to employees and the payment of premiums for      health insurance coverage under this title. For the purpose      of premium payments, a self-employed individual shall be      considered an employer that is making a 100 percent      contribution toward the premium amount.       ``(b) Enrollment and Offering of Other Coverage.--       ``(1) Enrollment.--A participating employer shall ensure      that each eligible employee has an opportunity to enroll in a      plan of the employer's choice or a plan of the employee's      choice in accordance with section 3007(d)(7).       ``(2) Prohibition on offering other comprehensive health      benefit coverage.--A participating employer may not offer a      health insurance plan providing comprehensive health benefit      coverage to employees other than a health benefits plan      offered under this title.       ``(3) Prohibition on coercion.--An employer shall not      pressure, coerce, or offer inducements to an employee to      elect not to enroll in coverage under the program under this      title or to select a particular health benefits plan.       ``(4) Offer of supplemental coverage options.--       ``(A) In general.--A participating employer may offer      supplementary coverage options to employees.       ``(B) Definition.--In subparagraph (A), the term      `supplementary coverage' means benefits described as      `excepted benefits' under section 2791(c).       ``(c) Regulatory Flexibility.--In developing the procedure      under subsection (a), the Administrator shall comply with the      requirements specified under the Regulatory Flexibility Act      under chapter 6 of title 5, United States Code, consider the      economic impacts that the regulation will have on small      businesses, and consider regulatory alternatives that would      mitigate such impact. The Administrator shall publish and      publicly disseminate a small business compliance guide,      pursuant to section 212 of the Small Business Regulatory      Enforcement Fairness Act, that explains the compliance      requirements for employer participation. Such compliance      guide shall be published not later than the date of the      publication of the final rule under this title, or the      effective date of such rules, whichever is later.       ``(d) Rule of Construction.--Except as provided in section      3004(f), nothing in this title shall be construed to require      that an employer make premium contributions on behalf of      employees.     ``SEC. 3006. ELIGIBILITY AND ENROLLMENT.       ``(a) In General.--An individual shall be eligible to      enroll in health insurance coverage under this title for      coverage beginning in 2011 if such individual is an employee      of a participating employer described in section 3001(a)(4)      or is a self-employed individual as defined in section      401(c)(1)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and meets      the definition of a participating employer in section      3001(a)(8).
