Speaker, I would like to thank the very distinguished gentleman from New York (Mr. Owens) for allowing me the courtesy to speak this evening.  As the daughter of a family of infantrymen and Marines, I was particularly captivated by an article I read just a few days ago in USA Today's editorial page entitled ``Untested Administration Hawks Clamor For War,'' by James Bamford, who is a member of USA Today's board of contributors. I would like to read a portion of it into the Record and insert it in its entirety.  He says, ``Beware of war hawks who never served in the military. That, in essence, was the message of retired four star Marine Corps General Anthony Zinni, a highly decorated veteran of the Vietnam War and the White House point man on the Middle East crisis. Zinni is one of the growing number of uniform officers in and out of the Pentagon urging caution on the issue of a preemptive strike against Iraq.  ``In an address recently in Florida, he warned his audience to watch out for the administration's civilian superhawks, most of whom avoided military service as best they could. `If you ask my opinion,' said Zinni, referring to Iraq, `General Brent Scowcroft, General Colin Powell, General Norman Schwarzkopf and General Zinni may all see this the same way.'                              {time}  1915  ``It might be interesting to wonder why all of the generals see it the same way, and all those (who) never fired a shot in anger (and) are really hell-bent to go to war see it a different way.  `` `That's usually the way it is in history,' he said.  ``Another veteran, Senator Chuck Hagel . . . who served in combat in Vietnam and now sits on the Foreign Relations Committee, was even more blunt. `It is interesting to me that many of those who want to rush this country into war and think it would be so quick and easy don't know anything about war. They come at it from an intellectual perspective versus having sat in jungles or foxholes and watched their friends get their heads blown off.' '' They have never seen that.  He talks about during the bloodiest years of the Vietnam War, Vice President Cheney decided against wearing the uniform of his country. Instead, he used multiple deferments to avoid military service altogether. In fact, he quotes the Vice President as saying, ``I had other priorities in the '60s than military service.''  Mr. Cheney is far from alone. ``Neither Paul Wolfowitz, the Deputy Defense Secretary, nor Richard Perle, the Chairman of the Defense Policy Board, have served in uniform, yet they are now two of the most bellicose champions of launching a bloody war in the Middle East.  ``What frightens many is the arrogance, naivete and cavalier attitude toward war. `The Army guys don't know anything,' Perle told The Nation's David Corn earlier this year,'' and debated with him whether 40,000 troops would be sufficient, when indeed most of the military say 200,000 to 250,000 would be needed, plus the support of many allies.  ``Non-combatants, however, litter the top ranks of the Republican hierarchy. President Bush served peacefully in the Texas National Guard,'' and indeed was missing for 1 year of that service. ``Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld spent his time in a Princeton classroom as others in his age group were fighting and dying on Korean battlefields (he later joined the peacetime Navy). Another major player in the administration's war strategy, Douglas Feith, the Defense Under Secretary for Policy, has no experience in the military. Nor does Mr. Cheney's influential Chief of Staff, Lewis Libby.  ``The top congressional Republican leaders'' in both the House and Senate ``never saw military service,'' and in contrast, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hyde) here in the House, ``a World War II combat veteran, has expressed skepticism about hasty U.S. action, as have some prominent Democrats'' such as the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Bonior), a distinguished Member who was in the military during the Vietnam War.  ``What is remarkable about this administration is that so many of those who are now shouting the loudest and pushing the hardest for this generation's war are the same people who avoided combat'' themselves, ``or often even a uniform, in Vietnam,'' just simply were not there.  ``Military veterans from any era tend to have more appreciation for the greater difficulty of getting out of a military action than getting in, a topic administration war hawks haven't said much about when it comes to Iraq.  ``Indeed,'' the author closes, ``the Bush administration's nonveteran hawks should review the origins of the Vietnam quagmire. Along the way, they might come across a quote from still another general, this one William Westmoreland, who once directed the war in Vietnam,'' and said, The military does not start wars. Politicians start wars.  Also, he quotes Civil War General William Tecumseh Sherman, who observed, ``It is only those who have neither fired a shot nor heard the shrieks and groans of the wounded who cry aloud for blood, more vengeance, more desolation.''  I commend this article to my colleagues. The title of it is ``Untested Administration Hawks Clamor for War.'' I ask Americans to think about it.  I will insert in the Record at this point the article that I mentioned previously.                    [From USA Today, Sept. 17, 2002]              Untested Administration Hawks Clamor for War                           (By James Bamford)       Beware of war hawks who never served in the military.       That, in essence, was the message of retired four-star      Marine Corps general Anthony Zinni, a highly decorated      veteran of the Vietnam War and the White House point man on      the Middle East crisis. Zinni is one of a growing number of      uniformed officers, in     and out of the Pentagon, urging caution on the issue of a      pre-emptive strike against Iraq.       In an address recently in Florida, he warned his audience      to watch out for the administration's civilian superhawks,      most of whom avoided military service as best they could.      ``If you ask me my opinion,'' said Zinni, referring to Iraq,      ``Gen. (Brent) Scowcroft, Gen. (Colin) Powell, Gen. (Norman)      Schwarzkopf and Gen. Zinni maybe all see this the same way.      It might be interesting to wonder why all of the generals see      it the same way, and all those (who) never fired a shot in      anger (and) are really hellbent to go to war see it a      different way.       ``That's usually the way it is in history,'' he said.       Another veteran, Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., who served in      combat in Vietnam and now sits on the Foreign Relations      Committee, was even more blunt. ``It is interesting to me      that many of those who want to rush this country into war and      think it would be so quick and easy don't know anything about      war,'' he said. ``They come at it from an intellectual      perspective vs. having sat in jungles or foxholes and watched      their friends get their heads blown off.''       The problem is not new. More than 100 years ago, another      battle-scarred soldier, Civil War Gen. William Tecumseh      Sherman, observed: ``It is only those who have neither fired      a shot nor heard the shrieks and groans of the wounded who      cry aloud for blood, more vengeance, more desolation.''       Last month, Vice President Cheney emerged briefly to give      several two-gun talks before veterans groups in which he      spoke of ``regime change'' and a ``liberated Iraq.''       ``We must take the battle to the enemy,'' he said of the      war on terrorism. Cheney went on to praise the virtue of      military service. ``The single most important asset      we have,'' he said, ``is the man or woman who steps      forward and puts on the uniform of this great nation.''       But during the bloodiest years of the Vietnam War, Cheney      decided against wearing that uniform. Instead, he used      multiple deferments to avoid military service altogether. ``I      had other priorities in the `60s than military service,'' he      once said.       Cheney is far from alone. For instance, neither Paul      Wolfowitz, the deputy Defense secretary, nor Richard Perle,      chairman of the Defense Policy Board, has served in uniform,      yet they are now two of the most bellicose champions of      launching a bloody war in the Middle East.       What frightens many is the arrogance, naivete and cavalier      attitude toward war. ``The Army guys don't know anything.''      Perle told The Nation's David Corn earlier this year. With      ``40,000 troops,'' he said, the United Stats could easily      take over Iraq. ``We don't need anyone else.'' But by most      other estimates, a minimum of 200,000 to 250,000 troops would      be needed, plus the support of many allies.       Even among Republicans, the warfare between the veterans      and non-vets can be intense. ``Maybe Mr. Perle would like to      be in the first wave of those who go into Baghdad,'' Hagel,      who came home from Vietnam with two Purple Hearts and a      Bronze Star, told The New York Times.       Secretary of State Colin Powell, a Vietnam combat veteran      and former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has often      expressed anger about the class gap between those who fought      in Vietnam and those who did not.       ``I am angry that so many of the sons of the powerful and      well-placed managed to wangle slots in Reserve and National      Guard units.'' he wrote in his 1995 autobiography, My      American Journey. ``Of the many tragedies of Vietnam, this      raw class discrimination strikes me as the most damaging to      the ideal that all Americans are created equal and owe equal      allegiance to their country.''       Non-combatants, however, litter the top ranks of the      Republican hierarchy. President Bush served peacefully in the      Texas National Guard. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld spent      his time in a Princeton classroom as others in his age group      were fighting and dying on Korean battlefields (he later      joined the peacetime Navy) Another major player in the      administrator's war strategy. Douglas Feith, the Defense      undersecretary for policy, has no experience in the military.      Nor does Cheney's influential chief of staff, Lewis Libby.       The top congressional Republican leaders--Senate Minority      Leader Trent Lott, House Speaker Dennis Hastert, House      Majority Leader Dick Armey and House Majority Whip Tom      Delay--never saw military service, either; only one, Armey,      has shown hesitation about invading Iraq. In contrast, House      International Relations Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-     Ill., a World War II combat veteran, has expressed skepticism      about hasty U.S. action, as have some prominent Democrats--     House Minority Whip David Bonior, Senate Majority Leader Tom      Daschle and former vice president Al Gore--who were in the      military during the Vietnam War.       No administration's senior ranks, of course, have to be      packed with military veterans in order to make good military      decisions. But what is remarkable about this administration      is that so many of those who are now shouting the loudest and      pushing the hardest for this generations's war are the same      people who avoided combat, or often even a uniform, in      Vietnam, their generation's war.       Military veterans from any era tend to have more      appreciation for the greater difficulty of getting out of a      military action than getting in--a topic administration war      hawks haven't said much about when it comes to Iraq.       Indeed, the Bush administration's non-veteran hawks should      review the origins of the Vietnam quagmire. Along the way,      they might come across a quote from still another general,      this one William Westmoreland, who once directed the war in      Vietnam.       ``The military don't start wars,'' he said ruefully.      ``Politicians start wars.''                          ____________________
