 President, the Nation watched in horror Friday as a senseless act of violence changed a community forever. The Senate and all Americans stand in mourning, sorrow, and sympathy with the students, faculty, staff, and families of Santa Fe High School in Texas.  No community should ever be subjected to such horror and heartbreak. Our hearts go out to the families of those killed, to the wounded who continue to battle injuries, to the first responders who leapt into action, and to the Santa Fe community that rallies around them.                          ____________________
