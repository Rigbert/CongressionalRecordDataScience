Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to take exception to my friend from New York, who suggested that somehow there is a war on cities and the rural areas have been exempted. This bill is a perfect example of a bill which is balanced in what it tries to do for the entire Nation.  It is true it serves rural areas and agriculture, which is important to all of us, regardless of where we live. But it is also a fact that a major portion of the spending in this bill literally goes into the gentleman's home city, as it does in mine, and all across the Nation, for programs like the food stamp program, child nutrition program, special milk program, the WIC Program, feeding for the elderly, and so many others that are important.  In the area of nutrition, this bill literally serves the Nation. It is not a bill directed to rural areas. There are specific programs that are directed to rural areas, and the gentleman addresses one, the Rural Telephone Bank.  I think we all concede and the committee report language says explicitly we are moving toward privatization of this bank, and I think it should be done. But we have to do it in an orderly way. What is at stake here is telephone service in areas of very sparse population, where in fact many of the large telephone companies have decided they do not want to build their subsidiaries. We have over the years created telephone cooperatives and others to deal with that service, much as we did in delivering electricity to those areas.  None of us want to jeopardize that. These are good, hard working people. We want to modernize it, we want to privatize it. I think the gentleman from New York is on the right track, but I think to do it precipitously with this amendment eliminating it may cause unintended consequences.
