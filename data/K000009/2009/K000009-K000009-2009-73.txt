Speaker, I rise to express the opinion that in the recent vote on H.R. 1106, which had to do with mortgage foreclosures and so-called enhancement of mortgage credit availability, it would be incumbent upon leadership of the institution to follow normal process and to allow the membership, if they wish to offer amendments before the Rules Committee, to be afforded that opportunity.  The challenges we face in the mortgage market are enormous, and regular order should be the rule of the day here. You know, we wouldn't have all these difficulties in our country if we would be properly using the normal institutions to resolve loans, loan difficulties, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Securities and Exchange Commission. When you don't use those, and you begin to try to tinker at the edges of a really large problem that the country faces, and the implosion of the mortgage market itself, you can make a lot of mistakes.  Members deserve respect. We deserve due diligence by the respective subcommittee and committees, including the opportunity to amend and include ideas in the manager's amendment. If that does not happen, we don't serve the American people well.  I think every Member here deserves that respect. And I would hope that, as next week begins, we will have the opportunity to perfect this legislation, if it can be perfected or, more properly, to meet with the Secretary of the Treasury and the economic leaders of the new administration to perhaps shape a different path forward.  Well, here's another Housing bill, claiming to be a nostrum for what ails us with housing foreclosures.  Last August, the same committee, with no hearings and no opportunity for amendment pushed through a landmark bill called Hope for Homeowners. It was supposed to help workouts, to bring assistance to counselors, to prevent foreclosures. To this date this program has worked out on 25 mortgages only. Twenty-Five--not 250, 2500, 25,000; just 25.  We have seen more foreclosures, not enough workouts, no Wall Street firms or their hired gun servicers coming to the table. The money for the communities engaged in counseling arrived late, and people lost their homes. The next batch of money did not arrive to allow cities to buy homes, and now out of state individuals or companies own the homes and these new owners have no vested interest in the properties. They are looking at the profit they will receive. The communities lose. The people lose. Even those homeowners who are paying their mortgages, keeping up with their bills and being overall good economic citizens are paying because their neighbors fell on dire straits, property values are plummeting. The money that did reach communities sometimes only reached certain communities--others suffered. In northern Ohio, Cleveland got the majority of the money and Toledo suffers with little or no money available to help people. I myself attended an auction run by a company in Dallas, TX, that sold away my constituent's homes to far away people and the communities are struggling and some neighborhoods are even dying.  Then, the last Administration shoved TARP at us. Crisis was coming or at hand and it was the only way to stop it. Those that voted for it thought that they were going to prevent more foreclosures--they wanted to help the people.  They found out Hank Paulson took all the money for Wall Street banks that didn't do workouts, and are not doing workouts. But the last Congress held them up, saved them, and paid them taxpayer dollars. To what end?  It's a new Congress and a new President. Foreclosures are still rampant. The economy is oscillating and the recession is deepening rather than stabilizing.  Now we are told: we've got another idea we want to sell you.  Let's go the bankruptcy route.  Of course, this won't deal with the millions of pending subprime foreclosures and achieve workouts. It will only address people filing for bankruptcy and about 20% of them might have a home involved in that process. These people could be helped, but we are not helping all the other people who are not turning to the last, absolute last resort of bankruptcy.  Do I understand this--no Wall Street big bank has been asked to go bankrupt and its assets distributed to more responsible community banks. But instead of bringing discipline to the banks, now we're going to ask the American people to file bankruptcy first. And, we're going to provide money to pay the fraudulent servicers.  If you're not sure how to vote on this, think what happened before. Think about the solutions we were told would work. Look around your community. Are they working?  I can tell you in my district they are not.  Here are some questions that ought to be answered before we move forward:  1. Does a family have to declare bankruptcy before qualifying for a ``workout/refinancing''? Why do families have to do this but not the banks?  2. What % of troubled loans would this plan rescue--less than 10%, . . . up to 90%?  3. Are eligible loans only ``subprime'' ones, or any loan?  4. In Title 1, why do lenders need financial incentives to modify loans? They've got TARP $.  5. What % of appropriated funds for this program will go to lenders? Why? How @ servicers? They're not licensed or certified. Why let them qualify for anything? They've been awful.  6. How will the government recoup its money? Is there a shared appreciation provision that reimburses government for its investment?  7. What happens to credit union financed mortgages? They did no subprimes. Are their loans eligible for workouts? What happens when a reduction in principal wipes out their annual profits?                          ____________________
