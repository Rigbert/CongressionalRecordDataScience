Speaker, Speaker Gingrich says we do not want to shut down the Federal Government. The majority leader says we do not want to shut down the Federal Government. President Clinton says we do not want to shut down the Federal Government.  Mr. Speaker, I offered an amendment in the Treasury-Postal bill last Wednesday which said we will continue the operations of Government because nobody wants to shut it down. They may want to reduce this program or cut out this program, but they want the Government to continue to serve Americans.  Why then, on almost a party line vote, when we have bipartisan support, the gentleman from Virginia [Mr. Davis], the gentleman from Virginia [Mr. Wolf], the gentleman from Maryland [Mr. Wynn], the gentlewoman from Maryland [Mrs. Morella], and others of us on both sides of the aisle, say nobody intends to shut down the Federal Government.  Why then do we not pass just a simple little bill that says we are not going to put this into politics. We will not play with people's lives, their ability to fund their mortgages, their food payments, their college tuition loans? Let us act responsibly. Let us keep our Government running. Let us pass the continuing resolution now.                          ____________________
