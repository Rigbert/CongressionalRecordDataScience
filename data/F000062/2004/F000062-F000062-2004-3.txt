 I want to make sure horsepackers can keep using these wilderness areas. I recognize that the wilderness areas created by this act are currently enjoyed by hikers, people on horseback, hunters and anglers. In addition, many visitors are serviced by commercial outfitters using horses as pack animals. I believe horsepacking is an important use of wilderness, and I know it is a use that was well established in wilderness prior to the passage of the Wilderness Act in 1964. Unlike some other units of the National Wilderness Preservation System, the areas designated by this act are not heavily used by horses at this time. While fully recognizing the responsibilities of the land managers to monitor visitor use and respond appropriately to any resource damage that may result from overuse, I believe that current levels of horsepacking use in these areas are consistent with wilderness designation. Do my colleagues agree?
