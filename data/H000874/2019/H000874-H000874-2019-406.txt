Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, it is hard to respond to that last speech.  A bill came from the Senate unanimously, Republicans and Democrats, that would have opened the government. We would have voted for that bill, all of us, but after not moving on Department of Homeland Security for 11-2/3 of a year, the then-majority party added into that bill a piece of legislation they knew would not pass in the United States Senate. Democrats would not be for it. The gentleman is correct.  The gentleman knew they wouldn't be for it, and the gentleman knew they couldn't get 60 votes. Notwithstanding that, they passed a piece of legislation that directly resulted in the shutdown of government.  I say that those are the facts.  As a matter of fact, we thought the President of the United States agreed with that bill, but somehow, in the some 900 feet of there to here, he changed his mind.  Maybe he talked to Ann Coulter or Sean Hannity. I don't know who the operative adviser was, but he changed his mind.  As a result, we had the longest shutdown in history.  The CBO says it cost at least $11 billion. The economic adviser at the White House said that it was costing at least one-tenth of a point a week.  This resolution says: Shutdown is stupid.  I am sure some don't agree with that, because I have been in this Chamber when you have voted to keep the government shut down. And you don't like me saying that.                              {time}  1230  Your Speaker asked you to open up the government and 144 of you--your Speaker, Mr. Boehner, not a Democrat, said: Look, this is stupid. We need to open up the government--voted no. Now, it passed because all of us voted with 87 Republicans, including your present leader, who voted yes to open up the government.  This resolution is so simple. A shutdown is stupid. That is all it says. We will see how you vote. And I am going to say something about some people who think it is stupid.  I want to thank my friend from Virginia, Ms. Wexton, for her leadership on this issue. She represents a district, as I do, where there are many hardworking Federal employees, who were negatively affected.  We had an argument here about whether we ought to give people a 2.6 percent raise, a COLA adjustment, to keep them even with the economy. And we voted to give them nothing--zero, zip. Not a cost-of-living adjustment. No pay at all.  I see my friend, the minority leader, on the floor. He said, not paying 800,000 people was unacceptable. I agree with him. I think it is unacceptable. I think asking people to work and then not paying them is not a moral thing to do.  This resolution, as I said, is simple. It is one I believe nearly every Member of this House ought to support, unless you support shutting down the government of the United States of America. It says, a shutdown should never be a strategy in negotiations over funding, period, full stop.  We just endured 35 days of a dangerous and unnecessary partial government shutdown that cost 800,000 American workers to be denied their paychecks and that the CBO says, as I just said, $11 billion was the cost. Those are the direct costs.  Our resolution makes it clear that such a use of shutdowns, or the threat of shutdowns, ought not to be tolerated in our political system. Now, this resolution says that, but I am going to have some other people who are going to say that as well.  No other country has this phenomena. I can't find another country that shuts its government down. In Australia, if you shut the government down, the government falls, so you have to form a new government.  There is no reason why Americans should have to live under the threat of being taken hostage, yet again, the next time there is an unresolved debate over an issue, whatever the issue might be.  Even many Republican leaders agree that using a shutdown is wrong. I think most leaders, as a matter of fact, not everyone.  Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell very definitively called shutdowns ``a failed policy.''  And Senator Susan Collins, rightfully, said, just a few days ago that: ``Shutdowns represent the ultimate failure to govern and should never be used as a weapon''--let me repeat that--``and should never be used as a weapon to achieve an outcome.''  Now, Mr. Speaker, I am sure my colleagues all know Lamar Alexander, the former Governor of Tennessee, former Secretary of Education, a Member of the United States Senate, and someone who was prominently mentioned and regularly mentioned as a candidate for President of the United States on the Republican ticket. Here is what he said: ``It is always wrong for either side to use shutting down the government as a bargaining chip in budget negotiations.''  Now, Mr. Speaker, I want my colleagues to hear this, Senator Alexander: ``It should be as off-limits as chemical weapons are to warfare.'' Could Senator Alexander have said it any more powerfully that shutdowns are not an option? That is all this resolution says.  Sadly, I think a lot of you are going to vote no, I suppose, on the theory that you think: No, if we don't get our way, shutting down the government is our option. That is certainly what you told Mr. Boehner and then Leader McCarthy.  This resolution says, let's not allow that to happen again. We now have 3 weeks to avert the next shutdown. I am hopeful that the Appropriations Committee will present us with a bipartisan agreement on how best to invest in border security. We all need to do our job.  Mr. Speaker, I call on my colleagues to join us on this resolution to make it clear to our Federal employees, to our contractors, to the American people, and, yes, to the rest of the world that we don't believe shutting down the government of the United States of America is an option in negotiations. Vote for this resolution. You know that shutting down government is not a positive result of our failures.
