Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 5225) to revise the boundaries of the Richmond National Battlefield Park based on the findings of the Civil War Sites Advisory Committee and the National Park Service and to encourage cooperative management, protection, and interpretation of the resources associated with the Civil War and the Civil War battles in and around the city of Richmond Virginia, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:                               H.R. 5225       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; DEFINITIONS.       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Richmond      National Battlefield Park Act of 2000''.       (b) Definitions.--In this Act:       (1) Battlefield park.--The term ``battlefield park'' means      the Richmond National Battlefield Park.       (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary      of the Interior.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:       (1) In the Act of March 2, 1936 (Chapter 113; 49 Stat.      1155; 16 U.S.C. 423j), Congress authorized the establishment      of the Richmond National Battlefield Park, and the boundaries      of the battlefield park were established to permit the      inclusion of all military battlefield areas related to the      battles fought during the Civil War in the vicinity of the      city of Richmond, Virginia. The battlefield park originally      included the area then known as the Richmond Battlefield      State Park.-       (2) The total acreage identified in 1936 for consideration      for inclusion in the battlefield park consisted of      approximately 225,000 acres in and around the city of      Richmond. A study undertaken by the congressionally      authorized Civil War Sites Advisory Committee determined that      of these 225,000 acres, the historically significant areas      relating to the campaigns against and in defense of Richmond      encompass approximately 38,000 acres.       (3) In a 1996 general management plan, the National Park      Service identified approximately 7,121 acres in and around      the city of Richmond that satisfy the National Park Service      criteria of significance, integrity, feasibility, and      suitability for inclusion in the battlefield park. The      National Park Service later identified an additional 186      acres for inclusion in the battlefield park.       (4) There is a national interest in protecting and      preserving sites of historical significance associated with      the Civil War and the city of Richmond.       (5) The Commonwealth of Virginia and its local units of      government have authority to prevent or minimize adverse uses      of these historic resources and can play a significant role      in the protection of the historic resources related to the      campaigns against and in defense of Richmond.       (6) The preservation of the New Market Heights Battlefield      in the vicinity of the city of Richmond is an important      aspect of American history that can be interpreted to the      public. The Battle of New Market Heights represents a premier      landmark in black military history as 14 black Union soldiers      were awarded the Medal of Honor in recognition of their valor      during the battle. According to National Park Service      historians, the sacrifices of the United States Colored      Troops in this battle helped to ensure the passage of the      Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution to      abolish slavery.       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act--       (1) to revise the boundaries for the Richmond National      Battlefield Park based on the findings of the Civil War Sites      Advisory Committee and the National Park Service; and       (2) to direct the Secretary of the Interior to work in      cooperation with the Commonwealth of Virginia, the city of      Richmond, other political subdivisions of the Commonwealth,      other public entities, and the private sector in the      management, protection, and interpretation of the resources      associated with the Civil War and the Civil War battles in      and around the city of Richmond, Virginia.     SEC. 3. RICHMOND NATIONAL BATTLEFIELD PARK; BOUNDARIES.       (a) Establishment and Purpose.--For the purpose of      protecting, managing, and interpreting the resources      associated with the Civil War battles in and around the city      of Richmond, Virginia, there is established the Richmond      National Battlefield Park consisting of approximately 7,307      acres of land, as generally depicted on the map entitled      ``Richmond National Battlefield Park Boundary Revision'',      numbered 367N.E.F.A.80026A, and dated September 2000. The map      shall be on file in the appropriate offices of the National      Park Service.       (b) Boundary Adjustments.--The Secretary may make minor      adjustments in the boundaries of the battlefield park      consistent with section 7(c) of the Land and Water      Conservation Fund Act of 1965 (16 U.S.C. 4601-9(c)).     SEC. 4. LAND ACQUISITION.       (a) Acquisition Authority.--       (1) In general.--The Secretary may acquire lands, waters,      and interests in lands within the boundaries of the      battlefield park from willing landowners by donation,      purchase with donated or appropriated funds, or exchange. In      acquiring lands and interests in lands under this Act, the      Secretary shall acquire the minimum interest necessary to      achieve the purposes for which the battlefield is      established.       (2) Special rule for private lands.--Privately owned lands      or interests in lands may be acquired under this Act only      with the consent of the owner.       (b) Easements.--       (1) Outside boundaries.--The Secretary may acquire an      easement on property outside the boundaries of the      battlefield park and around the city of Richmond, with the      consent of the owner, if the Secretary determines that the      easement is necessary to protect core Civil War resources as      identified by the Civil War Sites Advisory Committee. Upon      acquisition of the easement, the Secretary shall revise the      boundaries of the battlefield park to include the property      subject to the easement.       (2) Inside boundaries.--To the extent practicable, and if      preferred by a willing landowner, the Secretary shall use      permanent conservation easements to acquire interests in land      in lieu of acquiring land in fee simple and thereby removing      land from non-Federal ownership.       (c) Visitor Center.--The Secretary may acquire the Tredegar      Iron Works buildings and associated land in the city of      Richmond for use as a visitor center for the battlefield      park.     SEC. 5. PARK ADMINISTRATION.       (a) Applicable Laws.--The Secretary, acting through the      Director of the National Park Service, shall administer the      battlefield park in accordance with this Act and laws      generally applicable to units of the National Park System,      including the Act of August 25, 1916 (16 U.S.C. 1 et. seq.)      and the Act of August 21, 1935 (16 U.S.C. 461 et. seq.).

The Secretary shall include the Battle of New      Market Heights and the role of black Union soldiers in the      battle in historical interpretations provided to the public      at the battlefield park.       (c) Cooperative Agreements.--The Secretary may enter into      cooperative agreements with the Commonwealth of Virginia, its      political subdivisions (including the city of Richmond),      private property owners, and other members of the private      sector to develop mechanisms to protect and interpret the      historical resources within the battlefield park in a manner      that would allow for continued private ownership and use      where compatible with the purposes for which the battlefield      is established.       (d) Technical Assistance.--The Secretary may provide      technical assistance to the Commonwealth of Virginia, its      political subdivisions, nonprofit entities, and private      property owners for the development of comprehensive plans,      land use guidelines, special studies, and other activities      that are consistent with the identification, protection,      interpretation, and commemoration of historically significant      Civil War resources located inside and outside of the      boundaries of the battlefield park. The technical assistance      does not authorize the Secretary to own or manage any of the      resources outside the battlefield park boundaries.     SEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.       There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as are      necessary to carry out this Act.     SEC. 7. REPEAL OF SUPERSEDED LAW.
