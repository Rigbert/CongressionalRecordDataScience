 President, I ask to have printed in the Record finalist essays written by Vermont High School students as part of the Fourth Annual State of the Union Essay contest conducted by my office. These 9 finalists were selected from over 380 entries.  The essays follow:  Carly Neeld, Champlain Valley Union High School, Grade 11 (Finalist)       It is a great privilege to be a citizen of the United      States. As citizens, we have a responsibility to ensure that      our government is used to improve lives. Although this      country has achieved much, there are many aspects that can be      improved. In particular, we need to work towards reducing the      unemployment rate and take meaningful steps to stop climate      change. Addressing these two issues now will go a long way      towards helping current and future generations.       The unemployment rate is at seven percent. It is our      obligation, as a nation, to lower this rate. By lowering the      unemployment rate, we could see a drop in crime and a      reduction in poverty as more people are earning a steady      income. Because of this steady income, there will be more tax      revenue which could then support safety net programs that      help the impoverished. An increased employment rate will also      cause an increased access to health care and other      necessities to living, strengthening families and      communities.       In order to decrease the unemployment rate, there are      things in our country that will need improvement and our      support. Affordable childcare can benefit the employment      rate, as it allows parents to be free to go to work. Access      to higher education is also essential in increasing the      employment rate, as more people will be able to obtain higher      paying jobs or start businesses that create jobs. Quality      public education, especially early childhood education, will      build a strong workforce as jobs are created. It is important      to acknowledge the small businesses that provide countless      jobs and to ensure that the government is giving these      businesses the support they need to sustain their existence.       Climate change is a pressing issue the world is now facing      and, as the United States, we need to lead the world in a      greener direction. Carbon dioxide emissions are growing      exponentially and are hurting our environment and our      people's health. We need to take meaningful steps to reduce      our carbon dioxide emissions and put our energy and resources      into renewable energy technologies. Not only will the      environment benefit, but we will benefit economically as the      prices of energy will be stable and affordable.       These goals may be difficult to achieve; however, the      result will benefit the country immensely and place us as a      world leader in many aspects. These issues must be addressed,      as they will improve the lives of every citizen and will      allow us to strengthen our union.                                  ____       Rebecca Paige, South Royalton School, Grade 12 (Finalist)       The rising cost of a college education is becoming a      chronic problem for everyone. We want everyone to become a      well-educated, informed citizen, but are doing so at a steep      price. We are paying an exorbitant amount of money and are      being left with large amounts of debt.       For many families, having a high school senior in the      household brings mixed feelings towards college. There is the      excitement towards experiencing new things, but also the      concern for how they will be able to afford a college      education. The worries start right at the beginning, before      the senior is even accepted. Having just finished my college      application, I estimate that I paid about $600 for      application and testing fees. What do these fees do to help      with post-secondary education? Nothing. These fees are being      used as a gamble for the right to a college education. There      is nothing saying that the applicant will be guaranteed      admittance to college, only the chance of it. There should be      a movement passed that will eliminate all application,      testing, and other miscellaneous fees associated with the      application process, so students have a chance to apply to      the college they want without money to limit them in the      pursuit of a higher education.       Even once students have been accepted to a college or      university, the tuition should be lowered or subsidized by      the government. Pursuing education beyond high school serves      to help better society and, in turn, will help us out of the      unstable state in which we find ourselves. There are many      positive aspects about pursuing education beyond high school,      but they are being outweighed by the financial repercussions      of the decision to do so. This is not how the system should      be run. We should not have to cringe at the word college; we      should embrace it because of the plethora of opportunities      that it will provide us.       There seems to be a double standard in this country. We      want our citizens to pursue a higher education because the      country will reap the benefits, yet we still limit the post-     secondary education to those that can afford it and not let      everyone have the opportunity to a higher education. There      needs to be a change, if anything is going to move forward.      Therefore, let all fees be eliminated, let there be lower      tuition costs, and allow all people a chance for a college      education without having to sign over their life in order to      get one.                                  ____ Kendall Spaulding, Missisquoi Valley Union Middle, High School, Grade                              11 (Finalist)       ``Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the      courage to continue that counts,'' said Winston Churchill.      Churchill's quote links two controversial issues that our      country is now facing, education and unemployment. We have to      think about the people in our state and their futures. How      will they continue to succeed? If people want to continue      seeking jobs, they must go through a schooling process in      order for them to feel satisfied. We want to grow strong and      protect our views, so, taking control of our future will make      it stronger and brighter as a country. We have to start to      address these topics first, so they won't become a failure,      but a success for our country.       I believe education should be the government's biggest      concern because of what it can push our nation to accomplish.      We have to make the common core strong, so that students know      what to expect. We cannot just give up after a failure, we      have to be determined and think more about of our future.      Marion Brady, who is a classroom teacher, asked, ``What      knowledge is absolutely essential for every learner?'' His      question is what we think the curriculum should be to      everyone. I believe if any student is strong in a core of      truly essential skills, they can succeed in anything they      want in their future. I believe enforcing the common core      will help achieve our goals and lead to courageous decisions.       Building a successful education program will begin to      strengthen the unemployment rate in our country. I think      benefits being extended isn't the right solution because      there are so many opportunities to go towards to be      successful. If the government chooses to extend the benefits,      we would be spending billions of dollars in a short amount of      time, which would not help our economy. We have to think      about what's best for the individual, as well as the whole      country. It's best if we continue to persevere by going to a      job training facility to be more successful. Making no      extensions would lead people to create a successful life on      their own, gain confidence, and rely on only themselves.      Leading people to search for a job is in their own hands and      they need to have courage in order to succeed in life.       To conclude, our country has to continue to grow as a whole      in order to solve the controversial issues. Making successful      decisions can permanently change the way the country grows.      Also, creating a confident country leads to less room for      failure in the long run. Let's believe we can create a strong      common core plan for education and a non-extendable      unemployment plan. I believe it can be done, it just takes      time and hard work to get them. Let these two topics not be      an issue anymore and finally resolve them, so we all can grow      to our best.                                  ____        Eric Tucker, Spaulding High School, Grade 11 (Finalist)       The year 2013 was a period of progress and setback. The      government was shut down for sixteen days, the unemployment      rate decreased to seven percent, the lowest unemployment rate      in five years, The Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare) was passed      with mixed initial success, and many other influential      achievements and failures occurred. A new year is here, and      now is the time to further develop 2013's successes and solve      its problems. The best way to turn 2014 into a year of      achievement is to unite Americans and Congress by offering      multiple solutions to common disagreements and by discovering      a series of common goals with the support of the entire      nation.       One of the catastrophically unsolved problems in 2013 was      the gap between Republicans and Democrats in America. The      government was shut down from October 1st to October 16th,      and it nearly defaulted on its bills during this harsh debt-     ceiling debate.     This could have been avoided, if multiple choices were      offered during these debates. For example, the main reason      the Republicans did not want to re-open the government is      they strongly opposed the Democratic principle of a      government-controlled health insurance system (ObamaCare).      One compromise, which could have solved this dilemma, is      making ObamaCare optional. This compromise never occurred      because the Democrats wanted ObamaCare nationalized with a      fine on those who did not enlist and the Republicans wanted      complete abolishment. Middle ground must be reached.       Further connecting Congress and America will also help      eliminate some of 2013's largest problems. Sometimes Congress      is split because each Congressperson is acting on behalf of      his or her voters. At other times, such as the government      shutdown, Republicans and Democrats disagree on the best ways      to solve a problem. If Congress and the White House listened      to the public more, then America can help its leaders tackle      America's most difficult problems. Utilize Facebook, utilize      Twitter, utilize easy, accessible websites and conduct      multiple surveys concerning many issues the country faces.      Have America decide if the debt ceiling should be raised;      have America decide if ObamaCare should be mandatory and      existent; have America become one of the mediators of public      dilemma. Stop having Republicans elect Republicans and      Democrats elect Democrats; have Americans elect Americans.       Unification and success can also be created through      generating nationally common goals. For example, the issue of      clean energy is a project being half-heartedly tackled by the      government. Turn 2014 into the year that the United States of      America leads the world to a greener Earth. Begin the      movement that creates 4.5 million jobs, stimulates the      economy, and eliminates 1.2 billion tons of carbon emissions      per year by 2030. This single goal can cause America to reap      the benefits of economic stimulation, energy-efficiency, and      national unification.       It is time for America to raise itself to new heights as a      truly united nation. Allowing the public to help its leaders      compromise and work on common goals will bring this country      together. Now is the time to unite the United States of      America.                                  ____   Madison Gilley, Mouth Abraham Union Middle, High School, Grade 9                                (Finalist)       There are many factors that impact our environment. Air      pollution, deforestation, and climate change are just a few.      These specific problems are caused by humans. We have a      responsibility to our planet, ourselves, and to the other      species that live here with us. Senator Bernie Sanders should      take a stronger stance in protecting the environment because      it is important to the state and the world.       Air pollution has a vast effect on climate change and the      environment. In 2012 alone, the world produced 9.7 billion      metric tons of CO2 emissions (CO2Now).      All of the carbon emissions that go into the air cause      climate change because the atmosphere traps the      CO2, which causes all the extra heat. The air, in      many places, is not very clean because of air pollution and      smog. Some factories use green energy so they do not put out      as much pollution as other factories.       Deforestation, caused by logging, farming, mining, and      development is also another immense problem that needs to be      addressed. Rain forests are being cut down at an alarming      rate. These rainforests need to be protected. Madagascar has      lost 95% of its rainforests. Sumatra only has 15% of its      rainforests left. The Atlantic coast of Brazil has lost 90-     95% of its rainforest (Mongabay). Rainforests are important      because they provide a habitat for plants and animals, they      regulate our climate, they help to prevent soil erosion, and      they provide a home for indigenous people. Bernie Sanders      needs to help protect the forests not just in Vermont, but      all around the world.       Different environments around the world are in danger      because of climate change. One way that climate change is      caused is by carbon emissions. Air pollution causes climate      change because when the air is polluted by all the      CO2 that we are producing, it damages the ozone      layer. Climate change also affects forests which causes      damage to the animal population and their homes. The earth      isn't an unlimited supply; we need to use what we have      carefully and conscientiously.       Senator Bernie Sanders should take a stronger stance in      protecting the environment because climate change,      deforestation and air pollution are major problems damaging      our environment. These are all environmental issues that have      social and economic impacts. We only have one planet and we      need to use what we have carefully.                                  ____     Kylee DiMaggio, Missisquoi Valley Union High School, Grade 11                                (Finalist)       Barack Obama once said, ``Change will not come if we wait      for some other person or some other time. We are the ones      we've been waiting for. We are the change that we seek.'' The      American dream that many strive for is currently far out of      reach for most. Our current economy is in such a dire state      that some are even predicting another economic depression.      This economic issue is vital to our future as a nation and      impacts United States citizens directly. I also fear that if      this issue is not addressed before long the consequences may      be great. Fossil fuel usage (along with other things) have      aided in the increase of unemployment rates in the United      States and the poor economy. I believe that if the president      were to focus on the state of the economy many other issues      in the United States could be addressed as well.       Although I believe that many people blame the state of the      economy on an excess of government spending, a huge      expenditure of the government is in the subsidization of      fossil fuels. Not only are fossil fuels harmful to the      environment, but they are extremely costly. With the current      economy, many citizens struggle to afford the prices of this      resource. Furthermore, the large amount of dependence on      fossil fuels leaves this resource an unreachable necessity.      It is vital for the president to search for an alternative      resource because fossil fuels are currently too costly for      average citizens to afford. The president should be focused      on finding an alternative resource for fossil fuels to      decrease government spending and, in turn, improve the      economy.       As a result of a poor economy, citizens are finding it hard      to live comfortably and fulfill their ideas of the American      dream. Government spending reduces the amount of money the      government is able or willing to provide to the unemployed.      Theodore Roosevelt said, ``Behind the ostensible government      sits enthroned an invisible government owing no allegiance      and acknowledging no responsibility to the people.'' In      saying this, Roosevelt infers that the president is not to      blame, it is the politicians below him that do not allow him      to make change. I believe that the government as a whole      should be concerned with the outcome of such a poor economy.      For example, jobs are extremely limited, leaving unemployment      rates higher than the United States have seen in years. The      unemployed are finding it hard to live comfortably on the      current unemployment benefits. Therefore, the government, as      a whole, should be focused on extending unemployment benefits      to those in need. Citizens are suffering because of the poor      economy and the government needs to take action to avoid      this.       The United States economy must improve the state of our      union. Government spending must also decrease to make room      for citizens in need of assistance. Without government      assistance the citizens turn against their government and      grow unhappy. The United States should focus on decreasing      government spending to improve the economy because without a      stable economy, citizens suffer and the state of the union      crumbles.                                  ____        Trevor McNaney, Milton High School, Grade 12 (Finalist)       Amidst not only our challenges in the past year, but in our      progress as well, we as a nation have proved our unity and      strength. We have confronted issues, such as gun control and      gay marriage and have worked hard to figure out how to best      deal with issues like these. We have proved ourselves as      pioneers; we have explored the wonders of space and have      developed amazing technologies new to the world. I ask the      American people, with their strength and their unity, to      confront an entirely different issue. One that is so      intertwined with our lives and society, yet one that is so      ignored. I ask the people to confront a world issue. Today, I      ask that each and every individual of this nation to consider      the impacts that our society has on the environment.       We as a nation have come to understand that in order to      prosper, we need to work, produce, and consume with our      earnings. Companies produce goods that are meant to be broken      and thrown away so that consumers will simply buy more of      their product. I argue that we are smarter. A society that      values monetary gain at the demise and destruction of the      environment is one that will not last. Without a healthy      environment, we cannot have a healthy society. We are too      scared to look at the destruction and pollution that we are      causing as a society and as a global economic system. I ask      what is more fearful, deciding to make progress today or      ignoring the issues of tomorrow? Ignoring until there are no      longer any issues to worry about, until the Earth itself has      perished along with its inhabitants. Now is our gateway and      foundation to the future. We must change the way we live in      order to live.       The exciting possibility is that we can change. We hold      more knowledge and resources than we ever have before.      America, it is time that we put the environment first. It is      time that we alter the way that we view and interact with the      world around us. By 2026, every home needs a solar panel and      seventy percent of the buildings we use need to use gray      water. And by 2030, seventy-five percent of the      transportation industry needs to use bio-fuels. By 2035,      seventy percent of vehicles need to be electric and seventy      percent of America needs to be powered by clean renewable      energy and resources. Dismiss the idea that it cannot be      done, that we as a society and the world cannot solve the      problems that we have created. And most of all, dismiss the      notion that ''it is not your problem.'' The problems are      here, they are real, and they are now. This world is our      home, let's treat it like one.                                  ____        Emil Koenig, Vermont Commons School, Grade 12 (Finalist)       This past year has posed many serious national security and      foreign policy challenges for the United States. The nation      encountered various issues like the Edward Snowden's NSA      leaks, chemical weapons uses in the Syrian civil war, and a      government closing. While all of these issues are     significant and have captured the headlines of the news      media, we must also keep in mind the small issues that can      potentially transform into global conflicts.       Currently, for example, one of the seemingly more exotic      issues threatening world peace involves the disputed Diaoyu      (or Senkaku) Islands in the South China Sea. Although these      barren rocks might seem truly worthless, as they are      uninhabited and lack natural resources, this fact did not      stop China, Japan or South Korea from staking conflicting      claims and angrily criticizing each other, escalating a small      territorial issue into a potentially larger crisis. While      China flaunts its growing dominance in the region, the South      Koreans and Japanese reject Beijing's territorial claims.       In my conversations with various Chinese people during my      last year studying abroad in Beijing, most people strongly      sided with their government's territorial claims. In almost      the same breath, they catalogued a long list of grievances      from the turbulent history of Sino-Japanese relations. Many      still vividly recalled earlier atrocities, such as the ``Rape      of Nanjing,'' When Japanese troops stormed Nanjing, raping      women and burying people alive.       Chinese authorities play on these popular fears,      disseminating propaganda that blames Japan for countless      issues. Debates about truly useless ocean rocks, therefore,      become conflated with deeply felt passions from the past,      which is why it is important to understand the cultural and      historical backgrounds of various conflicts in order to      resolve them.       Because the situation now brewing in the South China Sea      stems from deeply felt cultural and historical origins, the      situation is extremely volatile. When the United States flew      two bombers over the islands to demonstrate close ties with      Japan, we may have raised the level of tension to a still      higher level. Following the flights by our bombers, the      Chinese, the Japanese, and the Koreans all sent planes to fly      over the islands, to demonstrate their respective ownership      claims over of the islands.       As a nation, if we want to avoid potential wars, the      government should consider more peaceful options, such as      encouraging negotiations, before sending in war planes. The      government must practice more diplomatic conversations with      Chinese, Japanese and Korean partners in order to reduce the      likelihood of war. Flying war planes over disputed islands      never solves issues; it mainly risks causing more tensions.       In sum, to avoid international incidents, the United States      must practice a more responsible system of foreign policy.      The tension of the East Asian region is only one example of      when America used force prior to engaging in other forms of      international communication. Instead, the US government must      assess historical and cultural backgrounds of various      conflicts and first try to resolve them through peaceful      means, rather than skyrocket the likelihood of starting wars.                                  ____Abigail Morris, Champlain Valley Union High School, Grade 11 (Finalist)       Many United States issues have been the subject of      attention from the media, citizens and officials. However, in      my opinion the environmental issues in the US have not had      their share of the spotlight. Small measures, whether      involving policy or simple publicity, could change the US      environment for the better. One of these measures is      increased regulation of the fracking industry.       Hydraulic fracturing or ``fracking'' is the process of      gathering oil by forcing highly pressurized fluid into oil or      gas formations, so that the oil or gas flows to the surface.      The use of fracking has jumped to 25% of oil production, up      from 1% in 2000. It has spurred hopes of an energy      independent United States, but there are many drawbacks,      especially where the environment is concerned. Fracking      endangers plants, livestock, and most importantly, human      beings. Refusal or reluctance to crack down on the fracking      industry could seriously harm the health of the United States      and its people. We must not let ourselves be lured by the      economic benefits of fracking, and instead must examine it      closely to determine if energy independence is worth the      risk.       Of the 750 chemicals that can be used in fracking fluid, 29      are carcinogens. In Wyoming, Pennsylvania and other states,      these chemicals have contaminated drinking water in      residential areas. If there is no way to change the chemical      makeup of fracking fluid or illegalize fracking completely,      making sure the fracking industry is subject to strict      regulation is the next best course of action.       Progress is being made, however. The FRAC (Fracturing      Responsibility and Awareness of Chemicals) Act was introduced      in 2011, which shows that the issue has caught the attention      of Congress. However, both the House and Senate versions have      yet to be passed. These bills need to be brought back to the      attention of Congress, because as long as the fracking      industry is not subject to the same regulation as every      other, the natural environment and citizens of the United      States will continue to be at risk.                          ____________________
