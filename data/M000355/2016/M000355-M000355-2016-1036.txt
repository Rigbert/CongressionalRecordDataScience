 President, I welcome our colleagues back from their State work periods. The Senate has gotten a lot done under the new majority, and we will continue our work today.  First, I want to remember the daily sacrifice of our Capitol Police in light of the incident last Monday. Incidents like these remind us of the sacrifices officers make on our behalf each and every day. These brave men and women protect all who work here. They protect the countless visitors from across our Nation and across the world. They defend this symbol of our democracy, and that means putting themselves in harm's way day in and day out. Again, we thank them for it.  We also welcome Capitol Police Chief Matthew Verderosa. Chief Verderosa comes to us with more than three decades of law enforcement experience, and that is a good thing given that this incident occurred just days into his new position. The Chief inherits an able, brave team who works hard every day to keep us safe. We look forward to continuing our close working relationship with the Capitol Police under his leadership.                          ____________________
