 Even Senator McCain and Senator Feingold have indicated that six of them we can probably reach agreement on in principle.  You are the majority leader, not I, but let me suggest on the ones that we can agree with in principle, it might be appropriate to pass a separate technical corrections bill, if it needs to be in a separate bill, in order to avoid going back to the House. Pass the technical corrections bill simultaneously; it goes back to the House, the other bill goes on down to the President.  I am a little worried about there not being much interest in the technicalcorrections bill after the main bill leaves the Senate.  If we can reach agreement on at least some of these, as appears possible, I hope the majority leader might consider taking up the technical corrections package simultaneously, sending it out of here and back over to the House side. It is just a suggestion.
