 As you noted, I hope, we waited the full 24 hours on the supplemental conference report so that Members will have the full 24 hours. And as a matter of fact, we were almost to the hour at 5:50 p.m. yesterday. And although there were some Members whom it had caused a problem to because of their schedules, we had said we were going to give 24 hours' notice, and we did give 24 hours' notice, and we want to continue to do that.  On the amending process, obviously, we are going to many times require that amendments be filed timely so that Members have an opportunity to see what amendments are going to be asked of the Rules Committee. But we will pursue what we believe to be, and hope in consultation with you, is a reasonable time frame to expect people to notice their amendments. Clearly, they have to be out of committee. Clearly, they have to have time to see the bill and prepare amendments. But we want to have amendments in many instances noted so that the membership can know what they are considering.
