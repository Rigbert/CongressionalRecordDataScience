Reclaiming my time, we have worked out a partnership arrangement with the gentleman from New Mexico [Mr. Skeen] and others on the committee. I am quite confident of the total package.  I see no further use to discuss this at this time unless the gentleman from New Mexico has a question or the distinguished gentleman from California.
