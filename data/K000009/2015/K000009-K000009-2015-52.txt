 I remember standing at the corner of Ohio and Michigan Avenues in Matamoros, Mexico, and looking at the TRICO windshield factory that was moved from the State of New York down there, and Parker Seals. It almost seemed like a movie set but for one thing, it was real.  Last year alone, our trade deficit cost us 20 percent of our GDP. Is anybody here paying attention or are we all a part of the 1 percent and forget about the 99 percent who have had to bear the brunt of this terrible, terrible outsourcing of jobs?  Average American wages across my region have dropped by $7,000. This trade deficit didn't happen by accident. Some people got filthy rich off of it.  This is a time for America to say, ``No more. No more. We are going to do it right. We are going to create trade deals that create jobs in our country, create a stronger middle class, raise wages, improve the environment, here and abroad. No more taking it out of the hide of America's workers.''  We are here because we stand on their shoulders. Vote ``no'' on this rule and ``no'' on TAA and ``no'' on TPP.
