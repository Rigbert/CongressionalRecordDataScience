 President, this Amendment will add a section to the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999 that will designate the headquarters building of the Central Intelligence Agency as the ``George Herbert Walker Bush Center for Central Intelligence.''  I believe that this is a fitting tribute to a man that has had a remarkable and distinguished career in public service not only as President, but also as Vice President, Member of Congress, U.N. Ambassador, the Chief of the U.S. Liaison Office to the Peoples' Republic of China, and Director of Central Intelligence.  President Bush, of course, is the only Director of Central Intelligence to become President of the United States.  I know that he has always been particularly proud of his tenure as the Director of Central Intelligence. I also know that he guided the Agency through a difficult time and continues to be held in high regard by not only CIA employees, but also the Intelligence Community at large.  Currently, the headquarters building at Langley does not have a formal name and this would be the only facility in the Washington, D.C. area named after President Bush. This amendment has been cleared on both sides and I urge its immediate adoption.
