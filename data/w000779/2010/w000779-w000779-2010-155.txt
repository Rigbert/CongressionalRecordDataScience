President, I am pleased to join today with my colleague from Maine, Senator Snowe, to introduce the Promote Nanotechnology in Schools Act of 2010.  As Co-Chair of the Congressional Nanotechnology Caucus, and former Chair of the Commerce Subcommittee on Science, Technology, and Innovation, I have been involved in encouraging the development of nanotechnology for many years. Although I am gratified by the tremendous advancements that have already been achieved in nanotechnology, there are significant hurdles that could prevent the U.S. from realizing the full potential that nanotechnology holds for job creation, economic growth, and international competitiveness.  During this challenging period when the economy is faltering and the government is working to help create jobs, nanotechnology represents an opportunity to provide long-term, well-paid employment for millions of Americans. In fact, the National Nanotechnology Initiative--the Federal Government organization that coordinates nanotechnology research across all Federal agencies--estimates that the global nanotechnology workforce will require 2 million trained workers by 2015. It is estimated that only 20,000 workers are currently employed in this field.  To ensure that many of the needed jobs will be created here in the U.S., it is necessary to provide our studentswith the tools that will provide the skills and knowledge that nanotechnology companies need. This is exactly what the Promote Nanotechnology in Schools Act will do.  This act directs the National Science Foundation to establish a grant program that would provide schools, community colleges, 2- and 4-year colleges and universities and other educational institutions with up to $400,000 to purchase nanotechnology education equipment and materials. Schools participating in the program would be required to provide matching funds of at least 1/4 of the amount of the grant.  In my home State, it has been very rewarding to see the technological advances and entrepreneurial success achieved by the Oregon Nanoscience and Microtechnologies Institute, ONAMI. Oregon's first signature research center, ONAMI is a public-private partnership between the State's top research universities, major corporations, and small business entrepreneurs. Working with top scientists and graduate students, and leveraging the nanotechnology equipment available at Oregon's public universities, ONAMI has provided gap funding to 18 start-up businesses, which have created at least 60 new jobs.  While Oregon has been a leader in this arena, it is certainly not alone. Nanotechnology job creation efforts are accelerating in hubs for technology development throughout the country. As Co-Chair of the Congressional Nanotechnology Caucus, I have had the opportunity to talk with innovators and entrepreneurs from nanotechnology companies working in the areas as diverse as energy management, health technology, environmental sciences, advanced computing, textile and material sciences, and many others. What I have heard in common across all of these fields is the need for qualified workers.  If high school and college students are not exposed to nanotechnology, this emerging field will not be able to reach its full potential. Without a qualified workforce that will allow nanotech companies in this country to scale-up, foreign competitors will be able to fill the vacuum in the global marketplace. With the Promote Nanotechnology in Schools Act, this country will put the resources into place that will prepare our students to meet the needs of the emerging nanotech economy.  That is why I want to thank Senator Snowe for joining me in introducing this timely, and much-needed legislation. I also want to acknowledge the support and efforts of the nanotech companies that worked with me and other Members of Congress to help build support for this bill. Finally, I call upon my colleagues to move quickly not only to pass this legislation but also the National Nanotechnology Initiative Amendments Act reauthorization. These important bills will help advance nanotechnology in this country, and protect the U.S.'s position at the forefront of innovation and economic opportunity.  I urge all my colleagues to support innovation and promote entrepreneurial competition by cosponsoring this legislation.                          ____________________
