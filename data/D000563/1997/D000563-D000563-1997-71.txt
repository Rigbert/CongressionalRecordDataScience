Mr. President, let me say at the outset, we don't have a settlement agreement. We are not talking about legislating one today. There is a good question, whatever we add to this appropriations bill, whether it is going to have an ultimate impact on that agreement.  Let me also say, on the question of expenses, I think the Senator from New Hampshire would acknowledge expenses are specified costs of a lawsuit and don't get to attorney's fees. So, I would quarrel with him on that.  Let me end by saying, there is on old poem:     While I was walking up the stair, I met a man who wasn't            there.     I saw that man again today.     I wish that man would go away.  The man that many of the people on this floor would wish to go away is a $50 billion tax credit. That is the underlying issue, and that is the important part of this debate.                           Amendment No. 1126  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). The time of the Senator from Illinois has expired. The question is on agreeing to the Wellstone amendment.
