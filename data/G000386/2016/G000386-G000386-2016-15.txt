 He is right so many times; I am sorry that we disagree on this issue. I don't believe the Senator will make me wrong on that point, but I do want to respect his right. He is such a good legislator.  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 649, H.R. 5963. I further ask that the bill be considered read a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.
