 President, today I am introducing a resolution to designate the visitors center at the Channel Islands National Park, California, as the ``Robert J. Lagomarsino Visitors Center.'' I am pleased to say Congressman Elton Gallegly is introducing the measure in the House of Representatives.  The legislation is identical to S.J. Res. 152 and H.J. Res. 67 which we sponsored in the 103d Congress. The House of Representatives passed the measure in 1993 as part of H.R. 3252, the West Virginia Conservation Act. The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee also approved the measure last year, but the full Senate was unable to act before the 103d Congress adjourned.  As some of my colleagues will remember, Robert Lagomarsino served in the House of Representatives for 18 years, from 1974 to 1992, representing the nineteenth district of California which then included Santa Barbara County and part of Ventura County. A member of the House Interior and Insular Affairs Committee and the Subcommittee on National Parks and Public Lands, Bob Lagomarsino was active on a wide range of natural resource issues, including the Alaska National Interest Lands Act, the Strip Mine Control Act, the California Wilderness Act, the Sespe Condor Rivers and Range Act, and hundreds of other bills.  But perhaps Bob Lagomarsino is most closely associated with protection of the Santa Barbara Channel and the establishment of the Channel Islands National Park. Even before his election to the House of Representatives, Bob Lagomarsino worked to protect the fragile Channel Islands and their remarkable scenery and wildlife. As a Member of the California State Senate, Bob Lagomarsino authored the bill creating a state sanctuary around the Channel Islands. As a Member of the House, Bob Lagomarsino sponsored the legislation which expanded the existing Channel Islands National Monument and redesignated the area as a National Park. He then worked hard to secure the funding necessary to complete the park. Additionally, as a Member of the House, he fought to protect the Channel Islands National Park from potential oil spills, successfully persuading oil companies not to ship Alaskan oil through the Santa Barbara Channel and opposing new federal oil leases in the area.  Given Bob Lagomarsino's long association with protection of the Channel Islands, I believe it is most fitting for us to designate the visitors center at the Channel Islands National Park as the ``Robert J. Lagomarsino Visitors Center''. I hope my colleagues in the 104th Congress will join me in recognizing the contributions of this distinguished Californian and enact this measure promptly.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the joint resolution be printed at this point in the Record.  There being no objection, the joint resolution was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                              S.J. Res. 10       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the      United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION.       The visitors center at the Channel Islands National Park,      California, is designated as the ``Robert J. Lagomarsino      Visitors Center''.     SEC. 2. LEGAL REFERENCE.       Any reference in any law, regulation, document, record,      map, or other paper of the United States to the visitors      center referred to in section 1 is deemed to be a reference      to the ``Robert J. Lagomarsino Visitors Center.''                               ____________________
