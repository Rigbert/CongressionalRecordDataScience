Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Berrien Community Foundation's 60th anniversary of providing invaluable financial support to southwest Michigan.  It is with great pleasure that I congratulate the Berrien Community Foundation after six decades of impeccable service to our community. Founded in 1952 by William Vawter and many conscientious business men and women, the Foundation has, been committed to finding innovative ways to invest charitable dollars to help residents of Berrien County. From grants to scholarships, the Berrien County Community Foundation has been working to educate our young people and prepare them to enter the workforce. Without that assistance, many students would not have the academic prospects they do today.  The Berrien Community Foundation represents the very best our district has to offer. Philanthropic individuals who desire to help deserving individuals reach their goals and meet their dreams are able to do so in a financially responsible way by collaborating with the Foundation. I have been very impressed by the Foundation's creative approach to making dollars go far to help individuals who just need a little help in moving forward with their aspirations. I continue to marvel at their dedication and good will and hope their work continues for many years to come.  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to again recognize the achievements and irreplaceable contributions the Foundation has provided to my district and look forward to their continuing efforts to make Berrien County a better place to live and work.                          ____________________
