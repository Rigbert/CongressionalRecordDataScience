Speaker, it is with the greatest pleasure that I pay tribute to an exceptionally dedicated, compassionate, and distinguished member of Indiana's First Congressional District, Mr. Ivory Brown, of Gary, Indiana. After teaching and coaching in the Gary Public School System for 41 years, Coach Ivory ``Ike'' Brown will retire on June 12, 1999. Upon completion of his last day, Mr. Brown will be honored at the Genesis Convention Center in Gary, Indiana, with a final, formal salute from his friends and colleagues for his service, effort, and dedication.  In 1954 Coach Brown graduated from Roosevelt High School in Gary, Indiana, and enrolled as an undergraduate at Wiley College. He began his graduate work at Indiana University, where he earned his Master's degree. Mr. Brown continued his education at Texas Southern University where he took advance courses.  An educator and coach for more than four decades in the Gary Community School Corporation, Ivory Brown's accomplishments in the classroom and on the court are shining examples of the pride and dedication he exhibited in his work. Mr. Brown began his teaching career with the Gary Community School Corporation in 1958 where he served as an elementary, middle, and high school teacher until 1968. From 1969-1972, he was a driver education specialist and in 1972 until his retirement, he served as a physical education instructor and head basketball coach at West Side High School.  From the beginning of his coaching career, Ivory Brown has served as an inspiration to thousands of students, fans, and players at West Side High School and throughout Northwest Indiana. Through his tireless efforts, he has assisted more than one hundred fifty high school athletes in their pursuit of higher education by helping them obtain college scholarships in basketball and track.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in commending Ivory ``Ike'' Brown for his lifetime of dedication, service, and leadership to the students and faculty of the Gary Community School Corporation, as well as the people of Northwest Indiana. Coach Brown's efforts as an educator and a basketball coach blended together to help kids make the most of their potential and earn their success in the world. Northwest Indiana's community has certainly been rewarded by the true service and uncompromising dedication displayed by Mr. Ivory Brown.                          ____________________
