Absolutely not. Thank you for the question.  Let me point out that every bill we have brought--the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban, the Born Alive Act, every single piece of legislation that would seek to protect the lives of unborn children--has a specific clause that women are held harmless; that there could be no prosecutions against them.
