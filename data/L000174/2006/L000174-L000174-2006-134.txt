President, this afternoon I would like to take a moment to mark the passing of a great American--Judge James DeAnda. Judge DeAnda died of cancer on September 7, 2006, at the age of 81. He was appointed to the Federal bench by President Jimmy Carter in 1979 and served as judge on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas until his retirement in 1992. Before his distinguished tenure as a Federal trial judge, James DeAnda was a tireless civil rights advocate with what has become known as a ``voracious appetite for justice.''  Born in Houston, TX, James DeAnda was the son of Mexican immigrants. He attended Texas A&M University and served in the U.S. Marines during World War II before graduating from the University of Texas Law School in 1950, when there were only a handful of Hispanic law students. James DeAnda returned to Houston after graduation, but he had difficulty finding work because White law firms refused to hire a Hispanic lawyer. Not one to be discouraged, James DeAnda joined another Hispanic lawyer to form a legal practice dedicated to representing Hispanic Americans.  In one of his earliest cases, James DeAnda was a member of the four-person legal team behind Hernandez v. Texas, 1954, the first case tried by Mexican American attorneys before the U.S. Supreme Court. In Hernandez, the Supreme Court overturned the murder conviction of a Hispanic man by an all-White jury and for the first time gave Hispanics status as a distinct legal classification deserving of special protection under the Constitution. This case represented a watershed moment in our civil rights history because it opened the door to voting rights, education, and employment challenges by Hispanic Americans. James DeAnda himself used this newly attained classification to fight the segregation of Hispanic children within public schools. He was involved in a number of cases including Cisneros v. Corpus Christi Independent School District, 1970, in which the Supreme Court extended for the first time Brown v. the Board of Education to Hispanics.  In 1968, James DeAnda helped found the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, MALDEF. As one of our Nation's leading Latino advocacy organizations, MALDEF played a crucial role in Judiciary Committee hearings on reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act this year. Several MALDEF leaders testified before the Senate and House committees about the continued importance of the Voting Rights Act in ensuring equal access and fair representation for minority voters. MALDEF conducted extensive studies showing the unavailability of translated voting materials and language assistance to Spanish-speaking voters, despite the legal requirement that they be provided and clearly demonstrated the need for reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act.  Judge James DeAnda inspired generations of civil rights advocates. The continuing work of the organization he helped to found, MALDEF, serves as an enduring legacy to this great American. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family.                          ____________________
