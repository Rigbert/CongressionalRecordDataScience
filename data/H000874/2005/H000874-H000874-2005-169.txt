Speaker, reclaiming my time, we have been talking about budget reconciliation now for a number of weeks and the possibility of a budget amendment bill coming to the floor. Over the last 2 weeks that has not come. But, as you know, committees are marking to a figure substantially above the current budget resolution which was adopted by the House and the Senate. Can you tell me whether or not we are going to have a budget amendment bill on the floor either next week or the week after, and whether or not we will have a reconciliation tax bill on the floor in the near future?
