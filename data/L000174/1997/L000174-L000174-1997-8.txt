President, I am delighted that the Senate unanimously confirmed Rodney W. Sippel to serve asa U.S. District Court Judge for the Eastern and Western Districts of Missouri.  Rodney Sippel is a uniquely well-qualified nominee, with a wealth of experience in the practice of law and in public service. He has years of litigation experience at the law firm of Husch & Eppenberger in St. Louis, MO. He is also a dedicated public servant, having served in the office of our former colleague, Senator Thomas Eagleton, and as an administrative assistant to the House Democratic leader, Richard Gephardt.  The American Bar Association found Mr. Sippel to be qualified for this appointment and his nomination enjoys the support of both Senators from Missouri.  The President nominated Rodney Sippel on May 15, 1997. After several months of inaction, the Judiciary Committee finally held a hearing on his nomination on October 28 and the committee favorably and unanimously reported his nomination to the full Senate on November 6.  I congratulate Rodney Sippel and his family on his confirmation. I look forward to his service as a U.S. district court judge.  I would like to note that the nomination process experienced by Rodney Sippel is a common one in this 105th Congress. It is an experience of unnecessary delay. After his nomination languished for months in the Judiciary Committee, the majority finally focused on Rodney Sippel and he was unanimously confirmed. I am not sure why it took so long for the majority to confirm this well-qualified nominee, but I am glad that they finally realized that he will be an outstanding Federal judge.                          ____________________
