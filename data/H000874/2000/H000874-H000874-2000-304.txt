 I want to yield to my very good friend, someone for whom I have a great deal of respect and affection, who has spent his time as a Member, he has been with this institution for a long period of time. I guess he is now in his third decade of work in this institution but a relatively new Member, succeeding his mentor and a great Member of this body, Bob Michel, but who has done as much as any Member in this body to try to bring us together collegially irrespective of party or faction or ideology, and that is a service that this institution needs. I am pleased to yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LaHood).  Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I am thankful for this hour that has been set aside by the gentleman from Maryland to sort of commemorate and share a little bit about the trip that some of us took, much of which has been talked about already in such great detail as the gentleman from Maryland has done and then the gentleman from Georgia and also the gentleman from New York.  I want to add my thanks to Doug Tanner for the work that he does with the Faith & Politics, to the gentleman from Maryland for this hour and really to say that normally these hours are set aside by Members to talk about issues that are near and dear to their heart and in particular in some cases that they feel very strongly about, and so for us to take this hour and talk about an opportunity that all of us had to share an experience in Selma, Alabama, to share the experience in Birmingham, to share the experience in Montgomery, to share the experience of walking across the Edmund Pettus Bridge is an opportunity for us to say to the American people that we do come here to make laws, to pass bills, but we also come here from districts where we return to demonstrate leadership, and not always in the bills that we pass but more on the other things that we do.  Part of what some of us have done was to travel to the Deep South and toobserve in a very surreal fashion because we were there with the gentleman from Georgia and many of his friends and compatriots and colleagues that were there 35 years ago. And this opportunity was offered to many but only a few of us went. And so for some of us to be able to experience, the second year for me, I went last year, my wife and I went again this year, it was different. It was different this year because of the huge mass of people that were there, in large part I think because the President was there which again highlights the importance of the event and highlights the importance of what took place and highlights the importance of dialogue and race relations and faith and politics coming together.  But it is important for us I think to go back to our districts and to share with our constituents and to meet with leaders in our districts and talk to them about the importance of dialogue, about the importance of race relations, about some things that have happened that we call progress but also talk about many things that we need to do to make further progress. I certainly intend to do that. I am hoping to invite the gentleman from Georgia to my hometown of Peoria, Illinois, to have him have a dialogue and to help conduct a dialogue and to be a part of a group of leaders in my community that can talk about race relations and the progress we have made but the long drive that we have ahead of us.  Finally, let me say that we have 435 in this House. Each one brings a little different background, a little different dimension, a little different experience, but there is only one among us who has the kind of background and influence and standing in the civil rights movement, in the voting rights movement, in the race relations movement, in the faith and politics movement and that is the gentleman from Georgia. He is one unto his own when it comes to voting rights, race relations, civil rights, because of what he has done, because of what he has experienced and that he did not come here forgetting it, he came here to say to people, follow me, let me show you what we have been through and what we need to do in the future.  So for the 434 of us who know the gentleman from Georgia and for the few of us who know him as a friend, as a brother, as somebody who is a leader, a power of one, I think if we do not take anything else away from our experience in the House, it will be the fact that we were a part of the experience of the gentleman from Georgia, and hopefully we will be a part of an experience of doing more and carrying on what the gentleman from Georgia has really begun earlier on in his life.                              {time}  2130  John, thank you for being a part of this wonderful institution and doing more than just coming here and passing bills and giving speeches but setting an example and saying to us, come with me and share my experience and then go back into your communities and provide the leadership. Without your leadership, without what you have done, we would not be doing what we are doing, and so we are grateful to you for being more than just a Congressman from Atlanta, Georgia, but for being a leader and continuing to be a leader.  So I say thank you to you, and we look forward to continuing to work with you hand in hand, shoulder to shoulder, to improve race relations in this country and we do have much work ahead of us.  I thank the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer) for devoting this hour to our experience and for articulating so well what we were able to experience in Selma and Birmingham and Montgomery. We look forward to working with all of the Members to carry on what we need to do here and back in our districts.
