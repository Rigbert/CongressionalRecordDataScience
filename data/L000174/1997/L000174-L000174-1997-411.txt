President, I come to the Senate floor to wish Arnie Aronson a happy 86th birthday and to commend him on his many achievements.  Arnie has been working for civil rights for over 50 years. He began at a time when help wanted ads openly specified ``Gentile only'' or ``Irish need not apply.'' In the early 1940's he organized a coalition of religious, ethnic, civil rights, social welfare, and labor organizations into the Chicago Council Against Religious and Racial Discrimination. By 1950 he was working with Roy Wilkins and many others to organize support for President Truman's proposed civil rights effort and engineered the combination of national organizations that created the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights.  He and the leadership Conference were instrumental in the enactment of the first extensive Federal civil rights laws since Reconstruction, the landmark 1964 Civil Rights Act, the fundamental Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the pivotal Fair Housing Act of 1968. They have been critical to our civil rights efforts at every turn every since.  The statement of purpose he drafted for the Leadership Conference says a great deal about this extraordinary man and his dedication to the rights of all:       We are committed to an integrated, democratic, plural      society in which every individual is accorded equal rights,      equal opportunities and equal justice and in which every      group is accorded an equal opportunity to enter fully into      the general life of the society with mutual acceptance and      regard for difference.  Arnie went on to help organize clergy, churches, and synagogues. He was a founding member of the National Urban Coalition and a charter member of Common Cause. In the last 10 years, while well in his 70's, he assumed the presidency of the Leadership Conference Education Fund and helped invigorate its educational and public service activities.  While he gave leadership and inspiration to the country he never forgot his family. I know the influence he had on his niece and nephew, Jenette and Si Kahn.  Their lives were changed as were ours. I wish him a happy birthday.                          ____________________
