 President, I rise today to pay tribute to the faculty, staff, and students at Lindsey Wilson College in Columbia, Kentucky.  First, I extend sincere thanks for the graciousness and hospitality shown during my visit to Lindsey Wilson College for the May 13, 2000 Commencement. It was an honor to address the faculty and graduating students at such a fine Kentucky institution, and I sincerely appreciate the opportunity.  Located on a southcentral Kentucky hilltop, Lindsey Wilson College is a four-year liberal arts college affiliated with the Kentucky Conference of the United Methodist Church. It began in 1903, as a training school for Vanderbilt University, then became a two-year college in 1923, and started offering a four-year degree program in 1986. Lindsey Wilson's diverse student body is comprised of individuals from 89 Kentucky counties, 23 states, and 26 foreign countries.  Since its four-year degree program began, enrollment has grown a whopping 160 percent and they have expanded to offer 16 undergraduate degree programs and two master's programs. Over the last 13 years, several new buildings have been constructed, the budget has more than doubled, assets now total $49 million, and Lindsey Wilson College's endowment is valued at more than $28 million. Congratulations on these tremendous accomplishments.  I would like to recognize President William T. Luckey and Chancellor John B. Begley. Students, faculty, and staff at Lindsey Wilson are all fortunate to have such committed individuals serving the mission of the school and facilitating its growth.  Another name that is important to Lindsey Wilson is Ruby McKinney Roach. Ms. Roach grew up in Adair County, Kentucky, and is a proud Lindsey Wilson College Alumnus of 1954. From Lindsey Wilson, she went to Berea College and earned a Bachelor of Arts in home economics and a Master of Education at Western Kentucky University. After a brief time teaching in Barren County, Ms. Roach went home to Adair County and served as a teacher and guidance counselor for 30 years.  According to the many people touched by her kindness and generosity, Ruby Roach became deeply involved in the lives of her students. As a home economics teacher, she had the opportunity to share her skills and knowledge with thousands of students over the years. As a guidance counselor, she had the unique experience of talking with students both about their educational and personal goals, and helped them develop a plan to accomplish those goals.  Ms. Roach has been an active member of the educational community outside her school as well, having held positions in the Kentucky Association of School Administrators, the Kentucky Counselors Association, the National Education Association, and Iota chapter of The Delta Kappa Gamma Society International, the honorary society of professional women educators.  Ruby Roach also served on numerous civic boards and organizations in the Adair community. She is a former member of the Columbia Women's Club and is an active member of Beulah Chapel. Ruby Roach has made her alma mater proud, and I commend her for what she has contributed to the College, the surrounding community, and to Kentucky.  In the same way, Lindsey Wilson College is an institution of which the Commonwealth of Kentucky can be proud. On behalf of myself and my colleagues in the Senate, congratulations Lindsey Wilson College, on your many achievements, and best wishes for continued success.                          ____________________
