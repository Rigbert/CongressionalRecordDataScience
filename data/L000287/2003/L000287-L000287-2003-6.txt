Mr. Chairman, in good conscience I cannot and will not support President Bush's misled, failed policy.  I did not vote for going to war, I did not vote to put our young people in harm's way, and I will not be a party to financing this war. This administration has been hell bent from day one to have a war with Iraq, and they have stopped at nothing to get it. Their record on Iraq is one of secrecy, deceit, and fear-mongering.  They deceived Members of Congress, the American people, and the community of nations. They told us that Saddam had ties to al Qaeda, that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, that oil from Iraq would pay to rebuild Iraq. I am sick and tired of lies, and I am sick and tired of war and killing and hatred and violence.  People are dying. For what? And while our troops and their families sacrifice, corporate America is getting rich. These war profiteers are makingmoney off the blood and toil of our soldiers and the people of Iraq. Halliburton. Bechtel Jacobs.  It is time to stop the madness. It is time to hold President Bush accountable for his words and his deeds. I cannot and will not be a party to this war. I will not vote for $87 billion for more violence, for more killing, for more war.
