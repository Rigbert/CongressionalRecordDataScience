 President, last week, President Clinton opened a new front in America's war on drugs with his appointment of Gen. Barry McCaffrey as the Nation's new drug czar. In doing so, President Clinton has once again demonstrated his commitment to put the full weight of his office and the American Government behind efforts to stem the tide of drugs flooding America's streets, and I commend him for that.  The measures my colleagues and I are introducing today are meant as a shot across the bow to the Government of Mexico. This legislation by the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee and myself, a Republican and a Democrat, will hopefully send a strong message that this Congress is prepared to back up the President's efforts in the strongest possible terms if Mexico's actions do not match their words in this war on drugs.  One year ago, the United States provided $20 billion in loan guarantees to Mexico in an unprecedented economic assistance package. That loan guarantee agreement expires next month with the option to extend it for another 6 months.  Today, based on the seriousness of the drug problem, the volume of drugs flowing into the United States, and the ineffectiveness of Mexico's efforts, I am joining with Senator D'Amato in introducing three pieces of legislation, two bills and one sense-of-the-Senate resolution, which, among other things, would link extension of the loan guarantee to Mexico to specific actions that Mexico must take to demonstrate greater cooperation with the United States and international anti-narcotics efforts.  Let me explain for a moment the depth of this problem. The Drug Enforcement Administration estimates that 60 to 70 percent of all the illegal drugs that enter the United States are smuggled through Mexico; 75 percent of the cocaine and 60 to 80 percent of all foreign-grown marijuana in the United States originates in Mexico.  DEA testified that it has become commonplace to have 727 cargo-style jets each carrying 10 to 20 tons of cocaine at a time fly into Mexico and return to Colombia with $20 to $30 million of United States currency aboard. Colombian drug cartels are using Mexico as a safe haven to store as much as 70 to 100 tons of cocaine to be smuggled into the United States.  The United States Customs officials estimate that almost 70 percent of those arrested for drug smuggling at border stations in the United States are Mexican nationals.  Mexican drug cartels have taken over the methamphetamine drug trade. This is a very dangerous drug, also known as crank or speed. The DEA estimates that 90 percent of the precursor chemical, ephedrine, used to make methamphetamine is smuggled into the United States from Mexico, much of it originating from China.  Methamphetamine is an exploding problem in the United States, and particularly in California. The California Bureau of Narcotics Enforcement figures show that from 1991 to 1994 seizures jumped 518 percent in just these 3 years.  In 10 years, from 1983 to 1993, methamphetamine abuse has skyrocketed in some California counties by more than 1,000 percent. Hospital emergency rooms admissions from amphetamine abuse have jumped by 366 percent.  California is infested with literally hundreds of clandestine and highly mobile methamphetamine labs. State drug officials indicate that these labs are most often run by Mexican nationals who are here illegally.  Mexico's efforts to date are simply not good enough. The recent arrest of Juan Garcia Abrego is a step in the right direction, but overall Mexico's efforts have simply not been enough.  The United States currently has 165 extradition requests pending with Mexico, 56 of those involving Mexican nationals. The United States has had an extradition treaty with Mexico since 1978, yet Mexico has not allowed the extradition of a single Mexican national to the United States for prosecution as any close ally would.  Juan Garcia Abrego was not extradited. He was deported as a U.S. citizen. He held dual citizenship.  The drug cartels still operate in Mexico with impunity. Leaders of two of the most powerful Mexican drug cartels, Amado Carillo-Fuentes and the Arellano-Felix brothers, have outstanding United States warrants for drug trafficking. They have been seen in public repeatedly with no fear of arrest, and there apparently has been no serious effort to apprehend them.  Money laundering. Mexico has become a haven for money laundering. Under Mexican law, money laundering is not a crime. No reporting requirements for large cash transactions exist. Jose Antonio Ramirez, director of Mexico's Association of Exchange Houses, has said it is common for cartel operatives to show up at unregulated money centers with literally suitcases stuffed with cash. The centers then write money orders or wire the funds to Colombia.  I understand that the Mexican Congress has asked the National Banking Commission to examine ways of preventing money laundering, but whether any concrete changes will result remains to be seen.  Let me give you some examples of government corruption:  Colombian jets unloading tons of cocaine in remote desert areas with the possible cooperation of Mexican Federal Police.  Reports that in a single weekend last November, 20 tons of cocaine destined for the United States were flown into Mexico in two large cargo plane shipments.  And the investigation involving connections between the drug cartels, Swiss bank accounts, and the brother of former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari only serves to reinforce the belief that drug-influenced corruption may reach the highest levels of Government.  Based on Mexico's efforts to date, Senator D'Amato and I believe that extraordinary measures are required. The legislation coauthored by Senator D'Amato and myself would do the following:  One, link extension of the loan guarantee to Mexico with cooperation in antidrug efforts. The United States-Mexico loan guarantee agreement expires next month. But the parties share an option to extend the agreement for an additional 6 months. And most likely they will be renewed after that.  This bill would prohibit the extension of the repayment terms for any of the currently outstanding loans to Mexico. It would prohibit the use of any of the remaining loan guarantees not obligated unless certain conditions with respect to antidrug efforts are met.  Second, we are introducing a sense-of-the-Senate resolution that Mexico should not be certified under the Foreign Assistance Act as fully cooperating with the United States and international antinarcotics efforts. Failure to certify as cooperating with these efforts would jeopardize Mexico's eligibility to receive foreign aid.  Sanctions for failure to be certified are mandatory, requiring that the United States withhold 50 percent of all foreign aid, with the exception of humanitarian and drug enforcement funds.  The third bill prohibits the approval of applications from Mexican trucking companies applying for cross-border permits under NAFTA until the Secretary of Transportation can certify that the trucks meet United States safety standards, the President certifies Mexico is taking sufficient steps to combat international narcotics trafficking, and the Congress approves the applications via a joint resolution.  These are strong steps, but I truly believe that this problem is so serious that strong steps are required.  Evidence that would show Mexico's commitment to address these issues would include action such as the following:  One, compliance with all outstanding requests for extradition by the United States.  Two, enactment and implementation of effective money laundering laws.  Three, action to prevent Mexico's drug profiteers from taking advantage of plans to privatize formerly public assets such as banks.  Four, enactment of effective laws to inspect and license trucks, cars, and aircraft as well as their owners and operators to assist drug crime enforcement.  Five, enactment of effective laws to curtail the importation and export of major precursor chemicals for methamphetamine production and other narcotic production.  Six, specific action to effect the arrests of Mexican drug cartel leaders and other individuals involved in organized crime.  Seven, adoption of a comprehensive program for drug enforcement and assistance to United States law enforcement to take effective action.  Eight, specific action dedicated to detecting and halting the large-scale air transportation of narcotics.  Nine, specific action to prosecute graft and corruption among civilian, government, and military officials that assist drug production and smuggling.  And, finally, passage of asset forfeiture laws which enable the confiscation of property derived through narcotics trafficking or fraudulent use of the loan guarantee funds.  Without tangible evidence that Mexico is willing to work toward these goals, I am prepared to support the strong steps I have outlined.  Mr. President, earlier Senator D'Amato and I, at a press conference, indicated our joint action to press forward with these bills. Mr. D'Amato indicated that his Banking Committee would be holding hearings on these bills in March. We earnestly and sincerely invite other Members on both sides of the aisle to cosponsor this legislation.  Mr. President, I have seen firsthand a major tunnel under the Mexican border that goes from a warehouse in Mexico, to a warehouse on the California side, that was air-conditioned and electrified to facilitate the smuggling of drugs from one country to another.  Mr. President, not too long ago in Rialto, CA, San Bernardino county, an arrest was made with the seizure of 4.5 tons--4.5 tons of cocaine. That amount of cocaine did not come across the border in backpacks.  Mr. President, I have been to the border. I have seen trucks going back and forth with very little or no inspection in the line-release program. For the past year, I have advocated a tightening of that program.  Now, under NAFTA, an even greater number of trucks would be able to cross the border with no inspection. What is the guarantee, when we know there is up to 100 tons of cocaine stored on the other side of the border awaiting transfer across this border, that it will not come in these trucks?  In every city, whether it is New York City, whether it is Los Angeles, or whether it is San Francisco, we have all seen people dying in the streets from drugs and drug deals gone awry. We have all seen the evolution of gangs around the trafficking of narcotics. We have all seen the street prices of cocaine drop and the problem get worse. We have seen the major spread of methamphetamine labs throughout the largest State in the Union, California.  The time has come to say, Enough is enough. To the Government of Mexico, close ally of the United States, we say ``This is $20 billion in loan guarantees plus other guarantees from the Monetary Fund--you must work hand in hand with us.'' We must stop the 727 cargo jets from landing on Mexican soil, from offloading drugs which then disappear before onloading United States currency for transport back to Colombia.  We must see that cartel leaders are extradited, that American extradition requests are honored, and that there are effective laws on the books to preclude money laundering in Mexico. In general, we must see that there is vigorous enforcement in Mexico to abate and stop the large flow of chemicals, cocaine and other contraband substances into the United States.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following letters be printed in the Record: One letter signed by Senator D'Amato and myself, dated January 26, to the Secretary of State urging denial of certification; a letter sent by myself on December 6 to Ambassador Kantor pointing out problems in cargo trucks coming from Mexico; another letter to Ambassador Kantor, Secretary of State Christopher, Secretary of Treasury Rubin, and Attorney General Reno addressing continuing problems with drug enforcement that are presented by Mexico.  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                                 Washington, DC, January 26, 1996.     Hon. Warren M. Christopher,     Secretary, Department of State, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Secretary: We are writing to urge you to advise      the President to deny certification that Mexico has taken      sufficient actions to combat international narcotics      trafficking when he reports to Congress on the anti-narcotics      efforts of major drug producing and drug-transit countries on      March 1, 1996.       As you know, Mexico is one of the most significant drug      producing and drug transit countries in the world, and the      bulk of the drugs moving through Mexico end up in the United      States, particularly in the state of California. The Drug      Enforcement Agency estimates that at least 75 percent of all      cocaine available in the United States originates in Mexico.      Further estimates are that 70 to 80 percent of all foreign-     grown marijuana in the United States originates in Mexico. It      is well known that Colombian drug cartels are using Mexico as      a base from which to transport narcotics into the United      States. We have been told that Colombian cartels may store as      much as 70 to 100 tons of cocaine in Mexico at any one time      to await smuggling into the United States.       These problems are bad enough, but they are made worse by      the Mexican government's failure to take serious actions to      address them. There has not been enough of a serious effort      to break up the drug cartels that operate with virtual      impunity in Mexico, or to arrest and extradite the drug lords      who run them. The recent arrest and deportation of Juan      Garcia Abrego is a positive development, but it contrasts      sharply with the actions of the Mexican authorities in many      other cases. To cite just two examples, the leaders of two of      the most powerful cartels in Mexico--Amado Carillo-Fuentes of      the Chihuahua Cartel, and the Arellano-Felix brothers of the      Tijuana Cartel--are reported to be regularly seen in public      with no fear of arrest.       In addition, Mexico has become a haven for laundering drug      money, which is one of the most important aspects of the      cartels' operations. Mexican laws regarding money laundering      are inadequate, and banks and money exchange houses in Mexico      do not have the same reporting requirements for large      transactions as they do in the United States. Thousands of      exchange houses are openly flouting what little oversight the      Mexican government conducts, and millions of dollars are      flowing to Colombia via money orders and wire transfers.       Finally, drug-influenced corruption continues unabated      within Mexican law enforcement agencies and the government      itself. One former cartel leader told U.S. prosecutors that      up to $50 million a month is used to bribe corrupt Mexican      officials to ignore, or even facilitate, drug-trafficking      activities. Drug money has clearly corrupted officials at      every level of Mexico's government and law enforcement      community, and--the investigations of the brother of former      President Carlos Salinas de Gortari notwithstanding--     President Zedillo's government is not taking sufficient      action to root out this corruption.       In light of these facts, we are sure you will agree that      Mexico is not deserving of certification as cooperating with      U.S. and international narcotics efforts when the President      issues his report pursuant to section 409A of the Foreign      Assistance Act. Furthermore, we do not believe that any vital      national interest warrants granting Mexico a waiver from      decertification. The illegal drugs that flow into the United      States from Mexico are tearing at our very culture, and as      such they themselves represent a fundamental threat to our      vital national interests. In contrast, the vital national      interests of the United States do not require us to provide      assistance to Mexico or to vote for multilateral development      bank assistance to Mexico, the two areas that would be      affected by Mexico's failure to be certified.       Thank you for your consideration of this extremely      important matter. We look forward to your early reply.           Sincerely,     Dianne Feinstein,       U.S. Senator.     Alfonse D'Amato,       U.S. Senator.                                                                    ____                                                  U.S. Senate,                                 Washington, DC, December 6, 1996.     Hon. Michael Kantor,     Ambassador, Washington, DC.       Dear Ambassador Kantor: I am writing to express my strong      opposition to the planned December 17 implementation of the      proposal to dramatically increase the number cargo trucks      from Mexico with direct access to delivery points in the      United States, under the North American Free Trade Agreement.      This opposition is based on two very serious concerns: first,      that inadequate provision has been made to ensure that this      will not result in increased drug smuggling across the      southwest border; and, second, that this will adverse impact      the safety of California's highways.       It is my understanding that, beginning on December 17,      under NAFTA, cargo trucks crossing the border from Mexico      will no longer be restricted to delivery points within a      limited commercial zone along the U.S.-Mexico border, but      will be permitted to ship freight from origination points in      Mexico directly to delivery points throughout California,      Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. Estimates are that broader      access will increase land shipments across the U.S.-Mexico      border to approximately 6 million truckloads annually by the      year 2001.                             Drug Smuggling       My concerns with respect to drug smuggling are two fold.      First, that our infrastructure to interdict drugs may not be      able to keep pace with our efforts to facilitate increased      trade and commerce across our land borders. And second, as      trade and commerce barriers are reduced between Mexico and      the United States, our drug abatement efforts will become      increasingly dependent upon the enforcement efforts of our      Mexican counterparts.       In a memorandum sent to me by Treasury Secretary Rubin last      March, his office noted that the number of arriving trucks      from Mexico increased last year at a faster rate than the      rate of truck inspections, resulting in a decrease in the      percentage of trucks being examined for drugs. Although he      declined to assume that the increasing cargo volume      automatically means an increase in contraband, he recognized      that the increase in cargo volume provides a window of      opportunity for smugglers.       In fact, in spite of (or perhaps because of) the reported      success of a number of drug interdiction programs responding      to changes in drug trafficking patterns, including the      Customs Air Program and Border Patrol's Operation Hold the      Line, Secretary Rubin noted that the next logical step for      smugglers is to try to exploit the huge cargo volume crossing      the border each day.       I concur with the assessment that drug smugglers will take      advantge of any relaxation of travel barriers between the      U.S. and Mexico, and fear that this greater access for      Mexican carriers under NAFTA will exacerbate what is already      a serious problem with drug interdiction.       Specifically, my questions regarding implementation are:      How will Customs procedures change to accommodate the      increase in truck volume? How will this change impact the      Line Release Program? Will companies go through any form of      application process or background check, or will any truck      from any company in Mexico be given unlimited access to U.S.      delivery points in these border states? What is the process      for licensing individual drivers from the companies shipping      cargo? Will the individual drivers undergo background checks?       According to officials from the Department of Justice,      cocaine smuggled across the California border with Mexico      accounts for at least 70 percent of the drug sent over the      entire Southwest border, so California has an enormous      interest in ensuring that drug interdiction efforts remain a      paramount concern as NAFTA is implemented.       Another emerging drug threat in the United States,      particularly in California, is the explosive increase in      methamphetamine production and trafficking. California has      become the production capitol of the nation for this      dangerous drug, and the major source of methamphetamine and      the precursor chemicals to produce this drug are the Mexican      drug cartels.       Mexican traffickers have established international      connections for supplies of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine key      precurson chemicals for methamphetamine which are controlled      in the United States but not in Mexico. Shipments of these      and other precursor chemicals are sent to Mexico from around      the world and then smuggled into the United States to      literally hundreds of clandestine laboratories in California      for production.       Methamphetamine is fast becoming the crack epidemic of the      1990s, and law enforcement is already unable to keep up with      the problem. A greater volume of uninspected trucks and      relaxed trade barriers can only make this problem worse.       Secondly, I am also worried about increasing our reliance      on Mexico to stop the probable increased flow of drugs across      our border. As I have spelled out in a separate letter to      you, I am gravely concerned about the adequacy of Mexican      efforts to restrict drug trafficking and the alarming level      of drug-influenced corruption within Mexican law enforcement      agencies and the government itself. This most certainly      impacts our efforts at drug abatement in the United States.      The news report this last week of a passenger plane loaded      with cocaine landing in Baja California Sur with the possible      cooperation of Mexican Federal Police is a shocking reminder      that our efforts to stop the flood of drugs on American      streets are only as strong as our weakest link.       I respect the efforts the Clinton Administration has made      to reduce the flow of drugs into the United States and I know      you share my concerns about maintaining the integrity of our      drug interdiction efforts. I support increased trade and      commerce with Mexico, but only to the extent that efforts to      curtail the epidemic of drug use in our own country are not      diminished, and to the extent that Mexico is cooperating      fully with our efforts.                             highway safety       I also want to express my strong concern about the safety      implications of allowing large trucks from Mexico access to      California's roads.                          hazardous materials       The Attorney General of Texas, Dan Morales--who supports      NAFTA--reports that more than a fourth of the approximately      5,000 Mexican trucks which cross into Texas every day carry:      corrosives; chemicals; explosives; jet fuel; and pesticides.            This week's issue of Time magazine reports that in the past      few months, several Mexican trucks in the U.S. have exploded      or leaked toxins.       With such dangerous materials, and evidence of a poor      record of truck safety in the United States, I fear that this      problem will escalate dramatically with the expansion of      Mexican truck traffic.                                 brakes       Another major area of concern is Mexico's request that the      Administration ease its requirements on front brakes.      According to the California Highway Patrol, in 1994 there      were 45 accidents involving large trucks for which faulty      brakes were found to be the cause. In these accidents, 77      people were injured and there was one fatality. There has      been a steady decline over the past ten years of accidents      involving large trucks, and I have grave concerns that the      increase in Mexican trucks on California's freeways and roads      will increase this number.                             drivers hours       As you know, truckers in the United States are limited to      ten hours of driving time. In Mexico, however, there is no      limit to the number of hours a driver may be behind the      wheel. Again, according to the California Highway Patrol,      there were 108 accidents in California involving a large      truck where the driver simply fell asleep. These accidents      were responsible for killing six and injuring 148.       I am very concerned about the adequacy of truck safety      inspection at the border. I fear that U.S. Customs Service      agents, who already have their hands full inspecting vehicles      for drugs and trade treaty compliance features, are simply      not going to have the time or technical expertise to conduct      thorough safety inspections on trucks coming from Mexico.       On behalf of the people of California, I urge your personal      attention to these issues.       Thank you for your anticipated assistance.           Sincerely,                                                 Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senator.                                                                    ____                                                  U.S. Senate,                                 Washington, DC, December 6, 1996.     Hon. Michael Kantor,     Ambassador,     Washington, DC.       Dear Ambassador Kantor: I am writing to request that you,      along with Secretary of State Christopher, Secretary of the      Treasury Rubin, and Attorney General Reno, address a      continuing problem which is vexing our country, and my state      in particular--the grossly inadequate drug enforcement      ``effort'' by Mexico.       Just last week, separate published reports demonstrated the      alarming, dramatic scale of this problem.       The Los Angeles Times reported on the continuing      investigation of Raul Salinas de Gortari, older brother of      Mexico's former President, Carlos Salinas de Gortari--an      investigation which continues to yield appalling information      about the extent of drug-influenced corruption in Mexico. The      investigation is demonstrating that: The Mexican drug lords      have become partners with the Colombian cartels; these      cartels supply up to three-fourths of the cocaine in the      United States, according to U.S. officials; Raul Salinas de      Gortari was closely associated with the most powerful drug      lord, Juan Garcia Abrego; Raul Salinas de Gortari served as      an intermediary between the drug cartels and Mexico's      political and economic elite; Garcia Abrego and Raul Salinas      de Gortari used their respective fields of influence to      protect each other from law enforcement; Raul Salinas de      Gortari profited handsomely from this relationship, with      Mexican officials estimating that he may have stockpiled up      to $250 million in foreign bank accounts and other      investments; and perhaps worst of all, this web of corruption      and protection may have extended even to Raul's brother,      President Carlos Salinas de Gortari.       This investigation was made public in Mexico last week,      prompting the unprecedented step of a unanimous vote by      members of all parties in Mexico's House of Deputies to      establish a congressional commission to investigate Raul      Salinas de Gortari and the sources of his wealth.       Coupled with other evidence of drug corruption in Mexico,      much of which was laid out at a Senate Foreign Relations      Committee hearing this August, I am afraid that Mexico is in      serious jeopardy of becoming a drug-dominated narco-     democracy.       The New York Times, meanwhile, also reported last week that      an entire passenger jet loaded with tons of cocaine landed in      a dry lake bed in Baja California Sur on Saturday. Local      fishermen saw the cocaine unloaded by 20 men wearing black      Mexican Federal Police uniforms. These men arrived in a      convoy of four-wheel-drive vehicles. After unloading the      plane, they set about trying to destroy it, by dismantling      it, attempting to blow it up with explosive powder, and      finally bulldozing over it with desert sand.       Despite widespread reports of Mexican police involvement      with allowing or even conducting drug smuggling, state police      who arrived on the scene allowed themselves to be talked out      of taking action by the uniformed men--demonstrating that the      state police were either duped, incredibly inattentive and      lacking in vigilance, or corrupt themselves.       It comes as no surprise that investigators have traced the      airplane's serial numbers back to Colombia's Cali cartel. As      for the tons of drugs that were unloaded from the plane, the      newspaper reported that they have not been recovered. I would      appreciate your investigating and reporting to me what      happened to these drugs, and to the plane.       For your convenience, I have attached copies of these      articles. What is especially dismaying is that there is      nothing new about airplanes loaded with multi-million dollar      shipments of cocaine flying from Colombia to Mexico. At a      Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in February, 1995, Drug      Enforcement Administration Director Constantine told me about      727s flying 10 to 20 tons of cocaine at a time into Mexico,      and returning to Colombia with 20 to 30 million dollars of      U.S. currency.       At the Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing in      August, we discussed this again. At that point, Ambassador      Gelbard interjected, ``based on an order from President      Zedillo, he has mobilized the Mexican Air Force to intercept      any such flights that do occur.'' And yet, we see now that      the flights do continue.       Frankly, I am astounded and disgusted that the Mexican      government is unable or unwilling to stop massive cargo      flights, or incidents such as this latest one, involving an      airplane, heavy vehicles, explosives, bulldozers, and police      officers who turn the other way.       It is no secret where these drugs are going: straight into      my State of California. At the February hearing, Director      Constantine confirmed that California has replaced Florida as      the major point of importation of cocaine into America. He      further stated that 75% of the cocaine in the United States      enters through the Southwest border from Mexico.       Mr. Ambassador, I ask that you, together with Secretary of      State Christopher, Secretary of the Treasury Rubin, and      Attorney General Reno, really take a good, hard look at what      specifically can be done to compel Mexico to achieve a higher      level of cooperation and enforcement against drugs.       The United States provides Mexico with a great deal of      assistance--such as the $20 billion loan guarantee earlier      this year. Yet this assistance seems to go to a country that      is utterly ineffective at stopping the infliction of the      scourge of drug trafficking on my state and our country--or,      worse, corruptly facilitates it. If Mexico will not summon      the will to help us in this effort, perhaps it is time for us      to reconsider our assistance to them.       On behalf of the people of California, I urge your personal      attention to this issue.       Thank you for your anticipated assistance.           Sincerely,                                                 Dianne Feinstein,                                                     U.S. Senator.
