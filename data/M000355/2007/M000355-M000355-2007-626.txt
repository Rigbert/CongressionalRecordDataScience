 President, it is my understanding that the authorization of these small business programs expires tomorrow. The bill before us, H.R. 434, was received in the Senate on January 18. I don't understand why the committee has waited until the day before the program expires to act. If we amend this bill and send it back to the House, they will not be able to act before these programs expire.  It is my understanding that if we allow this authorization to lapse, it will result in the dissolution of the SBA's Advisory Committee on Veterans Business Affairs. This committee serves veteran entrepreneurs by formulating, executing, and promoting policies that assist veterans seeking to start and develop small businesses. I cannot imagine why we would want to dissolve the committee designed to assist veterans who want to start their own small businesses.  Accordingly, I ask the Senator to modify the unanimous consent request to omit the Senate amendment and instead pass a bill clean so that it may go directly to the President for his signature.
