HATCH. I can't think of one case. In fact, there has never been a true filibuster conducted. In the cases where they have raised the question of cloture votes, cloture votes are called for one reason or another by majority leaders, but in each of those cases, as I recall, the nominees had an up-and-down vote. I would be happy to go to a cloture vote with our friends on the other side if afterwards they allow an up-and-down vote regardless of what happens on the cloture vote--happy to do it.  They do not seem to be inclined to do that. They want to filibuster the first Hispanic nominee to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, who has a ``unanimously well-qualified'' rating by the American Bar Association, their gold standard, and who has all of these other qualifications that lawyers only dream about. And he has fulfilled the American dream. He is being denied his opportunity to serve by a double standard here that is being applied by my colleagues on the other side.  It is some Members. I know all of them cannot feel that way.
