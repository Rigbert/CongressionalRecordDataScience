Chairman, I appreciate the recognition and rise in strong support of the gentleman's amendment. I certainly appreciate the concerns he has expressed about cleanup nationally, as well as the site illustrated in Utah, and share his concerns that we are not adequately investing in cleaning up contaminated communities where we have a national obligation.  This amendment would make a cut of $9.6 million to the weapons program,but I would point out to my colleagues that while I support the weapons complex and its modernization, this is a very slight change in funding, an account that has a $7.5 billion allocation and sees a $275 million increase for 2013 under the bill. And, therefore, I do think the gentleman has taken a very reasoned approach and strongly support his amendment.  I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Matheson).  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it.
