President, I rise to lend my support for S. 2097, the Launching Our Communities' Access to Local Television, legislation of which I am proud to be an original cosponsor.  Mr. President, this legislation is simply about equity. Should satellite customers in the rural Maine communities of Lovell and Greenville and Fort Fairfield have the right to receive the local broadcasts of stations in Portland, Bangor, and Presque Isle, Maine? Should they have the ability to receive their local news, emergency weather forecasts, information about school closures, and the wrap-up of the local school sports via satellite? My answer is yes, of course, they should.  While Congress authorized the ability of local network stations to broadcast their local signals via satellite by passing the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act last November, current satellite capacity only allows the top 40 to 50 television markets to receive this unique service. Unfortunately, this excludes the Portland, Bangor, and Presque Isle, Maine, markets and the satellite customers within those markets who want to view local programming.  This last year has been a particularly difficult and frustrating one for satellite customers. We took an important step in addressing many of the problems they and local broadcasters have experienced by passing the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act. We are, however, lacking a final component. Providing a rural loan guarantee program that is technologically-neutral, fiscally responsible, and focused on underserved markets will encourage companies to bring important information access to my State's rural communities and lead us to a conclusion of this important issue. I urge my colleagues to pass this important legislation.  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.
