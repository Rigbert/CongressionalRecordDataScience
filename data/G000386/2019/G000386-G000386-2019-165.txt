 President, 24 years ago radical Serb forces committed the worst genocide on European soil since the Holocaust. In and around the hallowed grounds at Srebrenica, over 8,000 Bosnians were murdered out of ethnic and religious hatred.  Iowa, my State, is now home to many Bosnians who bore witnesses to those atrocities. I pray that they and their families find peace, as well as justice. Ethnic and religious hatred must never be tolerated, and we must not forget the victims of this crime.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
