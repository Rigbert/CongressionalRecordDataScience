 President, I rise today to pay tribute to and lament the passing of a man of great faith from my home State, the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Mr. Ernest B. Hillenmeyer, Jr., devoted his life to serving others. He passed away last Thursday at the age of 92.  Ernest, or ``Ernie'' as he was affectionately known by friends and family, was born on a farm in Lexington, KY, on February 26, 1922. Ernie's formative years occurred when our country was trapped in the depths of the Great Depression. It was during this time that he learned the value of a good education, of family and community, and of faith in God. Through good times and bad, Ernie carried these ideals with him for the rest of his life.  Ernie's daughter, Katy Hillenmeyer, has said that ``we'd all have to live to be 200 to accomplish what he did in his 92 years.'' This is hardly an understatement. After graduating from the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, Ernie served his country for 10 years in the U.S. Naval Reserve. In 1985, he was ordained as a deacon and served his parish at St. Patrick Church in Maysville and St. James Church in Brooksville. Ernie was heavily involved in establishing the Meadowview Regional Hospital and the Hospice of Hope, both in Maysville, KY. He also chaired the Hayswood Foundation for 10 years, served as a director of the Maysville-Mason County Area Chamber of Commerce, and was the first lay chair of the board of trustees at Thomas Moore College. Those are only a few of Ernie's many accomplishments from a lifetime of service to others.  Ernie is survived by his wife, Mary Agnes Farrell Hillenmeyer, his sister, Mary Hillenmeyer Fiore, 6 children and 11 grandchildren. Said his cousin, Robert F. Houlihan, Jr., ``He's loved and respected. And he was totally unafraid to die. You can't live a bad life and be unafraid of death.'' Although he may have been unafraid, Ernie will undoubtedly be missed by those who knew and loved him. I ask that my Senate colleagues join me in remembrance of the life of Ernest B. Hillenmeyer, Jr.  Mr. President, Ernie's obituary was recently published in the Ledger Independent. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in full in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:              [From The Ledger Independent, Apr. 3, 2014]               Hillenmeyer Remembered for Life of Service       Maysville.--During his 92 years, Ernest B. Hillenmeyer Jr.      lived by the motto his father instilled during his boyhood on      their Lexington farm: ``Be honest, and be of service to your      community.''       Hillenmeyer embodied that creed through the many decades      and facets of his life, each guided by love of God, family      and his community.       Hillenmeyer, former president of Parker Tobacco Company and      a leader in the Catholic Church and civic affairs, died April      3, 2014, at the age of 92, at Maysville Nursing and      Rehabilitation Center following a long illness.       He raised seven children in Maysville, where he lived for      the past 68 years, and is survived by his wife of more than      52 years, Mary Agnes Farrell Hillenmeyer.       The World War II veteran helped establish Meadowview      Regional Medical Center in Maysville and Hospice of Hope,      which provides end-of-life care and through which, as its      first chaplain, he ministered to patients. In 1985, he was      ordained a deacon in the Roman Catholic Church as part of the      Diocese of Covington's first class of men to enter the      permanent diaconate and served his parish at St. Patrick      Church, Maysville, along with St. James Church in      Brooksville, where he was pastoral associate from 1998 to      2002. Thomas More College in Crestview Hills, where      Hillenmeyer was the first layman to chair the board of      trustees, awarded him an honorary doctorate in May 2013 for      his lifetime of leadership and volunteerism.       ``Deacon Ernie Hillenmeyer was a gentleman and a man of      integrity,'' said Sister Justina Franxman, OSB, his friend      and spiritual director for a number of years. ``He loved God,      his family and the Church. He was committed to his ministry      and saw Jesus in the people to whom he ministered. Ernie      loved life to the full.''       ``Ernie'' Hillenmeyer was born Feb. 26, 1922, in Lexington,      to Earnest B. Hillenmeyer Sr. and Mathilde Scott Hillenmeyer      and grew up on his father's farm. His passion for gardening      and agriculture dates to his youth tending peach and potato      crops with his dad, himself the son and grandson of      nurserymen.       He attended St. Paul's School in Lexington and later      graduated from Campion Jesuit High School in Prairie du      Chien, Wis.       He graduated from the United States Merchant Marine Academy      in Kings Point, N.Y., holding a commission from 1942 to 1952      as an officer in the U.S. Naval Reserve, from which he was      discharged as a lieutenant.       He spent three and a half years during World War II as a      deck officer aboard liberty ships in the Merchant Marine,      sailing with the North Atlantic and Pacific fleets.       During the war, he met fellow Kentuckian Ellen Cochrane      Parker, a Maysville native whom he married in April 1945.       His father-in-law, S. Alex Parker Sr. hired Hillenmeyer      into the family's tobacco business in 1946 and the couple      settled in Maysville, where their four children, Zoe,      Theresa, Ernie and Cece, were born.       Following his first wife's death in 1960, Hillenmeyer      married Mary Agnes Farrell of Ludlow, to whom he was      introduced by his childhood friend, the late Msgr. John F.      Murphy.       Married in October 1961, the couple had three more      children, Ellen, Katy and Paul.       He frequently traveled abroad for business and hosted      international guests in the creek-side house he built in      Huntington Park, one of two contiguous subdivisions he helped      to develop in Aberdeen, Ohio.       Whether sailing houseboats, pitching horseshoes, playing      bridge or crosswords, betting horses at Keeneland or cheering      on the University of Kentucky Wildcats, Hillenmeyer enjoyed      recreating with his family and friends, and delighted in      competition.       In 1987, Hillenmeyer was a representative attending various      Masses when Pope John Paul II visited and met with deacons      for a conference, in Detroit, Mich.       In all his years teaching card games to his kids and      grandkids, he never threw a hand. He took pride, too, in his      vegetable and flower gardens, producing homegrown tomatoes      and asparagus into his 90s.       Hillenmeyer began his long association with Thomas More      College when in the mid-1950s he was invited to become a      member of the Board of Lay Overseers, to which he was      selected chairman in 1960. This Board recommended the      college's move from downtown Covington to Crestview Hills and      the construction there of a new campus.       Along with education, Hillenmeyer worked to advance      ecumenism, health care and economic and human development.       As a member of the Limestone Ministerial Association, he      led ministers and others to locally observe an annual week of      prayer for Christian unity, now in its 42nd year.       He chaired a fund-raising drive to build a new hospital to      replace Maysville's outdated Hayswood Hospital. For 10 years,      he chaired the Hayswood Foundation, launching its grant      program which donated funds to support St. Patrick School,      the YMCA, The Boys and Girls Club and other projects in      surrounding communities.       A founding member of the Council for Burley Tobacco,      Hillenmeyer testified before Congress on behalf of tobacco      trade associations, and formerly presided over the Burley      Tobacco Dealers Association.       He served two terms as council member and vice mayor of      Aberdeen; was local district chairman for the Boy Scouts of      America; president of the Maysville Country Club; served as a      director of the local Chamber of Commerce; formerly presided      over Appalachian Industries in Vanceburg, promoting      employment and housing; and was a lifetime member of the UK      Alumni Association.       During retirement, he and his wife, Mary, routinely      attended daily Mass, and prayer and scriptural reflection,      and continued to nurture their deep bonds of affection and      eagerness to share their faith with others.       ``Ernie is a pillar--gentle and firm at the same time,''      cousin Robert F. Houlihan Jr., of Lexington said. ``He's      loved and respected. And he was totally unafraid to die. You      can't live a bad life and be unafraid of death.''       He is survived by his wife, Mary Farrell Hillenmeyer;      youngest sister, Mary Hillenmeyer Fiore of Kansas City      Missouri; six children, 11 grandchildren, beloved in-laws and      many other relatives who were dear to him.       Mass of Christian Burial will be celebrated at 11 a.m.,      Monday, April 7, at St. Patrick Church, in Maysville.       Visitation is 4 to 8 p.m., April 6, with Vigil Prayers at      7:30 p.m. at the church.       Burial will be in St. Patrick Cemetery.       Following the committal rite at St. Patrick Cemetery,      friends and family are invited to gather for food and      fellowship at the Limestone Center.       In lieu of flowers, memorial donations may be made to the      John J. Brannen Foundation, in care of St. Patrick School,      318 Limestone Street, Maysville, Ky. 41056, or St. Patrick      Church, 111 East Third Street, Maysville, Ky. 41056.       Woodhead Funeral Home, Falmouth, is serving the family.                          ____________________
