 President, I support the confirmation of the President's nominee to be the first inspector general of the intelligence community, Irvin Charles McCullough III.  The position of Inspector General of the Intelligence Community--or ICIG--was created in the fiscal year 2010 Intelligence Authorization Act, after several years of effort to have the position enacted. The reason to have a Community-wide inspector general is similar to the reason to have a Director of National Intelligence.  The ICIG is intended to review, and conduct oversight on, intelligence activities across the 16 agencies that make up the intelligence community, as well as the Office of the DNI, instead of having every agency--and its IG--operate within its own stovepipe.  In recent years, the intelligence agencies have worked more closely together. This has improved performance and reduced duplication, but it has also made the oversight work of individual agency inspectors general more difficult.  The Intelligence Committee saw there was a need to create an inspector general with authority and oversight of the entire intelligence community, and one who could look at issues that cut across individual agencies.  That view was reinforced by the relative weakness of the inspector general position in the Office of the DNI that was authorized as part of the Intelligence Reform Act of 2004.  Thus, the committee pushed to have created the inspector general of the intelligence community, to be confirmed by the Senate and given the statutory authorities and independence of other Senate-confirmed inspectors general.  Mr. McCullough is well-qualified to be this first ICIG. He has long experience conducting investigations both as an inspector general and a FBI agent. He is an attorney and is well-familiar with the intelligence community.  Mr. McCullough currently serves as the deputy inspector general of the DNI's Office of the Inspector General. From 2003 to 2010, he was an assistant inspector general for the National Security Agency. He served from 2001-2003 as senior counsel for law enforcement and intelligence in the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Department of the Treasury and was for 10 years in the Federal Bureau of Investigation as attorney, special agent and supervisory special agent.  The Intelligence Committee received Mr. McCullough's nomination in August. After Mr. McCullough answered the committee's questionnaire and prehearing questions, we held a public hearing with him on September 22. On October 4, the Intelligence Committee voted out Mr. McCullough's nomination on a rollcall vote of 15 to 0. His nomination was also considered in the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee and has moved forward by unanimous consent.  This important post will now be filled, and Mr. McCullough is qualified and prepared to take on the responsibilities and authorities of the position.  I support his confirmation.  The nomination considered and confirmed is as follows:            office of the director of national intelligence       Irvin Charles McCullough III, of Maryland, to be Inspector      General of the Intelligence Community, Office of the Director      of National Intelligence.                          ____________________
