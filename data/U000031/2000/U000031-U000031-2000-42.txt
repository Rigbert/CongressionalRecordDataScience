 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 1287, the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2000. Why are we here? We are here today because the Government broke its promise to the American people that it would begin storing the Nation's nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain by 1998, 2 years ago. The administration has still refused to deal in good faith with a bipartisan majority of both Houses of Congress to fix this problem.  Madam Speaker, there are few in this House who have worked as long to find a bipartisan solution to the problem of nuclear waste storage than I. For three consecutive Congresses, I have introduced bipartisan legislation to implement a safe solution to the problem of nuclear waste storage. Yet, despite the overwhelming bipartisan support for these measures throughout the years, we still cannot get the administration to stop saying no, no, no.  Let us review what has happened. In the 105th Congress, the bipartisan majority in the House overwhelmingly approved our nuclear waste bill, but the promise of a veto killed any further consideration in that Congress.  In this Congress, the House Committee on Commerce, by a vote of 40 to 6 reported out my bill, H.R. 45. Yet the administration continues to say, no, we will still veto it.  Just this past month, the Senate with a bipartisan majority passed the bill that we are considering today, S. 1287, bending over backwards to address each and every concern by this administration. Yet the administration still said no.  One of the big issues was interim storage. That cannot be part of the bill. We took it out over there in the Senate. Yet it seems like this legislation is like Charlie Brown and Lucy with a football. No matter what they did, the football kept going up, and they missed the kick. Sadly, it is the American people who continue to fall on their backs because it is they who are at risk with nuclear waste continuing to pile up in their communities.  So why do I come to the floor today in support of S. 1287 instead of my bill, H.R. 45? Well, the hour is late in this legislative year, and I believe it is better to move forward with the Senate bill today rather than face yet another filibuster in the other body and send it to the President in hopes that perhaps he will sign it.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this bill, which, if passed today and signed by the President, will in fact remove dangerous nuclear waste from communities all across America and deposit this material at Yucca Mountain, a safe and stable storage facility.  But, Madam Speaker, as I stand here today, I want to be clear about what our failure to pass this legislation will mean. By failing to pass this common sense, reasonable, scientifically sound bill, we are allowing the continuous pileup of nuclear waste in our communities, and we are abdicating our stewardship for future generations.  Right now across America, nuclear power plants are being forced to construct temporary facilities to hold nuclear waste, and they are filling up fast. Many of them are just a baseball throw away from your lakes, rivers, schools, and neighborhoods.  This bill moves high-level nuclear waste into one safe place rather than keep it in environmentally sensitive areas. Clearly, there is a need for a permanent facility to store this material.  But in the middle of the Nevada desert, far away from a populated ecosystem, sits Yucca Mountain, which by scientific accounts is a good place to start, a place, by the way, where we have spent $10 billion preparing it for this day.  Independent analysis in government agencies have shown that we are on the right track to have the Yucca Mountain site be safe, and I am here today to urge my colleagues to look at the sound science behind this proposal.  In addition, emotional pleas, mine, others today, some of our colleagues will say that transporting nuclear waste out of our communities is more dangerous than leaving it there. That makes no sense.  Again, I urge my friends to look at the scientific studies. In fact, over the past 30 years, we have had thousands of these shipments. Not a single release of radioactivity in any of those shipments. Asking consumers, through a tax in our utility bills, every single one of our constituents has contributed more than $17 billion to pay for this project.                              {time}  1300  By asking them to pay their utility bills to take care of this problem at the local level is unfair. Building temporary storage sites at our Nation's nuclear reactors have put taxpayers in double jeopardy. We are already paying the bill to build the storage site in Nevada, and now we are starting to foot the bill for storage sites in our communities.  With each passing day, we are one day closer to a nuclear power plant running out of storage room; we are one day closer to another cement cask being built in one of our constituents' back yards; and, my colleagues, it is yet another day that the Federal Government has not lived up to its responsibilities. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this measure. Let us get the stuff into one safe place. This bill begins that process.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
