 President, this is a time of serious political turmoil in the United States.  The House of Representatives is currently considering impeachment proceedings. The President of the United States has admitted to serious moral indiscretions.  The public is divided on what punishment should be meted out to a President who has performed such despicable and indefensible actions.  While the House of Representatives is considering impeachment the Senate is waiting to determine whether it may have to sit in judgment with respect to these actions.  Clearly this is a difficult time for the nation domestically.  It is a perilous time for the nation internationally.  We have four weeks left in this Congress and to date we have failed to address some critical foreign policy issues.  Notwithstanding that failure and the political disarray on the domestic front, there should be no disagreement as to the need to face up to these issues.  This challenge, and our unfinished business, is the subject of my remarks today.  Throughout our nation's history, Americans have understood that no matter what was happening in this country's internal political life, America's survival depends on presenting a strong, united front to the world. Now, in the middle of a domestic political crisis, we must overcome partisan differences to focus on urgent matters in United States foreign policy.  Especially now, in the face of major world crises, we must not allow ourselves to be distracted from our task of protecting America's security, leadership, and credibility abroad.  With time running short in the Congressional session, the ability to reach out to find the necessary consensus which could permit our country to speak in one voice is threatened by the entire debate over the future of this President.  No matter how we feel about the actions of President Clinton and whether impeachment proceedings should begin in the House of Representatives, Bill Clinton is still President of the United States with constitutional responsibilities for the conduct of our foreign policy and national security.  We in the Congress share that constitutional responsibility and I call on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to come together and work closely with the President and his national security team to address these issues together.  The security threats facing us are urgent and complex: international terrorism; weapons of mass destruction in Iraq; nuclear weapons programs in India, Pakistan, and North Korea; a fragile Middle East peace; drug trafficking and international crime; the financial crises in Russia and Asia; and impending humanitarian disasters in Kosovo and the Horn of Africa.                        Russian Economic Crisis  The unfolding crisis in Russia, for example, could hold serious threats to the national economic and military security of the United States. An even greater danger than the economic meltdown is the threat of a total collapse of Russia's political system.  With the Yeltsin era about to end, the only thing worse than an economically paralyzed Yeltsin government would be a coup d'etat that installed an authoritarian government.  It takes little imagination to see the dangers of a new, extremist Russian regime that would have access to thousands of leftover Cold War missiles armed with nuclear warheads. Because of the deep structural problems in Russia's political and economic system, there is very little that the United States can do to turn this situation around quickly.  But with thousands of former Soviet nuclear weapons experts out of work and rogue states such as Libya, Iran, and Iraq eager to offer them paychecks, we must keep our eye on the first priority of preventing the collapse of Russian democracy along with the economy if we want to protect our own national security.                                 Kosovo  In Kosovo, the Serbian special police are continuing their terrorist policy that has driven more than 300,000 Kosovo Albanians from their homes and into the forests and mountains. With the onset of the Balkan winter only one month away, a humanitarian catastrophe of enormous proportions looms. The West must compel the Serbs to cease military operations at once and provide unrestricted access to international aid organizations.  The Administration must immediately formulate a policy on Kosovo and present it to the Congress so we can be united in strong action to address yet another Balkan tragedy.                         Iraq Sanctions Policy  Iraq's decision last month to prevent U.N. inspections reminds us of the continuing threat posed by Saddam Hussein to our national interest. At that time, U.N. weapons inspector Scott Ritter resigned his post because he believed that the U.N. Security Council and the United States were unwilling to use force against Iraq to compel it to cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors.  Ritter's resignation has forced both the Administration and Congress to decide on a clear Iraq policy: do we rely on the immediate, unilateral use of force to back U.N. inspections?  Do we seek to maintain consensus on the Security Council before using force? Do we abandon the threat of the use of force and rely on sanctions to contain Iraq? These are tough choices, but we need to make a decision and be prepared to stick with it. And we need to remember that big nations can't bluff.                            The Middle East  Another test of United States leadership abroad is our continued support for the delicate peace process in the Middle East. My recent visit to the Middle East has reconfirmed my belief that both the Israeli and Palestinian leadership are committed to the success of the peace talks. It is important that Congress support the President's intensive efforts to revive a process that has remained stalled for much too long.  Continued drift in the peace process benefits no one but the terrorists and extremists.                             India/Pakistan  Equally critical is our support of the Administration's continued diplomatic efforts to de-escalate the nuclear tensions between India and Pakistan. In the wake of their nuclear tests, the President was forced by existing sanctions law to impose sweeping economic penalties against these countries, even though this made resolution of the crisis more difficult.  The Senate quickly moved to repeal part of the sanctions law to make exceptions for food and other humanitarian supplies. The Senate Sanctions Task Force, which I co-chair with Senator McConnell, also recommended changes in the existing sanctions regime to give the President flexibility in negotiating with India and Pakistan.  The Senate adopted these changes as an amendment to the Agricultural Appropriations bill. We need to completeaction on this legislation before we adjourn.  These are only some of the foreign policy issues we face together, the Congress and our President, in this dangerous world of borderless threats and transnational security challenges.  Our foreign policy initiatives could have tragic consequences--as we've seen in the past--if the President, Congress, and the American people fail to forge a common consensus on our foreign policy goals.  As I said at the outset, Bill Clinton is President of the United States. The situation requires a bipartisan effort to address these issues.  We have failed thus far in meeting that responsibility with respect to several very specific issues. Working with the President, we must act on these issues before we adjourn.                            Embassy funding  First among these is consideration of emergency embassy security legislation, which the President is expected to submit to the Congress this week. The embassy bombings in East Africa were tragic reminders of the long-term war against terrorism. They were also a reminder that maintaining a strong diplomatic presence around the globe cannot be done on a shoestring budget.  I believe the Congress will act quickly on the Administration's request for emergency funding to rebuild the destroyed embassies in Kenya and Tanzania and to meet urgent security needs of our other diplomatic facilities around the world. As the world's leading superpower, we cannot afford to pinch pennies in countering the new breed of international terrorist.  Under the leadership of the Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Helms, and the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of the Appropriations Committee, I am confident that this issue will be acted upon in an expeditious and bipartisan manner.  Engaging in a debate about whether Congress or the Executive had failed to provide adequate security funding would distract us from working together in a bipartisan manner to provide the funds needed to protect our people serving abroad.                              IMF Funding  America's own economic security may also very well depend on Congress's ability to provide strong international leadership at this critical time for the international economy. The Asian financial crisis has sent shock waves as far as Russia and Latin America. To protect our economy and to keep the crisis from spreading, Congress must act quickly to help replenish its share of the IMF's resources, which now have reached dangerously low levels.  But while the Senate has supported full funding for the IMF in a strong bipartisan manner, the House yesterday voted to provide only a fraction of our total share of the IMF's emergency funds.  With the outcome of the financial crisis still to be determined, Congress must act decisively before we adjourn to maintain both the financial strength of the IMF and to help end the global economic crisis before our own interests are jeopardized.                                  CWC  In a world beset with many dangers, the threat posed by weapons of mass destruction is also among our greatest concerns. Chemical weapons, among the world's oldest weapons of mass destruction, are truly horrific--as we learned when Iraq's Saddam Hussein gassed whole villages of his own people.  Partly in response to Saddam Hussein, the world has moved to adopt the Chemical Weapons Convention, or CWC, to outlaw chemical weapons and to verify compliance with the Treaty. In May of last year, the Senate passed bi-partisan legislation necessary to implement the Treaty. But the CWC remains in limbo. Why?  Because House Republicans failed to act on the Senate's CWC Implementation Act for six months, finally choosing to attach it to unrelated, vetoed legislation in a political confrontation with the President. Failure to act has put our country in violation of this treaty leaving us unable to demand compliance by others.  If the CWC implementation bill is not passed by the House in the next four weeks, we will continue to be in violation of the CWC Treaty and have to start all over again in a new Congress. It is time for the House of Representatives to step forward and put the national interest above political considerations.              U.N. Arrears/State Department Reorganization  The issue of United States arrears to the United Nations is another challenge we have yet to resolve. Chairman Helms and I worked hard to craft a bipartisan plan to pay $926 million in our arrears if the United Nations agreed to make reforms. Those plans are contained in the State Department Conference Report that has yet to be sent to the President.  Unfortunately, our payment to the UN has been weighed down with an unrelated, controversial abortion provision. We need to come to grips with this problem before we adjourn. Our arrears are harming our interests at the United Nations, where other countries are raising the issue at every opportunity to curtail U.S. influence on other matters.  Our failure to resolve serious differences over the Mexico City abortion language--or agree to strip it from this conference report--is also holding back additional legislation in the conference report authorizing the reorganization of the U.S. foreign affairs agencies--a long-awaited plan to help the Department streamline its operations to increase our diplomatic effectiveness.  We need to take a fresh look at the continuing impasse over this conference report. We in the Congress and the President need to set out a new road map to get these issues signed into law. As I said, we need, together, to resolve our differences over the Mexico City language or strip it off and fight that issue again next year.  Mr. President, at this point I would like to say a few words about the Committee on Foreign Relations, where I serve as Ranking Minority Member.  During this Congress the Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Helms, and I have worked together to address serious and difficult issues. We have not always agreed, though I am sure many have been surprised at the large number of issues the Chairman and I have come to agreement on.  Overriding all the issues, however, has been a strong commitment, equally shared, to our responsibility to discharge our responsibilities on the Committee on Foreign Relations.  Consequently it is no surprise that the Chairman, immediately upon our return in September, initiated plans for the Committee to act on over thirty legal assistance treaties and a large number of nominations important to the conduct of our foreign policy.  I applaud the Chairman for his commitment at this time of political crisis.  I regret, however, that the Committee has not been able to consider the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty this year. The Chairman and I disagree on the importance of this treaty and he has indicated a need to address other treaties first.  Although we will be unable to act before we adjourn, we do need to consider how and when the Senate will be able to take this treaty up next year.  Mr. President, as I said earlier, our time is short. We must work together to resolve these outstanding foreign policy issues.  Most important is the need for a bipartisan commitment to work with our President at this time of crisis, as he leads our country as Commander-in-Chief.  If ever there was a time for a President to provide leadership, overseas and the Congress to rise above a serious domestic political crisis to support the President, now is that time!  Mr. President, John F. Kennedy once remarked that ``our domestic policy can defeat us, but our foreign policy can kill us.''  He was right, of course. And in the coming weeks, Congress and the President have the responsibility to step up to the plate and address our unfinished foreign policy business--or risk allowing these neglected issues to jeopardize our national security interests.                          ____________________
