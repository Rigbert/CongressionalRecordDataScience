 Speaker, I am delighted to be joined by Representative Maurice Hinchey of the 26th District of New York State.  Mr. Speaker, I think that one of the problems in our democracy is that we have a tendency not to address some of the most sensitive and important issues. We seem to get a little bit consumed with O.J. Simpson and soap operas and the baseball games and so forth. Yet the country faces enormous pressures, enormous problems, and we really do not get into them very often in any great depth.  Let me begin the discussion with Representative Hinchey by raising a question, if I might, and, that is, many people in this country are concerned today about the degree to which in fact this Nation remains a democracy in which ordinary people are able to control their lives and control the future, as opposed to big-money interests which have such a profound impact on the political and economic life of this country.  Representative Hinchey, do you have some thoughts on that?
