Chairman, I rise today in opposition to this bill, and in support of Citizens like Annie Coleman of my district who will turn 73 on April 30. This bill pulls the rug out from under her. Let me tell you her story.  Annie lives on Oakwood Avenue in Toledo, OH, and worked all her life for Superior Laundry. She saved to own her own home and raised four children. She took care of a dying mother and husband after her retirement.  She now survives by picking up odd jobs, at age 72, because her Social Security checks of $640 a month are simply not enough to make ends meet. She pays nearly $200 a month for health insurance and prescriptions. Her heating bills are $180 a month and she receives $117 a month in winter heating assistance and emergency heating assistance in the winter. Even with this helping hand, she is left with $90 a week on which to live. Without it, she must make a choice between food and heat. No one who has lived through below zero Midwestern winters should be forced to make that choice.  The bill before us will eliminate the winter heating assistance [LIHEAP] Program. It will hurt Annie and 25,000 other citizens in northwest Ohio; it will hurt over 2 million elderly citizens across America. I cannot support a bill which puts the most vulnerable people in our society at risk.  Over the past 2 days we have engaged in a major debate on the worthy goal of balancing our budget by cutting $17.3 billion. Reducing the deficit and balancing the budget is a must and I have worked hard and continue to work hard to achieve that. But this is not the way to do it.  As we try to plug the red ink dike, the holes in the dike of our increasing debt, this $17.3 billion exercise is fruitless because at the same time there are billions of dollars flowing out the other side of the dike that are not under consideration and we are told are completely off the table.  Why not get rid of tax breaks for corporate welfare? We hear a lot about welfare for ordinary citizens. What about corporate welfare? Why not eliminate the tax breaks that give $5 billion for pharmaceutical companies to leave the United States and manufacture offshore; why not eliminate $30 billion worth of transfer pricing that rewards all these foreign corporations operating in the United States that do not pay a dime of taxes; why not auction off the rights to manufacture the space station and exact continuing royalties that will result in $40 billion in savings?  This rescission bill before us today makes none of these cuts. The bill before us today is irresponsible fiscal policy. No one should swallow the line that this bill will really result in deficit reduction. While it hurts our seniors and cuts out the summer jobs for our teenage sons and daughters, it also bankrolls the money for a future tax cut for America's wealthiest citizens. Thus, not only is the money being cut from our children and seniors, but it then is shifted to pay for capital gains and other tax cuts for the wealthiest among us as well as disaster relief largely for one State, California, which has the resources to pay for its own costs. In fact, the Governor of California has announced he wants to cut taxes in his State by $7 billion while asking the Federal Government to pick up $5 billion in disaster assistance.  The cuts in this bill will severely impact my community. I am especially worried about the impact of these cuts on the elderly and children.                    [[Page H3296]] summer youth jobs  Over my strong objections, the summer jobs for teenagers will be eliminated by this bill, which will eliminate nearly 2,000 jobs over 2 years in my district. In fact, 20 percent of the entire savings in this bill--$33 billion in all--comes from cuts in the various programs to move teenagers into the world of work. The rescission package completely eliminates summer jobs which employs about 600,000 young people nationwide. Youth, job training, Job Corps, and school-to-work accounted for $500 million in cuts.  In my district, 1,683 youth enrolled in the program and participated in jobs that were not make work jobs last summer. They worked at community centers and nonprofits throughout the community. The cut jeopardizes several innovative programs. The city of Toledo used summer youths to remove graffiti. The Arts Commission of Greater Toledo provided them with the opportunity to prepare public artwork, and learn skills at the same time. The Community Development Center--Spencer Township--uses summer youth to run a nutrition program to make up for school lunches that disadvantaged children do not get in the summer. The Red Cross and Catholic Club run recreation/day camp programs so that younger children have some place constructive to go during the summer months.  In addition, hundreds of other youth work at area nonprofit communities performing vital maintenance, upkeep and support functions that would go undone if not for summer youth workers.                   winter heating assistance [liheap]  This bill will eliminate heating assistance to help pay for gas and utility bills for over 13,700 seniors and a total of 25,000 low income families in my district. This includes 12,531 seniors in Lucas County, 521 seniors in Wood County, 383 seniors in Ottawa County, and 266 seniors in Fulton County. Nationwide, 2 million elderly households are helped each year through LIHEAP. The rescission package would completely eliminate the program. This cut will force low-income elderly to choose between heat and medicine or heat and food. No one in our Nation should be forced to make this choice.                          public broadcasting  Quality educational programming at our public television stations WBGU and WGTE will also be affected by cuts of over 30 percent in funding that will accelerate over the next 3 years. With the increase of violence and degrading television programs, CPB continues to fund marvelous children's educational and entertaining programs such as ``Sesame Street,'' ``Reading Rainbow,'' and ``Square One TV.'' Educating children, especially preschoolers is one of the most important goals of public television and where public television performs best.                        medigap insurance scams  The rescission package cuts in half Federal assistance to help senior citizens in all income groups being victimized by so-called Medigap insurance scams. Literally billions are spent by seniors each year on health insurance and while much of it is needed, it is estimated that a major portion of the total is either duplicative or coverage that seniors already have or is written in a way as to provide most seniors with very little added coverage.  During committee consideration, we attempted to meet deficit targets using cuts in programs that did not adversely affect children and the elderly. We tried to convert disaster assistance to California from grants to loan guarantees in order to minimize the budget impact and reprogram dollars to people's needs.  We must not put the most vulnerable people in our society at risk, to provide disaster assistance to States who can afford to pay for their own problems or to provide a tax cut for the wealthiest in our Nation. This bill is wrong-headed and deserves rejection.
