 President, I previously filed budgetary aggregates and committee allocations for budget year 2015 pursuant to section 116 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013. Today I am adjusting those levels to account for three reported bills from the Appropriations Committee.  Section 251 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 establishes statutory limits on discretionary spending and allows for various adjustments to those limits, while sections 302 and 314(a) of the Congressional Budget Act allows the chairman of the Budget Committee to establish and make revisions to allocations, aggregates, and levels consistent with those adjustments. The Committee on Appropriations reported three bills that are eligible for an adjustment under the Congressional Budget Act:  1) The State, Foreign Operations, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, which includes $8.625 billion in budget authority and $2.5 billion in outlays that is designated as Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding.  2) The Homeland Security Appropriations Act, which includes $213 millionin budget authority and $170 million in outlays that is designated as OCO funding and $6.438 billion in budget authority and $322 million in outlays that is designated as disaster funding.  3) The Defense Appropriations Act, which includes $59.719 billion in budget authority and $28.368 billion in outlays that is designated as OCO funding.  Consequently, I am revising the budgetary aggregates for 2015 by a total of $74.995 billion in budget authority and $31.360 billion in outlays. I am also revising the budget authority and outlay allocations to the appropriations committee for 2015 by $16.416 billion in revised nonsecurity budget authority, $58.579 billion in revised security budget authority, and $31.360 billion in total outlays.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the following tables detailing the changes to the allocation to the Committee on Appropriations and the budgetary aggregates.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                          BUDGETARY AGGREGATES    (Pursuant to section 116 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 and          section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974)------------------------------------------------------------------------          $s in millions                   2014               2015------------------------------------------------------------------------Current Spending Aggregates*:    Budget Authority..............          2,842,558          2,940,213    Outlays.......................          2,819,514          3,004,326Adjustments:    Budget Authority..............                  0             74,995    Outlays.......................                  0             31,360Revised Spending Aggregates:    Budget Authority..............          2,842,558          3,015,208    Outlays.......................          2,819,514         3,035,686------------------------------------------------------------------------* Current Spending Aggregates were revised on 6/16/2014 and 7/16/2014 to  include a disaster cap adjustment for the Agriculture Appropriations  subcommittee and a deficit neutral reserve fund adjustment for  terrorism risk insurance.
