 President, I find that very troubling. I find it troubling the Senate has now decided to change the definition of relevancy we have operated under in the Senate as long as I have been here. It appears very clear to me now that the issue of relevancy is a much higher standard than the issue of germaneness. We have stepped into a realm most of us are going to be very sorry we are in.  I again will say to my colleagues that having objected to waiving this relevancy, having listened to how we have now changed the definition of relevancy, what we are really doing is saying to women in this country they are irrelevant. I find that to be very sad, Mr. President.
