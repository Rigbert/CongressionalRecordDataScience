Speaker, I rise today to honor the distinguished representative from Iowa, the Hon. Jim Ross Lightfoot. For the past 12 years, Jim has honorably served the people of Iowa's Third District. Now I wish him the best in his attempt to represent Iowa in the United States Senate.  Jim has served this country in many different capacities, including in the Army, as a police officer, on the Corsicana, Texas City Commission, and most recently, as the Representative from Iowa's Third District.  While in Congress, Jim has made his marks on the Appropriations Committee, where he has served as the Subcommittee Chairman on Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government for the past 2 years. Because of his work as Chairman, Jim deserves some of the credit for the savings achieved in Government spending during the 104th Congress.  Jim's humor and demeanor will be missed in this body. He is a fighter whose courage and tenacity have allowed him to outlive his political obituary written by many pundits.  On behalf of the citizens of Wisconsin's Ninth District, I thank the Hon. Jim Ross Lightfoot for his service to the House of Representatives and the United States.  Mr. McDADE. Mr. Speaker, it is my very great pleasure to rise today to pay tribute to my colleague and dear friend, Jim Ross Lightfoot from Iowa who will be retiring from the House at the end of this Congress to pursue a seat in the other body.  We thank Jim for his years of distinguished public service in the House of Representatives and wish him well as he returns to Iowa--just as he has done every week Congress was in session--to stay in touch with the people of Iowa.  When he was first elected to the Congress in 1984, Jim brought with him to the House of Representatives a wide array of experience nearly as vast as his 27-county Congressional District.  A small businessman himself, Jim has long been a good friend to small business owners. After serving in the U.S. Army and Army Reserve in 1956-64, Jim was and is an outstanding spokesman for our Nation's veterans. As a former Tulsa, OK police officer, Jim was a valued leader in the Law Enforcement Caucus as its cochairman to pursue a seat in the other body.  His stewardship of the Treasury, Postal Service and General Government Appropriations Subcommittee was marked by a commitment to safeguard taxpayers hard-earned dollars and assuring that the Federal departments and agencies under his jurisdiction stuck to the good Government policies which were and are Jim's hallmark.  I wish Jim, his wife Nancy and their children Terri, Jamie, Alison and Jim Jr. the very best.                          ____________________
