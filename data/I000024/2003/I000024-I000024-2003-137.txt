President, I rise to pay tribute today to an outstanding American for his significant, lasting contributions to the soldiers of the United States Army.  On June 23, 2003, Dr. A. Michael Andrews II, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army for Research and Technology/Chief Scientist, returned to the private sector after over six and a half years of selfless service to the Army and the Nation. Mike hails from the great state of Oklahoma, and received his B.S. and M.S. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Oklahoma. In 1971, he received his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Illinois.  Following a stellar 25-year career as a senior engineer and senior executive at Rockwell International Corporation, Mike came to the Pentagon in January 1997 as the Director for Technology in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Research, Development and Acquisition.  His exemplary performance as Director of Technology led to Mike's appointment as the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army for Research and Technology/Chief Scientist, DAS, R, in November 1998. As DAS, R, Mike was responsible for the Army's entire Research and Technology program, spanning 21 Laboratories and Research, Development and Engineering Centers, with approximately 10,000 scientists and engineers and a budget that, under his leadership, grew over 30 percent to reach $1.8 billion in Fiscal Year 2004.  In October 1999, the Army Secretary and the Chief of Staff of the Army announced their Vision for transforming the Army to an Objective Force--a force that is rapidly deployable and can operate in both large-scale wars and urban peacekeeping operations. It was clear that the Army's Science and Technology, S, program was the cornerstone to achieving their vision of a full spectrum force within this decade. Mike took bold steps to shift the focus of the Army's technology by judiciously refocusing and redirecting the Army's $10 billion plus S investments over 2000-2007 towards developing and demonstrating Objective Force technologies.  Understanding the importance of Congressional support for the Army S program, Mike consistently worked to develop better communications with Members of Congress and Congressional Staff. These efforts resulted in Congress providing over 98 percent of the requested Army S program funding over the last five Fiscal Years and 100 percent, thus far, for Fiscal Year 2004.  In addition to his pursuit of achieving a lighter, more lethal Army, Mike also initiated a unique partnership with the private sector to link the Army and the entertainment industry to establish unique training environments for our soldiers. By leveraging significant entertainment industry investments and capabilities in modeling and simulations, e.g., electronic games, theme parks and digital movies, and existing Army efforts, Mike established a university-based center called the Institute for Creative Technologies. The Institute provides an environment for shared investment and joint projects to enhance Army training. The Institute has expanded beyond Hollywood to the Army's Field Artillery Center and School at Fort Sill, OK, where its significant simulation and modeling capabilities can be brought directly to soldiers undergoing basic and advanced Field Artillery training.  Finally, Mike was also the driving force in launching the Cybermission program, a personal initiative of Chief of Staff of the Army CSA, General Eric K. Shinseki. This program raised the visibility of the Army's commitment in the education of America's youth in science, math and technology among 7th-8th grade students across America. ECybermission introduces young Americans and potentially future soldiers to the Army and the theme of Service to Our Nation while supporting the President's commitment to education.  Mike was honored with the Presidential Rank Award in 2001, elected as a Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineering in 2001, and presented the National Defense Industry Association Firepower Award in 2000.  In this short space, it is difficult to fully document the many significant, positive ways that Mike has shaped the future of the Army. Through his tireless attention to detail and personal involvement, Mike has shepherded the FCS program through the past five years and has brought attention and credit to the Army's S community for the outstanding achievements that they have made. Mike Andrews' effective work with senior Army and DoD staff principals, scientists and engineers, and industry significantly enhanced the Army's efforts toward the development of the Future Combat Systems, Objective Force, and Transformation. He demonstrated visionary leadership, planning and organizational skills throughout his tenure. As we honor him, we note that this institution and our country is better off for the major contributions he has made. We wish him all the best in his future endeavors.                          ____________________
