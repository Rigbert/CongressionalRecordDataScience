President, the Senate has been in session all week and held one vote Tuesday and two votes this morning--all procedural votes. We have considered a bill this week concerning the number one issue in America today--the price of energy. Instead of allowing a full debate on the bill and, most importantly, a full opportunity to allow amendments to actually open up supplies and provide Americans with options, the Democratic majority has closed debate and prohibited any opportunity to amend the bill.  Now, the Senate Democratic Majority, after wasting an entire week, is engaged in a stunt to keep the Senate in session this weekend in some false demonstration they are serious about now addressing the issues that concern Americans.  Tomorrow, the Senate is expected to vote on a massive housing package that continues to grow as it has been amended going back and forth between the House and Senate. At this point, this bill proposes raising the national debt limit to $10.6 trillion, an $800 billion increase.
