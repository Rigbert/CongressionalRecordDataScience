Speaker, in the summer of 2011, I stood on the House floor in support of legislation to expedite approval of the landmark Keystone XL pipeline. We passed that bill by a strong bipartisan vote of 279 to 147. But despite the overwhelming support, the White House issued a veto threat, declaring the bill was unnecessary given that the administration was committed to reaching a decision on the project by the end of the year.  Fast forward to today, and it's deja vu all over again. More than three years after we passed that initial bill, we still don't have a decision from the president on this critical jobs project despite widespread support from Democrats and Republicans, laborers, and job creators.  President Obama famously proclaimed in January 2013 that he would do ``whatever it takes'' to create jobs and 2014 was renamed the president's so-called ``Year of Action.'' But when the chips are down, President Obama is incapable of saying ``yes'' to a project that would create tens of thousands of American jobs and advance our energy security. But despite the president's excuses, we haven't given up on finding a bipartisan solution.  We have now voted a total of eight times in the House to move this landmark project forward. And now we are standing up for jobs and energy once again. We are going to keep fighting for Keystone until we get the job done.  There is now no question that Keystone is in America's best interest. Keystone has been exhaustively studied more than any other pipeline in our nation's history and the facts are clear. Keystone will deliver nearly a million barrels of safe and secure North American oil, and President Obama's own State Department has confirmed that it will support over 42,000 jobs without significantly increasing emissions. It's also expected to be one of the safest pipelines ever built, adhering to the new pipeline standards we passed into law with additional safety requirements.  Hopefully, this ninth vote is the charm, and the Senate and President will finally agree, that after six years, it's time to finally say yes to energy and yes to jobs.                          ____________________
