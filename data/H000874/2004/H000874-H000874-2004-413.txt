Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that answer, and I would hope that we can respond to that issue as soon as possible. I know there is bipartisan support for what was referred to as the Crane-Rangel bill. I am not sure what it is referred to now, the Rangel-Manzullo bill. I think we could proceed in a bipartisan way if that bill could be moved forward. I understand that is not the bill that the committee has reported out, but it seems to me there is bipartisan consensus on that issue, and I thank the gentleman from Texas for that information.                          ____________________
