President, the amendment offered by my colleague Senator Lee would prohibit all funding for a fair housing regulation issued by HUD based on a requirement of a landmark civil rights law, the Fair Housing Act of 1968. Not only was this not a regulation that appeared out of thin air, the GAO did a report criticizing HUD, and once the regulation was implemented, closed the recommendation.  In addition, communities asked HUD to issue better guidance on this part of the law so that they could avoid being sued under the Fair Housing Act of 1968.  Thank you, Mr. President.  Mr. President, I move to table the Lee amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.
