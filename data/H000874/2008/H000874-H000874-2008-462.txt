John Lancaster, who passed away on July 1st at the age of 90.  John Lancaster was a man of principle and deep devotion to his community. As the first elected African-American county commissioner in the history of St. Mary's County, Maryland, Mr. Lancaster was certainly a political trailblazer. Breaking that barrier was indeed astonishing. John believed that he was accountable to all in the community as he simply but eloquently once said ``I was a commissioner serving all people.''  Perhaps the most important issue to John was education. A local official in my community recently dubbed him as the ``education commissioner'' and many regarded him as a mentor in education policy. As commissioner, John could not sit idly as public schools were decaying in front of him. Today, because of his efforts and foresight, education is a very important issue in St. Mary's County, and students are learning in first class facilities.  John Lancaster was the personification of hard work and optimism. In face of discrimination he pressed forward. Mr. Lancaster will certainly be remembered as an example for those who dare to dream the impossible. I would like to offer my condolences to his loving family, as we mourn the loss of an extraordinary person.                          ____________________
