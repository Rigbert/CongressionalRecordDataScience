 President, I rise today in support of Senator Lee's amendment that would prevent the implementation of HUD's affirmatively furthering fair housing regulation.  Contrary to statements that have been made, the Senator's amendment does nothing to change fair housing laws or to prevent the enforcement thereof. What the Lee amendment does is to prevent the implementation of a rule that would give HUD Federal control over local planning decisions.  Supporters of this program have argued that it is intended to protect communities from fair housing lawsuits. It is quite the contrary. This rule, if allowed to be implemented, will actually lay the predicate for endless litigation against every community in our respective States that are required to participate. This should be unacceptable to every Member of this body.  Supporting Senator Lee's amendment is the only option before us to prevent centralized Federal control of local planning decisions. In my judgment, the Collins-Reed amendment does nothing to restrain the full implementation of HUD's program. I urge my colleagues to support the Lee amendment.
