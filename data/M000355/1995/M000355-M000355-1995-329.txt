 President, I think it is reasonable to assume, given the outcome of the Feingold sense-of-the-Senate resolution, that any effort to, essentially, muscle this Democratic agenda item onto the Republican Senate would likely be greeted with a filibuster. But of course that was just a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. I suppose people can read into it whatever they choose.  The second-degree that the Republican leader has forwarded to the desk simply adds campaign finance to the whole litany of other issues. It listed a whole variety of things the Senate ought to be addressing and simply adds campaign finance to it. Those who feel campaign finance ought to be on the agenda of the 104th Congress surely ought to have no objection to the amendment now before us.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
