President, this afternoon, the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 3 p.m. Following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of H.R. 4112, the legislative branch appropriations bill.  As a reminder, a cloture motion was filed on Friday to the legislative branch bill and, therefore, Members have until 2 p.m. today to file first-degree amendments. The cloture vote will occur tomorrow at approximately 9:30 in the morning.  At the conclusion of debate today on the legislative branch appropriations bill, the Senate will begin consideration of S. 2260, the Commerce-State-Justice appropriations bill. All Members are encouraged to come to the floor to offer and debate amendments to this legislation. The majority leader has announced there will be no rollcall votes during today's session and, therefore, any votes ordered with respect to any appropriations bills will be postponed, to occur on Tuesday following the vote on cloture.                          ____________________
