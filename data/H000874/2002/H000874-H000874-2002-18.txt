Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his contribution; but not just tonight, I thank the gentleman for his contribution over a career of fighting for people and ensuring that their rights are observed and expanded.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gonzalez), the son of an extraordinary Member of this House who fought for the little people of America all the time and was a giant in this House; and his son, of which he would be supremely proud, promises to be equally committed to people.
