 President, I think that concludes--at least for this phase--the number of speakers we have on the Cohen amendment. Senator Smith is here to offer an amendment.  Senator Leahy and I would like to use this opportunity, before Senator Smith lays down his amendment, to get approved amendments that have been cleared by both sides. There are eight amendments.  With the permission of the Senator from Maine, I ask unanimous consent that the Cohen amendment be temporarily laid aside.
