 President, yesterday, the House of Representatives passed the Senate amendment to S. 3525, which represents the bipartisan and bicameral agreement on the Child and Family Services Improvement Act of 2006.  I was pleased to have introduced the Senate amendment with my friend and partner on the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Max Baucus. Senator Baucus and I were joined by Senator Orrin G. Hatch, and Senator John D. Rockefeller, Jr. and Senator Olympia J. Snowe. All of these members have a long history of support for important programs to improve the well-being of children.  This important legislation reauthorizes the Promoting Safe and Stable Families Program which provides services to families for family support, family preservation, time-limited reunification of families, and for adoption and post-adoption services. These are critical funding streams, and the reauthorization of the Promoting Safe and Stable Families Program ensures that families can rely on these preventative and supportive services.  The legislation also aligns the Child Welfare Services Act with the prevention activities of the Promoting Safe and Stable Families Program by providing incentives to States to invest in prevention services while allowing States to continue current State spending on existing State priorities.  S. 3525 provides support for increased caseworker visits as well as adopts a version of President Bush's proposal to provide a voucher for mentoring services for children of prisoners.  Additionally, the legislation increases access for funding for Indian tribes, which was a key priority of both Senator Baucus and Senator Kent Conrad.  The legislation that will soon be signed by the President also includes grants for regional partnerships to address the growing problem of methamphetamine and other substance abuse and addictions that have had a substantial impact on child welfare systems and services.  Funding for these competitive grants was a key priority of mine, and I am pleased that the compromise we were able to work out with the House maintains the support for grants to improve the outcomes for children affected by methamphetamine abuse and addiction.  Mr. President, the Senate Finance Committee did a great deal of work on issues relating to child welfare. We held the first full committee hearing in 10 years on child welfare, and we held an additional hearing on the effects of the methamphetamine epidemic on the child welfare system. We worked on a bipartisan basis to mark up and pass the Improving Outcomes for Children Affected by Meth Act of 2005. Key provisions of that bill are features in the legislation which will soon be signed into law.  But there is more that can be done to strengthen and improve child welfare services. I intend to continue to work on a bipartisan basis to develop and enact reforms to ensure that all children have access to loving, permanent homes.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank the staff who worked tirelessly to get this bill done. Members of Congress in both the House and the Senate are very well served by our staffs. These men and women care a great deal about these programs, and we are indebted to them for their insights and analysis.  I am grateful to the talented staff from the office of Senator Baucus, specifically, Diedra Henry-Spires, Doug Steiger, and Michelle Easton. Additionally, I am grateful to Senator Rockefeller's extremely knowledgeable aid Barbara Pryor.  I appreciate the work of the staff on the Subcommittee on Human Resources of the House Committee on Ways and Means, Matt Weidinger and Christine Calpin for the majority and Nick Gwyn and Sonja Nesbit for the minority.  I also thank the dedicated analyst from the Congressional Research Service, Emilie Stoltzfus who provided staff with invaluable expertise on child welfare programs.  Thanks to Christina Hawley Anthony from the Congressional Budget Office as well as legislative counsels Ruth Ernst and James Grossman.  Finally, I appreciate the efforts of my own Finance Committee policy lead on this issue, Becky Shipp as well as Mark Hayes, Ted Totman, and Kolan Davis.  Mr. President, because a formal conference was not convened on this bill, there is no conference report filed. However, the staff has prepared a section-by-section analysis of the Senate-House agreement for purposes of the legislative history.  Mr. President, some will say this has been a ``do nothing congress.'' I couldn't disagree more, and I believe that the children and families served by this legislation would disagree as well.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the section-by-section analysis to which I referred be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                      Section-by-Section Analysis  S. 3525, THE CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2006, AS                                 AMENDED (Prepared by the Staff of the U.S. House Committee on Ways and Means      and the U.S. Senate Committee on Finance, September 27, 2006)     Section 1--Short Title       ``The Child and Family Services Improvement Act of 2006''     Section 2--Findings       The legislation makes a number of findings regarding the      provision of services under two child welfare programs      authorized under Title IV-B of the Social Security Act, the      Child Welfare Services (CWS) program and the Promoting Safe      and Stable Families (PSSF) program. The findings note the      importance of monthly caseworker visits in improving outcomes      for children. They also outline the relationship between the      entry of children into the child welfare system and their      parent's abuse of methamphetamine and other substances.     Section 3--Reauthorization of the Promoting Safe and Stable          Families Program     Current Law       For fiscal year (FY) 2006, authorizes mandatory funding of      $345 million for the Promoting Safe and Stable Families      (PSSF) program (Title IV-B, Subpart 2 of the Social Security      Act) and discretionary funding of $200 million for each of      FYs 2002 through 2006.     S. 3525       The legislation extends the mandatory PSSF funding      authorization of $345 million for five years (FYs 2007      through 2011) and extends the discretionary funding      authorization of $200 million for each of those same five      years. The legislation expands the reporting requirement to      include both proposed spending and actual spending under the      CWS and PSSF programs, and at State option, other programs      that support child abuse prevention activities and child      welfare services. The legislation also prohibits HHS from      making any payment of PSSF funds to a State for      administrative costs that exceed 10 percent of total program      expenditures (Federal and non-Federal) of a State.     Reason for Change       The PSSF program supports four categories of services      provided to children and families: family preservation      services, community-based family support services, time-     limited reunification services, and adoption promotion and      support services. The legislation recognizes the importance      of encouraging States to invest in these activities. Thus the      legislation provides for the $200 million increase in      mandatory PSSF funds over the next five years included in the      Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (Pub. L. 109-171). In total      $345 million in mandatory funds (the recent $305 million      allotment of annual mandatory funds, plus a $40 million      annual increase provided under the Deficit Reduction Act of      2005) will be provided in each of FYs 2007 through 2011.       The legislation also will ensure better oversight and      accountability of spending under the CWS and PSSF programs by      requiring States to report on projected and actual spending      under these two programs. Specifically, data on actual      spending will help track State investments for the four      priorities of the PSSF program.     Section 4--Targeting of Promoting Safe and Stable Families          Program Resources     Current Law       Current law requires States to include assurances in their      PSSF plan that they will spend significant portions of their      PSSF funds in each of four priority areas: (1) family      preservation services; (2) community-based family support      services; (3) time-limited family reunification services; and      (4) adoption promotion and support services.     S. 3525       The legislation retains the four priorities of PSSF while      targeting the additional $40 million per year provided under      the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (Pub. L. 109-171) to two      new priorities: (1) support for monthly caseworker visits;      and (2) competitive grants to promote the well-being of      children in or at risk of placement in the child welfare      system as a result of their parent's abuse of methamphetamine      or other substances.       The legislation provides a total of $95 million to States      to support monthly caseworker visits of children in foster      care under the responsibility of the State, with a primary      emphasis on activities designed to improve caseworker      retention, recruitment, training, and ability to access the      benefits of technology. States will receive $40 million from      FY 2006 PSSF funds (with these funds available through FY      2009), $5 million in FY 2008, $10 million in FY 2009, and $20      million in each of FYs 2010 and 2011 to support monthly      caseworker visits. States cannot use these funds to supplant      any Federal funds already paid to the State under the Title      IV-E program that could be used for the purposes outlined      above.       To promote the well-being of children affected by their      parent's abuse of methamphetamine or other substances, the      legislation provides a total of $145 million to the Secretary      of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to award      competitive     grants to regional partnerships to pursue innovative      approaches to help children and families. Funding will be $40      million in FY 2007, $35 million in FY 2008, $30 million, in      FY 2009 and $20 million in each of FYs 2010 and 2011.      Partnerships must include the State child welfare agency or      an Indian tribe and at least one other eligible partner,      including: child welfare service providers (non-profit and      for-profit), community providers of health or mental      health services, local law enforcement agencies, judges      and court personnel, juvenile justice officials, school      personnel, the State agency responsible for administering      the substance abuse prevention and treatment block grant      (authorized under Title XIX-B, Subpart II of the Public      Health Services Act), and any other providers, agencies,      personnel, officials or entities related to the provision      of child and family services. Grants of between $500,000      and $1 million per year will be awarded for 2 to 5 year      periods.       A priority will be given to grant applications that propose      to combat methamphetamine abuse, given its substantial affect      on child welfare in some areas. Funding for the grants must      be used to support the purposes of this program, which may      include family- based comprehensive long-term substance abuse      treatment services, early intervention and prevention      services, mental health services, parent skills training, and      replication of successful models for providing family-based      comprehensive long-term substance abuse treatment services.      Grantees must provide a 15 percent match in the first and      second year, a 20 percent match in the third and fourth year,      and a 25 percent match in the fifth year. In-kind      contributions can qualify towards the match requirement. The      Secretary of HHS must consult with State leaders to develop      performance indicators and reporting is required of all grant      recipients.       The legislation also redirects current PSSF research      funding to support evaluation, research, and technical      assistance related to the above two PSSF funding priorities.      In each of FYs 2007 through 2011, at least $1 million must be      spent for research and technical assistance activities that      support monthly caseworker visits and at least $1 million      must be spent for research and technical assistance      activities with respect to the competitive grant program to      promote the well-being of children in or at risk of placement      in the child welfare system due to a parent's abuse of      methamphetamine or other substances.     Reason for Change       The targeting of funds to support monthly visits of foster      children is in response to research highlighting how monthly      visits lead to better outcomes for children. The Child and      Family Service Reviews (CFSRs) completed in each State found      a strong correlation between frequent caseworker visits with      children and positive outcomes for children, such as timely      achievement of permanency and other indicators of child well-     being. However, despite the fact that nearly all States had      written standards suggesting monthly visits were State      policy, a December 2005 report completed by the HHS Office of      the Inspector General found that only 20 States were able to      produce reports showing whether caseworkers actually visited      children in foster care on at least a monthly basis. States      are encouraged to invest these resources in those activities      with proven effectiveness in supporting monthly caseworker      visits of foster children and should be cognizant that these      funds may not supplant what States already spend from their      Title IV-E programs for these activities. These resources are      intended to increase State investment in these important      areas.       Parental substance abuse is a well-known problem affecting      the child welfare system, and the Office of Applied Studies      of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services      Administration reported that the number of new uses of      methamphetamines (meth) has increased 72 percent in the past      decade. A study by the National Association of Counties which      surveyed 300 counties in 13 States reported that meth abuse      is a major cause of child abuse and neglect. Forty percent of      all the child welfare officials in the survey reported an      increase in out-of-home placements due to meth abuse in 2005.     Section 5--Allotments and Grants to Indian Tribes     Current Law       Requires that 1 percent of all mandatory PSSF funds, and 2      percent of any discretionary appropriations for the PSSF      program, be set aside for tribal programs. (The minimum      tribal funding provided is $3.45 million and the maximum      annual tribal funding possible is $7.45 million.)       Out of the tribal funds reserved, Indian tribes or tribal      organizations with an approved plan must be allotted PSSF      funds (based on the relative share of tribal persons under      age 21 but only among tribes or tribal organizations with      approved plans). The Secretary of HHS may exempt a tribe from      any plan requirement that it determines would be      inappropriate for that tribe (taking into account the      resources, needs, and other circumstances of that tribe).      However, no tribe or tribal organization may have an approved      plan (or receive funds) unless its allotment is equal to at      least $10,000. Funds allotted are paid directly to the tribal      organization of the Indian tribe to which the money is      allotted.     S. 3525       The legislation increases the set-aside for tribal programs      to 3 percent of any discretionary funds appropriated. It also      increases the set-aside for tribal programs to 3 percent of      the mandatory funds authorized and which remain after the      separate reservation of funds is made for (1) monthly      caseworker visits, and (2) competitive grants to combat      methamphetamine and other substance abuse. Therefore, the      minimum funding available per year for tribal programs would      be $9.15 million and the maximum funding would be $15.15      million. The legislation eliminates the ability of the      Secretary of HHS to exempt tribes from the PSSF plan      requirements related to nonsupplantation, data reporting, and      monitoring. However, the Secretary retains the ability to      waive for Indian tribes the PSSF requirement to invest      significant amounts of program funds in each of the four PSSF      activities and to spend no more than 10 percent of PSSF funds      on administrative costs.       The legislation also permits tribal consortia to have      access to an allotment of PSSF funds (and related technical      assistance) on the same basis as such funds are currently      available to Indian tribes. A tribal consortium's allotment      is to be determined based on the number of tribal persons      under age 21 in each tribe that is a part of the tribal      consortium. If tribes choose to apply collectively as a      consortium, the population of tribal persons under age 21      for each tribe would be combined in order to determine the      size of the grant to the consortium, including whether the      consortium meets the $10,000 eligibility threshold in the      Act. A tribal consortium could select which Indian tribal      organization (among the tribes in the consortium) would      receive the direct payment of its allotment.     Reason for Change       The legislation recognizes the importance of assisting      tribes in their efforts to assist abused and neglected      children. The legislation significantly increases the amount      of funds provided to tribes and allows tribal consortia to      apply for PSSF funds. This step is being taken to encourage      the further development of tribal child welfare programs,      which largely serve severely disadvantaged communities and      families and can do so in a culturally appropriate manner.      Permanency outcomes for Indian children can be improved if      tribal consortia are able to have access to an allotment of      PSSF funding on the same basis as is currently available to      Indian tribes. This will facilitate smaller tribes' building      their own programs and will allow for administrative      efficiencies in tribal program administration.       To collect additional data and ensure proper oversight of      these funds, tribes and tribal consortia interested in      applying for this substantial increase in PSSF funds will be      required to adhere to the same data and monitoring plan      requirements as States. This additional data will inform how      these funds have helped the tribes better ensure the safety,      permanency, and well-being of tribal children.     Section 6--Improvements to the Child Welfare Services (CWS)          Program     Current Law       Up to $325 million annually is authorized on an indefinite      basis for the Child Welfare Services (CWS) program, which      provides funds to States to support a wide range of child      welfare activities. Federal funding represents 75 percent of      total funding for this program, and States are required to      contribute 25 percent of total CWS funding from State funds.     S. 3525       The legislation maintains the annual discretionary      authorization level of $325 million per year but limits the      funding authorization to FYs 2007 through 2011. The      legislation also specifies that the purpose of the CWS      program for which funds may be expended is to promote State      flexibility in the development and expansion of a coordinated      child and family services program that utilizes community-     based agencies and that ensures all children are raised in      safe, loving families, by: (1) protecting and promoting the      welfare of all children; (2) preventing the neglect, abuse,      or exploitation of children; (3) supporting at-risk families      through services which allow children, where appropriate, to      remain safely with their families or return to their families      in a timely manner; (4) promoting the safety, permanence and      well-being of children in foster care and adoptive families;      and (5) providing training, professional development and      support to ensure a well-qualified child welfare workforce.       The legislation eliminates the plan requirements related to      child day care standards and those related to the use of      paraprofessionals or volunteers and restates and renumbers      the remaining provisions with generally the same intent. It      rewrites the provision concerning policies and procedures for      children abandoned shortly after birth to assert that a State      must have in effect administrative and judicial procedures      for children who are abandoned at or shortly after birth      (including policies and procedures providing for legal      representation of the children) to ensure expeditious      decisions can be made for their permanent placement. Further,      it clarifies that the State may include residential      educational programs as a living arrangement for children for      whom reunification, adoption, or guardianship have been ruled      out as permanency goals. This provision does not undermine      current State policies regarding placement of children in      adoptive homes and does not eliminate the 25 bed policy.       Beginning October 1, 2007 (i.e. the beginning of FY 2008),      the legislation limits administrative funding to 10 percent,      but defines administrative funds to exclude caseworker      services and supervision of such services. Also beginning in      FY 2008, the legislation limits how much each State can      expend from Federal CWS funding for foster care maintenance      payments, adoption assistance payments, or child day care to      what the State can show that it spent for such purposes in FY      2005. Further, beginning with FY 2008, States are not allowed      to use State spending on foster care maintenance payments to      meet the State matching requirement to receive Federal CWS      fund in amounts that exceed what the State spent from such      funds in FY 2005.       The legislation also adds new requirements to the CWS plan      the State submits to (1) describe how the State consults with      and involves physicians and other appropriate medical      professionals in the assessment of children in foster care      and in determining appropriate medical treatment, and (2)      develop a plan on how to respond, track and continue care for      children receiving child welfare services in the event of a      disaster.     Reason for Change       The legislation will reorganize and update the CWS program      and encourage more effective oversight. It also aligns the      program to be coterminous with the reauthorization of the      PSSF program to allow for better coordination between the two      programs. It will encourage States to invest funding in      prevention services, but allows each State to maintain in the      coming years its FY 2005 level of spending from Federal CWS      funds for foster care, adoption assistance and child care      purposes. It adds a new State planning requirement to ensure      consultation with medical professionals as well as State      planning to continue the availability of child welfare      services during a disaster.     Section 7--Monthly Caseworker Standard     Current Law       There is no minimum Federal standard for monthly visits of      foster children in State custody.     S. 3525       The legislation requires the State to update its CWS State      plan by October 1, 2007 to describe its standards for the      content and frequency of caseworker visits of foster children      in State custody, which at a minimum must ensure that      children are visited on a monthly basis and that the      caseworker visits are well-planned and focused on issues      pertinent to case planning and service delivery to ensure the      safety, permanency, and well-being of children.       The legislation also sets a minimum Federal standard      requiring each State and territory to achieve by October 1,      2011 monthly caseworker visits for at least 90 percent of      foster children in State custody, with the majority of those      visits occurring in the child's residence. Each State and      territory would be held accountable for its efforts and the      legislation prescribes a planning process to achieve this      goal. To receive FY 2008 CWS funds, States must submit to HHS      data for FY 2007 on the percentage of foster children visited      on a monthly basis by their caseworker and the percentage of      those visits that occurred in the child's residence. Based on      this data, HHS will work with each State to set target levels      for the State to meet to achieve a 90 percent monthly      visitation standard by FY 2012 and will establish these      target levels by June 30, 2008. Then, beginning in FY 2009,      States must achieve their annual goal for the percentage of      caseworker visits and the percentage of visits that occur in      the child's residence, or face an enhanced matching      requirement in order to draw down their full allotment of      Federal CWS funds. The share of non-Federal spending that is      required in a State that does not meet its visitation target      level in a year increases by a minimum of 1 percentage point,      up to a maximum of 5 percentage points, depending on the      degree to which the State has missed its target level; absent      the commitment of additional State funds, Federal funds would      be reduced to yield the modified State share of overall CWS      funding, consistent with the degree of the State's failure to      achieve its visitation target for that year.       No later than March 31, 2010, HHS must submit to the House      Committee on Ways and Means and the Senate Committee on      Finance a report that outlines the progress States have made      in meeting their caseworker visitation standards and that      offers recommendations, developed in consultation with State      administrators of child welfare programs and members of State      legislatures, to assist States in meeting this standard.     Reason for Change       Holding States accountable for achieving monthly caseworker      visits for at least 90 percent of foster children responds to      research highlighting how monthly visits lead to better      outcomes for children. HHS shall work with the States to      establish a plan to achieve this goal by FY 2012 and States      are encouraged to invest the new PSSF resources provided in      FY 2006 and later fiscal years in activities that have been      shown to be effective in achieving increased caseworker      visitation of foster children. The above accountability      measure will ensure that, even in the case of a State that      fails to fulfill its specified level of caseworker visits,      the full Federal CWS allotment to a State will remain      available so long as that State increases its State CWS      spending modestly, according to the provisions of the      legislation.     Section 8--Reauthorization of Program for Mentoring Children          of Prisoners     Current Law       The Mentoring Children of Prisoners program is administered      by HHS and makes competitive grants to support the      establishment or expansion and operation of programs that      provide mentoring services to children of prisoners.     S. 3525       The legislation reauthorizes the existing Mentoring      Children of Prisoners program through FY 2011 at such sums as      may be necessary and increases the HHS set-aside for      research, technical assistance, and evaluation from 2.5      percent to 4 percent. It authorizes a new 3-year pilot      program to provide vouchers to qualified mentoring groups to      offer services to individual children of prisoners, but      specifies both annual caps on funding for this purpose and      that at least $25 million must be available each year for      site-based grants provided under the program. The voucher      pilot program will be administered by a national group that      will work closely with HHS to manage the program with the      goal to distribute least 3,000 vouchers in the first year,      8,000 vouchers in the second year and 13,000 vouchers in the      third year. The legislation specifies that the national group      must identify in its voucher distribution plan how the group      will prioritize providing vouchers to children in areas which      have not been served under the current site-based mentoring      program. During the third year of this pilot HHS shall      provide a report based on an independent evaluation to the      House Committee on Ways and Means and the Senate Committee on      Finance on the number of children who received vouchers for      mentoring services and any conclusions regarding the voucher      pilot program's effectiveness.     Reason for Change       The continuation of the Mentoring Children of Prisoners      program will enable public and private organizations to      establish or expand projects that provide one-on-one      mentoring for children of incarcerated parents and those      recently released from prison. At the same time, children      have not been able to access mentoring services in some      States and rural areas because of the absence of a site-based      grant to provide this service. The voucher pilot program will      evaluate the effectiveness of using vouchers to expand the      delivery of mentoring services to children of prisoners,      including to children in rural and underserved areas.     Section 9--Reauthorization of the Court Improvement Program     Current Law       For each of FYs 2002 through 2006, an eligible highest      State court (with an approved application) is entitled to a      share of funds to assess and make improvements to its      handling of child welfare procedures. A set-aside of $10      million from the mandatory funds authorized and 3.3 percent      of any discretionary appropriation is provided from the PSSF      program to support the Court Improvement Program. To receive      its full allotment of these funds the court, in each of FYs      2002 through 2006, is required to provide at least 25 percent      of the expenditures for this purpose.     S. 3525       The legislation reauthorizes the funding for the Court      Improvement Program for 5 years, through FY 2011.     Reason for Change       The Court Improvement Program has played an important role      in assisting State courts in their efforts to expedite      judicial proceedings for at-risk children. The legislation      will ensure these funds continue to remain available, and is      in addition to the $100 million provided over FYs 2006      through 2010 under the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (Pub. L.      109-171) to support training and data collection efforts of      State courts.     Section 10--Requirement for Foster Care Proceedings to          Include, in an Age-Appropriate Manner, Consultation with          the Child that Is the Subject of the Proceeding     Current Law       Current law does not include a standard for consulting with      children in court proceedings.     S. 3525       The legislation requires States to assure that in any      permanency hearing held with respect to the child, including      any hearing regarding the transition of the child from foster      care to independent living, the court or administrative body      conducting the hearing consults in an age-appropriate manner      with the child regarding the plan being proposed for the      child.     Reason for Change       Each child deserves the opportunity to participate and be      consulted in any court proceeding affecting his or her      future, in an age-appropriate manner.     Section 11--Technical Amendments     Section 12--Effective Dates       The legislation will become effective on October 1, 2006,      except for provisions with other specified effective dates or      if HHS determines that a State legislature must act before      the State can comply with the changes.                          ____________________
