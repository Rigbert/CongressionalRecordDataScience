President, more than 2 months ago I joined the Chairmen of both the Senate and House Judiciary Committees, the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, the Democratic and Republican leaders of both the Senate and the House of Representatives, and Members of Congress from both parties to introduce a bill to reauthorize and reinvigorate the temporary provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The bicameral, bipartisan introduction of this bill reflects not only its historic importance as a guarantor of the right to vote for all Americans, but also the broad consensus that the expiring provisions must be extended this year without delay. Unfortunately, we in the Senate have been delayed in getting this bill to the Senate floor by repeated cancellations and postponements of committee hearings and markups. The bill was also delayed in the House of Representatives for a month by a small group of opponents. Fortunately, the House was able to pass this legislation last week with 390 Members voting in favor. Now it is time for the Senate to do its part and pass this bill.  At my request, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee has agreed to hold a special executive business session of the committee so that after a month of delay we can report out the Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks and Coretta Scott King Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006. I hope that this vital civil rights legislation will be ready for full Senate consideration without further delay and that we can proceed with deliberate speed to pass the House-passed bill so that it may become law before Congress takes its summer vacation.  The U.S. Constitution specifically provides that Congress has the power to remedy discrimination under both the fourteenth and the fifteenth amendments. Over the course of nine Judiciary Committee hearings we received testimony from a range of constitutional scholars, voting rights advocates, and Supreme Court practitioners. There was agreement among these witnesses that Congress is at the height of its powers when giving enforceable meaning to these amendments by enacting laws that address racial discrimination in connection with voting. The fourteenth and fifteenth amendments have not changed. As long as these amendments are in our Constitution, Congress has the authority to enforce them, especially on matters of racial discrimination in connection with the right to vote. These are matters of fundamental importance.  The Senate Judiciary Committee held several hearings this year on the continuing need for the provision of the Voting Rights Act that requires covered jurisdictions to ``pre-clear'' all voting changes before they go into effect. This provision has been a tremendous source of protection for the voting rights of those long discriminated against and also a great deterrent against discriminatory efforts cropping up anew. Some academic witnesses suggested in their committee testimony that section 5 should be a victim of its success. In my view, abandoning a successful deterrent just because it works defies logic and common sense. Why risk losing the gains we have made? When this Congress finds an effective and constitutional way to prevent violations of the fundamental right to vote, we should preserve it. Now is no time for backsliding.  Since section 5 of the Voting Rights Act was first enacted in 1965 and last reauthorized in 1982, the country has made tremendous progress in combating racial discrimination. Certain jurisdictions disregarded the fifteenth amendment for almost 100 years and had a history of pervasive discriminatory practices that resisted attempts at redress from the passage of the fifteenth amendment in 1870 to the passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965. Section 5 is intended to be a remedy for violations of the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments, in place for as long as necessary to enforce those amendments and eliminate practices denying or abridging the rights of minorities to participate in the political process. In fact, due in large measure to the remedies provided in the VRA, many voters in jurisdictions covered for the purposes of section 5 have gained the effective exercise of their right to vote.  However, based on the record established in hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Subcommittee on Constitution, Civil Rights, and Property Rights, which builds on the extensive record established in the House of Representatives, there remains a compelling need for section 5. The Judiciary Committee received three categories of evidence supporting the continuation of this remedy. First, there is evidence that even with section 5 in place, covered jurisdictions have continued to engage in discriminatory tactics. Often, this recurring discrimination takes on more subtle forms than in 1965 or 1982, such as vote dilution, which relies on racially polarized voting to deny the effectiveness of the votes cast by members of a particular race. Second, there is evidence of the effectiveness of section 5 as a deterrent against bad practices in covered jurisdictions. Finally, there is evidence of the prophylactic effect of section 5, preserving the gains that have been achieved against the risk of backsliding.  Today, I would like to provide some of the evidence received in the Judiciary Committee about the persistence of discriminatory practices in covered jurisdictions that supports reauthorization of this crucial provision.  The robust record compiled in the Senate Judiciary Committee includes voluminous evidence of recurring discrimination in section 5 covered jurisdictions. Often, this recurring discrimination takes on more subtle forms than in 1965 or 1982, such as vote dilution and redistricting to deny the effectiveness of the votes cast by members of a particular race. Notably, many jurisdictions are repeat offenders, continuing a pattern of persistent resistance dating back to the enactment of the VRA. Debo P. Adegbile, AssociateDirector of Litigation of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc., testified about some examples of the types of evidence in the record:  The Record before this Congress presents continued evidence of such violations, and highlights the necessity for continued review of voting changes to protect minority voters in covered jurisdictions. For example, since the VRA's 1982 renewal, violations of minority voting rights have taken the form of last minute election date or polling place changes, discrimination at the polls, and familiar dilutive tactics of ``cracking'' and ``packing'' minority voting districts.  Objections to voting changes interposed by DOJ are one category of evidence relevant to the persistence of discrimination in covered jurisdictions. Although several witnesses pointed to a recent reduction in VRA objections as a reason to oppose extension of section 5, in fact there have been more objections in covered jurisdictions since the last reauthorization in 1982--608--than there were before that reauthorization, including 80 statewide section 5 objections. However, these objections only reveal a chapter of a much longer story. Mr. Adegbile also testified:  Although many VRA opponents and commentators point to a recent reduction in DOJ objections as evidence of the decreasing need for Section 5--this analysis oversimplifies the many ways in which the law serves to protect minority voters. Excluded from the category of objection statistics are other categories of deterred and rejected voting changes. These include matters that were denied preclearance by the Washington D.C. District Court; matters that were settled while pending before that court; voting changes that were withdrawn, altered or abandoned after the DOJ made formal More Information Requests, MIRs; as well as any recognition that the very existence of preclearance deters discriminatory voting changes in the first place. Taken together, these categories provide a more holistic view of the sizeable impact, deterrent effect, and continued need for section 5's provisions. Moreover, without the section 5 preclearance provisions many jurisdictions that have experienced a long history of exclusionary practices in voting would have lacked the incentive to tailor their electoral changes in a non-discriminatory fashion. Even with section 5 in place, many covered jurisdictions made voting changes that disadvantaged minority voters without preclearing them with the DOJ.  This is the Testimony of Debo P. Adegbile, Associate Director of Litigation of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc., before the United States Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, June 21, 2006, citing generally Luis Ricardo Fraga & Maria Lizet Ocampo, More Information Requests and the Deterrent Effect of section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, June 7, 2006--unpublished essay, submitted to Senate Judiciary Committee on June 9, 2006.  The following are only a small set of examples from the robust record compiled in the Senate Judiciary Committee:                            Vote Suppression       Through the use of illegal devices, State and local      officials in covered jurisdictions have suppressed the      ability of minority voters to effectively exercise their      right to vote.       In 2001, Kilmichael, Mississippi's white mayor and all      white five-member Board of Alderman abruptly cancelled an      election after census data revealed that African Americans      had become the majority in the town and an unprecedented      number of African-American candidates were running for      office. Even after DOJ objected, concluding that the      cancellation was an attempt to suppress the African-American      candidates, the mayor and board did not reschedule the      election. Only after DOJ forced Kilmichael to hold an      election in 2003 did it elect its first African-American      mayor, along with three African-American alderman. This is      from Caroline Fredrickson and Deborah J. Vagins, Promises to      Keep: The Impact of the Voting Rights Act, March 2006, at 12.       In March, 2004, in Prairie View, Texas, home to      historically black Prairie View A&M University, two students      decided to run for the local governing body. The white      criminal district attorney threatened that any student who      voted in the election would face felony prosecution for      ``illegal voting'' and only withdrew his statements when the      NAACP filed suit. Shortly thereafter, the Commissioner's      Court voted to reduce the availability of early voting at the      polling place closest to the college from 17 hours over two      days, to 6 hours on one day. This would have severely limited      the students' political participation, as most planned to      take advantage of early voting since their spring break      coincided with the primary date. The county did not restore      the voting hours until the NAACP filed a section 5      enforcement suit. This is from Laughlin McDonald ``The Case      for Extending and Amending the Voting Rights Act,'' A Report      of the Voting Rights Project of the American Civil Liberties      Union at 65-66.       In a 2004 opinion invalidating South Dakota's redistricting      plan, a Federal district judge documented the State's long      history of discrimination, including persistent efforts to      suppress the Native American vote since 1999. The judge      documented illegal denials of the right to vote in certain      elections, barriers to voter registration, intimidation and      unsubstantiated charges of vote fraud, lack of access to      polling sites, non-compliance with the Voting Rights Act's      language assistance provision, and dilutive voting schemes.      The opinion also quoted legislators expressing prejudice      against Indians. For example, when debating an unsuccessful      bill to make it easier for Indians to register, one      legislator said, ``I'm not sure we want that kind of person      in the polling place.' '' This is from National Commission on      the Voting Rights Act, ``Protecting Minority Voters: The      Voting Rights Act at Work 1982-2005'' February 2006 at 44.       The Mayor of the Town of North Johns, AL intentionally      discriminated against African-American candidates for city      council when he frustrated the attempts of these candidates      to acquire the required forms for their candidacy and refused      to swear them in when they won their elections. The court      found that the mayor acted to undermine the candidacy of two      African-American men because their election would result in      the town council becoming majority black. This is from      Dillard v. North Johns, 717 F. Supp. 1471, M.D. Ala. 1989.                      Discriminatory Redistricting       Due to racially polarized voting, the reality in many      jurisdictions is that the ability of minorities to have the      opportunity to elect their candidate of choice is often      dependent on the racial composition of a voting district.      Consequently, the seemingly neutral task of drawing district      lines can, in fact, be used strategically to abridge      minorities' right to vote using techniques called ``packing''      where a very large percentage of minorities are placed in a      single district and thereby denying them influence except in      that one jurisdiction, or the obverse ``unpacking,'' which      fragments minority communities into numerous jurisdictions,      denying them influence anywhere.       The impact of racially polarized voting is significant. In      the 2000 elections, only 8 percent of African Americans were      elected from majority white districts. This is from National      Commission on the Voting Rights Act, ``Protecting Minority      Voters: The Voting Rights Act at Work 1982-2005'' February      2006 at 38. As of 2000, neither Hispanics nor Native      Americans candidates had been elected to office from a      majority white district. Id. This is true throughout covered      jurisdictions. Every African-American representative      currently holding office in Congress from Louisiana, or in      the Louisiana State Legislature, has been elected from a      majority African-American district. This is from Debo P.      Adegbile, ``Voting Rights in Louisiana: 1982-2006,''      RenewTheVRA.org at 9. In Mississippi, the State with the      highest percentage African-American population, not a single      African-American candidate has won election to Congress or      the state legislature from a majority-white district, and no      African-American candidate has won a statewide office in the      20th Century. This is from Robert McDuff, ``Voting Rights in      Mississippi: 1982-2006,'' RenewTheVRA.org at 13.       After failing to redistrict for over two decades, following      the 1980 and 1990 census, the city of Seguin, Texas was 60      percent Hispanic, yet only 3 out of 9 city council members      were Hispanic. After a successful section 5 challenge by      Hispanic plaintiffs, the city redrew its discriminatory      districts in 1994 and again following the 2000 census, but      cut short the filing deadlines for the upcoming elections,      ensuring that the white incumbent would run unopposed.      Another section 5 suit was necessary to prevent this change,      called by some merely de minimis even though it determined      the election's outcome, from going into effect. This is      Testimony of John Trasvina, Interim President and General      Counsel, Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund      MALDEF, before the United States Senate Judiciary Committee,      June 13, 2006, at 4.       At a 2001 section 2 hearing, while testifying in defense of      the St. Bernard Parish School Board's illegal plan to      eliminate its only African-American district, Louisiana State      Senator Lynn Dean, the highest ranking public official in St.      Bernard Parish, admitted that he uses a term considered by      many to be a derogatory, even offensive, word in referring to      African Americans, had done so recently, and does not      necessarily consider it a racial term. Dean had served on the      school board for 10 years. This is from Debo P. Adegbile,      ``Voting Rights in Louisiana: 1982-2005,'' RenewTheVRA.org at      26.       In the post-1990 redistricting cycle, the Department of      Justice objected to Georgia's Senate redistricting bill twice      and to Georgia's House redistricting bill three times. The      newly adopted plans were then challenged by litigation in      which the state admitted to constitutional violations. After     losing the lawsuit, the state claimed to remedy the problem.      However, its newly adopted plans reduced the black      populations of numerous districts, thereby drawing DOJ      objections to both plans yet again in March 1996. This is      from Robert Kengle, ``Voting Rights in Louisiana: 1982-     2006,'' RenewTheVRA.org at 14.       The 2001 legislative redistricting plan in South Dakota,      which divided the State into thirty-five legislative      districts, altered the boundaries of District 27, which      included Shannon and Todd Counties, so that American Indians      comprised 90 percent of the district, while the district was      one of the most overpopulated in the State. Had American      Indians not been ``packed'' in District 27, they could have      comprised a majority in a house district in adjacent District      26. South Dakota refused to submit the plan for pre-     clearance, leading Alfred Bone Shirt and three other      residents from Districts 26 and 27 to sue the State in      December 2001. The plaintiffs claimed that South Dakota      failed to submit its plan for pre-clearance and also that the      plan unnecessarily packed Indian voters in violation of      section 2. A 3-judge court ordered the state to seek pre-     clearance and the Attorney General pre-cleared it, concluding      that the additional packing of Indians in District 27 did not      have a retrogressive effect. However, the district court,      sitting as a single-judge court, heard the plaintiffs'      section 2 claim and invalidated the State's 2001 legislative      plan as diluting American Indian voting strength, finding      that there was ``substantial evidence that South Dakota      officially excluded Indians from voting and holding office.''      This is from Bone Shirt v. Hazeltine, 200 F. Supp. 2d 1150,      1154 D.S.D. 2002.       In 2001, the Louisiana State Legislature sought judicial      pre-clearance of its statewide redistricting plan for the      Louisiana House of Representatives, which eliminated a      majority African-American district in Orleans Parish.      According to the legislators that drew that plan, the      district was eliminated because white voters in Orleans      Parish were entitled to ``proportional representation,''      despite significant population growth among African-Americans      in Orleans Parish over the course of the prior decade.      Although the legislators ultimately dropped their selective      ``proportional representation'' argument, the court found      that the state ``blatantly violate[ed] important procedural      rules'' through its litigation tactics and condemned the      state for its ``radical mid-course revision in [its legal]      theory of the case.'' The evidence, obtained over plaintiffs'      resistance via a motion to compel, showed significant levels      of racially-polarized voting in virtually all electoral      contests, as well as retrogressive purpose and effect in the      adoption of the plan. The evidence also showed that the      Speaker Pro Tempore, who was a plaintiff in the action,      removed long-standing language from the State's redistricting      guidelines that acknowledged the State's obligations under      the VRA at the start of the line drawing cycle. The      litigation resulted in a settlement on the eve of trial that      restored the opportunity district in Orleans Parish. The 2001      Louisiana House redistricting plan followed the standard      practice in Louisiana as no initial redistricting plan for      the Louisiana House of Representatives has ever been pre-     cleared by DOJ since the inception of Voting Rights Act in      1965. This is Testimony of Richard Engstrom before the House      of Representatives, Committee on the Judiciary, Subcommittee      on the Constitution, October 25, 2005. This is also Debo      P. Adegbile, Voting Rights in Louisiana, 1982-2006, at 16.       After finding Point Coupee Parish, Louisiana's      redistricting plans retrogressive, the Department of Justice      objected 3 decades in a row: in 1983, 1992, and 2002. After      the first 2 census cycles, the parish attempted to pack      minority voters into a single district while fragmenting the      remaining African-Americans into majority-white districts. In      2002, without explanation, the parish eliminated one majority      African-American district, despite an increase in the      African-American population of the parish. Unfortunately, the      experience in Point Coupee Parish is typical in Louisiana:      ``[b]etween 1982 and 2003, 10 other parishes were ``repeat      offenders,'' and 13 times the DOJ noted that local      authorities were merely resubmitting objected-to proposals      with cosmetic or no changes.'' This is Debo P. Adegbile,      ``Voting Rights in Louisiana: 1982-2006,'' RenewTheVRA.org at      27.       In 1983, African-American legislators were excluded from      legislative sessions held to develop Louisiana's post-census      redistricting plan after negotiations stalled. The governor      had threatened to veto a proposed plan that would create one      African-American majority district and the Senate rejected      the governor's plan to create all white majority districts.      In the absence of minority legislators, a compromise--Act      20--was reached that sacrificed the majority-minority      district despite the fact that--after a marked increase in      the previous decade--the highly-concentrated African-American      population now made up 48.9 percent of the voting age      population in Orleans Parish. Act 20 was struck down by a      1982 section 2 case. The remedied district led to the      election of Louisiana's first African-American congressman      since reconstruction. This is also from Debo P. Adegbile,      ``Voting Rights in Louisiana: 1982-2006,'' RenewTheVRA.org at      16.       In 1991 and 1992, the Morehouse Parish, Louisiana, Police      Jury drew district lines in an attempt to pack African-     American voters in the city of Bastrop multiple times in      defiance of DOJ objections. After a 1991 section 5 objection      to its attempt to draw the same districting plan several      times the Morehouse Parish Police Jury made cosmetic changes      and resubmitted the same plan. After DOJ lodged another      objection, the police jury resubmitted the same plan with      only cosmetic changes. Only after DOJ objected a third time      in 1992 did the police jury address the substance of the      first objection and draw district lines that did not result      in an over-concentration of African-American voters.       In 2006, election officials in Randolph County, Georgia,      moved the board of education district lines to include Henry      Cook, the African-American chair of the board of education,      from District Five of the county board of education, which is      majority black, to District Four, which is majority white. In      District Four, Cook would almost certainly be defeated given      the prevalence of racial bloc voting in the county, depriving      the African-American community of an incumbent elected      official who had their strong support in past elections.      Although Randolph County was covered by section 5, county      officials refused to submit the change for pre-clearance.      African-American residents of the county filed suit on April      17, 2006, to enjoin use of the change absent pre-clearance.      On June 5, 2006, the 3-judge court issued an order enjoining      further use of the voting change because of failure to comply      with section 5.       In 1991, Mississippi legislators rejected proposed House      and Senate redistricting plans that would have given African-     American voters greater opportunity to elect representatives      of their choice, referring to one such alternative on the      House floor as the ``black plan'' and privately as ``the n-     plan.'' DOJ objected, concluding that a racially      discriminatory purpose was at play. In the 1992 elections,      the cured redistricting plans boosted the percentage of      African-American representatives in the legislature to an all      time high: 27 percent of the House and 19 percent of the      Senate--up from 13 percent and 4 percent respectively in a      state where 33 percent of the voting age population is      African-American. This is Robert McDuff, ``Voting Rights in      Mississippi: 1982-2006,'' RenewTheVRA.org at 9-10.       In late 2001, Northampton County, VA proposed a change in      the method of electing the board of supervisors by collapsing      six districts into three larger districts. The DOJ objected,      finding that three of the six districts were majority-     minority districts in which African-American voters regularly      elected their candidates of choice. The new plan would have      diluted the minority-majorities and caused them to completely      disappear in 2 of the 3 new districts--clearly having      retrogressive effects. Two years later, the county provided a      new 6-district plan, which had the same retrogressive effects      of the 3-district plan. DOJ objected and provided a model      non-retrogressive, 6-district plan, which has yet to be      followed by the county. This from Anita S. Earls, Kara      Millonzi, Oni Seliski, and Torrey Dixon, ``Voting Rights in      Virginia, 1982-2006,'' RenewTheVRA.org at 27-28.       In 1989, in section 2 suit, a Federal district court      knocked down Chickasaw County, Mississippi, illegal plan to      have all majority-white supervisors' districts. Sent back to      the drawing board, the county then passed 3 different plans      over the next 6 years. Not one passed section 5 pre-     clearance. Finally, the Federal court drew its own plan for      the 1995 elections, providing for 2 majority-black districts      to reflect a population that was nearly 40 percent black.      Only then did the county adopt a plan that met no objection      by the Department of Justice. This is Robert McDuff, ``Voting      Rights in Mississippi: 1982-2006,'' RenewTheVRA.org at 6.       In 1992, DOJ objected to a Justice of the Peace and      Constable redistricting plan in Galveston County, Texas, that      fractured geographically compact African-American and      Hispanic voters and provided no opportunity districts among      the 8 districts in the plan, even though African Americans      and Hispanic comprised 31 percent of the county's population.      This is from Nina Perales, Luis Figueroa and Criselda G.      Rivas, ``Voting Rights in Texas, 1982-2006'',      RenewTheVRA.org, at 17-18.       In 1992, DOJ objected to the Terrell County Commissioners      Court redistricting plan. Although the Hispanic population in      the county had increased from 43 percent to 53 percent, the      proposed redistricting plan cracked the Hispanic population      by substantially decreasing the number of Hispanic voters in      one of the two Hispanic majority districts and packing      them into the other to create a district with an 83      percent Hispanic district. This is from Nina Perales, Luis      Figueroa and Criselda G. Rivas, ``Voting Rights in Texas,      1982-2006,'' RenewTheVRA.org, at 19.       In 2005, DOJ objected to the redistricting plan for the      Town of Delhi, LA, which eliminated an African-American      opportunity district, rejected an alternative plan which      would have been better for minority voters, and was adopted      with the intent to worsen the position of minority voters.      According to the 2000 Census, Delhi's population was majority      African-American, yet local officials attempted to reduce      minority voting strength in the town. DOJ denied pre-     clearance after determining that town officials sought to      worsen the position of minority voters by looking first to      the historical background of the city's decision, which      revealed that the plan was adopted despite steadily      increasing growth in the town's African-American population.      In its April 25, 2005, objection letter, DOJ stated,      ``[w]ithout     question, Black voters are worse off under the proposed      plan,'' which was adopted despite the counsel of the Town's      demographer, who noted the retrogressive effect of the plan.      This is from a Letter from R. Alexander Acosta, Assistant      Attorney General, Civil Rights Division, U.S. Department of      Justice, to Mr. David Creed, Executive Director, North Delta      Regional Planning and Development District, April 25, 2005.       In 1992, the Department of Justice objected to Florida's      redistricting plan for the State Senate, observing that      ``[w]ith regard to the Hillsborough County area, the State      has chosen to draw its senatorial districts such that there      are no districts in which minority persons constitute a      majority of the voting age population. To accomplish this      result, the State chose to divide the politically cohesive      minority populations in the Tampa and St. Petersburg areas.''      This is from JoNel Newman, ``Voting Rights in Florida, 1982-     2006'', RenewTheVRA.org, at 9.       The Department of Justice interposed an objection to the      2002 redistricting plan for the Florida House of      Representatives, stating that the plan reduced ``the ability      of Collier County Hispanic voters to elect their candidate of      choice [and] the drop in Hispanic population in the proposed      district would make it impossible for these Hispanic voters      to continue to do so.'' As a result of the Department's      Section 5 objection to the 2002 reapportionment plan,      Hispanic majority-minority district was preserved in Collier      County. This is JoNel Newman, ``Voting Rights in Florida,      1982-2006,'' RenewTheVRA.org, at 10.       In 2002, the Department of Justice objected to Arizona's      state legislative redistricting plan because it fractured      Hispanic voters and reduced Hispanic voting age population in      5 districts below their 1994 benchmarks, despite the growth      of the State's Hispanic population and the ability to draw      three compact majority-Hispanic districts. The State court      responded by accepting an interim plan recommended by a      Special Master that restored one district to its benchmark      level and created 2 new Hispanic-majority districts in      metropolitan Phoenix to replace some of the other four      majority Hispanic-majority districts that had been      eliminated.       In 1991, Hispanic plaintiffs and Monterrey County,      California, which was 33.6 percent Hispanic, reached a      settlement plan which, unlike Monterrey's initial plan, did      not dilute the vote of the county's Hispanic population.      However, after voters struck down the county's redistricting      plan in a required referendum petition, the county issued a      new plan to which the Justice Department objected under      section 5, stating that the County's plan ``. . . appears      deliberately to sacrifice Federal redistricting requirements,      including a fair recognition of Hispanic voting strength, in      order to advance the political interests of the non-minority      residents of northern Monterey County.'' Subsequently, the      district court adopted the plaintiffs' plan. As a result of      the implementation of the plaintiffs' plan, a Hispanic was      elected to the Board of Supervisors for the first time in      over 100 years. This is Gonzalez v. Monterey County 808      F.Supp. 727, 729 (N.D. Cal. 1992); Joaquin G. Avila,      California State Report on Voting Discrimination (forthcoming      May 25, 2006, manuscript at 9.       After the 1990 census, Merced County, CA, adopted a      redistricting plan that ignored the presence of its growing      Hispanic population which at the time constituted 32.6      percent. In doing so, the county disregarded its      demographer's recommendation to create a supervisor district      with a Hispanic majority and instead chose a plan that      fragmented the county's Hispanic population. The Justice      Department issued an objection rejecting the county's      redistricting plan because the plan fragmented the Hispanic      population. Following the objection, the county created a new      redistricting plan that both avoided the fragmentation of the      county's Hispanic population and created a supervisory      district with a Hispanic majority. The plan was later      approved and a Hispanic Supervisor elected. This is Joaquin      G. Avila, California State Report on Voting Discrimination,      forthcoming May 25, 2006, manuscript at 11.                  Discriminatory Polling Place Changes       Another method used in covered jurisdictions to deny      minorities the right to vote has been to move or even      eliminate polling places, often without notice. Moving a      polling place can appear to have little impact or importance,      but the record demonstrates that these changes have been used      systematically to deny minorities their constitutional right      to vote by injecting intimidation and confusion into the      electoral process.       Some have cited polling place changes as ``de minimis''      changes for which there should be an exception to section 5      pre-clearance. However, making such an exeception could lead      to substantial violations of minority voting rights. As      Robert McDuff, a civil rights attorney in Mississippi who has      worked on preclearance testified, ``polling place changes can      be retrogressive and should not be dismissed as per se de      minimis. With section 5 preclearance requests the context is      critical and DOJ has an expertise in assessing the context.''      Robert McDuff, Answers to Written Questions from Senator      Coburn. The following examples demonstrate that far from      being ``de minimis,'' polling place changes can be one of the      most effective means of denying minorities the right to vote.       In 1992, the Attorney General objected to a proposal by the      Wrightsville, GA, to relocate the polling place from the      county courthouse to the American Legion Hall, an all-white      club with a history of refusing membership to black      applicants and a then-current practice of hosting      functions to which blacks were not welcome. This is      Laughlin McDonald ``The Case for Extending and Amending      the Voting Rights Act,'' A Report of the Voting Rights      Project of the American Civil Liberties Union at 333, 334.       In 1995, Jenkins Parish, LA, attempted to relocate a      polling place from a predominately black community easily      accessible to many voters by foot to a location outside the      city limits in a predominately white neighborhood which had      no sidewalks, curving roads, and a speed limit of 55 mph. The      Attorney General rejected the change, concluding, ``the      county's proffered reasons for the selection of this      particular polling site appear to be pretextual, as the      selection of this location appears to be designed, in part,      to thwart recent black political participation.'' This is      Deval L. Patrick, Assistant Attorney General, to William E.      Woodrum, Jenkins County Attorney, March 20, 1995.       In 1985, the Apache County Board of Supervisors proposed to      eliminate the last remaining polling place on Arizona's Fort      Apache Reservation, reduce the daily hours of operation for      those voting stations that remained open, and implement a      rotating polling place system that would make it even harder      for Navajo voters to reach the polls. Yet, absentee voting      opportunities were not provided to Indian voters. Pointing to      the clear discriminatory purpose and effect of the proposed      changes, the Department of Justice objected. This is James      Thomas Tucker and Rodolfo Espino, ``Voting Rights in Arizona      1982-2006,'' RenewtheVRA.org, 46, 2006.       In 1994, after receiving word that whites were      uncomfortable walking into an African-American neighborhood      to vote at the Sunset Community Center, the St. Landry      Parish, LA, Police Jury moved the polling place to the Sunset      Town Hall, the site of historical racial discrimination. The      police jury did not hold a public hearing, seek any further      input, or advertise the change in any way. If not for the      section 5 pre-clearance process, minority voters would not      have known of the change until Election Day. This is Debo P.      Adegbile, ``Voting Rights in Louisiana, 1982-2006,''      RenewtheVRA.org, at 31.       In 1999, after the Davills Precinct polling center burned      down and the County Board of Supervisors of Dinwiddie County,      Virginia, moved the polling place to the Cut Bank Hunt Club,      privately owned with a large African-American membership, one      hundred and five citizens submitted their signatures to have      the precinct moved to the Mansons United Methodist Church,      located three miles southeast of the Hunt Club. The      petition's stated purpose for moving the precinct was for a      ``more central location.'' Before the board's meeting to      discuss moving the polling place, the Mansons United      Methodist Church withdrew its name as a possible location.      The board then placed an advertisement for a public hearing      on changing the polling place which stated that if any      ``suitable centrally located location [could] be found prior      to July 15, 1999,'' they would consider moving it there. On      July 12, 1999, the Bott Memorial Presbyterian Church members      offered their facilities for polling. On August 4, 1999, the      board approved changing the polling place to Bott Memorial      Presbyterian Church. The church is located at the extreme      east end of the precinct, however, and 1990 Census data      showed that a significant portion of the black population      resides in the western end of the precinct.       DOJ objected to the change, finding that the polling place      was moved for discriminatory reasons. This is a Letter from      Bill Lann Lee, Acting Assistant Attorney General, Civil      Rights Division, U.S. DOJ., to Benjamin W. Emerson of Sands,      Anderson, Marks & Miller, October 27, 1999.                          Methods of Elections       Officials have used their authority to set the methods of      elections as ways to abridge or even deny the ability of      minority citizens to vote and elect candidates of their      choice. The following are examples of the use of at-large      election systems, dual registration systems and other methods      since the last reauthorization of section 5.       In 1995, the State of Mississippi resurrected a form of the      dual registration system, which a Federal district court had      struck down less than a decade earlier as racially      discriminatory in intent and effect. Mississippi then refused      to submit its voting procedures for pre-clearance until      ordered to do so by the U.S. Supreme Court. Under the      unlawful system, voters who registered pursuant to the      National Voter Registration Act, NVRA, would only be eligible      to vote in federal elections, but not in State and local      elections. The majority of voters registered under the NVRA      were African-American. In addition, while one state      department provided its mostly-African-American public      assistance clientele with only the NVRA registration forms,      another department registered its mostly-white driver's      license applicants through the state forms, which enabled      them to vote in all elections. In its objection letter, DOJ      noted the state had merely breathed new life into the dual      registration system originally enacted by Mississippi in the      19th Century with an aim to eliminate the African-American      vote. This is Robert McDuff, ``Voting Rights in Mississippi:      1982-2006,'' RenewTheVRA.org at 16.       In 1992, Effingham County, Georgia proposed an at-large      election system despite anticipating that, due to racially      polarized voting, after the change, African-Americans would      no longer be able to elect the commissioner who would serve      as chairperson. This decision came on the heels of the      county's decision to eliminate the position of vice-     chairperson, long held by an African-American commissioner.      The county's justification for the change--that the proposed      system would avoid tie votes in the selection of a      chairperson--was tenuous at best because under the new      system, an even number of commissioners would invite tie      votes to a greater extent than the existing system. This is      Robert Kengle, ``Voting Rights in Georgia: 1982-2006,''      RenewTheVRA.org at 9-10.       Ten years after a successful lawsuit that forced the      adoption of single-member districts in the city of Freeport,      TX, minority candidates had gained two seats on the city      council. The City then sought to revert to at-large      elections, garnering an objection from the Department of      Justice. Similarly, the Haskill Consolidated Independent      School District sought to revert to at-large voting after      significant gains by minority populations.       After the Washington Parish, Louisiana, School Board      finally added a second majority-African American district in      1993, bringing the total to 2 out of 8, representing an      African American population of 32 percent, it immediately      created a new at-large seat to ensure that no white incumbent      would lose his or her seat and to reduce the impact of the      two African American members, to 2 out of 9. The      Department of Justice objected to this change. (See Letter      from James P. Turner, Assistant Attorney General, Civil      Rights Division, U.S. DOJ, to Sherri Marcus Morris,      Assistant Attorney General, State of Louisiana, and Jerald      N. Jones, City of Shreveport, September 11, 1995, cited in      Debo Adegbile, Voting Rights in Louisiana: 1982-2006,      February 2006, at 21.)       A Federal district court found that the at-large method of      electing the nine member Charleston County Council in South      Carolina violated section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. In      particular, the court found evidence of white bloc voting and      concluded that in 10 general elections involving African-     American candidates, ``white and minority voters were      polarized 100 percent of the time.'' The court also noted      that there was a history of discrimination that hindered the      present ability of minority voters to participate in the      political process; significant socio-economic disparities      along racial lines; a negligible history of African-American      electoral success; and significant evidence of intimidation      and harassment of African-American voters at the polls.      Following the court's decision, which was affirmed on appeal,      a single-member district plan was put in place with four      majority African-American districts that eventually led to      the election of four African Americans to the County Council.      This is Laughlin McDonald ``The Case for Extending and      Amending the Voting Rights Act,'' A Report of the Voting      Rights Project of the American Civil Liberties Union at 591-     592.       In 2005, a three-judge Federal court enjoined the city of      McComb, MS, from enforcing a State court order it had      obtained that removed an African-American member of that      city's board of selectmen from his seat by changing the      requirements for holding that office, holding that the order      clearly altered the pre-existing practice. The court ordered      the selectman restored to his office and enjoined the city      from enforcing the change unless preclearance was obtained.      This is Robert McDuff, ``Voting Rights in Mississippi: 1982-     2006,'' RenewTheVRA.org at 8.       In 1991 the Concordia Parish Police Jury in Louisiana      announced that it would reduce its size from 9 seats to 7,      with the intended consequence of eliminating one African-     American district, claiming the reduction was necessary as a      cost-saving measure. However, DOJ noted in its objection that      the parish had seen no need to save money by eliminating      districts until an influx of African-American residents      transformed the district in question from a majority-white      district into a majority African-American district. This is      Debo P. Adegbile, ``Voting Rights in Louisiana: 1982-2006,''      RenewTheVRA.org at 24.                              Annexations       The following are examples from the record where      jurisdictions changed their boundaries in order to diminish      the voting power of minorities by selectively changing the      racial composition of a district. Numerous jurisdictions have      annexed neighboring white suburbs in order to preserve white      majorities or electoral power.       In 1990, the city of Monroe, LA attempted to annex white      suburban wards to its city court jurisdiction. In its      objection, DOJ noted that the wards in question had been      eligible for annexation since 1970, but that there had been      no interest in annexing them until just after the first-ever      African-American candidate ran for Monroe city court. This is      Debo P. Adegbile, ``Voting Rights in Louisiana: 1982-2006,''      RenewTheVRA.org at 24.       Pleasant Grove, Alabama was an all-white city with a long      history of discrimination, located in an otherwise racially      mixed part of Alabama. The city sought pre-clearance for two      annexations, one for an area of white residents who wanted to      attend the all-white Pleasant Grove school district instead      of the desegregated Jefferson County school district, the      other for a parcel of land that was uninhabited at the time      but where the city planned to build upper income housing that      would likely be inhabited by whites only. At the same time,      the city refused to annex to two predominantly black areas.      The United States Supreme Court upheld the District Court's      denial of pre-clearance. This is from City of Pleasant Grove      v. United States, 479 U.S. 462, 1987.       In 2003, the Department of Justice interposed an objection      to a proposed annexation in the Town of North, SC, because      the town had ``been racially selective in its response to      both formal and informal annexation requests.'' DOJ found      that ``white petitioners have no difficulty in annexing their      property to the town'' while ``town officials provide little,      if any, information or assistance to black petitioners and      often fail to respond to their requests, whether formal or      informal, with the result that the annexation efforts of      black persons fail.'' Though the town argued that no formal      attempts had been made by African-Americans to be annexed      into the town, DOJ's investigation revealed that at least one      petition had been signed by a significant number of African-     American residents who sought annexation. The fact that the      town ignored or was non-responsive to the requests of      African-Americans, while accommodating the requests of      whites, led DOJ to determine that race was ``an overriding      factor in how the town responds to annexation requests.''      This is a Letter from R. Alexander Acosta, Assistant Attorney      General, Civil Rights Division, U.S. Department of Justice,      to H. Bruce Buckheister, Mayor, North, SC, September 16,      2003.                          ____________________
