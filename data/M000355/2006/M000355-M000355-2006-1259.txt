 President, it has been my distinct pleasure to be either the ranking member of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee or the chairman with my good friend Pat Leahy. Part of what Senate etiquette tells us is we are supposed to refer to each other as ``my good friend,'' but in the case of Pat Leahy, it is not only Senate etiquette but it is the case that he has become a good friend.  Twelve thousand votes is quite an accomplishment, but beyond that, I have enjoyed the spirit of bipartisanship with which we have pursued each Foreign Operations Appropriations bill for each of the last 14 years, whether he was chairman or I was chairman. We tried to develop the expenditures of the Federal Government in a way that made sense for America and also had an impact on the rest of the world.  The majority leader has mentioned the landmine crusade Senator Leahy has led for a long time. He is indeed known around the world for that. It has been an extraordinary crusade. He deserves enormous credit for leading it and is widely known around the world for that.  I thank him for his extraordinary service over the last 14 years in which I have been associated with him. It has been a pleasure to work with him every year. I, too, wish him 12,000 more votes.  I yield the floor.
