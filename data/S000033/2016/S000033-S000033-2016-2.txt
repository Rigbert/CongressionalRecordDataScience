 President, two points. First of all, let me reiterate that is for inflation-adjusted dollars, not nominal dollars. The funding for the National Institutes of Health this year will still be roughly $7 billion less than what it received in 2004. That is point No. 1.  Point No. 2--and I will yield briefly to my friend from Missouri--did I hear him say that he is supportive of reimportation and having the Federal Government--Medicare--negotiate prescription drug prices with the pharmaceutical industry? That is what I thought I heard him say.  I yield to my friend.
