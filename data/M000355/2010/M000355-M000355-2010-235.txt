 President, I would say to my good friend from Iowa, the majority leader and I have been working on a package of nominations. Unfortunately, we are snagged over one particular nomination which has already been defeated by the Senate, and that was the nomination of Craig Becker to be on the NLRB. The President then recessed Mr. Becker and recessed a Democratic nomination to the NLRB but not a Republican nominee to theNLRB. There is a fundamental lack of equity and fairness involved, and that has been a significant hindrance in coming to a consent agreement.  Obviously, before we leave we will clear the military nominations. Those are really not in dispute. But typically what happens here before a recess, the majority leader and I get together and we try to work out as many of these as we can. To just clear the whole calendar involves, in addition, clearing judges who just got out of committee this week. We have a way that we sequence those who have been acceptable to both sides.  In short, I have not seen every single name on the list of the Senator from Iowa, but it is simply not the way we are going to go forward, certainly not this evening.  Accordingly, I would now ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session to consider en bloc the following list of nominations that I will send to the desk. This is a list of approximately 60 nominations from the Executive Calendar.  I further ask unanimous consent that the nominations be confirmed en bloc, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate resume legislative session.
