  During World War II we had millions of men and women who not only worked in the assembly lines, they were fighting all over the world against fascism. This budget makes significant cuts in veterans' programs. The bill passed by the House Committee on the Budget would, over a 7-year period, reduce veterans' programs by $8.3 billion. The Senate Committee on the Budget, in fact, would reduce veterans' benefits by $15.1 billion.  Among other cuts would be an increase in the prescription drug copayment from $2 to $8. The House bill would also reduce the COLA on veterans' compensation. It would also eliminate the Veterans' Employment Program under the Job Partnership Training Act; the disabled outreach program. Boy, we are getting really tough.
