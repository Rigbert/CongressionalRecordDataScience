I wish to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the Town of Boothbay, ME. Boothbay was built with a spirit of determination and resiliency that still guides the community today, and this is a time to celebrate the generations of hard-working and caring people who have made it such a wonderful place to live, work, and raise families.  The year of Boothbay's incorporation, 1764, was but one milestone in a long journey of progress, a journey that is inextricably linked to the sea. For thousands of years the Boothbay Peninsula was a fishing grounds of the Etchemin Tribe, and the extensive shell middens and other archeological sites are today a treasure trove of this ancient history.  Drawn by one of the finest natural harbors in New England, English settlement began within a few years of the Pilgrims landing at Plymouth in 1620. The early English influence is underscored by the fact that some of the first deeds granted to the settlers were signed by the Etchemin Sagamore, who was called Chief Robinhood by the newcomers. By 1764, Boothbay was a growing town with an economy driven byfishing, shipbuilding, and tidal-powered sawmills. The wealth produced by the sea and by hard work was invested in schools and churches to create a true community.  Boothbay was a vital center for revolutionary activity during America's fight for independence. The strategic importance of the harbor put the small town under frequent enemy attack, and more than 100 patriots rose to its defense. During the war Captain Paul Reed established himself as one of our young nation's ablest and most courageous naval commanders. The Reverend John Murray was an eloquent and fearless voice for freedom, and his powerful words called many to its cause.  In the decades that followed, Boothbay became a place of industry and innovation with such endeavors as fish processing, canning, and fish-oil production. During the 1830s, Boothbay's bracing sea breezes and crystal-clear waters made it an early health spa, and by the end of the 19th century the town became a favorite destination for vacationers and summer residents.  Today the people of Boothbay continue to build on those traditions. Fishing and lobstering are mainstays of the economy. Fine hotels, inns, and restaurants support a thriving tourism industry. Boatyards build luxury yachts, fishing boats, and advanced vessels for military and law-enforcement purposes. Since its founding in 1974, the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences has become a global leader in oceanographic research. Lobster boat races, the annual Windjammer Days, and the Fishermen's Festival celebrate the town's maritime heritage, and the restored Opera House provides a beautiful venue for arts and entertainment.  This 250th anniversary is not just about something that is measured in calendar years. It is about human accomplishment, an occasion to celebrate the people who for more than two and a half centuries have pulled together, cared for one another, and built a community. Thanks to those who came before, Boothbay has a wonderful history. Thanks to those who are there today, it has a bright future.                          ____________________
