President, for the information of our colleagues, I thought I would describe how we are going to be proceeding today. Shortly, the President pro tempore, who is the comanager of the bill, will be making his opening statement. It is my understanding he will then move to lay down an amendment offered by Senator DeMint and a substitute amendment offered by Senator Inouye relating to the WARN Act, which is a Commerce Committee bill. We will not be voting on that amendment today, it is my understanding, under the agreement that has been previously reached.  We are open for business on other amendments for Members who may come to the floor or Members who wish to speak on this bill.  Thank you, Mr. President.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
