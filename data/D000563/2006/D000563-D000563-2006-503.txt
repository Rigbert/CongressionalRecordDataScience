We spelled out what we had in mind, that the Iraqis would take on more responsibility for their own fate and their own future, that the United States troops would be able to start withdrawing and coming home in this year of 2006. I ask the Democratic leader, as he joins with me each morning reading about how Iraq is descending into a civil war, the number of innocent civilians who are being killed in Iraq, and the number of American troops who continue to lose their lives in Iraq, when we voted for significant transition in Iraq, is this what we had in mind?
