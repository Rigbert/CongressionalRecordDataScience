President, with all due respect to my friend from Oklahoma, several days ago Senator Hatch and I were told that we could speak on the floor at 2:15. So I ask unanimous consent that I can speak as in morning business, that I will be followed by Senator Hatch, and in deference to our friend from Oklahoma, who makes a very good point, that this time be charged postcloture.
