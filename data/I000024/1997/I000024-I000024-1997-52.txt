The dropout rate is a problem. I will read a couple of things that I think are significant.  One of the mothers, named Voni Eason, said:       My son loves the school. He even likes the uniform. He      feels like he's a grown man. Without an education--and a      good, strong education--he's not going to have a job. Without      the Washington Scholarship Fund, he wouldn't be able to go to      his school.  That is a mother making a testimonial.  Tanya Odemns' son actually tried the public schools system in Washington, DC. She said:       My son wasn't learning anything. He didn't know his ABCs,      didn't know how to spell his name . . . public school didn't      give him any homework. I know my son is very intelligent and      wants to learn. When I heard about the Washington Scholarship      Fund, I just hopped on it real quick. [Now] he's excited when      he comes home, wants to do homework.  Mr. President, it has been tried and it is successful. It works.  I yield the floor.
