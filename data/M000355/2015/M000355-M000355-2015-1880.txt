 There are up to 18 rollcall votes scheduled this afternoon on pending amendments to the bill. I want to commend Chairman Murkowski and Senator Cantwell for working with our colleagues to get literally dozens and dozens of amendments up and voted on in the 3 weeks we have been working on this bill.  Now it is time to get through the remaining amendments and vote up or down on passage of this bill before we leave for the week.                          ____________________
