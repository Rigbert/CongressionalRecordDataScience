President, earlier today the President of the United States went back to school. He went to a local high school in the DC area to give a speech. It turned out that this speech became controversial.  I thought about that over the weekend because my wife and I went down to Mount Vernon, in Virginia, to the home of George Washington. It was a trip I promised my wife because the first time we went down there when I was a college student and drove down there in my little VW bug back in the 1960s, I got there to find out I did not have enough money for admission so we had to turn around and leave. I always told her: Loretta, we are going toget back down here someday. It took a few years, but we made it.  Touring the grounds there as well as the education and learning center, learning a little bit more about our first President, you realize what an opportunity he had to define the institution of the Presidency. One of the first things they asked of George Washington, the first President, was: What do we call you? Your Excellency? Your Highness? He said: Just call me Mr. President.  His decision at that moment created a tradition, not just a formal tradition of how we address the President of the United States, but, more importantly, a tradition of how we view the President of the United States. He is not royalty nor is he to be treated as royalty. He is to be treated as another American, but one who at this moment in time, by the will of the American people, serves in the highest office in the land. So George Washington established a standard, a standard of respect but not awe, when it comes to the office of President.  I thought of that over the years. In my lifetime there have been Presidents I genuinely admired, their politics and personalities, and others I was more critical of, but I always believed the office deserved respect whoever occupies that office. If you believe in this form of government and you believe in this Nation, the election to that office at the least--at the least--should gather the respect that each American owes to the office.  This President announced he wanted to speak to the schoolchildren of America today on what is roughly the first day of school across our Nation. He was not the first President to make that suggestion. President Ronald Reagan offered a speech to the schoolchildren of America; President George Herbert Walker Bush the same. I can't recall any controversy associated with the addresses by either of those previous Presidents, but for reasons I cannot understand, critics came forward criticizing President Obama for wanting to speak to our schoolchildren. Even in my home State of Illinois, the President's home State, some school districts made a conscious decision that they would not broadcast or make available the President's speech. Others allowed children to opt out if their parents didn't want them to hear the President's speech.  I think that is unfortunate. It is unfortunate and I am happy to say there are those of both political parties who said that. Senator Lamar Alexander, from Tennessee, a Republican, was just on the floor--a former Secretary of Education, former Presidential candidate. He spoke out and said of course the President should be allowed to speak to schoolchildren across America. Laura Bush, the former First Lady, said that this morning. Others have said the same.  I think they understand two things: first, respect for the institution of the Presidency, and, second, the fact that the President speaking may have some impact on young people across America. The President gave his speech. I hope his critics have been silenced because, as a parent and now as a grandparent, as I read his speech I would like every kid in America to hear it. He explained his own background and the tough times he went through growing up, the sacrifices made by his single mom, the fact that his father left at an early age, the fact that education became an important part of their lives even as they traveled around the world.  Barack, now President Obama, used to tell the story here in the Senate of his mother waking him up early in the morning when he lived overseas and saying: Let's get ready for school. When he would whine and cry about 5:30 in the morning and he is doing homework, his mom would say: It's no picnic for me either, buddy. She was a parent who cared, a mother who cared, and he a son who profited and benefited from her caring.  When I read his speech and elements of it today, I am glad the President spoke these words to the students of Virginia, and those school districts that decided their children should not hear this ought to stop and reflect on whether that was the right decision. When the President says:       But at the end of the day, the circumstances of your life--     what you look like, where you come from, how much money you      have, what you've got going on at home--that's no excuse for      neglecting your homework or having a bad attitude. That's no      excuse for talking back to your teacher, or cutting class, or      dropping out of school. That's no excuse for not trying.      Where you are right now doesn't have to determine where      you'll end up.  The President said:       No one's written your destiny for you. Here in America, you      write your own destiny. You make your own future.  He talked to these students not only about doing their homework and reading, getting involved in extracurricular activities, volunteering in their community, deciding to     . . . stand up for kids who are being teased or bullied      because of who they are or how they look, because you      believe, like I do, that all kids deserve a safe environment      to study and learn.  The President went on to say:       No one is born being good at things. You become good at      things through hard work.  And then he said:       And even when you're struggling, even when you're      discouraged, and you feel like other people have given up on      you--don't ever give up on yourself. Because when you give up      on yourself, you give up on your country.       The story of America isn't about people who quit when      things got tough. It's about people who kept going, who tried      harder, who loved their country too much to do anything less      than their best.  That speech by President Obama to the schoolchildren of America was a positive thing. It was a good thing. Some said it was a way to promote his socialist agenda, it was political propaganda. I find nothing political about these comments. This is good advice to any child, any student across this country, and I am glad the President took this opportunity to use whatever influence he has over these young people to guide them in the right path as they start out in their school year.                          ____________________
