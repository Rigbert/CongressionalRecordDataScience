Speaker, this has been a long day, and somehow we knew last night that this nightmare would not go away when daybreak came this morning. This has been a long day, particularly for those families that have lost a loved one, and also for the emergency personnel, friends, and neighbors. This has been a long day for America, as we come to grips with this attack on America and the values that we hold so dearly.  I spoke earlier this afternoon with a family in my district whose son, Brad, worked on the 93rd floor of the World Trade Center. Their news was no news, no word, no good.  As we struggle with our grief and pray for those families, we are reminded that this is a country that stands for freedom and justice, and, yes, we will prevail. We stand here tonight united behind our Nation's efforts to seek swift justice. We will find all the people who orchestrated and participated in this evil web. I have no doubts. These mass murderers, wherever they are, will be identified and, yes, justice will be served.  Tonight I participated, like thousands of Americans, in a prayer vigil, and I said a prayer for Brad. I asked for a miracle to save him and so many others like him.  I say to our fellow citizens across the country, thank you. Thank you for your prayers for us, for the leaders of this country, and the so many public servants. They are appreciated, and they help right the mayhem to lift us all.  Yes, we are united. We are the United States of America.  God bless America.
