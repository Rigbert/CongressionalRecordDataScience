President, I rise today to submit a resolution commending the Georges Bank review panel on the recent extension of the moratorium on oil and gas exploration on Georges Bank and urging our Canadian neighbors to adopt a longer-term moratorium that would match that adopted by the United States.  Georges Bank is a large shallow bank on the Outer Continental Shelf of the eastern North American continent. Georges Bank, which separates the Gulf of Maine from the open Atlantic Ocean, is traditionally known as one of the most productive fishing grounds in the world. Fishing vessels from New England and Canada catch cod, haddock, yellowtail flounder, scallops, lobsters, swordfish, herring, and bluefin tuna in its waters. Literally hundreds of communities depend upon fish from Georges Bank for their way of life and livelihood.  In 1984, the United States-Canadian boundary dispute involving ownership of Georges Bank was resolved by the International Court of Justice at The Hague. The Court declared the northeastern portion of the bank as under Canadian jurisdiction and the southwestern portion as under the jurisdiction of the United States. Since that decision, both the United States and Canada have maintained a moratorium on oil and gas exploration on Georges Bank.  In 1998, the United States extended its moratorium until the year 2012.  In 1988, with the adoption of the Canada-Nova Scotia Accord Acts, Canada placed a moratorium on petroleum activities on Georges Bank until January 1, 2000. In preparation for the expiration of that moratorium, a three-person review panel held an extensive public comment period, commissioned studies, and thoroughly explored the pros and cons of allowing oil and gas activity on the Canadian portion of Georges Bank. Last month, at the conclusion of its review, the panel recommended that the moratorium on petroleum activities on Georges Bank be continued, but it did not specify a date.  I certainly respect the fact that Canada is entitled to make its own mineral management decisions. Nevertheless, given the joint jurisdiction that the United States and Canada have over Georges Bank, I believe it is appropriate for this body to convey its concern and support for the unique ecosystem and fisheries of Georges Bank. An accident involving a petroleum spill on either side of the line could have a devastating impact on fisheries well up and down the coast from Nova Scotia and New Brunswick to the coast of New England.  The severe weather in and the vast expanse of Georges Bank far from shore would greatly complicate any effort to clean up any spill that could occur. Indeed, even if a spill never occurred, the lubricants used in drilling could well have a toxic impact on Georges Bank's delicate fisheries.  Fishermen from Canada and the United States are subject to strict regulations governing fishing on Georges Bank. These regulations are designed to allow fish stocks to recover after years of overfishing. They have involved considerable sacrifices for the fishermen who depend on Georges Bank to make a living. But the sacrifices are paying off, and the fish stocks are recovering. It would be a shame to set back or to reverse completely those hard-won recovery efforts with even the risk of a major oil spill.  The resolution I am submitting today encourages the Government of Canada to accept the recommendations of its review panel. It also goes further by asking our neighbor to the north to extend its drilling moratorium until the year 2012 to match the American moratorium. In that way, both Canadians and Americans may be assured that Georges Bank will remain in its traditional uses.                          ____________________
