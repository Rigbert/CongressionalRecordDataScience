 President, I rise to ask if the chairman can clarify for me whether this bill includes a provision that provides the ``brownfields'' benefits for supplemental empowerment zones.  As a former mayor, I am very committed to promoting economic growth in our urban area. The ``brownfields'' provision will be significant in the City of Los Angeles' effort to turn abandoned, vacant or underutilized industrial or commercial properties back into productive use. Can the chairman confirm that, under the Senate tax bill, brownfields remediation incentives are also extended to supplemental empowerment zones?  Mr. Roth. Yes, the committee bill extends the brownfields benefits to supplemental zones as well. Section 768(c)(2) of the bill, entitled ``Expensing of Environmental Remediation Costs,'' extends the brownfields benefits to supplemental zones designated after December 21, 1994, which confers the benefits to the supplemental zones of Los Angeles and Cleveland, OH.
