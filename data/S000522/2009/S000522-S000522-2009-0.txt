Mr. Speaker, Chairman Berman's Iran Refined Petroleum Sanctions Act, cosponsored by the ranking member, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, significantly ratchets up strong bipartisan pressure on Iran to end their nefarious quest for nuclear weapons.  Given Ahmadinejad's extreme hostility toward Israel, his outrageous threats to annihilate Israel from the face of the Earth, and his obsessive hatred of Jews worldwide, this bill strengthens penalties on those who not only sell, lease, or provide to Iran any goods, services, technology, information, or support that would allow Iran to maintain or expand its domestic production of refined petroleum resources, it has other sanctions as well.  Mr. Speaker, any serious effort to peacefully stop Iran from acquiring weapons of mass destruction, which I believe they will use if they acquire them, requires the strongest political and economic pressure that we can muster. H.R. 2194 is a step, the right step in that direction.
