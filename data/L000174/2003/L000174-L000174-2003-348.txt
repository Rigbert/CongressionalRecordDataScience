President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts. It is interesting that we are in this debate. We are told we want to finish the Energy bill, yet we have been talking about everything but energy. We have a number of judicial nominations that have been brought up that are obviously controversial, obviously not ripe for debate. That takes time. At the same time, we have ignored a number of judicial nominations that could have been voted on in a series of 10-minute rollcall votes had the leadership wanted that.  Maybe they don't really want to finish the Energy bill before the recess. Or perhaps, as we now read in the paper, the White House has ordered Republican leadership to have four cloture votes, a very busy week.  When I came here and when the distinguished Presiding Officer, my friend from Alaska, and the very highly respected President pro tempore, we tended to be more independent around here, independent of the White House.
