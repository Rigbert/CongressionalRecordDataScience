President, I ask unanimous consent that the scheduled cloture vote be vitiated and, further, that at 9:30 tomorrow morning the Senate resume consideration of the Leavitt nomination and there then be 60 minutes equally divided between the chairman and the ranking member or their designees, with 20 minutes of the minority time under the control of Senator Lautenberg. I further ask consent that following that debate, the Senate proceed to a vote on the confirmation of the nomination, with no intervening action or debate, provided that following that vote, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action and the Senate then resume legislative session.  I also ask unanimous consent that this evening at 5:30 the Senate proceed to a vote on the confirmation of Calendar No. 424, the nomination of Dale Fischer to be U.S. District Judge for the Central District of California; further, that following that vote the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action and the Senate then resume legislative session.
