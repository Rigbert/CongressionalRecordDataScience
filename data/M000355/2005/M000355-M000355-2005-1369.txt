 President, tomorrow, following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of the highway bill. We will then have 60 minutes for debate before the cloture vote on the pending substitute. It is my hope that cloture will be invoked so we can move closer toward completing our work on this important legislation. Following the vote, we will continue working through whatever amendments are left. A number of amendments have indeed been filed, and Senators who wish to offer amendments should contact the managers at once. Senators should expect rollcall votes throughout the day in relation to amendments to the bill.  Again, it is our intention to complete action on this important legislation this week. Senators should expect busy days for the remainder of the week and are certainly asked to plan accordingly.                          ____________________
