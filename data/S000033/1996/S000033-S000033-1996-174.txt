 Speaker, for the benefit of my colleagues I would like to have printed in the Record this statement by Kevin Gannon, a high school student from Brattleboro, VT. Kevin was speaking at my recent town meeting on issues facing young people.                           (By Kevin Gannon)       Years ago when someone wanted to tell you not to waste a      resource, you might have said, ``Hey, it doesn't grow on      trees.'' Today, you don't have to be a tree-hugger to see the      irony in that. Century-old forests are disappearing, and      dwindling timber isn't our only environmental concerns when      it comes to building materials. Landfills are fast becoming      ``landfulls,'' and countless other resources are either      becoming scarce or are hazardous to process.       But now a new generation of building products offers      alternatives, and as concern grows about the environment a      vanguard of builders [and] architects * * * around the      country are setting new standards for resource-efficient home      construction. Housing developments for conservation-conscious      consumers (as shown on the poster) are being built around the      country. To identify resource-efficient building material,      you must ask the following questions: Do the products use      virgin resources efficiently? Do they make reasonable use of      recycled materials? Will they offer high quality durability      over the life of the house, and will they help ease      pollution?       Engineered wood products can use as little as half the wood      fiber of sawed lumber, while delivering superior performance.      Made from wood chips and veneers, they help to preserve large      trees and reduce demand for timber * * * Laminated veneer is      now taking the place of massive beams. The latest efforts in      manufacturing engineered lumber focus on making better use of      fast-growing trees and combining them with adhesives that      don't emit toxic, ureaformaldehyde * * * [Another]      corporation makes a product * * * which uses cotton fiber.      Since most paper comes from fast-growing pulpwood trees,      reusing it in wallboard won't spare many big, slow-growing      species; but there are other products that might. One is a      floor-sheeting panel from the Belcom Technologies. The panels      only need support at their corners, minimizing the number      needed. On a national level, that's hundreds of thousands of      joists--or trees--spared.       If you really want to save wood, use steel. Using steel      studs in your next framing job could reduce the amount of      wood used in a house by up to 50%. Two-thirds of the steel      that goes into structural components comes from building and      bridge demolition, auto and industrial scrap. However, if for      some reason steel framing doesn't appeal to you, you can buy      some * * * double-dipped zinc-coated storm-guard nails [made]      exclusively from remelted steel.       Recycled glass bottles have become a prime source in      fiberglass insulation, but an Indiana corporation has found a      constructive use for scrap automotive glass; in fact, 70% of      its new traffic tiles come from automotive glass      manufacturing waste. CTE Glass Products makes * * * ceramic      floor tiles with waste from its lightbulb manufacturing      division.       There are many ways to recycle wood. In San Jose, CA, New      World Lumber rescues discarded redwood from the Gualdalupe      landfill; after planing off the weathered surfaces, it      assembles short sections between deducted rails to make      fence-board, or they slice longer pieces into lattice. The      firm also plans to make 24"-wide fence panels.       Building structures to last longer is another responsible      approach to building. In the '90's, inexpensive materials at      this point don't lend themselves to that. Cheap building      materials can also pose health hazards; for example,      inexpensive particle-board releases ureaformaldehyde in your      home.       Time allowing, I would speak all day about this topic.       Congressman Sanders: Kevin, that was a very thoughtful      presentation. Can I ask you a very brief question? What      impact do you think your ideas would have on the economy in      terms of creating jobs, and what kind of jobs might be      created?       Answer. Well, right now the remodeling business alone is a      $2 billion industry; that's just remodeling, not even      construction, which is multi-billion. And one of my ideas is      to create jobs. Subsidized housing is a problem in America,      and if we could use recycled resources, I think we could kind      of kill two birds with one stone.       Congressman Sanders: So you think this idea could put      people to work.       Answer. Oh, definitely.       Congressman Sanders: Good, Kevin, thank you very much.                          ____________________
