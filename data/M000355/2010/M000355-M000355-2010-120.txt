 President, I had the opportunity to hear the distinguished Senator from Maine, a few moments ago, speak on the measure before us and how it has seemed to become completely enmeshed in the political agenda of the other side. I commend her for her efforts to get this bill right. Senator LeMieux was on the floor earlier, another one of our colleagues on the Republican side who worked long and hard to get this bill across the finish line.  But I must say, it takes a lot of effort to make a partisan issue out of a bill that should have broad bipartisan support. You have to go out of your way, as Senator Snowe pointed out, to make a small business bill controversial, but our friends on the other side have managed to pull it off.
