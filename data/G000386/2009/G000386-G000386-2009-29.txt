 My inquiry will be whether the pending amendment, which everyone agrees is critical to the health care reform legislation before us, complies with Senate rule XLIV.  Senate rule XLIV was adopted as part of major ethics and government reform legislation. It was passed in 2007. Its title was the ``Honest Leadership and Open Government Act.'' The Democratic leadership made it the first bill introduced when they took over the majority in 2007. It enjoyed broad bipartisan support. I wish the reform had been tougher. The part of the legislation that became Senate rule XLIV dealt with the transparency of earmarks. They are technically defined as ``limited tax benefits'' and ``congressionally directed spending items.''  Rule XLIV applies to floor amendments such as the pending managers' amendment. Rule XLIV requires the sponsor of the amendment--in this case, Senator Reid--to provide a list of these narrow provisions. Senator Reid has not provided the list. We received the several-hundred-page amendment yesterday morning. Republican staff have performed a preliminary review. That review finds that some items might--I repeat, might--be limited tax benefits. There are press reports about narrowly crafted exceptions to the insurance fee.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of the Dow Jones article dated December 19, 2009.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                       [From Dow Jones Newswires]  Senator Nelson Wins Tax Carve-Out for Mutual of Omaha in Health Bill                          (By Martin Vaughan)       Washington (Dow Jones)--Insurance giant Mutual of Omaha      will see less of a hit from a $10 billion-a-year industry-     wide tax on health insurance providers, under the terms of a      deal worked out between Senate Democratic leaders and Sen.      Ben Nelson (D., Neb.).       Under revised Senate health legislation unveiled Saturday      by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D., Nev.), the tax on      insurers will begin in 2011 at $2 billion a year, eventually      rising to $10 billion annually. The tax is to be divided up      based on each company's market share.       Senate aides who reviewed the legislation said provisions      in the revised bill are specifically crafted to protect      Nebraska insurers, including Mutual of Omaha.       The tax carve-out appears to be one of several concessions      Nelson won from Democratic leaders before agreeing to add his      vote, the final one needed to secure passage in the Senate,      to the healthcare measure.       ``The biggest issue for us was abortion,'' said Jake      Thompson, a Nelson spokesman. ``But Sen. Nelson also wanted      to ensure that Nebraskans won't face increased premiums as a      result of a fee that was going to be imposed.''       Nelson inserted a provision that will carve out      supplemental Medicare insurance from that tax. That provision      will benefit Mutual of Omaha, but also other insurers that      offer so-called Medigap policies, Thompson said.       Nelson also won support for a provision ensuring that      Nebraska won't have to foot any costs for new Medicaid      enrollees. That is important because the Senate bill expands      Medicaid eligibility, potentially increasing costs for many      states under a cost-sharing system with the federal      government.       Most other states will be required to pick up between 5%      and 18% of coverage costs for new Medicaid enrollees, with      the federal government picking up the remainder.       The revised bill introduced by Reid also carves out non-     profit insurers that meet certain criteria, especially in      Nebraska and Michigan, from the new industry-wide tax.       ``Several states had unique circumstances, and [Reid]      thought it was appropriate to provide a narrow exemption from      the fee for a couple of states that had unique      circumstances,'' a Senate Democratic aide said in a      conference call with reporters.       ``Nebraska also had circumstances that necessitated the      relief,'' the aide said, without elaborating.       ``This legislation is good for our country and good for      Nebraska,'' Nelson said in announcing his support for the      healthcare bill Saturday.       One provision in the bill is narrowly tailored to apply to      Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Nebraska, Nelson's spokesman said.      It says that a company that is a mutual insurance company and      had a market share in a state of between 40% and 60% in 2008      would be exempt from the tax.       Senate transparency rules enacted after Democrats took over      the chamber in 2006 discourage narrowly crafted tax breaks,      also called tax earmarks. Senators are required when offering      amendments that include such provisions to publish a list in      the Congressional Record, and the amendments could be subject      to procedural objections.       The Senate GOP aide said that carving one insurance      provider out of the tax could put it at a distinct advantage      with respect to competitors. The Joint Tax Committee has      estimated that the tax could result in increased premiums to      consumers of between 1% and 1.5%.       ``If one company is protected from that fee, you're talking      about a significant pricing differential,'' the aide said.
