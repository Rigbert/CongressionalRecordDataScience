 President, I rise today to introduce the Long-Term Care and Retirement Security Act. This legislation, which I sponsored in the 106th Congress with my distinguished colleague from Florida, Senator Bob Graham, would ease the tremendous cost of long-term care.  The bill that Senator Graham and I are re-introducing today would allow individuals a tax deduction for the cost of long-term care insurance premiums. Increasingly, Americans are interested in private long-term care insurance to pay for nursing home stays, assisted living, home health aides, and other services. However, most people find the policies unaffordable. The younger the person, the lower the insurance premium, yet most people aren't ready to buy a policy until retirement. A deduction would encourage more people to buy long-term care insurance.  Our proposal also would give individuals or their care givers a $3,000 tax credit to help cover their long-term care expenses. This would apply to those who have been certified by a doctor as needing help with at least three activities of daily living, such as needing help with at least three activities of daily living, such as eating, bathing or dressing. This credit would help care givers pay for medical supplies, nursing care and any other expenses of caring for family members with disabilities.  The Van Zee family of Otley, Iowa, typifies many families who would benefit from his legislation. Renee Van Zee at 55 years old has early onset Alzheimer's disease. Three years after her diagnosis, she can't feed, bathe or dress herself. Her daughter, Leanna, and her husband, Albert, are pulling out all the stops to keep Mrs. Van Zee out of a nursing home. They care for her full-time. They've found some services through Medicaid and Medicare and received a donated hospital bed. Even so, caring for Mrs. Van Zee is difficult. She can't be left alone at any time. The family's network of services is piecemeal, like that of many families in similar straits. Those services could change with any change in their circumstances. The family bears considerable out-of-pocket expenses for Mrs. Van Zee's nutritional supplements. The supplements cost $4.96 for a four-pack of cans. Mrs. Van Zee consumes two or three cans a day. It's obvious how this situation affects a family's finances. Working adults quit their jobs to care for a loved one, and take on a host of new expenses at the same time.  The Long-Term Care and Retirement Security Act would help the 22 million family caregivers like the Van Zees. A $3,000 tax credit would help to pay for Mrs. Van Zee's nutritional supplements or hire an extra nurse. The legislation also would help families like the Van Zees buy long-term care insurance. Someone like Mrs. Van Zee could have bought herself insurance years ago, had it been an affordable option for her.  As it did last year, the bill that Senator Graham and I are introducing today has been endorsed by both the AARP and the Health Insurance Association of America. A companion bill sponsored by Representatives Nancy Johnson, Karen Thurman, and Earl Pomeroy is pending in the House of Representatives.  An aging nation has no time to waste in preparing for long-term care, and the need to help people afford long-term care is more pressing than ever. I look forward to working with Senator Graham and our colleagues in the Senate to get our bill passed into law as soon as possible.                                 ______                                       By
