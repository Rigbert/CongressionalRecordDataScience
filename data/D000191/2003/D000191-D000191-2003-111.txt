Chairman, reclaiming my time, I thank the gentleman for that point. Unfortunately, Utah is only one State in the western United States that would be subject to these proposals. There are a number of other States. There is not, to the best of my knowledge, a memorandum of understanding with Oregon, Washington, Montana, Wyoming, Nevada, California, or other areas. And I think that we should not depend upon MOUs, but we should legislate in these areas.
