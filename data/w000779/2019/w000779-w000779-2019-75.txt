President, Social Security provides vital benefits to millions of Americans who work and pay into the system with each paycheck. Because Social Security is fundamental to workers' retirement security, the law protected benefits from creditors. The only exceptions were unpaid Federal taxes, child support or alimony payments, and court-ordered victim restitution. These protections ensured that the social safety net programs would be there for basic needs. That protection was weakened over 20 years ago when the law was changed. Now, more and more seniors face cuts in their Social Security benefits because of student loan debts. The Wall Street Journal recently highlighted the issue with an article titled, ``Over 60, and Crushed by Student Loan Debt.'' We need to take action to restore the strong protections to Social Security and other benefit programs.  We now realize what a profound effect the loss of these protections has had on retirees and individuals with disabilities, who often live on fixed incomes. More and more seniors and people with disabilities are having their Social Security and other lifeline benefits taken away to pay Federal debts. For example, according to recent data from the U.S. Bureau of Fiscal Service, over 167,000 Americans had their benefits garnished for student loan debt. Those 167,000 had nearly $200 million garnished from their earned benefits. This is just the tip of the iceberg as more Americans start receiving benefits. Between 2008 and 2018, the number of individuals whose Social Security benefits were offset to pay student loans debt increased by 133 percent, from about 72,000 to 169,000. Over that same period, the amount collected from Social Security benefits ballooned from almost $63 million to nearly $200 million, a 217 percent increase.  Social Security plays a critical role in keeping seniors and people with disabilities out of poverty. In Oregon alone, Social Security cuts the poverty rate of the elderly from about 35 percent to 5 percent. However, despite Social Security's critical role in the safety net, close to 1 out of every 10 seniors over age 65 and 1 in 5 disabled workers still live in poverty and that is simply unacceptable.  I, along with Senators Brown, Whitehouse, Leahy, Warren, Hirano, Sanders, Gillibrand, Merkley, and Schatz are reintroducing the Protection of Social Security Benefits Restoration Act. The bill would restore the strong protections in the law that prevented the government from taking earned benefits to pay Federal non-tax debts, and help ensure beneficiaries will be able to maintain a basic standard of living. The bill is supported by AARP, the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, National Association of Disability Representatives, AFL-CIO, National Organization of Social Security Claimants' Representatives, Social Security Works, National Organization for Women, Justice in Aging, American Federation of Teachers, Alliance for Retired Americans, Economic Policy Institute.  I ask Unanimous Consent that a letter from the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare endorsing our bill be printed in the Record.                                                     May 15, 2019.     Hon. Ron Wyden,     Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Wyden: On behalf of the millions of members      and supporters of the National Committee to Preserve Social      Security and Medicare, I write to endorse your bill the      ``Protection of Social Security Benefits Restoration Act.''       Since the inception of the Social Security program in 1935,      the Social Security Act provided strong protections against      loss of retirement income through the garnishment or      attachment of Social Security benefits for the purpose of      recovering debts owed by retirees. For decades the law      provided near iron-clad protection against impoverishment in      old age due to debt collection.       Unfortunately, in 1996 the Congress reversed course by      authorizing the garnishment of Social Security and other      earned benefits for the purpose of collecting debts owed by      seniors to the federal government. Figuring prominently in      this matter is the recovery of student loan debts from      seniors who are living on their all-too-modest monthly Social      Security benefits.       With student loan debt becoming an increasingly serious      problem in this country, we agree with you that now is the      time to act. The Congress must restore the historic      protections that once were provided by Social Security      against the spectacle of impoverishment in old age so that      the federal government can collect debts that all too often      were incurred years, even decades ago.       For these reasons, the National Committee endorses your      bill, the ``Protection of Social Security Benefits      Restoration Act,'' and urges other members of the United      States Senate to cosponsor this vitally important measure. We      thank you for your leadership on this matter and look forward      to working with you to enact this bill.           Sincerely,     Max Richtman,       President and CEO, National Committee to Preserve Social      Security and Medicare.
