 President, I rise today to speak about legislation that my colleague from Washington, Congressman Doc Hastings, and I are introducing to name the soon-to-be-opened Community-Based Outpatient Clinic in Wenatchee, WA, after Elwood ``Bud'' Link. Bud provided both the inspiration and the energy necessary to make this project a reality, thereby fulfilling a longstanding and serious need for his community.  Bud, a World War II veteran and an active member of Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 10445, recognized the need for better, more accessible veteran medical services for those veterans living in north central Washington. Like countless others, Bud suffered from health problems attributed to his service in the Navy, where he bravely served aboard the USS Tracy escorting convoys throughout the South Pacific and protecting medical personnel after the deployment of the atomic bomb.  When Bud returned to the States, he, like so many other veterans, relied on the VA for health care. In order to receive the necessary treatment from the VA, however, Bud was forced to make a 3-hour drive in each direction to the VA medical center nearest to his home.  Realizing that this was the case for veterans all over his community, Bud, his wife of over 50 years, Helen, and his fellow VFW Post 10445 members, helped by the American Legion and other veteran service organizations, mobilized the community to work toward the creation of a new, more accessible outpatient veteran center.  I was proud to contribute to this effort. After several years of hard work, I stood with Congressman Doc Hastings at the Cashmere VFW hall on March 20, 2006 to announce the VA's final decision to create the Community-Based Outpatient Clinic in Wenatchee, WA.  Although Bud sadly passed away before this exciting announcement was made, the creation of this facility in Wenatchee represents the culmination of Bud and his fellow veterans' efforts to make veterans' medical care more accessible and, in turn, to hold the Federal Government accountable for fulfilling its promises to the veteran community.  Bud dedicated his time and energy to addressing this and other veteran needs as an advocate, a leader, and a concerned citizen. Due in large part to Bud's work, the new CBOC, set to serve six counties in north central Washington, is likely to make over 25,000 visits by veterans more accessible next year.  Bud's life of service and activism, coupled with this final victory, reaffirms a valuable lesson for all Americans: even a single citizen can see a problem and fix it.  Bud Link dedicated his time and energy to helping other veterans, and now that the clinic he fought for is going to open, we have a chance to honor his lifetime of service. My bill will ensure that Bud's efforts and good example will not be forgotten, but rather, that the new CBOC will carry on Bud's legacy.  I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the work that Bud Link and his fellow veterans have done to make this new CBOC a reality.                                 ______                                       By
