President, I want to add my voice to the growing chorus in Washington condemning the State Peace and Development Council's brutal and inhumane treatment of the people of Burma--including refugees and internally displaced persons.  We recently heard from the senior Senator from Kentucky, Senator McConnell, who has been a consistent, strong voice for human rights and democracy in Burma. He spoke of the many abuses committed by the SPDC and his concerns that the SPDC's proclaimed interest for reconciliation with the legitimate leaders of Burma--led by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and the National League for Democracy--ring hollow.  I am in complete agreement with his assessment.  It is past time for the SPDC and its armed forces to respect the human rights and dignity of the people of Burma and to punish those in the military who are responsible for killing and injuring innocent men, women and children.  I was appalled to learn this week that Burma Army Column Commander Khin Mau Kyi, who is reportedly responsible for burning churches and villages and torturing pastors and Buddhist monks, said. ``I don't respect any religion, my religion is the trigger of my gun.''  Mr. President, Khin Mau Kyi's so-called ``religion'' is, according to information I have received, responsible for the murder of the following people at Htee Law Belh on April 28, 2002: Saw Hto Paw, Naw Hsar Kay, Naw Kri Htoo, Naw Ble Po, 5 years old, Daw Htwe Ye, Naw Mu Tha, Mu Pwat Pwat, 7 year old, Saw Ka Pru Moo, Naw Plah, 5 years old, Naw Dah Baw 2 years old, and Naw Pi Lay and her infant.  The State Department should publicly condemn the SPDC for these atrocities, and call on the SPDC to investigate these crimes and bring those responsible to justice. Unfortunately, there is no reason to believe the SPDC will act against its own officers.  We and the international community should do our utmost to provide assistance to the SPDC's victims. In the days to come, I will confer with my friend from Kentucky on appropriate actions we can take to help refugees and internally displaced persons in Burma, including engagement with Thailand to ensure that Burmese fleeing SPDC abuses can enter into Thailand, that international journalists are given free and unfettered access to refugee camps and ethnic minorities, and the UN High Commissioner For Refugees is allowed to provide a safe haven for those fleeing SPDC oppression.                          ____________________
