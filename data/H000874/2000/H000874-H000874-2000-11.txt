Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time.  Mr. Speaker, I want to respond to my friend the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Linder) about omissions, about some things that are not in the House or not in the Senate bills.  I would say to my friend, there are commissions and omissions, and we believe there is an omission. There is an opportunity to do the right thing. There is an opportunity to right a wrong. There is an opportunity to correct a mistake made by the Congress of the United States. To not do so when one has the opportunity to do it is, I suggest to my friend from Georgia, an omission and, in addition to that, a grievous omission.  This provision has been talked about for months now. It is called Latino fairness. But as the gentleman from Oregon so correctly observed, it is for fairness for everybody.  I want to tell my colleagues why I rise on this floor and feel so strongly about this provision. The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wolf) is on the floor. I am glad he is on the floor. He and I, during the 1980's, were members of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Helsinki Commission. And we are still members of that. And one of the things that we fought shoulder to shoulder to do in the 1980's was to ensure that families would be together, that families would be unified.  The issue there was whether or not the Soviet Union was going to allow individuals out of the Soviet Union to unite with their families. The issue here is whether the United States is going to force people out of the United States to become disunited from their families and whether or not we will provide for greater unification of families from throughout Central and South America in a fair way.                              {time}  1400  There ought to be a resounding ``yes'' to that question. There ought to be a resounding ``no'' as the gentleman from Oregon says to this rule so that we cannot commit the omission which has been so grievously perpetrated in this bill.
