President, I will be very brief. As I look around, there is only one person on this floor who has served longer than I have and that is the Senator from Alaska. I know the difficulties--both he and I have gone back and forth, sometimes one is chairman, sometimes the other is, on different committees--how difficult it is to keep a major bill going through. I understand his concern in doing it.
