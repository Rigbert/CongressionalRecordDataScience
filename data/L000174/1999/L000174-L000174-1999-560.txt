As I had assured my friend from Utah over the weekend, I and my staff have spent a lot of time talking to Democratic Members, and we have cut out a number of amendments.  I do want to see this bill completed. I do want a good juvenile justice bill. Also, I want to get us on to Y2K, as the distinguished Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, said he is in favor of the Y2K bill. He is in favor of going immediately, after juvenile justice, to the Y2K bill.  The distinguished majority leader is absolutely right in what he said about the supplemental. I suspect--I have not talked with Senator Stevens and Senator Byrd--that is going to go fairly rapidly.  We are going to have our caucus luncheons. The distinguished Senator from North Carolina wishes to begin a series of justly-deserved tributes to the admiral. I ask the distinguished leader if he would withdraw for now the unanimous consent agreement, let us work during our caucus luncheons with other Members to try to get this up so we can accommodate both the Republican and Democratic side, get amendments voted up or down, and get the bill voted up or down.
