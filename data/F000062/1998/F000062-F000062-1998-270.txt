''  The Juvenile Diabetes Foundation International, the Diabetes Research Foundation, I ask unanimous consent that letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                       Juvenile Diabetes Foundation International,                             The Diabetes Research Foundation,                                                 February 9, 1998.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: On behalf of the Juvenile Diabetes      Foundation International (JDFI), we urge you to vote ``no''      on a motion to invoke cloture and proceed to consider S.      1601, a bill to ban human cloning. This vote is scheduled to      come before the Senate on Tuesday, February 10.       We want to be clear: there is no acceptable moral or      ethical justification for making a replica of another human      being. As currently drafted, however, S. 1601 threatens to      restrict future promising stem cell research which could lead      to improved treatments or even a cure for diabetes and many      other serious, chronic illnesses.       Diabetes affects approximately 16 million Americans and is      a leading chronic disease in children. In addition to its      severe human impact, diabetes costs about $137 billion per      year in direct and indirect expenses. Therefore, it is      critical that any federal policies affecting medical research      are crafted so that they do not unnecessarily restrict the      potential for promising future advances in diabetes research.       In the case of type 1, or juvenile, diabetes, the beta      cells of the pancreas which produce insulin are destroyed.      Promising stem cell research could make it possible to      produce pancreatic beta cells that could then be transplanted      into a person with diabetes. As a consequence, a person with      type 1 diabetes would be free of the up to eight daily blood      tests and up to six daily insulin injections that so      significantly reduce the quality of life. More importantly,      this type of cell transplantation could eliminate the      horrible complications of the disease which include: kidney      failure; blindness; amputation; increased risk of heart      disease and stroke; and premature death.       For these reasons, JDFI urges you to vote ``no'' on the      cloture motion for S. 1601, thereby allowing the Senate to      conduct a more thorough debate on this issue. We need to      better understand the impact that legislation in this area      could have on research critical to improving the lives of      people with devastating illness. In order to ensure medical      progress and the attainment of future opportunities, we urge      you to proceed cautiously.           Sincerely,     Robert Levine, MD,       Chairman, Government Relations Committee.     James E. Mulvihill, DMD,       President and CEO, Juvenile Diabetes Foundation      International.
