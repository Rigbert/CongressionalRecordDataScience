  Let me say to all of my colleagues, particularly those on my side of the aisle who share the view of the majority leadership and myself on this issue, this motion to table is a meaningless vote and should reflect that fact. Consequently, I urge all of my colleagues to vote against tabling on behalf of the majority leader, Senator Bennett, and myself.  I yield the floor.
