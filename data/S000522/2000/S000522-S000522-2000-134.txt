Mr. Speaker, let me just begin by thanking the gentleman from California (Mr. Rohrabacher) for his excellent piece of legislation, which tells the truth about the ongoing repression in Vietnam.  Today, Mr. Speaker, I want to share some observations from a human rights fact-finding mission I made in December to Saigon. The principal purpose of the trip was to inspect the new refugee processing program, which, as most of my colleagues know, has recently moved from Bangkok to our new U.S. Consulate in Saigon.  As I think many of my colleagues know as well, I am very pleased to have been the sponsor, the prime author, of comprehensive foreign policy legislation, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000 and 2001, which became law last November.  That bill provided for an extension of the McCain amendment on Vietnamese refugee children through fiscal year 2001, along with an expansion of the amendment to cover the so-called co-residency cases.  The new law also included very important language making clear that our refugee programs in Vietnam should be far more than a token effort. We made that clear in all kinds of cases. For example, with the Montagnards who were turned down because they kept fighting the Communists after 1975, with reeducation camp survivors whose refugee applications were denied because they were afraid to talk in front of government-hired interpreters, with former U.S. Government employees who were turned down for no good reason at all, and with people who have suffered recent persecution for their political or religious beliefs, we need to be far more generous than we have been in the past.  It is too early, Mr. Speaker, to know whether or not our Saigon refugee program will live up to those expectations, which is the clear meaning and intent of the law. But I promise, as Chairman of the Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights, to keep my eye on the ball and to keep pushing hard for it.  In addition to focusing on the refugee programs, Mr. Speaker, we also focused heavily on the human rights issues, democracy, and transparency in Vietnam, which we have also done in our subcommittee over the last several years.  I met with Dr. Nguyen Dan Que, who--like the great Professor Hoat, who is now in this country--is a courageous and brilliant former prisoner of conscience. He is now under virtual house arrest, however, in Saigon. Hisphone is tapped. His Internet connections have been cut off. He and members of his family are followed wherever they go.  Notwithstanding the fact that I had a Government thug following me wherever I went, Dr. Que invited us into his home and gave us a fascinating lecture on the future prospects for reform and democracy in Vietnam.  He explained, for example, that the principal contradiction in Vietnamese society is not between North and South, not between traditionalism and modernity, but between the Politburo and everybody else in the country.  We also met with religious leaders, including Archbishop Man, Father Chan Tin, and members of the Hoa Hao Buddhist Church. And we met with Montagnard students, some of whom are Protestants who have been forbidden to have prayer meetings in their country.  Unfortunately, on the advice of Ambassador Peterson, we were unable to meet with the leaders of the Unified Buddhist Church, who have come in for some of the most brutal treatment of all. The ambassador felt the time was not right. The next trip, I can assure my colleagues, we will meet with them. But we have continued to raise their issues, as well.  One thing that was very clear from all of our conversations with human rights advocates, religious figures, and ordinary Vietnamese was that international pressure does indeed work.  For example, Dr. Que pointed out that while trade may bring some reforms to Vietnam, these reforms will come quicker if the United States strongly uses each economic concession, especially the prospect of a bilateral trade agreement, as leverage to require immediate progress on human rights.  If anyone doubts that economic leverage works to change the behavior of the Vietnamese Government, these doubts should be resolved by the experience of the ROVR program.  In mid-1996, the Vietnamese Government promised that if the 20,000 or so people who were eligible for ROVR would return to Vietnam, the U.S. would be able to interview them for refugee resettlement in the U.S.  Eighteen months after making this promise, the Vietnamese Government had let us interview only a few hundred of the 20,000 people. But when it was made clear to them that they would not get a waiver of the Jackson-Vanik amendment, which would be necessary to allow subsidized loans under the U.S. Export-Import and OPIC programs, they allowed us to start interviewing people almost immediately.  We eventually got 18,000 people to freedom under the ROVR program. So linkage to economic issues does work.  Let me also focus on a couple of human rights issues. As the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos) said so eloquently, the Vietnamese Government must stop imprisoning people for their political or religious beliefs. They must release all prisoners of conscience that they currently hold.                              {time}  1100  Hanoi insists that it has no political or religious prisoners, only ordinary law breakers. When visiting, American delegations like my own point out that these law breakers include Catholic priests and Buddhist monks. When we raise these issues, they say that these people have been imprisoned for such crimes as activities to overthrow the government, which is utter nonsense, or using freedom and democracy to injure the national unity, whatever that means.  Vietnamese officials cheerfully remind visitors that they have a ``different system.'' They need to be persuaded that if they are going to do business with us they have to abide by internationally recognized norms regarding human rights.  The Vietnamese government must eliminate other gross human rights violations such as its two-child-per-couple policy, which deprives the parents of unauthorized children of employment and other government benefits.  It must grant workers the right to organize independent trade unions and stop the practice of forced labor. It has to stop jamming Radio Free Asia, which tries to bring the Vietnamese people the kind of broadcasting they would provide for themselves if their government would allow freedom of expression.  Mr. Speaker, I would submit for the Record an excellent article written by Le Van Tien on ``Vietnam's Failed Revolution.'' It was in the Asian Wall Street Journal on April 28, 2000.          [From the Wall Street Journal, Fri., Apr. 28, 2000]                   Vietnam's Failed Revolution . . .                            (By Le Van Tien)     We are marching to Saigon.     We are entering the city.     We are liberating the South.       This was the song I heard the National Liberation Front      soldiers singing as they marched behind the North Vietnamese      tanks that rolled into Saigon on April 30, 1975. Later the      lyrics were taught to children, who sang them      enthusiastically enough. Say what you will about the      Communists, they have always understood that children love      parades.       In the years just after the unification of Vietnam, even as      many South Vietnamese were either fleeing in boats or being      sent to prison or ``re-education,'' others--particularly      young people--were willing to join the Communists in efforts      to rebuild the country. Many were even willing to fight and      die in the wars against Cambodia and China.       Yet 25 years later most of the survivors can barely      remember the songs they used to sing about the revolution.      For those of us who were imprisoned or forced into exile, it      is tempting to judge the revolution by our own standards. It      is more instructive, however, to judge a movement by the      extent to which it has met its own goals. Life in Vietnam has      indeed changed in many ways since 1975, but not in any of the      ways promised by the revolution.       Vietnam was never a rich country, but now it is one of the      poorest in the world, with a per capita GDP of about $300.      Teachers make $20 per month, construction workers about $30,      medical doctors $35. Of the 37 million working-age      Vietnamese, only 7 million have stable jobs, almost all in      government or in state-owned enterprises. The remaining 30      million are seasonal workers employed for 200 days or less      per years.       Almost everyone in Vietnam is struggling for survival day      by day, and almost everyone blames the government--especially      corruption in government. It is no accident that people in      rural areas are the poorest of all (according to the World      Bank, about 45% of Vietnamese farmers live below the poverty      line) because these are the areas where government is most      corrupt and has the greatest power over people's lives.       Despite the harsh measures taken by the Vietnamese      government against those who openly express their displeasure      with government policies, there have been periodic      demonstrations and even uprisings among rural people      protesting corruption and oppression.       In 1989, several hundred people from villages in the Mekong      Delta traveled to Saigon, now called Ho Chi Minh City, to      demand improved conditions in the countryside. These      demonstrations were partly motivated by resentment at      continued North Vietnamese domination of the South, but in      the early 1990s there were riots in three provinces in      Central Vietnam, in an area known as the ``cradle of the      revolution.''       These events culminated in 1997 in Thai Binh, a northern      province noted for the unusually high percentage of      enthusiastic Communists among its people, in which thousands      of peasants and farmers detained armed public security      officers and demanded an end to confiscatory taxes,      corruption, and other official abuses. Even a group of high-     ranking Army officers from Thai Binh openly announced that      ``the Communist party has succeeded in abolishing the old      regime in which man exploited man, only to replace it with a      regime in which the Party itself exploits the people.'' Many      of the Thai Binh demonstrators were sent to prison or re-     education, but the government also dismissed about 50      officials including the head of the provincial People's      Committee.       The poor living conditions of the farmers and the working      class contrast sharply with the lifestyle of many Communist      cadres, government officials, and executives in state-owned      enterprises. They can afford conspicuous consumption not      because of their salaries, but because of their far larger      income from official corruption. In recent years, the      government itself has recognized that corruption is at the      heart of its problems, strangling the economy and scaring      away foreign investors.       In mid-1999 General Secretary Le Kha Phieu announced a two-     year campaign of ``self-criticism.'' The campaign is intended      to end bribery, extortion, smuggling, and other corrupt      practices, in order to win the confidence of the people and      also of foreign investors. These investors were initially      attracted by the official policies of economic ``renovation''      and ``openness'' announced in the early 1990s, but they have      been discouraged not only by the burdens of corruption and      hyperregulation, but also by the consequent decline in      economic growth rates from about 8% annually to just over 4%.      Most ominously, many are frighted by the prospect of      political instability as a consequence of the steady erosion      of the government's legitimacy.       The Vietnamese government seems to understand that it is in      danger of losing its grip on power. It has been quietly      advised by scholars, international financial institutions     and representatives of other governments that it must act to      regain the trust of the Vietnamese people. The most obvious      way to do this would be through a campaign of renovation and      openness extending beyond the economic sphere to include      freedom of expression, religion, and the press as well as      steps toward more representative government.       Party leaders, however, regard these freedoms as an even      greater threat to their power than the current popular      dissatisfaction with government. In August 1999, at the      closing session of the Seventh Communist Party Plenum,      General Secretary Le Kha Phieu stated that ``there will be no      sharing of power. The Communists will hold firmly to      leadership. Any request for democracy, freedom, human rights,      or `peaceful evolution,' is a conspiracy by the enemy forces      to erase the socialist regime in Vietnam.''       This injunction has manifested itself in strong measures by      local authorities throughout the country against actions      suspected to be harmful to internal stability and order. Most      recently, a number of Hoa Hao Buddhists were imprisoned for      participating in a ceremony to commemorate the 53rd      anniversary of the disappearance of their founder.       Father Chan Tin, an outspoken Roman Catholic priest and      human rights advocate, was recently ``tried'' in absentia at      public meeting organized by the People's Committee in the      district where his church is located. Father Tin was charged      with such crimes as ``seeking to abolish the leadership of      the Communist Party'' and ``destroying the solidarity between      religions and the state.'' And the principal leaders of the      Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam, the country's largest      religious denomination, remain under virtual house arrest.       The government also recently arrested, searched, and      deported French reporter Sylvaine Pasquier, who was      apprehended outside the house of former political prisoner      Nguyen Dan Que, whom she was attempting to interview. Ms.      Pasquier reports that at one point her interrogator made a      gesture to simulate a gun at her head and said she could put      heroin in her purse and condemn her as a drug smuggler.       Next month Mr. Phieu will make an official visit to France      at the invitation of President Chirac--the first visit to a      democratic country by a General Secretary of the Vietnamese      Communist Party since Ho Chi Minh visited France in 1946. The      Phieu visit was arranged with the help of the French      Communist Party, which recently announced its determination      to ``rejuvenate the spirit of communism'' as a movement      committed to ``return political power to the individual      citizen.''       Perhaps Mr. Phieu and his colleagues in the Vietnamese      Communist Party will come to share the insight of their      French comrades that Communism can only survive by finding a      way to coexist with democracy and individual freedom. If      not--if they keep trying to cure the consequences of      Stalinism with more Stalinism--it is hard to imagine that      anyone will be singing songs about the revolution in another      25 years.  Mr. Speaker, I want to salute the gentleman from California (Mr. Rohrabacher) for this excellent resolution.
