 President, the Head Start program has successfully served hundreds of thousands of children over the past 33 years. These are children who otherwise would have been left behind. Instead, they received an enriching opportunity to get prepared for elementary school.  It is critical that we allow local Head Start providers to continue to focus on their mission of serving families and children first. They serve our most vulnerable populations. We need to make sure that we do not saddle Head Start with the additional responsibilities that some members have proposed. Responsibilities such as determining paternity, or enforcing welfare laws by verifying TANF requirements, are duties which are within the realm and expertise of social workers and other professionals. Requiring Head Start to handle these burdensome responsibilities would take their time, energy and focus away from serving families and children first.  We are finding that the quality of instruction and programs at Head Start continues to improve. We must continue to improve quality. One major concern is the authority given to private companies in this bill. While for-profits are partners with many Head Start grantees, their profit-making goals are not wholly consistent with the mission of serving the public good.  Mr. President, in June, 1995, several respected researchers from Yale University and other universities issued a report comparing the quality and cost outcomes between for-profit and non-profit centers. The research shows that non-profit centers on average have more teachers with Associates of Arts in Early Childhood Education degrees than for-profit centers.  Futhermore, for-profit centers on average had lower quality scores but higher costs per child than non-profit centers. Also, for-profit centers make very little use of volunteers from the community. I fear that for-profits are not about quality and community.  Mr. President, presently under 50 percent of the eligible population is served by the Head Start program. It is important that Head Start continues to expand and serve a greater number of children. However, during these times of welfare reform, it is also necessary that Head Start provide full-day, full-year programs for working families. In order to achieve both goals, it is important that expansion occurs cautiously.  Overall, the bill allows flexibility and focuses on school readiness and should be supported. Head Start is one of the most important investments we can make in our children.                          ____________________
