Chairman, in 1973, the National Commission on Fire Prevention and Control issued its ``America Burining'' report. For the fire service this was a turning point in its 350 year history and led to the creation of the United States Fire Administration.  Today is another such turning point because this afternoon we will see a renewed Federal commitment to the fire service. I will get into the details in a moment but first I would like to thank a few of my colleagues for their leadership.  First, is my good friend from Pennsylvania Curt Weldon. As all of you know, Representative Weldon is the founder of the Fire Caucus and has done more to advance the cause of first responders than any other Member in Congress.  Secondly, I would like to thank my friend from New Jersey Representative Bill Pascrell. Congressman Pascrell is the sponsor of the FIRE Act, H.R. 1168. The FIRE Act has energized the fire service and the grant provisions to our first responders included in the amendment today are largely derived from his legislation.  Finally, are my Fire Caucus Co-chairs. Representative Rob Andrews and Representative Sherry Boehlert, and Representatives Nick Smith who serves as Chairman of the Basic Research Subcommittee of the Science Committee. All of them have worked very hard to get us here today.  Mr. Chairman, as I said before this is a watershed moment for the fire service. The proposed amendment does four very important things for the fire service. First, it makes available $10 million for the Volunteer Fire Assistance program. This program helps fire departments in rural and suburban areas prepare for and fight wildfires.  The second component is $10 million for a competitive grant program administered by FEMA for burn prevention, research, and treatment. This money will be used by groups like Safe Kid, AARP, and NFPA to prevent fires before they start.  Groups like the International Association of Fire Fighters will be able to apply for the money to augment their very successful burn camp. Unlike other accident victims, burn survivors are often permanently disfigured and require extensive physical therapy, job re-training and counseling.  The fourth item is the $80 million that will be made available to fire fighter health and safety. Sadly, every year roughly 100 fire fighters are killed in the line of duty. This money will be used to purchase turnout gear, communications equipment, promote fire fighter fitness, increase training, and enforce the fire codes.  Mr. Chairman, I want to urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment.                          ____________________
