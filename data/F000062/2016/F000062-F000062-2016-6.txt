 President, before I begin, I wish to say a few words about my colleague from California who is retiring. I very much regret that I was not able to be here for her remarks on the floor. However, I have written a rather extensive statement for the record. I want to say here and now that no one has fought for California or for this country harder. She has had a dedicated and long career of service to our country, and her accomplishments are many.  Those are documented in the record, and I believe they will stand the test of time. So I want to offer my heartiest congratulations to her for 24 years of service to this country. We came to the Senate together. I have very much respected her, her work, and her diligence over these years.                                  WRDA  Now, Mr. President, I rise to speak about the Water Resources Development Act, which the House passed yesterday afternoon 360 to 61. My colleague Senator Boxer was the author of that bill. I believe it is a good bill. There is a whole litany of excellent projects that benefit the environment as well as the economy of so many of our States.  I want to say something else about my remarkable colleague. We first arrived here in the Senate 24 years ago. She has accomplished a lot in that time, protecting the environment, defending the downtrodden and vulnerable, and fighting for California. She is a tremendous Senator, and I believe her record will withstand the test of time.  Mr. President, I would like to focus on two provisions in this bill, the water infrastructure provisions and funding for Lake Tahoe restoration and protection.  First, this bill includes many vital water infrastructure projects that will limit the risk of flooding, restore critical wildlife habitat and keep our ports running smoothly.  The bill authorizes $177 million for the South San Francisco Bay Shoreline. I have been working on this project for decades, alongside the local sponsors and Army Corps of Engineers.  With nearly 200 square miles of communities in low-lying areas along the shoreline, some that are more than 13 feet below sea level, this area faces a significant threat of major tidal flooding.  Coupled with the restoration of more than 15,000 acres of wetlands, this project will protect vulnerable communities and improve wildlife refuges and public and private infrastructure valued at more than $50 billion.  The bill also authorizes the Los Angeles River Project. At a cost of $1.42 billion, this project will restore 11 miles of the Los Angeles River from Griffith Park to downtown Los Angeles.  The bill also authorizes $880 million to reduce floods along American and Sacramento Rivers near Sacramento, $780 million to reduce flooding in West Sacramento, and expands eligibility of an existing Federal program increasing funding for harbor maintenance to include the ports of Hueneme and San Diego.  The bill also includes a piece of legislation that deals with a passion of mine, saving Lake Tahoe.  This summer, more than 7,000 people joined together for the 20th Annual Lake Tahoe Summit.  I proudly shared the stage with Senators Reid and Boxer, California Governor Jerry Brown, and President Obama.  This summit was an impressive bookend to Senator Reid's efforts to save Lake Tahoe.  In 1997, he invited President Clinton for the first Lake Tahoe Summit to highlight the declining health of the lake and to announce a major Federal restoration effort.  That summit launched an impressive public-private partnership that has since invested $1.9 billion in restoration projects in Lake Tahoe and the surrounding basin.  This remarkable partnership brought Federal, State, local, tribal, and private interests together to help save the lake.  Their work got a real boost in 2000 when we passed the original Lake Tahoe Restoration Act, which authorized $300 million over 10 years.  That $1.9 billion has been invested in nearly 500 completed projects and 120 more that are in the works. These include erosion control on 729 miles of roads, 65,000 acres of hazardous fuels treatment, more than 16,000 acres of wildlife habitat restored, and 1,500 acres of stream environment zones restored. And 2,770 linear feet of shoreline has been added, creating or improving 152 miles of bike and pedestrian routes.  But we still have more work to do.  The Tahoe Environmental Research Center at UC-Davis recently released their annual State of the Lake report.  Their research highlighted several threats to the lake: Climate change and drought are creating increasing the potential for a catastrophic wildfire in the Tahoe Basin, sedimentation and pollution continue to decrease water quality and the lake's treasured clarity, and invasive species threaten the economy of the region.  The time to act to is now, and the Federal Government must take a leading role--close to 80 percent of the land surrounding Lake Tahoe is public land, primarily in more than 150,000 acres of national forest.  This bill authorizes $415 million over 10 years to help address those challenges.  This bill authorizes $150 million for wildfire fuel reduction and forest restoration projects, $45 million to fight invasive species including a successful boat inspection program, $113 million for projects to prevent water pollution and help improve water infrastructure that helps to maintain the lake's water clarity, $80 million for the Environmental Improvement Program which prioritizes the most effective projects for restoration, and $20 million for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to help with the recovery of several native fish species.  The bill also requires an annual report to Congress detailing the status of all projects undertaken to make sure dollars are expended wisely.  We have an opportunity to ensure the future of Lake Tahoe by passing the Water Resources Development Act of 2016 and, thus, passing the Lake Tahoe Bill of 2015.  I want to speak today about the California drought language in this bill, which represents 3 years of effort on my part. I believe these provisions are both necessary and will help our State. I think it is noticeable that both Democrats and Republicans in the California House delegation voted for this bill. In fact, a substantial majority of California House Democrats--21 out of 37--voted yes for the bill.  I particularly want to thank Representatives Costa and Garamendi for their help in this bill throughout this effort. They really made a major effort. Overall, 35 of the 51 California representatives from both parties who voted, from up and down our very big State, voted for this bill and its drought provisions.  California is now entering into our sixth year of drought. Experts have indicated that even if this is the final year of drought, which many doubt, it will take an additional time of 4 years to recover. The effects of the drought have been devastating. In the past 2 years, 35,000 people have lost jobs; $4.9 billion has been lost to the California economy; 1 million acres of farmland were fallowed in 2015; 69 communities have little or no water; and 2,400 private water wells have gone dry. We had 102 million trees on Federal land die during this period of time. Parts of the Great Central Valley have seen as much as 1 foot of land subsidence. That is where the ground actually sinks because of groundwater depletion. Thismeans cracks in canals, bridges, and pipelines. I have seen those photos. We have had 95- and 98-percent salmon mortality in the past 2 years because of problems with cold water temperature valves and probes at Shasta Dam, which provides the cold water to the Sacramento River.  To address the devastating impacts of this drought and to create a long-term new infrastructure that moves away from dams, the bill contains two key parts: short-term provisions and long-term provisions. Before I go into them, I want to say that the drought part of the bill is supported by 218 cities, 6 county governments, 446 water districts, both urban and agricultural.  I ask unanimous consent that that information be printed in the Record directly following my remarks.  Those operational provisions are short term. They last just 5 years. They don't contain any mandatory pumping levels. This bill does not say that if the water flow is such and such, the pumps that move that water must pump at X, Y, or Z. There is none of that. Instead, what this bill does is require daily monitoring for fish when water is turbid.  This monitoring also takes place more frequently and closer to the pumps than it does today. Today, it is at 17 miles from the pumps, and the change is 12 miles from the pumps. It also requires agencies to explain their decisions when they reduce pumping. This will bring about transparency, provide solid reasoning for decisions, and, I think, reduce the angst that exists out there about how those systems are controlled.  Those provisions simply require the agencies to use the best available science based on real-time monitoring so that we can save some water from those heavy flows, as you see on the chart next to me. These are the heavy flows that came in February and March, and we were not able to hold this water and use it later in the year.  What we have done here is tracked every single day from the beginning of the year and what the pumping level was and what the water level was. We also talk about the numbers caught, which are very small: adult smelt, 12; juvenile smelt, 8, and winter-run salmon, 56. So this can be improved, and we seek to do that.  We also provide provisions that simply require the agency to use the best available science based on real-time monitoring, so, again, we can save water from the heavy flows, as you have just seen. Even if this sixth year is a bumper crop of water, UCLA predicts that it is going to take 4\1/2\ years to recover from the drought.  Other short-term provisions include extending the time period for voluntary water transfers by 5 months; ending the winter storm payback requirement, which says: If you save this water, you must put it back into the ocean; allowing a 1-to-1 ratio for voluntary water transfers that can help both fish and farms; and allowing expedited reviews of transfers and construction of barriers to protect water quality.  These water supplies are not for big corporate agriculture, as some would have you think; this water is for the tens of thousands of small farms that have gone bankrupt, like a melon farmer who sat in my office with tears in his eyes and told me how he lost a farm that he had struggled to pay for and that had been part of his family for generations. There are also small towns in the Central Valley, where people are still bathing with bottled water and some 2,500 wells have run dry.  We worked for 2 years with Interior, NOAA fisheries, and the Council on Environmental Quality to make sure there were strong environmental protections, including a very comprehensive savings clause, and we will get to that in a minute.  So the bill in this measure requires agency scientists to review every proposed action. That is right. Scientists must review and approve every proposed action under this bill. These are agency biologists and experts in endangered species. The bill requires them to carefully review every proposal to move water under the provisions of this bill. That is what they do today, and that is what they would do under the bill. That is what the ESA requires, and that is what this bill will require.  The savings clause in this bill also makes clear that the provisions will not override existing environmental law, like the Endangered Species Act and biological opinions.  The bill also makes clear that nothing in this bill will affect water quality. Drinking water will still be available at the same levels of quality as before. The State will have the same ability to regulate water in the delta as it always has had. To make this even clearer, each individual section also requires consistency with the environmental laws and biological opinions.  These protections are referenced in the bill no less than 36 times throughout. In fact, the Commissioner of the Bureau of Reclamation wrote on June 27. He wrote about the savings clause: ``[The savings clause] leads me to conclude that the directives in this legislation are to be implemented in a manner consistent with the ESA and the current biological opinions for federal and state projects.''  I ask unanimous consent to have this letter and my memo concerning the drought savings clause be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                  U.S. Department of the Interior,                                        Bureau of Reclamation,                                    Washington, DC, June 27, 2016.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: Thank you for your letter of      February 24, 2016, addressed to President Barack Obama      regarding your legislation entitled the California Long-Term      Provisions for Water Supply and Short-Term Provisions for      Emergency Drought Relief Act, numbered S. 2533 and H.R. 5247.      I apologize for the delay in this response.       As you know, I testified on S. 2533 before the Senate      Energy and Natural Resources Committee's Water and Power      Subcommittee on May 17, 2016. Your legislation authorizes      significant new investments in proven water supply and      conservation activities that will help make California's      water supplies more resilient in the face of drought. Locally      supported projects such as water recycling, water efficiency      improvements, desalination, groundwater storage, distributed      treatment systems and surface water storage are given      thoughtful consideration in S. 2533, with allowance for      robust non-federal cost-sharing for new projects.       In addition, the bill contains an important savings clause      in section 701 which states that the bill shall not be      interpreted or implemented in a manner that ``overrides,      modifies, or amends'' the Endangered Species Act (ESA) or the      application of the biological opinions governing operations      in the Bay Delta. The combination of these provisions leads      me to conclude that the directives in this legislation are to      be implemented in a manner consistent with the ESA and the      current biological opinions for the federal and state      projects.       While S. 2533 and H.R. 5247 codify the flexibility      Reclamation has exercised in its drought contingency plans      over the past several years, I also wish to be clear that      there is little, if any, operational flexibility remaining in      the biological opinions beyond that already being exercised.      Consequently, as indicated by the 2015 Statement of      Administration Position on H.R. 2898 (Valadao), the      Department would be concerned about, and would likely oppose,      any subsequent change in the authorizations contained in S.      2533 or H.R. 5247 that purport to create additional      flexibility in the biological opinions by amending those      opinions or the ESA itself.       I believe that on balance, S. 2533 is a beneficial piece of      legislation and will help California's water supply in the      near- and long-term. I appreciate your ongoing efforts to      work with Reclamation and the Department on this bill.      [intend to continue this partnership moving forward.           Sincerely,                                                 Estevan R. Lopez,     Commissioner.                                  ____     From the Office of Senator Dianne Feinstein, Dec. 9, 2016     Re Drought language savings clause                            Savings language       The drought language included in the Water Resources and      Development Act of 2016 contains a comprehensive savings      clause. The savings clause states that nothing in this      legislation overrides, modifies, or amends, the Endangered      Species Act or the relevant provisions of the smelt and      salmonid biological opinion that govern the coordinated      operations of the Central Valley Project and the State Water      Project, located in California.       In fact, the Interior Department (responsible for      developing and implementing the smelt biological opinion) and      the Commerce Department (responsible for developing and      implementing the salmonid biological opinion) drafted      sections that govern impacts to these endangered species. The      intention behind three years of work with the federal      agencies responsible for enforcing the Endangered Species Act      was clear: To prohibit any federal agency, under any      administration, from taking any action that would violate the      Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C.     Sec. Sec. 1531-1544 (2012) or the relevant biological      opinions.       That the Act is to be implemented in a manner that complies      with the protections within the Endangered Species Act is      highlighted by a June 27, 2016 letter from the Commissioner      of Reclamation. In that letter, the Commissioner states the      savings clause and other environmental protections contained      in S. 2533 (upon which this savings clause was based) ``leads      me to conclude that the directives in the legislation are to      be implemented in a manner consistent with the ESA and the      current biological opinions for the federal and state      projects.''       To make clear this legislation's goal of consistency with      the Endangered Species Act and biological opinions, each      individual section of the bill likewise requires consistency      with the environmental laws and biological opinions. These      protections are referenced no less than thirty-six times      throughout the bill.       The argument that a savings clause--of the kind that is      routinely included in bills passed by Congress--may be      rendered ineffective by more specific provisions of an act      misses the mark. As a general matter, the Supreme Court has      made clear that it will take its guidance from a ``common-     sense view'' of the language of the savings clause itself.      And the language here is unmistakable and clear: Nothing in      the Act ``overrides, modifies, or amends the applicability of      the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.)      or the application of the smelt and salmonid biological      opinions to the operation of the Central Valley Project or      the State Water Project.''       In fact, the Supreme Court concluded that language in a      savings clause worded almost identically to the clause in S.      2533 did, in fact, govern in the event of conflicts between      the act and already-existing legal standards. The statute      there made clear that nothing in the act could be construed      to ``modify, impair, or supersede'' the applicability of      antitrust laws and any other federal, state, or local law.      That reading led the Court to the logical conclusion that      nothing in the act (much like the language here) could be      read to alter already-existing standards (the analogue here      would be the biological opinions and the ESA).       Moreover, the argument for applying the savings language to      each individual provision of the bill is even stronger in      this case, because each individual provision repeats the same      environmental protections. Rather than conflicting, the      savings language and the individual sections reflect the same      intent: that any action implementing the bill must be      consistent with the environmental laws, including the ESA and      the biological opinions.
