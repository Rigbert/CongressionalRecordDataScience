President, I rise today to pay tribute to Ralph Jackman of Vergennes, VT. Mr. Jackman has been reporting for duty as chief of the Vergennes Fire Department for 50 years--since December 1, 1954.  Chief Jackman started with the fire department 8 years before he took over as chief. During his tenure a new station was built, the number of firefighters doubled, the number of vehicles tripled, and the budget more than quadrupled.  Though at 80 years of age Chief Jackman has given up fighting the fires himself, he continues to respond to calls and manage the volunteer department's paperwork and affairs.  I congratulate Chief Jackman and his family for over 50 years of service to the City of Vergennes and the State of Vermont. He has selflessly given so much to his community.  I ask unanimous consent that an editorial that appeared in today's Burlington Free Press be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Burlington Free Press, Dec. 8, 2004]                      Opinion: True Public Servant       Rare is the modern-day employee who stays in a job      throughout his adult lifetime.       In sharp contrast stands Ralph Jackman, who has committed      the last 50 years to the Vergennes Fire Department. That      surely makes him one of the longest serving fire chiefs in      the nation.       Jackman became chief of the department on Dec. 1, 1954,      eight years after joining the force. And at age 80, don't      expect him to retire anytime soon. Jackman's not actually      battling blazes these days, but he's still in the thick of      the action by managing the volunteer department's paperwork      and overseeing the changes that have brought this fire      department into the 21st century.       Among those changes was construction of a new fire station      and a doubling of the number of firefighters.       He has also seen destruction and death. Jackman recalls in      1948 following a fire engine on the way to a blaze, and      watching the engine crash into an oncoming car, leaving      firefighter Lee Schroder dead.       His most memorable blaze was the Feb. 24, 1958, fire that      destroyed much of downtown Vergennes. He was an eyewitness to      an event that shaped the spirit of a small Vermont city.       His devotion to his community was honored last weekend at a      gathering that drew Gov. Jim Douglas and Vergennes Mayor      Kitty Oxholm. .       The nation came to understand the depth of that commitment      on 9/11, when so many of New York City's firefighters lost      their lives trying to save victims of the terrorist attacks      on the World Trade Centers. Vermont firefighters don't face      that extreme scenario, but they put their lives on the line      every time they roll to a scene to protect their neighbors.       Jackman recently said, ``Being chief is just a privilege      and an honor.''       However, it is the people of Vergennes who have been      honored by his 50 years of service to their community.                          ____________________
