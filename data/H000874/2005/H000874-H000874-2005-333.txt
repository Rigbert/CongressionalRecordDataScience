Speaker, reclaiming my time, with all due respect, I hope that is not the case.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I understand. I appreciate the gentleman yielding.  Mr. Speaker, the House will convene on Tuesday at 12:30 p.m. for morning hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business. We will consider several measures under suspension of the rules. A final list of those bills will be sent to the Members' offices by the end of the week. Any votes called on these measures will be rolled until 6:30 p.m.  On Wednesday and Thursday, the House will convene at 10 a.m. for legislative business. We expect to consider additional legislation under suspension of the rules relating to the Hurricane Katrina relief. In addition, we plan to consider two bills under a rule, H.R. 889, Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2005, and H.R. 3132, the Children's Safety Act of 2005.
