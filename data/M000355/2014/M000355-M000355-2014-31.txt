 President, the recent beheading of U.S. citizen Peter Kassig was the latest reminder of the brutal tactics employed by ISIL, a murderous terrorist organization and insurgency that slaughters the innocent and routinely employs suicide bombers and IEDs in its campaign of terror.  The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant slaughtered Sunni tribe members in Anbar Province, executed prisoners, and captured key terrain in cities such as Mosul.  Americans know ISIL is lethal, but it is also versatile. It has associates and sympathizers in countries across the West, some self-radicalized on the Internet, including not only in Europe and Canada but right here in the United States. The ISIL fighting force continues to grow more numerous--now numbering at least 20,000 strong--with its success on the battlefield having drawn more extremists to the fight from many of the same places, including, again, right here in America.  At its core, ISIL includes many seasoned veterans who once fought under the banner of Al Qaeda in Iraq and either survived the U.S. military detention or el uded our military altogether during the years of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Many of these fighters are familiar with America's intelligence capabilities, and many are savvy with communications. These are terrorists who know how to use encryption, and they know how to change devices frequently. That is part of the reason I am strongly opposed to legislation offered by the chairman of the Judiciary Committee that would end one of the Nation's critical capabilities to gather significant intelligence on terrorist threats. This is the worst possible time to be tying our hands behind our backs.  The threat from ISIL is real. It is different from what we faced before. If we are going to overcome it, if our aim is to degrade and destroy ISIL, as the President has said, then it is going to require smart policies and firm determination. At a minimum, we should not be doing anything to make the situation worse. Yet that is what this bill would do.  Most damagingly, it would hinder the ability of intelligence community analysts to query a database to determine links between potential terrorists. Instead, the Leahy bill would have this data be held by telephone companies. It would make it far harder for records to be gathered for a specific selection term. Under the Leahy bill, the telephone companies would face no statutory requirement to even hold the relevant data.  There is a legitimate debate to be had over the proper balance to strike in our democracy. We continue to have that debate, and we should. But the opponents of this collection program have not provided any examples--no examples--of the National Security Agency intentionally spying on innocent civilians--no examples of that. In fact, the NSA, the courts, and the Congress have put in place detailed oversight procedures to protect both privacy and national security. Moreover, the only data captured under this program is the telephone number dialed--the telephone number dialed--the number from which the call was made, and the length of the call. Under section 215 of the PATRIOT Act, the content of the call is not captured. So I think the programs we have in place strike an appropriate balance between protecting our civil liberties and keeping our Nation safe. I think the bill before us would upend that delicate balance completely.  What is more, legislation with such far-reaching effects should be given the closest possible scrutiny, but this bill was never even considered by the Judiciary Committee or the Intelligence Committee. So it is unclear why the majority leader is moving to it now rather than taking up a bipartisan measure such as the FISA Improvements Act that passed the Intelligence Committee on a strong bipartisan vote of 11 to 4.  With the current law not even expiring until next June, it is unclear why the majority leader wants to rush this untested bill through in this lameduck session rather than after a reasonable consideration by relevant committees and by the newly elected Members who will actually be responsible for overseeing the program's operation.  The point is that the authorities we enacted after September 11, 2001, which were crafted to ensure that we integrated intelligence gathered overseas and here in the United States, are acutely relevant right now. We live in a dangerous world. Threats such as ISIL only make it more so. At a moment when the United States is conducting a military campaign to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat ISIL, now is certainly not the time to be considering legislation that takes away the exact tools we need to combat ISIL.  Our intelligence community is working to track foreign fighters returning from fighting in Syria, to prevent others from traveling to the battlefield, and to keep those within Syria from radicalizing their friends and families back home. It makes little sense to pass legislation that hinders our intelligence community--legislation that has yet to receive any committee consideration.  On that note, today's Wall Street Journal features an excellent opinion piece offered by former Federal judge and Attorney General Michael Mukasey and Gen. Michael Hayden, the former Director of the CIA and the NSA. I recommend their column, ``NSA Reform That Only ISIS Could Love.'' I ask unanimous consent that a copy be printed in the Record at this point.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:              [From the Wall Street Journal, Nov. 7, 2014]                  NSA Reform That Only ISIS Could Love             (By Michael V. Hayden and Michael B. Mukasey)       For those charged with gathering the information our      government needs to keep us safe, the news has been grim.      Following the leaks by Edward Snowden beginning in June last      year of highly classified intelligence gathering techniques,      the former head of the National Counterterrorism Center,      Matthew Olsen, disclosed in September that terrorists tracked      by U.S. intelligence services have started encrypting their      communications in ways that defeat detection, and that the      government has lost track of several.       Meanwhile, Islamic State terrorists continue to rampage      across Syria and Iraq, even as the group, also known as ISIS,      uses sophisticated Internet communications to swell its ranks      with recruits bearing U.S., Canadian or European passports      who can easily slip back into their native countries and      wreak havoc.       In that threat environment, one would think that the last      thing on the ``to do'' list of the 113th Congress would be to      add to the grim news. Yet Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid      has announced that he will bring to the floor the      extravagantly misnamed USA Freedom Act, a major new bill      exquisitely crafted to hobble the gathering of electronic      intelligence.       For starters, the bill ends the National Security Agency's      bulk collection of what is called telephone metadata. This      includes the date, time, duration and telephone numbers for      all calls, but not their content or the identity of the      caller or called, and is information already held by      telephone companies. The bill would substitute a cumbersome      and untried process that would require the NSA, when it seeks      to check on which telephone numbers have called or been      called by a number reasonably associated with terrorist      activity, to obtain a warrant from the Foreign Intelligence      Surveillance Court, or FISA court, and then scurry to each of      the nation's telephone-service providers to comb through the      information that remains in their hands rather than in the      NSA's.       Nothing in the bill requires the telephone companies to      preserve the metadata for any prescribed period. Current      Federal Communications Commission regulations impose an 18-     month retention requirement, but administrative regulations      are subject to change. It isn't hard to envision companies      that wish to offer subscribers the attraction of rapid      destruction of these records, or a complaisant bureaucracy      that lets them do it.       The bill's imposition of the warrant requirement on the NSA      would be more burdensome than what any assistant U.S.      attorney must do to get metadata in a routine criminal case,      which is simply to aver that the information is needed in      connection with a criminal investigation--period.       Proponents say this change is necessary to allay fears that      the NSA could use telephone metadata to construct an      electronic portrait of an American citizen's communications,      and determine whether that person has, say, consulted a      psychiatrist, or called someone else's spouse. However, only      22 people at the NSA are permitted access to metadata, and      only upon a showing of relevance to a national-security      investigation, and they are barred from any data-mining      whatsoever even in connection with such an investigation.      They are overseen by a Madisonian trifecta of the FISA court,      the executive and committees of Congress. Those people and      everyone else at the NSA live in constant dread of failing to      detect a terrorist attack. Nonetheless, the sponsors of the      USA Freedom Act prefer the counsel of hypothetical fears to      the logic of concrete realities.       This sensitivity to abstract concerns doesn't stop at the      water's edge. Under the bill, if the FISA court directs any      change, however technical, in the gathering of information      from foreigners abroad, no information gathered before the      change is implemented could be used before any official body      in this country--agency, grand jury, court, whatever.       Back in the bad old days, as during World War II and the      Cold War, intelligence of all sorts directed at protecting      national security was gathered by the executive without      supervision by judges who, after all, know nothing about the      subject and cannot be held to account for adverse outcomes.      After the Watergate scandal and the resignation of     President Nixon, the FISA court was established in 1978 to      provide oversight for intelligence gathering, in addition to      that already provided by the executive and by Congress. Now,      there are those who complain that the FISA court accedes too      often to requests for government access to information, and      does not appear to resemble a true court in that there is no      public advocate opposing the government position.       But the nearly uniform success of the government before the      FISA court is due both to the government's careful restraint      in presenting applications, and to pushback from the court      itself--which results in the amendment of applications. Even      when the government applies for wiretaps or search warrants      in ordinary criminal cases there is no advocate opposing the      application.       Nonetheless, this new bill would establish a permanent      advocate appointed by the court to oppose the government's      applications before the FISA court. This provision has      elicited an extraordinary written objection from a former      presiding judge of the FISA court. U.S. District Judge John      D. Bates points out that the presence of such an advocate,      who cannot conceivably be aware of all the facts, would      simply add to the burdens of the court and could wind up      sacrificing both national security and privacy.       This bill redefines the FISA court, which was never meant      to be an adversary tribunal and was imposed simply as an      added safeguard in the 1970s, without regard to its history      or its purpose. Worse, it is a three-headed constitutional      monster: It is a violation of both the separation of powers      principle and the Constitution's appointments clause by      having judges rather than the president appoint the public      advocate, and then it has the advocate litigate against the      Justice Department when both executive offices are supposed      to be controlled by the president.       The bill is not an unrelieved disaster. It rightly allows      for the expansion of metadata gathering to include more calls      made by cellphones.       Not surprisingly, the bill has received the endorsement of      President Obama's attorney general, Eric Holder, and his      director of national intelligence, James Clapper, who in a      Sept. 2 letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee said they      were ``comfortable'' with the bill's provisions--even as they      conceded that the bill may have ``additional impacts that we      will be able to identify only after we start to implement the      new law.''       If that calls to mind the Affordable Care Act and the      suggestion that we should wait and find out what is in the      bill until after it passes, bear in mind that ``additional      impacts'' here may include holes in the ground where      buildings used to stand and empty chairs where people used to      sit.       There is no immediate or emergency need for this piece of      legislation. Current surveillance authorities do not expire      at the end of this year, which is fortunate given the current      threats we face at home and abroad. The USA Freedom Act      should await the attention of the Congress that will actually      oversee it. A change to national-security procedures is not      something to be rushed through in a lame-duck session.                          ____________________
