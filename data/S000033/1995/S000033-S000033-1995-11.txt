 Speaker, let me just first of all say that I am in strong agreement with the rule. It is an open rule and will allow for a substantive debate.  Let me recapitulate some of the main points that are involved in this legislation. No. 1, we hear a lot of discussion on the floor of this House about local control and respecting the rights of the people back home. This legislation was discussed intensively in three different State legislatures. The people of Texas through their legislature approved this compact. The people of Maine did the same. The people of Vermont also approved this compact.  I should point out the Governor of Texas is a Republican; the Governor of Vermont is a Democrat and, as it happens, the Governor of Maine is an Independent.  Second, as has already been stated, there are nine compacts that have already been approved by the Congress, impacting 42 States. This will be the 10th compact. I think from a precedent point of view, it is important for this Congress to pass this compact.  Third, what has also, I think, not been made clear is this Congress is not designating a specific disposal site. That is not what we are doing. Presumably, the people of Texas have a process to determine what is in the best interest of their own people. Frankly, I would hope and expect that the people of Texas would not do anything that is environmentally dangerous to the people of their region. We in Congress are not making that decision. The people of Texas are making that decision, and I hope that we could respect that process.  I would simply suggest that from a precedent point of view, from respect for local control, we should support this rule and we should eventually support the bill.
