 With respect to formula and discretionary grants, the bill sets obligation limitations on contract authority for both programs and appropriates $190 million for formula grants. It is our understanding that the only significant amount of contract authority for transit programs that is expected to carry over into fiscal year 1998 is $392 million for transit new start projects. In the absence of a reauthorization bill, the only significant new funding for transit formula and discretionary grant programs next year would be the amount appropriated for formula grants in this bill and the amount remaining available for new start projects. The Federal Transit Administration would apportion the appropriated funds for formula grants according to current formulas, and the new start funding would be distributed based on statutory direction in this bill. Both those distributions would be revisited when reauthorization legislation has been enacted and, presumably, has created new contract authority for these programs.
