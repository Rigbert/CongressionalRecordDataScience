Con. Res. 17       Whereas the Government of Sudan continues to commit crimes      against humanity and engage in genocidal acts in the Darfur      region of Sudan;       Whereas the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement      between the government in Khartoum and the Sudanese People's      Liberation Army on January 9, 2005, has not resulted in an      improvement of the security situation in Darfur;       Whereas, on January 26, 2005, the Government of Sudan      bombed the village of Rahad Kabolong in the state of North      Darfur, killing an estimated 100 people;       Whereas, in February of 2005, the African Union reported      that the security situation in Darfur had deteriorated over      the course of the previous four months;       Whereas, in March 2005, Doctors Without Borders issued a      report that stated that rape of women in Darfur continues      unabated;       Whereas United Nations officials have stated that at least      70,000 people have died due to violence and insecurity in      Darfur, but that the total is likely higher;       Whereas, according to the United Nations, the number of      people internally displaced due to the conflict in Darfur has      risen over the past year to nearly 1,850,000, and over      200,000 people are refugees in neighboring Chad;       Whereas aid organizations believe that approximately 1,000      people per day are dying as a direct and indirect result of      the conflict in Darfur;       Whereas neither the mandate nor the troop strength of the      African Union Mission in Sudan is adequate to protect      civilians in that country; and       Whereas all members of the international community must      participate in efforts to stop genocide, war crimes, and      crimes against humanity in Darfur: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives      concurring), That Congress--       (1) strongly condemns the continued attacks on civilians in      Darfur;       (2) calls on all parties to abide by the terms of the April      8, 2004, N'Djamena cease-fire agreement;       (3) calls on the Government of Sudan to immediately      withdraw all military aircraft from the region and disarm the      janjaweed militias;       (4) commends the Africa Union Mission in Sudan for its      actions to date in monitoring the implementation of the      N'Djamena cease-fire agreement in Darfur;       (5) urges the President to immediately direct the United      States Permanent Representative to the North Atlantic Treaty      Organization to propose in the North Atlantic Council that      NATO assess and report to members on the potential      effectiveness of and requirements for a NATO-enforced no-fly      zone across the Darfur region of Sudan; and       (6) calls upon NATO allies to support the dispatch of such      an assessment mission.
