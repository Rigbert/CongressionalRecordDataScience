Unfortunately, S. 3307, The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010, is partially offset by cutting future Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, SNAP, benefits. While I believe this is important legislation, cutting SNAP benefits for families to pay for a hunger prevention programs is illogical, and isn't something that I could support. Today, a staggering 20 percent of Oregonians rely on SNAP benefits to pay for their basic food needs, which is the fourth-highest participation rate amongst all states.  I wasn't alone in opposing the cuts to SNAP benefits included in S. 3307. I signed a letter to House leadership, with over 100 of my colleagues, expressing our opposition to these cuts. I was hopeful, that by postponing a vote in the House of Representatives on S. 3307, Congress, along with the Administration, could renegotiate the SNAP offset. While the Administration has promised to work to restore lost SNAP benefits, staggering deficits along with new Leadership in the House of Representatives, has created no clear path to reinstating future SNAP benefits.  Meal programs inside and outside of school serve as a direct line to prevent hunger for needy children. I will continue to support child nutrition legislation that doesn't cut critical SNAP benefits.
