Speaker, I offer a motion to instruct conferees.  The Clerk read as follows:       Ms. Kaptur moves that the manager on the part of the House      at the conference on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses      on the bill, H.R. 2330, be instructed to insist on the      highest possible levels of funding permitted for      international food activities under P.L. 480, Title II.
