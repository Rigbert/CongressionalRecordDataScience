Speaker, the Members on our side of the aisle can hardly wait to hear what half-baked excuse our Republican colleagues will use this year for failing to complete our appropriations work on time.  Remember last fall's favorite punching bag? Tom Daschle and Senate Democrats.  As if the other body had anything to do with the Republican majority's refusal to even bring up eight of the 13 annual spending bills on this floor for a vote.  We all know last year's little secret: The House GOP--so famously derided as the ``perfectionist caucus'' by Former Speaker Newt Gingrich--didn't have the votes on its side of the aisle to pass those bills.  So, you pointed the finger of blame at the Senate.  When we considered the first continuing resolution last year, the majority leader (Mr. Delay) said:  ``The Democrat House leadership embraced the decision by the other body [the Senate] to proceed with no governing fiscal oversight called a budget. For any theoretical elective body, the decision to proceed forward without a governing budget would be foolhardy and grossly irresponsible.''  The chairman of the Transportation-Treasury Appropriations Subcommittee, Mr. Istook, passed the buck with even more gusto:  ``The law requires both houses to enact a budget. This body has done so. The other body still has not done it. No wonder we have gridlock and deadlock.''  But few could match the bluntness of my friend from Georgia (Mr. Kingston):  ``There is a sinkhole on the Capitol, not over here, but over there [the Senate],'' said Mr. Kingston.  ``Now, this sinkhole ate up the budget this year. So here we are forced to pass a continuing resolution because we cannot deal with some group that does not have a budget.''  Well, the last time I checked, my Republican friends, there was a Republican majority in this body, a Republican majority in the other body, and a Republican chief executive at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue.  And while this house has passed all 13 spending bills, we have only adopted three conference reports.  So what is your excuse this year?  We all know the answer to that. It's your inability to compromise even with members of your own party.  And it's an affliction that is not just holding up the appropriations process.  It's also preventing us from passing an energy bill, from extending the child tax credit to 6.5 million working American families, and giving our seniors a real prescription drug benefit that is not designed to destroy Medicare.  The GOP has no one to blame this year for this legislative failure but itself.                          ____________________
