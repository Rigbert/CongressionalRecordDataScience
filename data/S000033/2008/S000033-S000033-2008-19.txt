 President, I wish to say a few words in thanking Senator Byrd, not only for his years of illustrious service to the American people but for reminding us about the importance of the Constitution. It is incredible that year after year he has come up here--and perhaps more than any other Member of the Congress--to instruct the American people about that great document and to urge people--children, old people, people from all over this country--to once again study what the Constitution is about.  I would hope, as a result of Senator Byrd's efforts, classrooms all over this country--our young people--will understand the importance of the Constitution.  So I say to Senator Byrd, thank you so much for your service in that regard.
