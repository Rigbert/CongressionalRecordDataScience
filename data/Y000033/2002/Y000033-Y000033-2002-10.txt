Mr. Speaker, this gentleman, of course, is the chairman of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. I agree with the gentleman's points. As the sponsor of the original bill for allowing the pilots to be armed in the cockpit, this is neither a mandate to disrupt schedules nor a requirement that either the Federal Government or air carrier compensate any crew member for these voluntary programs. I want to stress voluntary programs. It just gives a chance for the pilots themselves to arm and to properly train.
