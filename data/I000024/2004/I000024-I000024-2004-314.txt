We are going to try to have this highway bill completed by the end of the week. To do that, there are several things that need to happen. One is that we get these amendments in. We have announced before, and we want to make sure the offices know, if Members have amendments they would like to have considered by the managers, our staff will be available this afternoon and Saturday--this afternoon, all afternoon and Saturday from noon to 5 o'clock--in Hart room 415. We would like to have amendments looked at. I strongly urge you to come down. We are going to stay on our timetable to try to have this completed.  I appreciate the comments by the Senator from Vermont and the Senator from New Jersey. It is very important we get this done.  We are beyond the point of turning back and changing things. We have spent a year working out all the elements--the environmental portion of the bill, the safety portion of the bill, the formula portion--and we have probably the best bill we have had during my time, and I go back to ISTEA when I was in the other body and TEA-21 here.  We have considered more than the other formulas and we have now abandoned the idea of percentages that will get 60 votes and then walking. That is not the way we should be doing it. I think we are doing it a lot better.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
