 President, I rise today to introduce--with my cosponsor Senator Boxer--a historic bill that will end 18 years of litigation between the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Friant Water Authority, and the U.S. Department of the Interior. The legislation will enact a settlement that accomplishes the restoration of California's second longest river, the San Joaquin, while maintaining a stable water supply for the farmers who have made the Valley bloom and have supplied low-cost agricultural products to Americans from coast to coast.  The alternative to a consensus resolution to this long-running western water battle basis is to continue the fight. To my knowledge, every farmer and every environmentalist who has considered the possibility of continued litigation believes that an outcome imposed by a judge is likely to be worse for everyone on all counts: more costly, riskier for the farmers, and less beneficial for the environment.  Because the settlement provides a framework that all interests can accept, this legislation has the strong support of the Bush administration, the Schwarzenegger administration, the environmental and fishing communities and numerous California farmers and water districts, including all 22 Friant water districts that have been part of the litigation.  In announcing the signing of this San Joaquin River settlement in September, the Assistant Secretary of the Interior praised it as a ``monumental agreement.'' And when the Federal court then approved the settlement in late October, Secretary of the Interior Dirk Kempthorne further praised settlement for launching ``one of the largest environmental restoration projects in California's history.'' The Secretary further observed that ``This Settlement closes a long chapter of conflict and uncertainty in California's San Joaquin Valley . . . and open[s] a new chapter of environmental restoration and water supply certainty for the farmers and their communities.''  I share the Secretary's strong support for this balanced and historic agreement, and it is my honor to join with Senator Boxer and a bipartisan group of California House Members in introducing legislation to approve and authorize this settlement before we end the 109th Congress.  The legislation indicates how the settlement agreement forged by the parties is going to be implemented. It involves the Departments of the Interior and Commerce, and essentially gives the Secretary of the Interior the additional authority to:     take the actions to restore the San Joaquin River;     reintroduce the California Central Valley Spring Run Chinook      Salmon;     minimize water supply impacts on Friant water districts; and     avoid reductions in water supply for third-party water      contractors.  One of the major benefits of this settlement is the restoration of a long-lost salmon fishery. The return of one of California's most important salmon runs will create significant benefits for local communities in the San Joaquin Valley, helping to restore a beleaguered fishing industry while improving recreation and quality of life.  The legislation provides for improvements to the San Joaquin River channel to allow salmon restoration to begin in 2014. Beginning in that year, the river would see an annual flow regime mandated by the settlement, with pulses of additional water in the spring and greater flows available in wetter years. There is flexibility to add or subtract up to 10 percent from the annual flows, as the best science dictates.  A visitor to the revitalized river channel in a decade will find an entirely different place providing recreation and relaxation for residents of small towns like Mendota, and a refuge for residents of larger cities like Fresno.  The legislation I am introducing today includes provisions to benefit the farmers of the San Joaquin Valley as well as the salmon: In wet years, Friant contractors can purchase surplus flows at $10 per acre-foot for use in dry years, far less than the approximately $35 per acre-foot that they would otherwise pay for this water. The Secretary of the Interior is authorized to recirculate new restoration flows from the Delta via the California aqueduct and the Cross-Valley Canal to provide additional supply for Friant.  Today's legislation also includes substantial protections for other water districts in California that were not party to the original settlement negotiations. These other water contractors will be able to avoid all but the smallest water impacts as a result of the settlement, except on a voluntary basis.  In addition, the restoration of flows for over 150 miles below Friant Dam, and reconnecting the upper river to the critical San Joaquin-Sacramento Delta, will be a welcome change for the more than 22 million Californians who rely on that crucial source for their drinking water.  Finally, restoring the San Joaquin as a living salmon river may ultimately help struggling fishing communities on California's north coast--and even into southern Oregon. The restoration of the San Joaquin and the government's commitment to reintroduce and rebuild historic salmon populations provide a rare bright spot for these communities.  In addition to congratulating the parties for making a settlement that will enable the long-sought restoration of the San Joaquin River, I am mindful of and remain committed to progress in implementing and funding the December 19, 2000, Trinity River restorationrecord of decision and the Hoopa Valley Tribe's comanagement of the decision's important goal of restoring the fishery resources that the United States holds in trust for the tribe.  Support of this agreement is almost as far reaching as its benefits. This historic agreement would not have been possible without the participation of a remarkably broad group of agencies, stakeholders and legislators, reaching far beyond the settling parties. The Department of the Interior, the State of California, the Friant Water Users Authority, the Natural Resources Defense Council on behalf of 13 other environmental organizations and countless other stakeholders came together and spent countless hours with legislators in Washington to ensure that we found a solution that the large majority of those affected could support.  Last month, California voters showed their support by approving Propositions 84 and 1E that will help pay for the settlement by committing at least $100 million and likely $200 million or more toward the restoration costs. Indeed, this legislation includes a diverse mix of approximately $200 million in direct Water User payments, new State payments, $240 million in dedicated Friant Central Valley Project capital repayments, and future Federal appropriations limited to $250 million. This mix of funding sources is intended to ensure that the river restoration program will be sustainable over time and truly a joint effort of Federal, State and local agencies.  I would like to emphasize that the Federal funding in the bill is for implementation of both the restoration goal to reestablish a salmon fishery in the river, and the water management goal to avoid or minimize water supply losses supplied by Friant Water Districts. It is important to recognize that these efforts are of equal importance.  At the end of the day, I believe that this agreement is something that we can all feel very proud of, and I urge my colleagues in the Senate to move quickly to approve this legislation and provide the administration the authorization it needs to fully carry out its legal obligations and the extensive restoration opportunities under the settlement.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.

(f) No Additional Expenditures Required.--Nothing in this      Act shall be construed to require a Federal official to      expend Federal funds not appropriated by Congress, or to seek      the appropriation of additional funds by Congress, for the      implementation of the Settlement.       (g) Reach 4B.--       (1) Study.--       (A) In general.--In accordance with the Settlement and the      Memorandum of Understanding executed pursuant to paragraph 6      of the Settlement, the Secretary shall conduct a study that      specifies--       (i) the costs of undertaking any work required under      paragraph 11(a)(3) of the Settlement to increase the capacity      of Reach 4B prior to reinitiation of Restoration Flows;       (ii) the impacts associated with reinitiation of such      flows; and       (iii) measures that shall be implemented to mitigate      impacts.       (B) Deadline.--The study under subparagraph (A) shall be      completed prior to restoration of any flows other than      Interim Flows.       (2) Report.--       (A) In general.--The Secretary shall file a report with      Congress not later than 90 days after issuing a      determination, as required by the Settlement, on whether to      expand channel conveyance capacity to 4500 cubic feet per      second in Reach 4B of the San Joaquin River, or use an      alternative route for pulse flows, that--       (i) explains whether the Secretary has decided to expand      Reach 4B capacity to 4500 cubic feet per second; and       (ii) addresses the following matters:       (I) The basis for the Secretary's determination, whether      set out in environmental review documents or otherwise, as to      whether the expansion of Reach 4B would be the preferable      means to achieve the Restoration Goal as provided in the      Settlement, including how different factors were assessed      such as comparative biological and habitat benefits,      comparative costs, relative availability of State cost-     sharing funds, and the comparative benefits and impacts on      water temperature, water supply, private property, and local      and downstream flood control.       (II) The Secretary's final cost estimate for expanding      Reach 4B capacity to 4500 cubic feet per second, or any      alternative route selected, as well as the alternative cost      estimates provided by the State, by the Restoration      Administrator, and by the other parties to the Settlement.       (III) The Secretary's plan for funding the costs of      expanding Reach 4B or any alternative route selected, whether      by existing Federal funds provided under this Act, by non-     Federal funds, by future Federal appropriations, or some      combination of such sources.       (B) Determination required.--The Secretary shall, to the      extent feasible, make the determination in subparagraph (A)      prior to undertaking any substantial construction work to      increase capacity in Reach 4B.       (3) Costs.--If the Secretary's estimated Federal cost for      expanding Reach 4B in paragraph (2), in light of the      Secretary's funding plan set out in paragraph (2), would      exceed the remaining Federal funding authorized by this Act      (including all funds reallocated, all funds dedicated, and      all new funds authorized by this Act and separate from all      commitments of State and other non-Federal funds and in-kind      commitments), then before the Secretary commences actual      construction work in Reach 4B (other than planning, design,      feasibility, or other preliminary measures) to expand      capacity to 4500 cubic feet per second to implement this      Settlement, Congress must have increased the applicable      authorization ceiling provided by this Act in an amount at      least sufficient to cover the higher estimated Federal costs.     SEC. 10. CALIFORNIA CENTRAL VALLEY SPRING RUN CHINOOK SALMON.       (a) Finding.--Congress finds that the implementation of the      Settlement to resolve 18 years of contentious litigation      regarding restoration of the San Joaquin River and the      reintroduction of the California Central Valley Spring Run      Chinook salmon is a unique and unprecedented circumstance      that requires clear expressions of Congressional intent      regarding how the provisions of the Endangered Species Act of      1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) are utilized to achieve the      goals of restoration of the San Joaquin River and the      successful reintroduction of California Central Valley Spring      Run Chinook salmon.       (b) Reintroduction in the San Joaquin River.--California      Central Valley Spring Run Chinook salmon shall be      reintroduced in the San Joaquin River below Friant Dam      pursuant to section 10(j) of the Endangered Species Act of      1973 (16 U.S.C. 1539(j)) and the Settlement, provided that      the Secretary of Commerce finds that a permit for the      reintroduction of California Central Valley Spring Run      Chinook salmon may be issued pursuant to section 10(a)(1)(A)      of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C.      1539(a)(1)(A)).       (c) Final Rule.--       (1) Definition of third party.--For the purpose of this      subsection, the term ``third party'' means persons or      entities diverting or receiving water pursuant to applicable      State and Federal law and shall include Central Valley      Project contractors outside of the Friant Division of the      Central Valley Project and the State Water Project.       (2) Issuance.--The Secretary of Commerce shall issue a      final rule pursuant to section 4(d) of the Endangered Species      Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1533(d)) governing the incidental take      of reintroduced California Central Valley Spring Run Chinook      salmon prior to the reintroduction.       (3) Required components.--The rule issued under paragraph      (2) shall provide that the reintroduction will not impose      more than de minimis: water supply reductions, additional      storage releases, or bypass flows on unwilling third parties      due to such reintroduction.       (4) Applicable law.--Nothing in this section--       (A) diminishes the statutory or regulatory protections      provided in the Endangered Species Act for any species listed      pursuant to section 4 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973      (16 U.S.C. 1533) other than the reintroduced population of      California Central Valley Spring Run Chinook salmon,      including protections pursuant to existing biological      opinions or new biological opinions issued by the Secretary      or Secretary of Commerce; or       (B) precludes the Secretary or Secretary of Commerce from      imposing protections under the Endangered Species Act of 1973      (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) for other species listed pursuant to      section 4 of that Act (16 U.S.C. 1533) because those      protections provide incidental benefits to such reintroduced      California Central Valley Spring Run Chinook salmon.       (d) Report.--       (1) In general.--Not later than December 31, 2024, the      Secretary of Commerce shall report to Congress on the      progress made on the reintroduction set forth in this section      and the Secretary's plans for future implementation of this      section.       (2) Inclusions.--The report under paragraph (1) shall      include--       (A) an assessment of the major challenges, if any, to      successful reintroduction;       (B) an evaluation of the effect, if any, of the      reintroduction on the existing population of California      Central Valley Spring Run Chinook salmon existing on the      Sacramento River or its tributaries; and       (C) an assessment regarding the future of the      reintroduction.       (e) FERC Projects.--       (1) In general.--With regard to California Central Valley      Spring Run Chinook salmon reintroduced pursuant to the      Settlement, the Secretary of Commerce shall exercise its      authority under section 18 of the Federal Power Act (16      U.S.C. 811) by reserving its right to file prescriptions in      proceedings for projects licensed by the Federal Energy      Regulatory Commission on the Calaveras, Stanislaus, Tuolumne,      Merced, and San Joaquin rivers and otherwise consistent with      subsection (c) until after the expiration of the term of the      Settlement, December 31, 2025, or the expiration of the      designation made pursuant to subsection (b), whichever ends      first.       (2) Effect of subsection.--Nothing in this subsection shall      preclude the Secretary of Commerce from imposing      prescriptions pursuant to section 18 of the Federal Power Act      (16 U.S.C. 811) solely for other anadromous fish species      because those prescriptions provide incidental benefits to      such reintroduced California Central Valley Spring Run      Chinook salmon.       (f) Effect of Section.--Nothing in this section is intended      or shall be construed--       (1) to modify the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C.      1531 et seq.) or the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 791a et      seq.); or       (2) to establish a precedent with respect to any other      application of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C.      1531 et seq.) or the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 791a et      seq.).                                 ______                                       By Mr. DeWINE:  S. 4086. A bill to improve data collection efforts with respect to the safety of pregnant women and unborn children in motor vehicle crashes, provide for research and development of appropriate countermeasures, educate the public regarding motor vehicle safety risks affecting pregnant women and unborn children, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, during my 12 years in the Senate, I have always fought to increase our Nation's commitment to children's health and safety. One of the areas where I have had the privilege of working together with Democrats and Republicans on children's issues is highway safety. Whether the matter at hand was making school buses safer or enacting new motor vehicle safety standards that protect small children in crashes, I have always been fortunate to find fellow Senators committed to crafting legislation that will make a difference in children's lives.  One of the things I have learned over the years is that the research, testing, and public awareness programs operated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration--NHTSA--play a major role helping prevent injuries and saving lives on our roads. We lose over 42,000 lives each year in motor vehicle crashes, but that total would be astronomically higher without the work done by NHTSA and its partners. As vehicles have changed, technologieshave matured, and the safety challenges facing the driving public have shifted over time, NHTSA has responded by instituting new programs. Sometimes, however, it takes a little action by Congress to get NHTSA moving on these important safety objectives.  Today, I rise to introduce a measure that I hope my colleagues will consider in the future as they continue to work on highway safety issues. I also hope that this bill might spur additional action by NHTSA.  In speaking with leading safety advocates, I have come to understand just how significant the safety challenges are for pregnant women and their unborn children in motor vehicle crashes. Yet despite these great challenges and the importance we all place on ensuring maternal health and safety, we know very little about the way crash forces affect mothers and their unborn children over both the short-term and long-term. While university researchers have begun to document some of the chief safety challenges facing pregnant mothers, we need to do more to fully understand these issues and to develop ways of applying what we have learned in manufacturing vehicles that are safer for pregnant women and their unborn children.  Additionally, we need to do a better job communicating the immediate and lifelong safety risks associated with motor vehicle crashes to pregnant mothers so that they can do everything possible to ensure not only their own health, but that of their babies. Sometimes, these steps may be as simple as making sure that safety belts are worn and positioned properly. At some point, technologies may become available on the market designed specifically to cater to the motor vehicle safety needs of pregnant women.  To achieve these goals and ultimately to prevent injuries and save lives, we need NHTSA to act and we need to provide new resources for research and testing. The bill I am introducing today does precisely that.  The Maternal Motor Vehicle Crash Safety Act of 2006 addresses these issues in a number of ways. First, the bill presents findings defining the challenges facing pregnant women and their unborn children in motor vehicle crashes. I particularly want to thank Dr. Hank Weiss of the University of Pittsburgh for his assistance in bringing this important research to my attention.  Second, the bill contains sections providing incentives for states to link various databases in a way that will lead to a better understanding of the number of mothers and babies that are impacted by motor vehicle crashes each year and what the long-term health impacts are for children who were involved in crashes before being born. Furthermore, the bill sets several high priority research areas for NHTSA, including an investigation into computer modeling systems and biofidelic crash-test dummies capable of simulating a pregnant woman and her child during dangerous crashes. Sadly, we have functional dummies that accurately simulate men, women, and children--but none for pregnant women.  I strongly urge my colleagues to take up and pass this legislation during the 110th Congress. Members of the Senate and leaders at NHTSA work hard every year to do their best to improve highway safety here in the United States, and I believe the measures outlined in this bill have the potential to make a lasting contribution to those efforts in the years ahead.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill, the Maternal Motor Vehicle Crash Safety Act of 2006, be printed in the Record.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.                                S. 4086       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Maternal Motor Vehicle Crash      Safety Act of 2006''.     SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.       In this Act:       (1) Administrator.--The term ``Administrator'' means the      Administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety      Administration.       (2) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term      ``appropriate congressional committees'' means the Committee      on Appropriations and Committee on Commerce, Science, and      Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on      Appropriations and the Committee on Energy and Commerce of      the House of Representatives.       (3) Biofidelic.--The term ``biofidelic'' means having the      property of responding to and being impacted by crash and      other external forces in a manner directly consistent with      the way in which a live human being would respond to and be      impacted by such forces.       (4) Data linkage system.--The term ``data linkage system''      means an information system that is capable of accurately      tracking adverse health effects and birth outcomes for      pregnant women who are occupants of a motor vehicle that is      involved in a crash and the unborn children of such women,      through the connection and analysis of multiple data sources.       (5) Unborn child.--The term ``unborn child'' means a member      of the species homo sapiens, at any stage of development, who      is carried in the womb.     SEC. 3. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Injuries are the leading cause of pregnancy-associated      deaths in the United States.       (2) Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of injury      deaths in women of reproductive age and the leading cause of      injury hospitalizations among pregnant women.       (3) Studies have indicated that motor vehicles are      estimated to account for up to 80 percent of injury related      deaths among unborn children.       (4) Transportation Research Board publications indicate      that deaths among unborn children due to motor vehicle      crashes are more frequent than several notable fatal      childhood injuries, including bicycle related deaths in      children aged 0 through 15, firearm related deaths in      children aged 0 through 9, and motor vehicle crash related      deaths in children aged 0 through 1.       (5) Studies suggest that approximately 3 percent of all      babies born in the United States are involved in a motor      vehicle crash while in utero.       (6) Studies have shown that elevated risks of birth-related      threats and obstetric complications following crashes      involving pregnant women include--       (A) premature childbirth;       (B) low birth weight;       (C) placental injury;       (D) uterine rupture; and       (E) amniotic rupture.       (7) Despite advances in vehicle safety, pregnant women have      not received the special attention and consideration needed      to understand, reduce, and prevent the risks of adverse      pregnancy outcomes related to crashes.       (8) There is a need for more research and application using      anthropometric test devices and computerized modeling systems      that represent pregnant women during all stages of pregnancy.       (9) During pregnancy, the risks of traumatic injury to a      woman is shared by the woman's unborn child. Assessing the      magnitude and characteristics of those risks through data      linkage systems, comparing the risks to other injuries and      diseases, and reducing them, are important unmet challenges      for improving maternal and child health.       (10) A better understanding is needed about what can happen      during, and after, a pregnant woman is involved in a motor      vehicle crash. This includes the effects of a crash on the      mother, the unborn child, and the delicate physiological      balance between the mother and child that separates healthy      from unhealthy pregnancies, including the effects of maternal      physiologic adaptations to trauma, fluid loss and shock,      effects from maternal stress, effects from diagnostic      regimens, medical or surgical procedures, or the wide variety      of prescription medicines, and other medication taken by the      mother.       (11) Despite the importance of the health of mothers and      unborn children involved in motor vehicle crashes, agencies      and data linkage systems responsible for tracking motor      vehicle injuries, deaths, and other measures of adverse      outcome rarely capture pregnancy status.       (12) Existing data collection and analysis systems      generally do not count unborn children involved in motor      vehicle crashes and do not follow them after their birth to      ascertain the effects of the crash on long-term neuro-     developmental and functional outcomes.     SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON IMPROVEMENTS TO THE NATIONAL                    AUTOMOTIVE SAMPLING SYSTEM CRASHWORTHINESS DATA                    SYSTEM.
