I believe this historical analogy is very sound.                          Preventing Extortion                          (By Jack Churchill)       The debate about a public health insurance option mirrors      the debate about public power in the 1920's and 30's. The      arguments then were very similar to the arguments we hear      today.       The principal issue then was whether the federal government      should enter the public power business by investing      taxpayers' money to build the Tennessee Valley Authority and      to harness the Columbia and other rivers for electrical      energy or the sites should be transferred to the private      sector. A second issue was who should build transmission      lines and set wholesale prices when the Federal government      built dams.       The answer to the second question was first enunciated on      the Senate floor In the fight over the Wilson Dam in 1920 by      Senator John Sharp Williams of Tennessee. He said ``The      government should have somewhere a producer of these things      that should furnish a productive element to stop and check      private profiteering.'' Thus was born the yardstick federal      policy which later found its way into TVA legislation through      the efforts of Nebraska's Senator George Norris. In a 1932      campaign speech in Portland, Oregon, Franklin Roosevelt      referred to his TVA and other regional proposals as      ``yardsticks to prevent extortion against the public.''       Roosevelt's statement enunciated America's public power      agenda, which through the years has saved the federal      government and electrical consumers hundreds of billions of      today's dollars. This public investment provided the      electrical energy to build the bombers and the atomic bomb      and was a critical factor in winning World War II.       At the time of the Yardstick Public Power legislation of      the 1930's, most of the farms and homes in rural America were      without electrical power. Only in the cities could private      power companies make a profit selling electrical energy. With      the launching of the New Deal yardstick pricing, together      with publicly owned electrical cooperatives and public      utility districts, rural America was electrified and private      utilities ended up serving a large majority of rural      consumers.       Because we adopted yardstick pricing back in the 30's,      today America possesses a healthy and balanced mix of      private, public, and cooperative electrical systems.       The public power analogy might be a useful device in      combating the brutal campaign against a federal public health      insurance option. History is repeating itself. We see the      same epithets of socialism, unfair competition, and      government interference with private enterprise.       Both America's constitutional system of government and our      free enterprise economic system are built upon the      fundamental notion of balancing power between institutions.      It is only when there is an imbalance of power within one of      the two systems or the share of power between them that we      fail. Recent disasters created by imbalance, including      Enron and California energy manipulation and the collapse      of the American banking system, wiping out our citizens'      retirement accounts, are painful examples.       Most importantly and perhaps most painful for great numbers      of our citizens today, America trails all developed countries      by many years in fashioning an effective national health      services delivery system.       There is no industry that has a more shared and complex mix      of nonprofit, government, and private for-profit delivery      systems. Yet we have a system that is neither cost-effective      nor meets the needs of our citizens whether insured or not.      It is a system that is out of balance. It desperately needs      an effective yardstick       The imbalance in our system began in 1975 when the Supreme      Court gave the green light to commercialization of medicine      by removing medicine from protection of the antitrust laws.      The imbalance was greatly exacerbated in 1980 when the      American Medical Association changed its ethical guidelines      to declare that medicine was no longer a professional service      but both a business and a profession. The other factor of      great influence that has led to imbalance is the dominance of      investor-owned private insurance companies born from the      establishment of employer-based health insurance systems.       Thus began the corporatizing and domination of Wall Street      in organizing and pricing for-profit medical services. Rather      than a system organized to deliver cost-effective medical      services to patients, today we have a system designed for      profit.       Despite the roles of federal Medicare, state Medicaid,      members of Congress health care programs, federal delivery      systems such as the Veterans Administration, and nonprofit      group health cooperative associations, the balance of power      in our national health care delivery system is now largely in      the hands of Wall Street-driven for-profit enterprises. Every      medical procedure from putting on surgical gloves to sending      bills to the insurance company has become a profit center.      And the pricing for all the services are set largely in an      oligarchical framework of administered pricing. There is      absolutely no competitive pricing. Have you or anyone you      know ever negotiated the price of medical service?       So history repeats itself. The Democratic party is charged      with formulating another national yardstick policy that will      have enormous consequences for the health and welfare of our      citizens in generations to come. Like Franklin Roosevelt,      President Obama is simply leading the nation to create      sufficient power in the public sector to balance against the      private sector and the Wall Street pricing effect. Or in      President Roosevelt's words, ``a yardstick to prevent      extortion against the public.''And as President Obama stated      the issue ``to keep insurance companies honest.''       The failure of Congress to build in an effective market      yardstick for pricing medical services would cost future      generations trillions and fail to deliver cost-effective      medical care to all our citizens. No amount of regulation      will suffice. Only the market mechanism will provide      effective cost reduction to pay for universal coverage.                          ____________________
