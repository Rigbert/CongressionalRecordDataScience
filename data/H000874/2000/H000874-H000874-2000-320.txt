Speaker, I rise today in honor of John T. Daugherty, a distinguished and extraordinary member of the Southern Maryland community and a personal friend for many years. His contributions to his community of Lexington Park and the Southern Maryland area will continue to pay dividends and be fondly remembered for decades to come. Mr. John T. Daugherty was best known as Jack throughout Southern Maryland. He was born January 18, 1919 in Bath County, Kentucky. He went on to attend school at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill; Center College in Danville, Kentucky; and Morehead State Teachers College. He later was trained to fly Navy airplanes in Pensacola, Florida. He joined the Marine Corps and saw service in the South Pacific during World War II, where his courageous prowess earned him the Distinguished Flying Cross for a bombing raid on Rabaul Harbor. He went on to become a pioneer and product of the Patuxent River Naval Air Station Test Pilot School even before the first official graduating class was formed. After leaving active duty, he continued to proudly serve his country as a Lieutenant Colonel in the Marine Corps Reserves. Jack Daugherty remained in St. Mary's County to began life as a civilian and his entrepreneurial instincts led him to create many small businesses in Southern Maryland. His early business pursuits were not based on personal gain, rather, he created many new ventures to meet the needs of a fledgling and fast growing upstart Navy town. He is perhaps best known for founding Citizen's Bank, later known as Maryland Bank and Trust. His efforts to bring desperately needed capital resources to the Lexington Park community were critical in building a town to support the growing Navy base at Patuxent. Jack Daugherty became president of this bank and continued to run the local community bank for 35 years. He used the bank to literally help build a town that today is home to one of America's largest and most technologically advanced military bases. His unconventional loan practices enabled hundreds of entrepreneurs to go into business. Today, many small business owners, including a large number of women and minority owned businesses, will tell you how Mr. Daugherty helped them get started in business. Typically, they will tell you, their loans were approved without using any collateral and written on the back of an envelope.  Indicative of Mr. Daugherty's great sense of community spirit and among his greatest contributions to the community, was an early venture to create a local radio station for St. Mary's County. Recognizing the need to create a sense of community, he began and operated the WPTX AM Radio station in Lexington Park, where he and other local business owners took turns announcing local news events, weather, and other items of local interest. Mr. Daugherty himself was an announcer on the station, covering local news and political events. That station has continually served the local community and today is operated as 97.7 WMDM-FM under the ownership of Mr. Ron Walton. Jack Daugherty was also a founder of the St. Mary's County Chamber of Commerce, a member of the Historic St. Mary's City Commission and the founder of the Lexington Park Little League. He was on the Board of Trustees at St. Mary's College of Maryland and is fondly remembered for providing scholarships to many disadvantaged area students.  Mr. Speaker, Jack Daugherty was a unique individual who made contributions to his community that will last for generations to come. He was a giant among his peers whose leadership provided countless opportunities for thousands of individuals, reaching far beyond his local community. His rugged independence and fierce commitment to his community should distinguish him forever for the important role he has had in attracting the very significant U.S. Navy investment at Patuxent River Naval Air Station we have today. Repeatedly, he was a critical force in mobilizing the necessary resources to retain and attract federal investments at Pax River. Whenever a threat appeared on the horizon to either Pax River or St. Inigoes, it was Jack Daugherty who mobilized the local community to fight it.  Mr. Speaker, Jack Daugherty's presence will be sorely missed. Right up until his death on August 10, 2000, he played an active role in the Southern Maryland Navy Alliance, providing the same firm and steady leadership to that organization as he continued to support and protect the interests of Southern Maryland and the U.S. Navy. I ask my colleagues to join with me in honoring a great American whose success and love of life will long be remembered in Southern Maryland. Every community in America needs a Jack Daugherty. He knew the importance of community spirit and set the bar high for others to give back to community in which he lived. I ask my colleagues to join with me in paying tribute to John T. Daugherty, a veteran, a business and community leader and great family man, for his lifetime of service to his family, his neighbors and to his country.  My best wishes go out to his wife Kay, son Tom and daughter Katie who best knew him as an upstanding and decent husband, father, and community leader. I ask that you join me in honoring John T. Daugherty's strength and devotion to a community that will continue to reap the benefits of his work and dedication. His legacy will never be forgotten.                          ____________________
