This is one that Senator Boxer and I have been working together on for a long period of time. We have gone through these reauthorizations for many years, and we know this is the way to do it.  The reauthorization bill is far superior to just the short-term efforts for extensions. I think we all realize extensions cost about 30 percent off the top. And while I can't support the specific proposal of my good friend from Vermont, passing a bipartisan long-term fully funded bill is my top priority as chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee.  As we all know, the current Transportation reauthorization expires on May 31, and EPW will be prepared to move on a reauthorization bill before that deadline. That is our goal. My staff has been working closely with the staff of my good friend and partner from California, the ranking member, Senator Boxer, and we are getting close to having our bill ready.  I know my colleagues on the Committees on Finance, Commerce, Science and Transportation, and Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs are alsocommitted to passing a long-term bill as soon as possible, because this does involve not just the Environment and Public Works Committee but the other two committees as well.
