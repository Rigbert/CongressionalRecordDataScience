Speaker, America's workers do not support the Trump-negotiated NAFTA-2 trade deal.  Just like the original NAFTA, the new NAFTA is half-baked, repackaged, and broken. It was not written to improve the lives of our working families in Ohio or in Mexico or in Central America. It was written to advance transnational corporate interests and the schemes of very wealthy elites.  In a country whose public and private sectors too often serve the interests of the rich and powerful and not the average person, this is the last thing the working people of Ohio and North America need, regardless of whether they work in the mills or toil in the fields.  The President's promise of higher wages and returning jobs is not to be believed. NAFTA cannot deliver for the working people unless it ensures the dignity of labor, of labor rights, and labor enforcement on this continent.  Our leaders must wake up to the human suffering these trade deals create, not only for our own citizens as their jobs are outsourced but, also, people who are exploited in Mexico and the Americas.  When transnational corporations crash together the economies of first- and third-world countries, without a second thought about the consequences, it is the working people who get crushed.  The ravages of NAFTA inflicted on the Americas and their workers are etched across America's communities. Far too many have been devastated by the outsourcing of factories, many left in economic ruin.  NAFTA was sold as the model of the modern integration of first-world and emerging-world economies. It was then replicated in Central America with the so-called CAFTA sweatshop deal, covering nations from which millions are now fleeing to our border.  When multinational corporate interests dominate negotiations and place a heavy thumb on the scales of economic justice for labor across the Americas, trade with our closest neighbors is never a zero-sum game because too few control the levers of negotiating power.  It is no surprise that nearly a half a million migrants have been taken into custody at our southern border this year alone--half a million.  In the past, undocumented immigrants were overwhelmingly single men from Mexico, but that flow has changed. First, we experienced immigration from Mexico post NAFTA. There was a hemorrhage.  That has gone down in recent years, but now CAFTA, the gift of CAFTA, sees Central American families having become the new face of undocumented immigration.  These landless people, jobless people from the Americas live in fear.  As America exports our transnational-driven trade models, we knowingly rely upon the human suffering our economic policies inflict on the poor.  NAFTA and NAFTA-2 were always about cheap labor and bringing down the benefits of health and pension benefits for American workers.  Undocumented migrants arrive brutalized through trafficking channels. Indeed, one can easily see, in agriculture alone in the Americas, the exploitative model of slavery has simply morphed into a new serfdom under the present system.  Once in the United States, many become undocumented farm workers, and the Department of Agriculture estimates that about half of our Nation's farm workers are unauthorized, undocumented.  These workers face great hostility and black-market labor conditions repugnant to our values. This undocumented status makes workers especially vulnerable to abuse.  Is the answer to expand our migrant visa worker programs, the H-2A or H-2B visas? Absolutely not.  Take the tragedy of Santiago Cruz, a Mexican labor recruiter brutally murdered in a legal labor recruitment office in Monterrey, Mexico.  Santiago was communicating to his fellow Mexican workers who sought economic opportunity in America that they did not have to pay a coyote $8,000 to get across the border--a crooked, lone coyote.  Twelve years after his death near the Mexican-U.S. border, Mexico has not prosecuted his murderer and our country has not raised a voice to get justice in his murder.  But the greatest injustice is the new NAFTA deal that fails to address the cancer of undocumented labor in the Americas, especially in the agriculture industry.  The current migrant worker system is widely abused by employers seeking a captive workforce. NAFTA-2 must include a comprehensive strategy to address continental labor, and agricultural immigration must be a part and central to it, not absent.  The continental enforcement of healthy working conditions and integration of enforceable labor laws must be central to NAFTA-2. It is not in it.  That is the ugly exploitation of America's industrialized and farm workers that we allow to continue.  How morally reprehensible is this?  I ask my colleagues to please take a look at our bill and include a labor secretariat in the new NAFTA deal. Let's put some justice in trade.                          ____________________
