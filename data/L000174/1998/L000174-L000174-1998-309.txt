President, I would like to engage the Chairman in a colloquy. Last year, the Senator and I discussed the energy generation problems facing rural areas of the United States. The Chairman wisely included funding in the Fiscal Year 1998 Energy and Water Appropriations bill to address this problem. In rural areas, energy distribution systems are often more difficult and expensive to establish. As a result, communities are often forced to rely on more polluting fuel sources because they have lower up front capital costs. The Jeffords amendment the Chairman accepted this morning increases funding for the Remote Power Initiative to $5 million. Is that correct?
