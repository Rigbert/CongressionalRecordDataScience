President, this amendment has been here three times before. In fact, this amendment has been supported with over 90 votes each time it came through. Unfortunately, once one of the bills went into conference, it was taken out. They replaced it with a 45-day provision.  What this does--it is a one-sentence amendment, very easy to understand. It says:       None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available      by this Act may be used to construct or modify a facility or      facilities in the United States [to house terrorists].  If you want terrorists here, then vote against this amendment. This may be the last shot you have at it. We have the Inouye-Inhofe amendment already passed in the Defense authorization bill, but it is in conference. We do not know whether it will come out. This is the second shot we have to try to keep terrorists from coming into the United States.  I retain the remainder of my time.
