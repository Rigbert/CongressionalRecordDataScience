President, I congratulate Senator Hagan on the Senate's consideration of the nomination of Max O. Cogburn.  Max O. Cogburn is nominated to sit on the U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina, the very district where he has served for 9 years as a magistrate judge and for 12 years as an assistant U.S. attorney. Mr. Cogburn is currently a partner in the Asheville, NC, law firm of Cogburn and Brazil, and also serves as an appointed member of the North Carolina Education Lottery Commission.  This nomination could--and in my view should--have been considered and confirmed last year. Instead, it was unnecessarily returned to the President without final Senate action, despite the nominee's qualifications and the needs of the American people to have judges available to hear cases in the Federal courts. The President has had to renominate him, the Senate Judiciary Committee has had to reconsider him and now, finally, the Senate is being allowed to consider him.  I suspect the Senate will now confirm him unanimously or nearly so. He has the support of both his home state Senators, one a Democrat and the other a Republican. The nomination of Max Cogburn to fill a vacancy in the Western District of North Carolina is one that was reported without opposition by the Judiciary Committee both last year and, again, earlier this year.  Besides this nomination, there are two nominees ready to fill vacancies in the District of Columbia. Recently, Seth Stern reported in Congressional Quarterly criticism from Chief Judge Lamberth of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, who warned that the breakdown in the judicial confirmation process is ``injuring the country.'' The two judicial nominees to fill longstanding vacancies for his court are still waiting for final consideration by the Senate. They, too, were reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee last year and again this year. They, too, are being needlessly delayed. The Senate should consider and confirm them without further delay. I will ask that a copy of the article be printed in the Record.  Also reported from the Judiciary Committee and before the Senate are nominees to fill a judicial emergency vacancy in New York, a judicial emergency vacancy on the Second Circuit and a judicial vacancy in Oregon. They should be debated and confirmed without delay, as well. Earlier today, the Judiciary Committee moved forward to vote on two additional Federal circuit nominees and four additional district court nominees. They are now available to the Senate for its consideration, as well.  After the confirmation of Mr. Cogburn, there will be 11 judicial nominees left waiting for Senate consideration having been reviewed by the Judiciary Committee. We are holding hearings every two weeks and hope finally to begin to bend the curve and start to lower judicial vacancies across the country. We can do that if the Senate continues to consider judicial nominations in regular order as they are reported by the Judiciary Committee.  Federal judicial vacancies around the country still number too many and they have persisted for too long. That is why Chief Justice Roberts, Attorney General Holder, White House Counsel Bob Bauer and many others--including the President of the United States--have spoken out and urged the Senate to act.  Nearly one out of every eight Federal judgeships remains vacant. This puts at serious risk the ability of all Americans to have a fair hearing in court. The real price being paid for these unnecessary delays is that the judges that remain are overburdened and the American people who depend on them are being denied hearings and justice in a timely fashion.  Regrettably, the progress we made during the first 2 years of the Bush administration has not been duplicated, and the progress we made over the 8 years from 2001 to 2009 to reduce judicial vacancies from 110 to a low of 34 was reversed. The vacancy rate we reduced from 10 percent at the end of President Clinton's term to less than 4 percent in 2008 has now risen back to over 10 percent. In contrast to the sharp reduction in vacancies we made during President Bush's first 2 years when the Democratically controlled Senate confirmed 100 of his judicial nominations, only 60 of President Obama's judicial nominations were allowed to be considered and confirmed during his first 2 years. We have not kept up with the rate of attrition, let alone brought the vacancies down. By now they should have been cut in half. Instead, they continue to hover around 100.  The Senate must do better. The Nation cannot afford further delays by the Senate in taking action on the nominations pending before it. Judicial vacancies on courts throughout the country hinder the Federal judiciary's ability to fulfill its constitutional role. They create a backlog of cases that prevents people from having their day in court. This is unacceptable.  We can consider and confirm this President's nominations to the Federal bench in a timely manner. President Obama has worked with Democratic and Republican home state Senators to identify superbly qualified, consensus nominations. None of the nominations on the Executive Calendar are controversial. They all have the support of their home State Senators, Republicans and Democrats. All have a strong commitment to the rule of law and a demonstrated faithfulness to the Constitution.  During President Bush's first term, his first 4 tumultuous years in office, we proceeded to confirm 205 of his judicial nominations. We confirmed 100 of those during the 17 months I was Chairman during President Bush's first 2 years in office. So far in President Obama's third year in office, the Senate has only been allowed to consider 71 of his Federal circuit and district court nominees. We remain well short of the benchmark we set during the Bush administration. When we approach it we can reduce vacancies from the historically high levels at which they have remained throughout these first three years of the Obama administration to the historically low level we reached toward the end of the Bush administration.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the article to which I referred.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:       [From CQ Today Online News--Legal Affairs, Feb. 28, 2011]   Judges: `Totally Broken' Confirmation Process Causing `Dire' Case                                 Backlogs                            (By Seth Stern)       Two federal judges criticized the slow pace of judicial      confirmations Monday, saying cases are backlogged and judges      overwhelmed at the trial court level.       Speaking at a Brookings Institution event on judicial      nominations, Royce Lamberth, the chief judge of the U.S.      District Court for the District of Columbia, said the      confirmation process is ``totally broken'' and that the      pattern of ``paybacks and the bickering have been thoroughly      bipartisan.''       Lamberth, who was appointed by President Ronald Reagan in      1987, raised similar concerns in a speech in March 2009, just      after the start of the Obama administration. But he said he      was increasingly concerned by the delays in the confirmation      of federal trial judges, which has only worsened in the two      years since.       ``I say to both Democrats and Republicans, you are injuring      the country,'' Lamberth said.       Lamberth was joined on the panel by William Furgeson Jr., a      Texas district court judge who said judges' growing caseloads      resulting from the vacancies in his district in western Texas      are a ``desperate problem'' that results in ``assembly-line      justice.''       Furgeson called the situation on the border ``dire,''      adding it was a ``giant mystery'' why senators now fight over      trial court judges.       Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. had also emphasized the      ``persistent problem'' of vacancies on the federal bench in      his annual report on the state of the judiciary released in      December.       ``Each political party has found it easy to turn on a dime      from decrying to defending the blocking of judicial      nominations, depending on their changing political      fortunes,'' Roberts wrote in the report.       Only 67 percent of Obama's district court nominees were      confirmed during his first two years in office, compared to      92 percent for George W. Bush and 87 percent for Bill      Clinton, according to statistics compiled by Russell Wheeler,      a visiting fellow at the liberal-leaning Brookings      Institution, and 83 of 677 district court seats were vacant      as of Feb. 25.       The Senate has confirmed six district court judges so far      this year, including two more Monday: Amy Totenberg and Steve      C. Jones to the Northern District of Georgia.       On Wednesday, the Senate Judiciary Committee will hold a      second confirmation hearing for President Obama's most      controversial judicial nominee: Goodwin Liu, who was first      nominated for a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th      Circuit in 2009.       The University of California law professor has faced      intense criticism from Republicans for his liberal views and      for repeatedly amending the materials he has provided to the      Judiciary Committee.
