I take back my time. The gentleman raised a sore point here. On TEA-21 and AIR-21, you took discretionary money and you put it into mandatory accounts and you created a problem for our Members who wanted programs in our transportation bill. You took that money into those programs, you reduced the amount of discretionary money available, and then in the few dollars we had left when the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Rogers) brought a transportation appropriations bill on the floor here this year with some Members' projects in it, you sat right there and you, by a point of order, struck all of those projects. Do not tell me what you have done to appropriations bills.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend, the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Rogers), who is chairman of the Subcommittee on Transportation of the Committee on Appropriations.
