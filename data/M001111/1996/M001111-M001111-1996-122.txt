 President, yesterday, I was privileged to see and hear a dramatic presentation by four high school sophomores from my home State of Washington. They performed a short dramatic work, with choral music, in my office for me and my staff. They had no fancy stage lights or microphones or curtains. They had simple costumes, and no stage make-up. Yet, they created true magic. It was emotional, powerful, and indicative of what young people can do if given half a chance.  These four young women, Dallas Milholland, Cynthia Ward, Kristin Allen-Zito, and Malissa Kobbevik, came to Washington, DC, from their home 3,000 miles away in Bellingham, WA, to compete in the National History Day Finals. The presentation they created was entitled ``Focus of Concern: Breaking the Silence Surrounding Battered Women.''  They researched the plight of battered women throughout history. They examined the accounts of women's ill-treatment, and the silence, ignorance, and approval of such treatment. They also looked at the rise of concern about domestic violence and passage and enforcement of laws to protect women against it.  These four young women wrote the script, adapted the accompanying music for beautiful three-part harmony, chose the subdued black costumes, and did the understated blocking and choreography. They performed before national judges, and other students from around the country.  This morning, they called and told me that they have been chosen as the National Champions of the National History Day Competition. I know the Presiding Officer is as proud of these four young women from Washington State as I am.  The teachers and students of Bellingham High School, and those on Vashon Island, in Port Angeles, and Richland, who also brought their terrific History Day projects to the competition, should all be proud. The people of Bellingham, of Washington State, and all Americans should be very proud of these four young women from Bellingham, and all those who made their great victory possible.  What their performance teaches every person who sees it is that domestic violence is an overpowering presence in the lives of too many women and children, almost as hard to outlive as his to live through. As these young women point out in their presentation, ``During the 10 minutes of (our) presentation, 66 women have been beaten. Sometime during the next 3 hours, one of these women will die.''  To quote further: ``During the 13 years of the Vietnam war, 58,000 American service personnel died on the battlefield. During the same time period, 54,000 American women were killed by their domestic partners.''  Their performance teaches that with brutality against women, as with all brutality in the human experience, there are times of concern, when actions happen, and there are times of silence, or worse, times when brutality is condoned. Each of us needs to be responsible to call 911 when we hear the sounds of domestic violence in our neighborhoods. Each of us needs to be responsible to value women and their young children. Each of us needs to tell young girls that they deserve and should expect better.  We must become aware that every day women are beaten, pushed, and threatened by those they love: and they are too afraid to admit ``someone I love is hurting me.''  This performance also teaches something about the power of a relevant education. Young people learn best when they see relevance to their own lives outside the classroom, relevance to their current interests, and relevance to their future careers.  These young women are talented, interested, and powerful. They are not, however, alone, and they are not unique. Behind these four young women are four families, and at least one great teacher who gave them a chance. A chance to do something adults these days don't seem to expect from American students--strive for excellence.  Every student can benefit from seeing this performance. Every student can also benefit from being given a chance to work hard for something that they truly care about. Whether it's a book, a social cause, a business idea, a sport or hobby--we must encourage young people to see the connections.  These young people from my State are incredible. They can help us solve the problems facing this country, so can all the other children in this country today.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the text of the script from the students at Bellingham High School be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                       ``Battered Women''--Script       4 girls standing in darkness with backs to audience.

D: Puritan leaders take a stand against family violence      because they believe that it weakens the community and      offends God. Citizens are encouraged to watch neighbors. To      stop domestic violence as it occurs and report these cases to      the authorities.       K: The church strongly supports this stand. Puritan      Preacher Cotton Mather.       M: ``For a man to beat his wife is as bad as any sacrilege.      Any such rascal were better buried alive than to show his      face among his neighbors.

K: 1871: The court rules:       M: ``The privilege, ancient though it may be, to beat her      with a stick, to pull out her hair, to choke her, to spit in      her face, to kick her about the floor, is not acknowledged by      law.''       D: Suffragists realize that although this law clearly      forbids wife abuse, society does not consider wife abuse a      crime and so it goes unpunished and unabated.       K: 1876.       C: Lucy Stone, editor of the Women's Journal takes a stand      against the ineffectiveness of these laws by demanding that      they be backed by appropriate penalties.       D: ``The law for the use of the whipping post should exist      in every State.

D: But over time, public interest wanes. Although laws      exist to protect women, public apathy renders these mandates      useless and for the next 70 years a silence of indifference      drowns out the prayers of women.       CDK: Song: ``Empty Eyes With No More Tears To Cry.''       M: A time of silence.       D: 1967. A desperate woman calls the police.       C: ``My boyfriend is mad at me, he's going to beat me up.''       D: The dispatcher replies:       K: ``Call us again when he does.''       M: The Civil Rights movement of the 1960's focuses public      attention on the rights of minorities including the rights of      women. The feminists movement of the 1970's continues this      struggle. One of it's issues, public and judicial support for      battered women.       D: Time and time again the terror of abuse pushes women to      desperation. Without support from neighbors, police, or the      judicial system. Women are pushed into violent acts of their      own.       K: A focus of concern: 1977.       C: Francine Hughes, battered wife of 15 years takes the      only stand she can. She douses her husband's bed with gas      while he sleeps. Francine lights a match and is finally freed      from his abuse.       K: Jennifer Patri. Evelyn Ware. Sharon McNearny.

All: Shot and killed her husband.       K: It is tragic that these women are left alone to take      such drastic measures. However the stands which they take      shatter the silence surrounding wife abuse and screams for      society's intervention.       D: Eventually society does intervene and significant      changes occur.       K: Public awareness, concern and support for battered      women.       M: The issuance of ex parte protection orders.       C: Mandatory arrest laws and criminal penalties for      perpetrators.       M: Shelters and legal services for women in crisis.       K: We are told that history repeats itself and we have seen      how the issue of wife abuse has cycled through the public's      conscience. The time to stop that cycle is now while battered      women are still a focus of concern.       M: During the 10 minutes of this presentation, 66 women      have been beaten.       K: Sometime during the next 3 hours one of these women will      die.       D: Will we again allow the silence to fall?       [All spots off.]       CDK: Song: ``Crying Jesus Help Me.''       [single spot on.]       M: ``Today in my small natural body I sit and learn, my      woman's body, like yours, target on any street taken from me      at the age of 12. I watch a woman dare, I dare to watch a      woman, we dare to raise our voices.'' Victim 1975.       C: Song: ``Can You Hear * * *''       K: Can you hear the prayers of the women?       D: or is the silence too loud?       [spot off/close.]
