President, I rise today to join my colleagues in introducing the Promoting Health in Rural Areas Act of 1999.  Health care today is at a crossroads. Rural communities face significant challenges in their efforts to recruit and retain health care providers. Hospitals and other health care facilities are facing increasing pressure from Medicare reductions. In 1997, Congress passed significant changes to the Medicare program in an effort to preserve the program for future generations. A new Congressional Budget Report says we are exceeding our expectations. In fact, since the beginning of the fiscal year in October, Medicare spending was $2.6 billion less than the amount spent in the similar period last year.  While this is good news for the fiscal integrity of the Medicare program, I am concerned about the unintended effects these reductions are having on the beneficiaries who depend on Medicare for health care services. It doesn't do much good to ``save'' the program if providers can no longer afford to deliver the services and beneficiaries are no longer able to access these services.  A new review by Ernst & Young reports that total hospital Medicare margins are expected to decline from 4.3 percent in fiscal year 1997 to only 0.1 percent in this fiscal year and remain below three percent through 2002.  Even more shocking is that total hospital margins for small, rural hospitals are expected to fall from 4.3 percent in fiscal year 1998 to negative 5.6 percent by fiscal year 2002, an amazing decline of 233 percent. Kansas hospitals are expected to lose over $530 million. I simply don't think our rural health system can survive any more reductions.  The Promoting Health in Rural Areas Act of 1999 will help to improve access, increase choice, and improve the quality of care provided in rural America.  Health care providers in rural areas generally serve a large number of Medicare patients. However, Medicare reimbursement to rural providers is not adequate to cover the costs of these services. This measure takes steps to ensure fair Medicare and Medicaid payments to rural providers by targeting those hospitals with special designations in rural areas. Provisions are included to increase payments and improve the Sole Community Hospital, Medicare Dependent Hospital, and Critical Access Hospital programs. In addition, these special facilities are exempt from a new outpatient reimbursement system that is being developed by the Health Care Financing Administration.  The Promoting Health in Rural Areas Act of 1999 also strengthens health professional recruitment programs and gives communities a chance to begin recruitment efforts before a crisis hits. Under current law, a community must effectively lose a physician before they qualify for recruitment assistance as a shortage area.  This measure also takes steps to encourage the use of telehealth, a critical piece of the rural health infrastructure. Under current law, HCFA limits reimbursement to four groups of services. This bill will expand reimbursement to include any services currently covered by Medicare in a rural area. In addition, the bill authorizes a new grant/loan program for telemedicine activities in rural areas.  Compromise is a way of life for rural Americans. Rural residents have fewer choices of physicians or hospitals. Rural providers must settle for fewer medical colleagues to rely on for consultation and support.  However, rural communities can no longer compromise. The regulatory burden is too much. Payments are too low. There simply isn't any more ``fat'' in the system.  Mr. President, I fear this is only the tip of the iceberg. As payment changes continue to be implemented and HCFA continues to issue new regulations and paperwork burdens, rural communities are going to suffer the most. In fact, many may not survive. We are already losing home health agencies at an alarming rate. Are hospitals the next to go?  I am committed to efforts to preserve access to health care services for all Kansans. We can do this if we simply focus on practical reforms that takeinto account the realities of practicing medicine in rural states like Kansas. We can guarantee access to quality health care services if we make changes now. We can't afford to wait. I urge my colleagues to join me today in supporting this legislation and look forward to working together to enact common sense solutions--before it's too late.                                 ______                                       By
