 President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). Without objection, it is so ordered.  Under the previous order, all time is expired.  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the Rosenstein nomination?  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
