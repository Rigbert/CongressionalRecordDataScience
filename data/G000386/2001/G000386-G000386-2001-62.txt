 President, I come to this Chamber to address an issue that was discussed yesterday. I do it because I am the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee. I want to respond to some Senators on the other side of the aisle--meaning the majority side of the aisle--who have raised concerns about legislation that I have put forth as part of a stimulus package. I put forth this legislation for our Republican caucus in my capacity as former chairman and now ranking member of the Finance Committee. So I want to respond, first, to the majority leader's and Budget Committee chairman's comments about the Senate Republican caucus proposal.  From my point of view, these comments were destructive of bipartisanship. The attacks came yesterday afternoon on the floor, following a news conference that was held on the Capitol grounds. In contrast, while these things were going on yesterday, I spent time working for an agreement that crossed party lines; in other words, for a bipartisan agreement.  In fact, for a number of weeks, the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Baucus, and I have been meeting in an attempt to find an agreement on a stimulus package.  Last week, Senator Daschle and Senator Baucus released a stimulus proposal that, as they indicated, clearly reflected the more liberal part of the Democratic caucus. Senator Baucus made it clear that it was basically a negotiating position and that he would be willing to move to the center.  The proposal was released as a position for the Democratic caucus. It was made very clear in statements, well-intentioned on the part of Senator Baucus, that it was basically a negotiating position and that he would be willing to move to the center, or saw that as necessary as part of the process to get legislation through the Senate.  In general, Republicans such as myself reacted constructively to the proposal. I was quoted in the press accordingly. I disagreed with the proposal Senator Baucus put forward, but I recognized it as an essential part of a process of getting a bill through the Senate. I saw it as a positive step. Quite frankly, I viewed it as a response to the bill that passed the House of Representatives.  On Tuesday of this week, we Republicans responded to the Democratic caucus position with one from our own caucus. From our point of view, it mirrored the President's stimulus plan. What kind of a reception did we get after we released our plan? In this era of bipartisanship and collegiality, something bad happened. The attack dogs were unleashed and with a fury. The same day, Senator Daschle harshly attacked our proposal in an extremely partisan, stilted manner.  The next afternoon, which was yesterday, Senator Conrad was on the floor with the usual props he has--he uses them well--ferociously denouncing the Senate Republican proposal. Rather than recognizing the proposal as part of the process, as we Republicans viewed the Democratic proposal, the Democrats instead have turned up the partisan heat and are trying to torch any real plan that will help our economy and our country.  One has to wonder why we have such a double standard. Why is it that one side obsessively attacks the other, that fault is not found on that side?  Senator Daschle, along with Senator Lott, has exercised leadership since September 11. This had been a most important feature of doing business in Washington, DC, in these times of anxiety while we are trying to win the war on terrorism. The tone, as much as the substance, has been critical to the success of the process.  Senator Daschle himself said we should not be ``strident'' in these times of trying to win a war. So you can imagine my surprise, even anger, and surely disappointment, when I read the tone of Senator Daschle's attack on the plan and, frankly, on me in press reports. Basically, Senator Daschle accused me of unilaterally stopping the stimulus process, particularly as it related to Republicans and Democrats working out a bipartisan agreement.  I will read the quote into the Record:       We've waited in an effort to try and find a way to work in      a bipartisan manner. Unfortunately, as a result of Grassley's      decision yesterday . . . that will not be possible, at least      in the short run . . .  I focus on Senator Daschle's quote because it is a bit ironic. As he was criticizing me, I was preparing for a meeting with Senator Baucus on the stimulus package. I guess if you ignore the fact that Democrats put out a partisan package last week, then Senator Daschle's quote would make some sense. But, of course, that is not true. So Senator Daschle seems to be saying that it is fine for Democrats to put out a caucus position and Republicans to be constructive, but if Republicans respond with our own caucus position, then that is partisanship. The Republican response justifies ramping up the content and the tone of the partisan rhetoric.  The American people expect better. They know a double standard when they see it. Let's get back to the tone Senator Daschle set earlier. That is what I am asking for; that is a very good tone.  Let's not descend to name calling, destructive partisan comments, and double standards.  Now I move to Senator Conrad's attacks which occurred yesterday afternoon. Let me say, this is a preliminary response to Senator Conrad's attack on the Senate Republican caucus plan. I will have a lot more to say on that later, particularly after I get some figures back from the Joint Committee on Taxation.  Senator Conrad spent a lot of time yesterday developing charts that were critical of Senate Republican caucus positions which he personalized by calling it the Grassley plan. He personalized his attacks, and that should be avoided. He decided to appoint himself as the teacher and accordingly grade everyone's economic stimulus proposal. That is fine. He has that right. I don't have a problem with that. If he is going to be the grader, though, I think he needs to be objective. He needs to treat those plans that he opposes the same way he treats those plans he supports. He does not do that.  The report card Senator Conrad used yesterday is not the whole set of principles upon which the budgeteers agreed.  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a copy of the budgeteers' documents.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                    Principles for Economic Stimulus       The Chairmen and Ranking Members of the House and Senate      Budget Committees recognize the extraordinary circumstances      resulting from the September 11, 2001 attacks on our country.      These terrorist attacks have created a national emergency,      instigated a war on terrorism, and exacerbated     a slowdown in the economy. Clearly, the Congress and the      President will provide the resources necessary to respond to      these events. The principles articulated below are simply      intended to ensure that those resources provided by the      Congress and the President be an effective economic stimulus      package that does not erode fiscal discipline in the future.       Overall principle. An economic stimulus package should be      based on the recognition that long-term fiscal discipline is      essential to sustained economic growth. Measures to stimulate      the economy should be limited in time so that as the economy      recovers, the budget regains a surplus that is at least equal      to the surplus in Social Security. Any short-term economic      stimulus should not result in higher long-term interest      rates.       Objectives. An economic stimulus package should restore      consumer and business confidence, increase employment and      investment, and help those most vulnerable in an economic      downturn, and do all of the above without converting a      cyclical deficit into a structural deficit.       Timing. Congress should assemble an economic stimulus      package deliberatively but with dispatch, aiming for passage      within 3-4 weeks, based on the best economic data available.       Rapid impact. A substantial portion of the fiscal impact on      the economy should be felt within 6 months.       Sunset. All economic stimulus proposals should sunset      within 1 year, to the extent practicable.       Targets. Economic stimulus should be broad-based rather      than industry-specific. Policies should achieve the greatest      possible stimulus effect per dollar spent and should be      directed to individuals who are most likely to spend the      additional after-tax income and businesses most likely to      increase investment spending and employment.       Size. The economic stimulus package should equal      approximately 1 percent of GDP (about $100 billion) but      should count the budgetary effects of policies implemented      since August, which, at present, total roughly $40 billion.       Offsets. To uphold the policy of repaying the greatest      amount of national debt feasible between 2002-2011, outyear      offsets should make up over time for the cost of near-term      economic stimulus.
