Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 804) condemning the unauthorized, inappropriate, and coerced ordination of Catholic bishops by the People's Republic of China, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:                              H. Res. 804       Whereas the Catholic Patriotic Association of China is a      government-sanctioned organization that does not represent      the majority of Chinese Catholics, and has been used by the      Government of the People's Republic of China to oppress      Catholics who choose to remain loyal to the Pope as their      spiritual leader;       Whereas on April 30, 2006, the Chinese Government-     sanctioned Catholic Patriotic Association of China conducted      an unauthorized episcopal ordination of the priest Joseph Ma      Yinglin, elevating him to the office of bishop without the      approval and against the wishes of the Holy Father Pope      Benedict XVI;       Whereas on May 3, 2006, the Chinese Government-sanctioned      Catholic Patriotic Association of China conducted an      unauthorized episcopal ordination of the priest Joseph Liu      Xinhong, elevating him to the office of bishop without the      approval and against the wishes of the Holy Father Pope      Benedict XVI;       Whereas on May 14, 2006, the Chinese Government-sanctioned      Catholic Patriotic Association of China installed Bishop      Vincent Zhan Silu as Bishop of Mindong Diocese without the      approval and against the wishes of the Holy Father Pope      Benedict XVI;       Whereas, according to information reported by the Vatican,      bishops and priests in the People's Republic of China have      been subjected to strong pressures and threats to take part      in the episcopal ordinations which, being without pontifical      mandate, are illicit and, besides, contrary to their      conscience;       Whereas the entire world follows with attention the      progress of religious freedom in China and had hoped that      such deplorable episodes by now would belong to the past;       Whereas, following a trip to China in August 2005, the      United States Commission on International Religious Freedom      reported that the Chinese Government continues to      systematically violate the right to freedom of thought,      conscience, and religion or belief, contravening both the      Chinese Constitution and international human rights norms;       Whereas on May 3, 2006, the United States Commission on      International Religious Freedom announced its 2006      recommendations to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and      continued to identify China as one of ten ``Countries of      Particular Concern'';       Whereas Chinese law and policy restrict religious      activities to those activities associated with the five      officially-sanctioned ``patriotic'' religious organizations;       Whereas all other collective religious activities in China      are illegal, and individuals from ``unregistered'' religious      groups are subject to harassment, detention, and arrest;       Whereas freedom of religious expression is a fundamental      right enshrined in the United States Constitution and      recognized by all civilized nations; and       Whereas China, like all members of the United Nations, is      bound by Article 18 of the Uniform Declaration of Human      Rights which states: ``Everyone has the right to freedom of      thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom      to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone      or in community with others and in public or private, to      manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice,      worship and observance'': Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That the House of Representatives--       (1) condemns, in the strongest possible terms, the actions      of the Government of the People's Republic of China to coerce      Catholic bishops in China, both those in the Catholic      Patriotic Association of China and those who remain loyal to      the Pope, to violate their consciences and consecrate bishops      in defiance of Rome;       (2) extends its deepest sympathy and condolences to the      Catholic population of China and the Catholic Church for this      insult to their beliefs and religious practices;       (3) reaffirms the right of all religious organizations to      choose their leaders in a manner that is free of      intimidation, terror, or coercion in accordance with Article      18 of the Uniform Declaration of Human Rights;       (4) urges the Government of China to end its repression of      religious organizations, recognize the ecclesiastical      authority of religious leaders to provide spiritual      leadership to their followers, and end the practice of only      allowing religious worship through state-sanctioned patriotic      religious associations; and       (5) encourages the Government of China to refrain from      additional ordination of Catholic bishops while the Vatican      and the Catholic Patriotic Association of China resolve their      differences and adopt a mutually acceptable process for      approving the elevation of bishops.
