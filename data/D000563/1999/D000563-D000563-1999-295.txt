I want to speak to the Bond amendment and I certainly yield to the chair of the subcommittee for his comments on the Robb amendment.  Is it appropriate to ask unanimous consent that after the Senator fromWashington completes his remarks, I be given no more than 10 minutes to respond to the Robb amendment?
