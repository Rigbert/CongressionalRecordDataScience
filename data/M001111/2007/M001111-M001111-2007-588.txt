 President, if I can inform our colleagues, we are in the process of working to get a unanimous consent agreement to move the two votes that were scheduled for 2 o'clock to 2:30 p.m. We are going to be putting that together. We should have it in just a few minutes. If our colleagues will allow us to let Senator Boxer continue for a few minutes, we will have that put together.
