Chairman, I withdraw my point of order, since the amendment is germane, and I rise in opposition to the amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I cannot believe that the gentlewoman from Texas would draft an amendment of this nature and submit it to the committee for its consideration.  It says, ``This act shall have no effect if there are more than five convicted child offenders within any given ZIP code.'' That means that if there are five child sex offenders who are convicted under this law and sent to the penitentiary for life, there are five people in the ZIP code where the penitentiary is located, and every future child sex offender would be able to run around the country in Federal areas and be able to continue preying on these children.  Stop and think about how this amendment is drafted. It is drafted so that anyplace where there is a penitentiary that has five or more child sex offenders, it would end up taking away the effect of this law throughout the United States of America.  This is a shameful amendment, and I hope it is overwhelmingly rejected.
