Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  The amendment would simply make an exception for the taking of property that is categorized as a brownfield under Federal law, meaning it is a site that contains or is perceived to contain hazardous contaminants. I support the adoption of the amendment and commend the gentleman from California for introducing it.
