 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a brave young man who just returned from a tour of duty in Iraq. Rodney ``Jimmy'' Estes II is from my hometown of Louisville, KY. A few months ago, Jimmy was dressed in fatigues fighting the war on terror in the Iraqi desert. But today, you can find him wearing red and white and playing football for the University of Louisville Cardinals--my favorite team.  Jimmy Estes, a 1998 graduate of St. Xavier High School, turned down a football scholarship to Georgetown College to follow in his grandfather's footsteps--to serve in the U.S. Marine Corps. The day after graduation, he left Kentucky for boot camp at Parris Island. And on January 7, 2003, Jimmy was called to active duty.  As a member of the Alpha Company, 8th Tank Battalion, Jimmy was on the front lines in An Nasiriyah, Iraq. During his time in the country, he experienced some of the war's most intense fighting. In his tank, he worked as the loader and operated the 240-millimeter gun on top of the vehicle. Jimmy and his comrades are unsung heroes in one of our troops' finest hours. They were the lead tank in the rescue mission of PVT Jessica Lynch.  To pass the hours in Iraq, Jimmy played football with his fellow soldiers, reminding him of his lifelong dream--to play football for the University of Louisville Cardinals. Following his tour of duty, which ended this past May, Jimmy returned home and enrolled at U of L. Determined to play football, Jimmy spent his summer preparing to try out for one of four walk-on positions. And just like on the battlefield, Jimmy succeeded. Not only is he a wide receiver on his university's football team, he also continues to serve his Nation as a Marine reservist.  Jimmy's bravery, humility, and determination should be commended. On behalf of this grateful Nation, I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Corporal Estes for his dedicated service. As a proud U of L alum and most importantly, a football fan, I wish Jimmy and his teammates a winning season. Go Cards!  I ask unanimous consent that the article, ``For Jimmy Estes, that was war; this is football'' from my hometown paper, The Courier-Journal, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:          [From the Louisville Courier-Journal, Oct. 10, 2003]            For Jimmy Estes, That Was War; This Is Football                             (By Pat Forde)       The war wasn't so bad until bedtime.       Jimmy Estes spent the dusty desert days in the company of      his M1A1 Abrams tank crew or with the other members of Alpha      Company, 8th Tank Battalion. On the dull days the Marines      opened care packages or talked about family, sports and what      they'd give for cold water and hot showers. On the deadly      days they went out and killed Iraqis because it was their      job, and when the battles around An Nasiriyah were done, the      soldiers rehashed them in detached terms.       But at the end of the day, when Cpl. Rodney J. Estes II      would lie down and stare up at the inky Arabian night, he was      alone with the whole thing. It was just him and the horror:      the dead women and children, the dogs tugging at corpses, the      Iraqis he personally shot in combat, the bullets they shot at      him that pinged off the tank's armor.       It was just him and the heroism: Estes and his mates rode      the lead tank on the famous Jessica Lynch rescue mission,      laying down fire and securing the perimeter before Army      Rangers and Navy SEALs went into Saddam Hussein General      Hospital to retrieve America's most famous POW.       He took all of it to bed with him.       ``Those were some lonely nights,'' Estes said.       It was during those lonely nights that he made a vow: ``If      I get out of here and make it home alive, I'm going to do it.      ``       Go to college. And play football. For his hometown team,      the University of Louisville.       Today Jimmy Estes is alive and well and a 23-year-old walk-     on wide receiver for the Cardinals.       He saw enough death in the desert to learn that dreams can      come with an expiration date--probably not one of your      choosing. A young man who had drifted along without plan or      purpose since graduating from St.Xavier High School in 1998      had an epiphany in Iraq.       ``Absolutely, it changed me,'' said Estes, who hadn't      played organized football in six years. ``I kind of piddled      around at jobs here and there, not anything I'd call a      career. If I hadn't gotten deployed, to be honest, I don't      know where I'd be right now.       ``I don't take things for granted like I used to. I realize      how lucky I am. I realize life can end.''       Now his life is just restarting. He is a justice      administration major in the classroom, with designs on      becoming a football coach. On the field he is a humble      freshman who hasn't even dressed out for a game.       Yet there is no bigger hero in the U of L football program.       Said offensive lineman Will Rabatin, Estes' friend since      grade school: ``I'm proud to know him.''       No more proud than Estes is to have this long-shot college      football experience. Think of all the coddled athletes out      there, complaining that a full ride isn't enough. Then listen      to Estes, who's been through more than those guys can ever      imagine and now cherishes the chance to pay his way      through college and play on the scout team.       ``He's just a great kid to have around,'' said offensive      coordinator and wide receivers coach Paul Petrino. ``Every      day when we start out doing ball drills, he has a lot of      enthusiasm, a lot of fire. You can tell he loves being      here.''       ``I look forward to going out there every day,'' Estes      said. ``I really appreciate the opportunity. It's just so      great to be a part of it.''       In the weeks before the invasion of Iraq, the Marines      played touch football in Kuwait all the time. Tankers against      tank maintenance. In combat boots. In the desert.       Talk about your sandlot games.       For Estes, this was a continuation of his life long love of      sports. When he played flag football in grade school, all the      kids on the sidelines were squirting each other with water      bottles, oblivious to the game. Jimmy was running the      sidelines, keeping pace with the action and imploring his      coaches to put him in.       When he was 6 he persuaded his father, Rodney, a retired      Louisville police officer, to get him out of school early for      the first two days of the NCAA basketball tournament. Jimmy      sat in front of the television from noon until midnight each      day, transfixed.       At age 7 he was reading Sports Illustrated cover to cover.       Later on he played at St. Martha for Rabatin's father, once      catching the winning     touchdown pass in the Toy Bowl. Then it was on to St. X,      where he played little his final year after a disagreement      with the coaches.       ``He just didn't have a positive experience,'' his father      said. ``Part of that was his fault.''       Estes' only football option was a partial scholarship to      Georgetown College. He turned it down to follow in his      grandfather's footsteps--into the Marine Corps and into a      tank.       ``That broke my heart when he didn't take that scholarship      to Georgetown,'' Rodney Estes said. ``You know how you      envision going down there on Saturdays to watch your son and      walk around campus?''       Instead, a day after graduation from St. X, Estes was off      to Parris Island for boot camp as a Marine reservist. Higher      education--and football--flickered out of sight.       In 1999 he had talked to UofL assistant Greg Nord and then-     coach John L. Smith about walking on, but he never followed      through. He worked a job here and a job there and performed      his duties with the reserves. Life was standing still.       ``He kind of had his head up his--in other words,'' said      Lance Cpl. Nick Rassano, a 2000 Trinity graduate who was in      the same tank in the Middle East with Estes.       Then last Jan. 7, the phone rang at Ruby Tuesday, where      Estes was bartending. The order was expected but still      jarring: Report for active duty.       He told his family the news at dinner that night. Two days      later he was gone--but not without some prescient final words      from his father.       ``Remember,'' Rodney Estes told his oldest son, ``the way      you handle yourself out there probably says a lot about how      you'll handle the rest of your life.''       First stop was Camp Lejeune, N.C. Then he was on a ship 30      days to Kuwait, for a month of preparation, some touch      football and the last decent meals for a long time.       Finally, after a month in Kuwait, Estes and the rest of the      American military force invaded Iraq.       ``I was a policeman 25 years, and I'm not the kind of guy      who gets overly worried,'' Rodney Estes said. ``But I tell      you, that night he left I thought, `This could be the last      night I ever see him.' When your own kid goes off, that puts      you through some changes.       ``I'd wake up in the middle of the night and watch CNN. I      watched so much TV I was about to drive myself crazy.''       Over in Iraq, the A-8 Marines were pushing hard toward An      Nasiriyah and what ultimately would be some of the most      intense fighting of the war. The first day of combat was the      worst, as Estes watched a rocket-propelled grenade blow up an      American vehicle and kill several soldiers.       He said they arrived in the area to find the streets      flooded with sewage that stalled half of Alpha Company's 14      tanks--including his, christened the ``Think Tank'' because      of the crew's propensity for making maintenance errors.       When the tanks bogged down, the Iraqis lit up. They were      firing on foot, from orange-and-white taxis and from SUVs.       Estes was the loader in his tank but also was charged with      manning the 240-millimeter gun on top of the vehicle. With      the upper half of his body in view, he exchanged fire with      the enemy.       Welcome to the terror and exhilaration of warfare, Cpl.      Estes.       ``It was a heck of an adrenaline rush,'' he said. ``I was      scared, excited, all those things. I think of it like going      into a big game, only times 100. Obviously, the stakes are      much higher.       ``You get a sick feeling in the pit of your stomach. I      didn't freeze or tense up, but I definitely had      butterflies.''       Asked if he personally shot anyone, Estes looked down      briefly and answered yes. There was no bravado in his voice.       ``The first time you see somebody get hit with a round is a      crazy feeling,'' he said. ``It's a sick feeling. But when you      sign up to be a Marine, that's something you obviously know      can be part of the job.       ``I can't sit here and describe the feelings you get. I can      tell you what I saw, but in no way does it simulate what it      was like.''       There is no simulation. Just late-night assimilation--     alone, lying on your back and staring at the sky in a strange      and dangerous land.       One day the Think Tank crewmen got the call to be part of a      hush-hush mission. They were to be the lead among three tanks      escorting a group of Special Ops forces into town. It had the      potential to be dangerous. Estes' tank commander had him      clear out space inside the tank, in case they needed it to      transport bodies.       They originally were told that the target was a Saddam      look-alike. They had no idea that they were going to play a      part in the most dramatic--and later controversial--event in      the war.       In the early hours of April 1, their tank led a group of      other vehicles carrying Special Operation Unit Task Force 20      into Nasiriyah, storming into position around the hospital.      Night-vision goggles on, Estes laid down suppression fire      with the 240-mm gun for a few minutes and set up a perimeter      before the Rangers and SEALs went in.       Lynch was rushed out and loaded onto a helicopter, though      most involved in the rescue still didn't know the particulars      of what happened. Estes' tank remained in position for hours      afterward.       At one point he was told to hand some Special Ops soldiers      a tank shovel. They used it to dig up a shallow grave outside      the hospital, locating the bodies of several Americans from      Lynch's 507th Maintenance Company.       It wasn't until days later that the Think Tank crew was      able to piece together the story and realize that their      mission was the rescue dominating news coverage at home.       ``We didn't realize how big a deal it was until we saw it      on the cover of Newsweek,'' Rassano said.       To Estes the mission was important for one other reason: He      never again discharged his weapon. A series of moves to other      cities resulted in nothing more noteworthy than a couple of      utterly uneventful weeks guarding a bridge.       With the action centralizing on Baghdad, there wasn't much      to do other than reading the Sports Illustrateds and eating      the beef jerky sent from home. Finally, Alpha Company pulled      out and returned to Kuwait on May 5.       The war was over for Cpl. Estes. It was time to act on his      vow.       During the interminable 38-day voyage back to America,      Estes e-mailed his father and told him his plans: He was      going to enroll at U of L and walk on to the football team.      Rodney Estes was thrilled.       Jimmy returned to Kentucky on July 2, and he and the rest      of his battalion were feted at Fort Knox. He obviously was      thrilled to see his family--his father, mother, stepmother,      stepsister and two half-siblings.       Especially his 11-year-old half-sister, Jennifer Estes. He      thought of her often when he saw children her age caught in      the calamity of war.       ``He's crazy about her,'' Jimmy's dad said. ``He's not      exactly a sensitive kid by any stretch of the imagination,      but I think some of the things he saw over there affected      him.''       To help put the war behind, Estes plunged into his future      plans. After about a week of acclimation, he began working      out six days a week toward his goal of becoming a Cardinal.       A depressing and debilitating diet of MREs--the scarcely      edible Meals Ready to Eat--had killed his appetite. By the      end of the war Estes could eat barely half an MRE a day, and      he lost a significant amount of weight and muscle mass.       But that could be overcome with work, and he was driven.      His first couple of calls to U of L graduate assistant Sam      Adams, in charge of the walk-on program, went unreturned.      Finally, Adams called back.       He said that Estes couldn't walk on until classes started,      but in the meantime the coaches wanted to look at some      videotape of him. He had nothing significant to show since      his days on the St. X junior varsity. Nevertheless, Adams      told him to report for a one-day group tryout.       Estes arrived in excellent physical condition, performed      well in the fitness tests and was one of four walk-ons chosen      for the team. After U of L upset Kentucky to open the season      Aug. 31, he reported for his first practice as a Louisville      Cardinal.       ``It was awesome that first day, just putting on the      equipment again,'' he said. ``I was looking around saying,      `I'm playing with a Division I football program. Four months      ago I was shooting at Iraqis running around with AK-47s.' ''       Today life is easy. The 18-hour days don't pile up for      weeks on end. The food is edible. There are no tank repairs,      no missions, no imminent danger.       The load so many student-athletes find so difficult is like      vacation to Jimmy Estes.       ``All you've got to do is go to class and play football,''      Rassano said. ``That's got to be the easiest thing he's done      all year. After going through there, everything's easier.       ``The whole experience kind of straightened him out. I'm      real proud of Jimmy.''       A good many Cardinals have no idea what Estes was going      through while they were in spring practice. But a few have      seen the USMC tattoo on the 5-foot-11, 200-pound      receiver's left shoulder and inquired, and a few others      have heard a story or two about the walk-on soldier.       He doesn't hide his history, but he doesn't broadcast it,      either. He's not looking for hero status in the locker room.       ``The coaches can't give me any special treatment, and I      don't want it,'' he said. ``I'd always heard stories of      people coming back (from a war) and thinking the world owed      them something, or they were messed up mentally. I didn't      want that. I just wanted to make that experience a      positive.''       U of L will play Army tomorrow. Estes has been where none      of the celebrated West Pointers has gone yet: into combat for      his country.       He is a Cardinal worthy of a salute from the Cadets.       Yet he wasn't even supposed to be at the stadium. Instead,      he was scheduled for real military work: a reunion with Alpha      Company at Fort Knox for their first weekend of reservist      training since the war.       But at practice yesterday head coach Bobby Petrino informed      Estes that he will be dressing out and joining the squad if      he can get a furlough from Marine drills.       Estes plans to wear two uniforms tomorrow; he'll be in Papa      John's Cardinal Stadium in the afternoon after meeting up      with his mates in the morning. He's looking forward to seeing      the men with whom he shared a life-altering experience--and      telling them about his college football career.       ``I don't think a whole lot of them really believed me,''      he said with a smile.       But it's true. A desert dream that materialized on lonely      nights under an inky Arabian sky has come true.                          ____________________
