Speaker, I rise for the purpose of inquiring of the majority leader the schedule for the week to come, and it is my ========================= END NOTE =========================   (Mr. McCARTHY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, before I begin, I do want to wish everybody a happy St. Patrick's Day.  Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the House will meet at noon for morning hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business. Votes will be postponed until 6:30.  On Tuesday and Wednesday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning hour and noon for legislative business.  On Thursday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business. Mr. Speaker, late votes are likely in the House on Thursday, and Members are advised to adjust their schedules accordingly.  Mr. Speaker, the House will consider a number of suspensions next week, a complete list of which will be announced at close of business today.  In addition, the House will consider several critical pieces of the Republican plan to repeal and replace ObamaCare:  First, H.R. 372, the Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act, sponsored by Representative Paul Gosar, creates competition in the healthcare market by eliminating antitrust protection for insurance providers.  Next, H.R. 1101, the Small Business Health Fairness Act, sponsored by Representative Sam Johnson of Texas, allows small businesses to pool together and purchase plans, an important step toward purchasing health care across State lines.  Finally, Mr. Speaker, we will consider the FY 2017 reconciliation bill, also known as the American Health Care Act. This bill eliminates the many taxes and mandates of ObamaCare. It gives patients enhanced tools to take control of their healthcare decisions, and it expands choice so Americans are free to pick the plan that is best for themselves and their families.  Mr. Speaker, it is known that ObamaCare is failing, and we have a responsibility to provide Americans relief. These bills are the result of much deliberation and hard work, and their passage will help create a competitive marketplace that provides high-quality care at an affordable cost.
