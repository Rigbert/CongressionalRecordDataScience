' But because I know what happened when we followed that, I would rather just read the words. And the words said, ``None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available under this act may be made available to pay any voluntary contribution of the United States to the United Nations or any of its specialized agencies,'' which include the ones I have mentioned, if the United Nations borrows funds from any international financial institution.  If the U.N. borrows money to make its payments from these international institutions because the U.S. and others are in arrears in their dues, then we are not allowed to give money to the World Heritage Agency, the International Fund for the Advancement of Women, the International Fund Against Torture, the U.N. Environment Program, UNICEF, and Lord knows how many others. That is all I am saying. I am not reading anybody's lips. I am just reading the words of the amendment.
