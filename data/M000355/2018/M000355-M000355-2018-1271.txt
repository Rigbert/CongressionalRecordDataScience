 John H. Klette, Jr., a centenarian veteran of the Second World War, will be honored as the grand marshal in the community's Memorial Day parade.  Soon after the United States entered World War II, Klette enlisted at the age of 24 to help defeat Nazi Germany. A practicing attorney and a licensed pilot, he chose to join the Army Air Corps--the precursor of the Air Force--and passed the necessary exams that same day. After months of training, he was assigned as a pilot in the 32nd Bombardment Squadron of the 301st Bombardment Group and was sent to southern Italy. Klette's first mission to Bucharest, Romania, saw significant enemy resistance, and his aircraft suffered serious damage. That fight wouldnot be the last time Klette saw danger in the line of duty.  To this day, he remembers what he calls the worst mission of his career. Overcome by dozens of persistent enemy craft, Klette's plane was in a dire state. With low oxygen and fires onboard, the crew resisted wave after wave of enemy fighters destroying or damaging several of the enemy craft. Showing tremendous courage in the face of incredible danger, Klette and his team completed their mission and returned to their base.  In recognition of their intrepid actions, the entire crew was awarded the Silver Star, the third highest combat decoration awarded by the Armed Forces. Klette was only 25 at the time. Throughout World War II, Klette flew 51 missions, finishing his last on Thanksgiving Day in 1944.  As a member of the Greatest Generation determined to serve his Nation, Klette entered the Reserves after World War II. He was called back to Active Duty and served for nearly 2 years in Korea. Flying 50 combat missions in that conflict, Klette totaled more than 100 missions during his military career.  After officially leaving military service in 1952, Klette returned to northern Kentucky to practice law with his father in Covington. Still practicing law to this day--now with his daughter as a partner--Klette has been an active member of his community, serving on the board of multiple civic organizations.  As the grand marshal of the Park Hills Memorial day parade, Klette will receive the recognition and gratitude that he deserves. Because of his years of dedication to our Nation in uniform, I am proud to join with the Park Hills community to honor his gallant service and sacrifice. I urge all of my colleagues in the Senate to help me thank John Klette.  (At the request of Mr. Durbin, the following statement was ordered to be printed in the Record.)                          ____________________
