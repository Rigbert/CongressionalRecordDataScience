Speaker, I rise today in honor of Hispanic Heritage Month, which runs through October 15, 2003. In our district across Northern Ohio, the community has organized events to honor our fellow citizens with Hispanic heritage. In our communities, Hispanic citizens have long made lasting contributions to all aspects of civic life, including business, education, religion, labor, and politics.  Ohio's ninth district Hispanic community is comprised of a large and vibrant Mexican American community, a spirited Puerto Rican community and many other countries in Central and South America and the Caribbean whose ancestry is represented. We celebrate many important holidays such as Dia de los Muertos and Puerto Rico's Independence, musical and artistic celebrations such as LatinoFest and support the existence of organizations such as Latins United, Club Taino and many others.  Congress first resolved the celebration of Hispanic heritage through Public Law 90-498 in 1968. At that time the President was asked to issue annually a proclamation designating the week including September 15-16 as National Hispanic Heritage Week and calling upon the people of the United States, especially the educational community, to observe the week with appropriate ceremonies.  It was not until 1988, however, that the Congress drafted and approved a joint resolution to approve a month-long commemoration.  Hispanic Heritage Month affords us a special opportunity to celebrate the contributions of Hispanic Americans, now 38 million strong and the nation's largest minority group. It gives us the opportunity to thank them for enriching the quality of life in America. It gives us the opportunity to learn more about Hispanic Americans and their lives in America. It gives us an opportunity to pause and take note that no fewer than 40 Hispanic Americans have been awarded the Medal of Honor, our nation's highest honor for valor in action. It gives us an opportunity to reflect on the commitment to social justice exemplified by such leaders as Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta. It gives us an opportunity to resolve to fulfill the dream of ``si se puede'' of eradicating poverty and injustice and ensuring that all Hispanic Americans enjoy a full stakehold in American society of the 21st Century.  So, during this Hispanic Heritage Week, while we celebrate so many extraordinary achievements, we are also mindful of the challenges ahead and the bright future for Hispanic Americans in our changing American culture.                          ____________________
