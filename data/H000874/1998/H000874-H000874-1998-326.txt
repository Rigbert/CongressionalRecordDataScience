Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 927, the National Sea Grant College Program Authorization. We have needed to re-authorize the Sea Grant Program since 1995 and I want to applaud Representatives Saxton, Young, Abercrombie and Farr for their leadership on this increasingly important issue:  Mr. Speaker, the Sea Grant Program was established in 1966 to improve the conservation, management, and utilization of marine resources. Modeled after the highly successful Land Grant College Program, Sea Grant has become a National leader in conducting marine research. This research is conducted at 29 designated Sea Grant colleges but the program disseminates their findings to over 300 hundred colleges and universities across the country. One of these Sea Grant designees is the University of Maryland which is located in my District. Maryland is a leader in living marine and estuarine resources research and I can attest to quality of the research conducted through the program.  As a Member from a coastal district, I am acutely aware of the problems confronting our marine environment. This spring and summer we saw how critically important research is with the outbreak of Pfiesteria in the upper Chesapeake Bay. At the time of the outbreak, we were not certain about the most basic facts about the organism, exactly what conditions triggered it to become lethal, how it attacked fish, and the potential danger this organism posed to humans.  The Chesapeake Bay, Mr. Speaker, is not only a National ecological treasure but is one of the most abundant and productive places to conduct research. In addition to Pfiesteria, the Bay has seen the oyster population, which is so vital ecologically and economically, threatened by Dermo and MSX viruses. Sea Grant has been the leader in the Oyster Disease Research Program and fully six million dollars per year is specifically earmarked in the re-authorization for oyster and Pfiesteria study.  Mr. Speaker, I encourage all my colleagues to support this legislation to reauthorize this critically important environmental program.                          ____________________
