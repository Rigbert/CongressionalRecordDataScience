 Might it not then be the next step for Congress to conclude that since now the press has all the power, that maybe we ought to amend the first amendment a little further and give the Congress the power to maybe say how many hours a day a station may broadcast, because we might conclude that they were engaging in an excessive amount of discussion of our issues, or we might conclude that the circulation of a newspaper might be limited to a certain number, because there was an excessive amount of news out there, an excessive amount of discourse about daily events?  That is also part of the first amendment, is it not, and that is also part of the discourse that goes on in this free society. That would be potentially the next step, might it not?
