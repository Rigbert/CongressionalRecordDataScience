(2) Enrichment plant.--The term ``enrichment plant'' means      a uranium enrichment plant owned by the Department of Energy      with respect to which the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has      made a determination of compliance under section 1701(b)(2)      of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2297f(b)(2)).       (3) Qualified operator.--The term ``qualified operator''      means a company that has experience in operating an      enrichment plant under Nuclear Regulatory Commission      authorization and has the ability and workforce to enrich the      depleted uranium that is owned by the Department of Energy.

(a) In General.--       (1) Requirement.--The Secretary shall enter into a contract      with a qualified operator for a 24 month pilot program for      the reenrichment at an enrichment plant of the depleted      uranium described in section 2(3) that the Secretary finds      economically viable. The Secretary shall seek to maximize the      financial return to the Federal Government in negotiating the      terms of such contract.       (2) Amount of enrichment.--The Secretary shall, during each      year of the pilot program under this subsection, conduct      uranium reenrichment under such program in an amount      (measured in separative work units) equal to approximately 25      percent of the aggregate uranium enrichment conducted in the      United States during calendar year 2010.       (3) Economic viability.--For purposes of paragraph (1),      uranium shall be considered economically viable if the cost      to the United States of the reenrichment thereof, including      the costs of the contract entered into under paragraph (1),      are less than the revenue anticipated from the sale of the      reenriched uranium.       (b) Commencement of Reenrichment Activities.--Reenrichment      activities under the contract entered into under subsection      (a) shall commence as soon as possible, but no later than      June 1, 2012.
