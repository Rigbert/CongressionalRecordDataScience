President, today I introduce a Resolution which would express the support of Congress for activities that will raise public awareness of multiple sclerosis.  Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, often disabling disease of the central nervous system. Symptoms can range from mild numbness in the limbs to paralysis and blindness. Most people with MS are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 40, but the unpredictable physical and emotional effects of this debilitating disease can be lifelong. The progress, severity and specific symptoms of MS in any one person cannot yet be predicted, but advances in research and treatment are giving hope to those affected by the disease. It is known that MS afflicts twice as many women as men, however, once an individual is diagnosed with MS their symptoms can be effectively managed and complications avoided through regular medical care.  Nationally, it is estimated that between 250,000 and 350,000 individualssuffer from MS, which is approximately 1 out of every 1,000 people. In Rhode Island, the rate is slightly higher--1.5 out of every 1,000. Over 3,000 individuals and their families in my home state are affected by this disease.  It is my hope that through this resolution we can bring greater attention to the devastating affects of this disease, while also building support for additional research. It is through more intensive research efforts by agencies such as the National Institutes of Health that we will better understand some of the potential causes of this disease, as well as develop more effective methods of treatment, and maybe someday prevention. Indeed, it is only with greater resources that we can build public awareness about MS and enhance our scientific understanding of this mysterious illness.  I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society as well as the Rhode Island Chapter of the Multiple Sclerosis Society for their encouragement and assistance in developing this important Resolution. It is through their grassroots efforts that individuals suffering from MS can get information about their disease as well as learn more about resources available in their communities, research being conducted, and support services for family members. Their support is essential to those who have been afflicted with MS, and I hope that through this resolution the Congress can assist in bolstering these important efforts.  In closing, I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting this important Resolution to raise awareness and encourage people to become more educated about this debilitating disease.                          ____________________
