 Brownback, and Mr. Glenn) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:                              S. Res. 227       Whereas the Government of India conducted an underground      nuclear explosion on May 15, 1974;       Whereas since the 1974 nuclear test by the Government of      India, the United States and its allies have worked      extensively to prevent the further proliferation of nuclear      weapons in South Asia;       Whereas on May 11, 1998, the Government of India conducted      underground tests of three separate nuclear explosive      devices, including a fission device, a low-yield device, and      a thermo-nuclear device;       Whereas this decision by the Government of India has      needlessly raised tension in the South Asia region and      threatens to exacerbate the nuclear arms race in that region;       Whereas the five declared nuclear weapons states and 144      other nations have signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty      in hopes of putting a permanent end to nuclear testing;       Whereas the Government of India has refused to sign the      Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty;       Whereas the Government of India has refused to sign the      Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty;       Whereas India has refused to enter into a safeguards      agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency      covering any of its nuclear research facilities;       Whereas the Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of 1994      requires the President to impose a variety of aid and trade      sanctions against any non-nuclear weapons state that      detonates a nuclear explosive device; Therefore, be it       Resolved, That the Senate       (1) Condemns in the strongest possible terms the decision      of the Government of India to conduct three nuclear tests on      May 11, 1998;       (2) Calls upon the President to carry out the provisions of      the Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of 1994 with respect      to India and invoke all sanctions therein;       (3) Calls upon the Government of India to take immediate      steps to reduce tensions that this unilateral and unnecessary      step has caused;       (4) Expresses its regret that this decision by the      Government of India will, of necessity, negatively affect      relations between the United States and India;       (5) Urges the Government of Pakistan, the Government of the      People's Republic of China, and all governments to exercise      restraint in response to the Indian nuclear tests, in order      to avoid further exacerbating the nuclear arms race in South      Asia;       (6) Calls upon all governments in the region to take steps      to prevent further proliferation of nuclear weapons and      ballistic missiles; and       (7) Urges the Government of India to enter into a      safeguards agreement with the International Atomic energy      Agency which would cover all Indian nuclear research      facilities at the earliest possible time.
