Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Missouri for reserving this special order.  I rise to pay special tribute to my friend and colleague and leader of our committee, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Bliley), our chairman.  There is not a finer committee in the Congress than the Committee on Commerce. I wish my colleague, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Coble), was still here for me to rib him, because he knows in fact that it is the best committee in the Congress for a lot of reasons: the jurisdiction, whether it be health care, trade, commerce, telecommunications, you name it, it comes under the authority of our committee.  If we look at the legislation that passes through here in the House on a weekly basis, really about one-third to 40 percent of the major bills that pass through this Congress originate in the Committee on Commerce.  It is a terrific committee to serve on. We have wonderful Members. We have terrific staff, hard-working. We have had a wonderful leader in the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Bliley) the last 6 years.                              {time}  1900  Mr. Speaker, I was fortunate when I was first placed on the Committee on Commerce to serve under then ranking member of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Bliley). He was always fair, and he has always been fair, certainly in his 6 years as he led this committee in so many ways that will impact all of America for many years to come.  The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Bliley) is a straight shooter. Yes, we knew when we were in his doghouse, but there was always a way to get out. He wanted an answer, he usually had the votes, and if you were straight up with him, your reputation stayed honest and strong, and he was able and willing to help you on a whole host of issues as legislation moved through the Congress.  I am only sorry tonight that the hour is late. We are all trying to get home, back to our districts. Congress will not be in session tomorrow. I have had the wonderful opportunity of serving with him also on the tennis court, opponent, as well as partner. He plays on the court just as hard as he plays in committee. This Congress would be far better off to have more gentlemen like the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Bliley).  There is not a day that he has not been able to go home or he has not been able to have his head high in the issues that he helped lead knowing he has done the right thing. His impact will be felt not only on this body, but across the country for generations to come.  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Blunt) for reserving this special hour for a really very special guy, a real gentleman in every respect of the word. I thank the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Bliley).
