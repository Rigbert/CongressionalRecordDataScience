Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1115, the Class Action Fairness Act of 2003. In years past, the occasional news account of some outrageous class action verdict or settlement was light humor. Now the stories are so common there is no punch line, the class action judicial system itself has become a joke, and no one is laughing except the trial lawyers, all the way to the bank.  Abuse of State class action lawsuits is now systemic and this mounting crisis is a threat to the integrity of our civil justice system and a persistent drain on the national economy. Since this House passed nearly identical class action reform legislation in the 107th Congress, a bill which died in the Democrat-controlled Senate, the problem has only gotten worse. One major element of the worsening crisis is the exponential increase in State class action cases, many of which deal with national issues and classes.  In the past 10 years, State court class actions filing nationwide have increased over 1,000 percent. In certain ``magnet courts'' known for certifying even the most speculative class action suits, the increase in filings over the last 5 years is approaching 4,000 percent. Take, for example, the court in Madison County, Illinois, a rural county of 250,000 people which is on pace for a projected 3,650 percent increase in class action filings over 1998 levels. Eighty-one percent of those cases sought to certify nationwide cases, including all nationwide Sprint customers ever disconnected on a cell phone, all Roto-Rooter customers nationwide whose drains were repaired by unlicensed plumbers, and all nationwide customers who purchased a ``limited edition'' Barbie doll at a higher price.  So why are all these class action cases filed there? Madison County did not experience a similar growth in population during this time, nor did it suddenly become a hub for interstate commerce. Furthermore, there is no evidence to suggest that the good people of Madison County are somehow cursed or more plagued by injuries than the average citizen. Indeed, the only explanation for this phenomenon is aggressive forum shopping by trial lawyers to find courts and judges who will act as willing accomplices in a judicial power grab, hearing nationwide cases and setting policy for the entire country in a local court.  A second major element of the present class action crisis is a system producing outrageous settlements that benefit only lawyers and trample the rights of class members. Class actions were originally created to efficiently address a large number of similar claims by people suffering small harms. Today they are too often used to efficiently transfer large fees to a small number of trial lawyers doing great harm. The present rules encourage a race to any available State courthouse in hopes of a rubber-stamped nationwide settlement that produces millions in attorneys' fees. Clearly, some trial lawyers are winners in this race, but as the Justice Department testified at the committee's last hearing, the losers in this race are the victims who often gain little or nothing through the settlement, yet are bound by it in perpetuity. These same victims and all consumers often bear the cost of these settlements through increased prices for goods and insurance.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to share with Members a survey that was published in the USA Today newspaper on Monday, March 24, 2003: ``Opinions on Class Action Lawsuits, Who Benefits the Most From Class Action Lawsuits.'' Forty-seven percent said lawyers for plaintiffs, 20 percent said lawyers for companies, 12 percent said don't know, 9 percent said plaintiffs, 7 percent said companies being sued, and 5 percent said buyers of products.  Two-thirds of the American public according to this survey indicate that the beneficiaries of class action lawsuits are lawyers and only 14 percent said plaintiffs and buyers of products. This bill is designed to change this mix so that the consumers and the plaintiffs are the ones that benefit rather than lawyers for plaintiffs or lawyers for defendants.  Summarizing the problem last November, The Washington Post editorial board in a critique of the present system wrote:  ``Class actions permit almost infinite venue shopping; national class actions can be filed just about anywhere and are disproportionately brought in a handful of State courts whose judges get elected with lawyers' money. These judges effectively become regulators of products and services produced elsewhere and sold nationally. And when cases are settled, the clients get token payments while the lawyers get enormous fees. This is not justice. It is an extortion racket only Congress can fix.''  Mr. Chairman, today Congress has an opportunity to end this extortion racket and fix this problem. Article 3 of the Constitution empowers Congress to establish Federal jurisdiction over cases between citizens of different States, but current rules on class actions require that all plaintiffs and defendants be residents of different States and that every plaintiff's claim be valued at $75,000 or more. These jurisdictional statutes enacted before the advent of modern class actions lead to results the framers would find perverse.  For example, under current law, a citizen of one State may bring in Federal court a simple $75,001 slip-and-fallclaim against a party from another State. But if a class of 25 million product owners or users living in all 50 States bring claims collectively worth $15 billion against a manufacturer, that lawsuit usually must be heard in State court.  H.R. 1115 would apply new diversity standards to class actions by changing the diversity requirements for class actions where any plaintiff and any defendant reside in different States and where the aggregate of all plaintiffs' claims is at least $2 million. These modest changes will keep large actions of a national character in Federal court where they belong.                              {time}  1215  H.R. 1115 also addresses the other major area in need of reform, the incentives for settlements in class action cases and scrutiny of those settlements. Under current rules, the first case settled wins. Those left out must either find a way to join the settlement or forego their claim. This leads to bad settlements favoring lawyers over consumers in jurisdictions with lax class action requirements. In the last year, more such one-sided settlements benefiting only the lawyers occurred.  Example: A settlement with Blockbuster over late fees produced $9.25 million in lawyers' fees, and nothing more but dollar coupons for the consumers represented, only 20 percent of which are likely to be redeemed.  Another example: A settlement with Crayola over asbestos included in crayons produced $600,000 in attorneys' fees, and nothing but a 75-cent discount on more crayons for affected consumers.  In order to prevent abuses like this, H.R. 1115 aims to protect plaintiffs by prohibiting the payment of bounties to class representatives, barring the approval of net loss settlements, adopting better notice requirement provisions which clarify class members' rights, and by requiring greater scrutiny of coupon settlements and settlements involving out-of-State class members.  Finally, Mr. Chairman, it is important to note that the costs of class action abuses are not limited to the parties of the settlements. They are shared by the American consumer through higher prices and higher insurance premiums.  Class action lawsuits also pose a threat to investors and the security of American retirement plans, which are largely invested in equity securities of American corporations. While class action liability can be enormous, news of these lawsuits on Wall Street can drive down any particular stock by as much as 10 points in one day.  I also would note that we are likely to hear names like Enron, Adelphia and WorldCom tossed about today, and rhetoric that this bill would let such noted corporate wrongdoers off the hook. The truth of the matter is that nothing in H.R. 1115 would limit the rights of plaintiffs to seek redress in court in these types of cases.  Under current law, most lawsuits against these companies will be heard in Federal bankruptcy court, for the same reasons that Federal courts should be able to resolve many of the class actions. Federal courts protect the interests of diverse parties from all parts of the country. In addition, section 4 of H.R. 1115 specifically excludes a number of Federal securities and State-based corporate fraud lawsuits.  Mr. Chairman, the need to restore some common sense, fairness, certainty, and dignity in our class action system is clear. The time to act is now, and I urge my colleagues to vote for this bill and to put some sense back into our legal system.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
