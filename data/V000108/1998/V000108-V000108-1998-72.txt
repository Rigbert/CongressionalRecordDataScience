First, let me say that I am extremely pleased at projections which show that the budget is nearly balanced. The most recent figures from the Congressional Budget Office say that by the year end, the Federal budget will not only come into balance but will actually produce an $8 billion surplus.  While we have certainly made tremendous progress from 1992, when the deficit hit a record high of $290 billion, more work needs to be done. Even if the deficit does disappear on paper, the budget will not really be balanced since the true size of the deficit is masked by borrowing from the Federal trust funds.  It is estimated that for fiscal year 1998, trust fund surpluses from programs such as Social Security and the Highway Trust Fund will make the deficit appear $155 billion less than it actually is. Therefore, I believe we must redouble our efforts to make sure that the budget is really balanced without borrowing from the trust funds. If a surplus does occur, I am committed to working for the following three goals:  First, we should take steps to provide for the long-term fiscal health of Social Security, Medicare and other Federal retirement programs without, I would repeat that, without increasing the payroll tax. Under current CBO projections, Medicare is scheduled to run out of funds by the year 2010 while Social Security will start to lose money in the year 2012 and be unfunded by the year 2029.  These glum predictions are not the result of gross mismanagement or because anyone is guilty of stealing money from the programs. Rather, these programs are in trouble because the average American is living longer and because health care costs are rising so fast. Therefore, it is our responsibility to make the tough choices necessary to ensure that these programs can support not only us, but more importantly, our children and the generations that come after them.  Secondly, I believe it is absolutely imperative that we begin paying down the massive Federal debt. Since 1980, the gross Federal debt has grown more than five times in size to nearly $5.5 trillion. Today, the debt is two-thirds the size of our Nation's gross domestic product and interest payments on the debt consume 15 cents of every dollar in Federal spending. Think about how much better off we would be if this money did not have to be spent on interest payments. At today's average interest rate of 6.7 percent for every $1 billion in debt we retire, we would save $55 million each and every year in interest payments.  Most economists say that by reducing the debt and thereby shrinking interest payments, we would reduce interest rates, increase savings rates, keep the tax burden down, and make more money available in both the public and private sectors to continue to fuel economic growth. It will not happen in the next 10 years, 20 years or even 30 years. But if we begin paying off the debt now, eventually we will reduce it to a manageable level so it does not eat up such a large portion of our national output.  Finally, we should be investing more in this country's economic infrastructure such as roads, bridges, inland waterways, sewage treatment plants and airports in order to make American workers and businesses more productive and profitable.  There is little doubt that investing in economic infrastructure has positive benefits for all Americans. Improving roads, updating sewer systems, modernizing airports and making sure our communications system is ready for the 21st century enhances our international competitiveness and helps American workers remain the most productive in the world.  Despite the obvious benefits, many infrastructure projects are not today receiving adequate funds or are simply being ignored. For instance, a 1995 Department of Transportation study found that nearly one-third of the roads in this country are in poor or mediocre condition.  The Department of Defense estimates that it will be at least 12 years before adequate housing can be built for every soldier in the U.S. armed forces.  And in 1996, the Federal Aviation Administration said it would need at least $33 billion over the next 5 years to meet its capital improvement needs. Yet last year the Federal Government spent only $1.46 billion for airport development projects.  Madam Speaker, we have a moral responsibility to provide a solid and fiscally secure future for the generations that will follow us.                          ____________________
