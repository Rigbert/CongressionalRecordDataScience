 President, I stand before you today to pay tribute to a man who has spent a significant amount of his life working for the Kentucky Rural Water Association and the National Rural Water Association. Mr. Joe Liles helped in founding the Kentucky Rural Water Association in 1979. He has also been an employee of the National Rural Water Association since 1999, when he was first elected to the Board of Directors.  He has progressed through numerous positions within the association, and as of September 2010, Mr. Liles has been President of the National Rural Water Association.  I would like to congratulate Mr. Liles on his achievements. I would also like to acknowledge the Kentucky Rural Water Association Leadership Award that Mr. Liles was given in 2008. He was presented this prestigious award based on his exemplary service, leadership, and commitment to Kentucky's water and wastewater utilities. Most recently, Mr. Liles received the 2012 Man of the Year Award from the National Rural Water Association.  After 38 years of dedication to the water systems of Warren, Butler, and Simpson counties, Mr. Liles retired in 2005 from his managerial position. However, he currently serves as the utilities' community and government relations assistant.  Mr. Joe Liles resides in Bowling Green, KY, with his wife, Sally, and his four daughters. He is a grandfather to six. Liles earned his bachelor's degree with an area of concentration in management from Western Kentucky University.  Mr. Liles has shown tremendous loyalty, devotion, and consideration, not only to his job and career, but also to the Bluegrass State. I appreciate all that Mr. Liles has done for the Commonwealth of Kentucky.  Mr. President, the National Rural Water Association recently published an article about the accomplishments of Mr. Joe Liles, and I would ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed as follows: [From the National Rural Water Association Newsletter, Oct. 23, 2012]       The National Rural Water Association recently honored Joe      Liles as the 2012 Man of the Year. A long-standing leader in      rural water, Liles was honored during the Tribute to      Excellence awards ceremony, held on Sept. 24th in Nashville,      Tenn. Joe Liles, outgoing NRWA president and founding member      of the Kentucky Rural Water Association board of directors,      has served in numerous positions on the boards for both      Kentucky Rural Water and NRWA.       The Man of the Year Award is a prestigious award that      recognizes individuals for their many years of exemplary      service, leadership, and commitment to our nation's water and      wastewater utilities. Although Mr. Liles retired as manager      of the Warren, Butler and Simpson counties water systems in      2005 after 38 years, he currently serves as the utilities'      community and government relations assistant.
