Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Chairman, let me thank my colleagues, particularly the gentleman from New Mexico, for his patience. I think this has been an important debate. It has gone on longer than any other debate on this bill, but, frankly, I think the issue at hand is one of the most important facing us today.  I wanted to acknowledge two people: one who is not here and one who is. The one I would like to acknowledge who is here is my staff assistant, Tom Faletti. Tom Faletti has been standing by my side on this tobacco issue for 10 years. He has covered me with glory in those rare moments when we have defied the tobacco lobby. He has stood by me loyally and forgiven me my defeats and my failings in the course of this experience, taking on the most powerful lobby in Washington.  I know the results of the vote last year. We were defeated with the same amendment. I sense today that it might be better, I hope it is. But let me just say this: One of the reasons I am involved in this debate is because another person I served with is not here today. His name was Mike Synar of Oklahoma.  Mike Synar was a tiger on this issue. He paid for it dearly in terms of losing his congressional seat when the tobacco companies turned on him and managed to defeat him. Mike gave up one of the most precious things to him, next to his family, his congressional career, because he believed so intensely in this issue. Those of us who come to this side of the table have that same passion.                              {time}  1745  I respect those on the other side, too, because they speak with conviction and passion as well.  I listened to this debate today and jotted down a few of the words that have been used to describe either me or my amendment. I say to my colleagues: You have to have a pretty tough mental hide to be in politics, to hear people get up on the floor and call you or your amendment, in full view of the C-SPAN audience and the people here, ``mean-spirited, punitive, misdirected, hypocrisy at the highest level, self serving, political and cruel,'' and I think they were warming up to some stronger words before they finally had to sit down. I understand that the emotions really run high on this issue. They certainly run high on this side of the issue, those of us who have fought the tobacco companies for so long.  First, let me say a word about tobacco farmers and growers. For as long as I have been involved in this debate, from the very beginning, I have made known to every congressman and congresswoman from a tobacco-producing State: ``I will join you at the table to find transitions for these tobacco growers to go into some other crop. I will work with you, I'll subsidize it.'' I do not have any battle with these poor men and women who are struggling to make a living, but I can tell my colleagues honestly no one ever takes me up on my invitation. The reason they do not take me up on the invitation: there is no crop that one can legally grow in America that is as profitable as tobacco; not one.  For example, the gross receipts per acre, on tobacco, are $4,000; the net receipts from $1,400 to $800. In my part of the world we grow a lot of corn and soybeans. Corn, gross receipts per acre will run $400 to $800. A farmer might take half of that away.  So look at the difference here. It is anywhere from 3 to 10 times as lucrative as growing some other crop. That is why the tobacco farmers do not want to leave it. They cannot make any kind of money close to that growing any another crop on their land. They just do not want to give it up.  But quite honestly, I think it is time for the Federal Government to say to them, ``You're on your own,'' and that is what this amendment starts to do. It takes away the subsidy for crop insurance and the subsidy for the extension service for these tobacco farmers.  Let me also mention this argument about jobs. The previous speaker, my friend from Tennessee, stood up and said the Durbin amendment will cost jobs. It will. It will. Because if we can diminish the use of tobacco in this country, we will have fewer respiratory therapists, we will have fewer cancer specialists, we will have fewer surgeons operating on people who are devastated by the diseases attached to tobacco. Make no mistake about it. The jobs associated with tobacco in this country, the best-paying jobs, are associated with the victims of tobacco in this country, and we have to be sensitive to that fact as well.  I feel sorry for those working in tobacco companies, but let me tell my colleagues: The product they are selling is killing people every single day.  The gentlewoman from Utah said earlier there are a lot of agricultural products. There is only one agricultural product in America that has a body count, and it is tobacco. That is why it is different, and that is why it should be treated differently.  Forty-seven of my colleagues from both parties have joined me in a task force taking on the tobacco industry. Let me say to my colleagues when I first got to Congress, that was unthinkable. No one came out publicly against the tobacco lobby. Now there are 47 of us, and occasionally we can put a majority together on the floor.  For those who argue, and one of my colleagues did, well, these folks who oppose tobacco, they get a lot of big political contributions too. Let me tell my colleagues I am still waiting in my office for my first PAC check from the American Cancer Society, the American Heart Association, the American Lung Association, the Coalition on Smoking and Health. These health groups give away a lot of psychic income, they do not write the checks like the tobacco lobby will for the people who vote against the Durbin amendment today. On the political ledger all the money is on the other side. We have to struggle and put this battle up because it is something we believe in.  Now let me close by saying this. I certainly hope that my colleagues will take this amendment very seriously. I do. This has been a 10-year battle that this Congressman has waged on this floor of the House. We started off with a victory banning smoking on airplanes. We extended it to flights all across the United States. The tobacco companies said it was the end of the world; try to stop smoking on airplanes, they are going to be beating up the flight attendants and smoking in the restrooms. It never happened. It never happened. People knew that sensible regulation of smoking is something that this country ought to bedoing, and now it is time for us to get out of the business of subsidizing tobacco.  Mr. Chairman, this Durbin amendment will give to my colleagues the right answer to the question: Congressman, if this product kills so many Americans, why in God's name does the Federal Treasury subsidize it?  By voting for the Durbin amendment, my colleagues who support me will be able to say to those colleagues we ended it, and we ended it in the right way, saying to tobacco growers; find another line of work, or at least support your production of tobacco on your own dollar, not on the dollar of taxpayers.
