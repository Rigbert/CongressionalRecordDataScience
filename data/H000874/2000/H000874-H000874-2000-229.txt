Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds.  Mr. Chairman, I just wanted the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Goodling) to remind me who was in charge of the Department of Education from 1981, as he was lamenting that nobody cared about quality and that nobody cared about whether these were operating effectively on behalf of children. Who was in charge of the Department of Education, Department of Human Services from 1981 to 1993?  Congress was not in charge. We did not run them. The fact of the matter is, as the gentleman pointed out, the first Secretary to tell a Head Start program it could not operate because it was not doing what we wanted for children was Donna Shalala. The gentleman was correct on that.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from Hawaii (Mrs. Mink).                              {time}  2045
