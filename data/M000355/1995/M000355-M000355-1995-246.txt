 1092. A bill to impose sanctions against Burma, and countries assisting Burma, unless Burma observes basic human rights and permits political freedoms; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.                        THE 1995 FREE BURMA ACT Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the 1995 Free Burma Act. I had planned to introduce the legislation on July 11, the date the State Law and Order Restoration Council--SLORC--was to reach a determination about the status of Aung San Suu Kyi. Fortunately for Suu Kyi, her family and Burma, SLORC decided to release her from 6 years of house arrest.  Everyone hoped that her release would mark the beginning of significant change in Burma. But, as Suu Kyi recently remarked, ``We are nowhere near democracy. I have been released--that is all. The situation has not changed in any other way.''  Two weeks ago, I announced that I would refrain from introducing sanctions legislation in the interests of determining just how serious the SLORC was about change in Burma. I indicated that I would monitor the situation and determine if progress was made in four areas before introducing sanctions. Let me review those conditions.  First, Suu Kyi has called for dialog with the SLORC to negotiate the peaceful transfer of power. In her first public statement she took note of the fact that a majority of the people in Burma voted for democracy and a market economy in 1990. In fact her National League for Democracy carried 392 seats in Parliament. A dialog to set Burma on the road to economic and political recovery should being immediately and without preconditions.  Second, Suu Kyi must continue to be afforded the opportunity to meet with her political supporters. It is essential that she have freedom of movement and speech and that her supporters and the press enjoy the same rights.  Third, Suu Kyi urged the SLORC to release all political prisoners, including the 16 elected members of Parliament and hundreds of other NLD supporters. I hope this occurs promptly, but in the meantime, I think it is imperative that the SLORC sign and implement the ICRC agreement granting access to political detainees. Last month the ICRC announced they intend to withdraw from Burma after 7 years of attempting to negotiate an agreement with SLORC. I believe it would represent a good faith effort if SLORC now signed that agreement.  Finally, SLORC's intention to move toward national reconciliation could be demonstrated by ceasing attacks on ethnic minorities along the Thai border. Over the past year, SLORC has engaged in negotiations to reach cease-fire agreements with many of the ethnic groups--agreements which explicitly call upon the withdrawal of SLORC forces from various regions. In December, SLORC broke off talks and launched attacks against the Karen. Nearly 80,000 refugees fled across the border. Over the past several weeks several thousand SLORC troop have moved into the Kayah state and launched attacks against Karenni camps. News accounts report that 20,000 refugees have fled.  On Monday, this week, I asked Assistant Secretary of State for Asian Affairs, Winston Lord, Assistant Secretary for Narcotics, Robert Gelbard, to provide the administration's assessment of progress in meeting these conditions. I also asked a Burmese student, Omar Khin, and representatives from Asia Watch and the AFL-CIO to testify.  Although everyone agreed that Suu Kyi's release was an important development and that she was being afforded the opportunity to meet with her supporters, every witness expressed disappointment that that was all that has happened.  The war against ethnic groups continue. Political repression and human rights violations continue. In fact, just this week, Asia Watch released an extensive report detailing how the situation has deteriorated.  The Red Cross still plans to shut down operations because of SLORC's refusal to grant access to political prisoners. And, perhaps most importantly, no negotiations have been initiated by SLORC to implement the 1990 elections. In fact, no efforts have been made to set a date for dialog to begin.  It is pretty obvious that SLORC's decision to release Suu Kyi was a calculated move designed to encourage foreign investment and Burma's inclusion in ASEAN. Indeed, within 48 hours of her release, several governments announced their intention to consider expanding trade and assistance. I think it is too early to reward SLORC--these initiatives are premature.  I agree with Suu Kyi who has cautioned all potential investors. A recent AP story made clear that she is concerned about a rush to embrace SLORC. She has, in fact, welcomed this legislation as a means of pressuring SLORC to the table. In an AP story she said, ``These are very tough sanctions and I think they have shown they are very interested in democracy.''  The legislation sends the message that Suu Kyi's release is not enough--that the Senate expects SLORC to implement the results of the 1990 election and transfer power to a civilian government.  Mr. President, some people may wonder why Burma should matter to the United States. After all there are certainly other countries with comparable human rights records.  That may well be true. But, there is one compelling reason why we have a direct interest in Burma. Today, Burma is the source of 65 percent of the heroin coming into the United States compared with 15 percent 10 years ago. More alarming is the fact that purity has shot up. Law enforcement officials here in Washington and in Kentucky tell me they used to see purity around 2 percent to 3 percent on our streets. Now it is not uncommon to find purity levels from 25 percent to 65 percent.  The drug czar has said heroin trafficking represents a serious threat to our national interests. I agree. I also agree with Assistant Secretary Lord's testimony that the only thing that will solve the problem is a change in government.  Mr. President, we all hope that Suu Kyi's release marks the beginning of the end of repression in Burma. However, past experience with this military dictatorship suggests caution is the appropriate approach.  Suu Kyi has issued a statement of remarkable good will toward a regime that illegally held her in detention for 6 years. She has demonstrated courage and determination, stating immediately after her release that her detention has not changed her basic goals to advance peace and freedom in Burma.  I think it is important that we respect and promote that agenda. Keeping the pressure on SLORC will assure that her release is translated from a symbolic gesture to real progress.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record several letters of support for this legislation which have come in from around the world. I also ask unanimous consent to include a brief summary of the legislation and an article including comments Suu Kyi has made about the legislation.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:       Senator McConnell, members of the press: My name is Ohmar      Khin. I am a Burmese student in exile who participated in the      1988 nationwide pro-democracy movement in Burma and      experienced first-hand, the brutality of the current military      regime. The memories of the events of 1988 are still vivid.       At that time, I was a senior student at Rangoon Arts and      Science University majoring in Chemistry. On March 16, while      walking to class with my friends, I saw students banging      drums and calling others to gather nearby the Convocation      Hall. They were protesting the death of a student who was      shot by soldiers dispersing a demonstration three days      earlier. My friends and I joined the protesters. As we      marched passed Inya Lake we saw troops stationed on the road,      blocking our way and riot police trucks rolling down the      road.       Many students ran into nearby streets and some jumped into      the lake. Others were beaten and kicked by police then      dragged into the trucks. I was separated from my friends and      ran into one of the houses in front of the lake. The      residents let me and a few others in, locking their gate.      From there, I watched the terrifying scene. My heart was      pounding with fear. My sarong was torn apart. I was holding a      pencil sharpener to defend myself if I were caught. Some      troops tried to climb over the gate to catch us but a      Japanese diplomat next door let us climb down into his      residence and hid us in his house. It was night before I      could finally get back home.       From that time there was a determination to fight for      justice in our country. During the next few months students      organized quietly. More and more people recognized the need      for change in the country and joined this movement which led      to the nationwide pro-democracy uprising of August 8, 1988,      known as 8-8-88.       Tens of thousands of people, including monks and children,      took to the streets that day, calling for democracy and human      rights. I marched along with my colleagues and witnessed the      horror of our own military shooting innocent people. One of      the students marching next to me was shot to death.       During those months of struggle in 1988, hundreds of      students were arrested, universities and colleges were      closed. Thousands of students, like myself, were forced to      flee the country.       I believe that democracy and human rights will truly come      to Burma one day, but the help of the international community      is critical in bringing about that change. Pressure brought      to bear by the international community was instrumental in      freeing Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and such pressure must continue      until democracy is restored. The legislation planned by      Senator McConnell calling for economic sanctions on the      military regime is the type of initiative which will sustain      such pressure.       The struggle of 1988 should not be forgotten. The spirit of      the people and their desire to live under a just and      democratic government remains strong. Senator McConnell's      legislation can help the people of Burma achieve that goal.                                                                    ____              National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma,                                 Office of the Prime Minister,                                   Washington, DC, March 29, 1995.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: I have recently learned of your      intention to introduce a bill to impose US economic sanctions      on Burma. On behalf of the democratically elected government      of Burma, I am writing to give you my wholehearted support as      well as that of my government in your effort.       The imposition of sanctions should never be taken lightly.      Any measure designed to constrict the economy of a country      will cause some degree of hardship to the people. However, I      believe, and the democratic forces working to liberate our      country believe, that foreign investment serves to strengthen      the outlaw State Law and Restoration Council (SLORC). It is      providing SLORC with the means to finance a massive army and      intelligence service whose only job is to crush internal      dissent. SLORC controls all foreign investment into Burma and      channels contracts to the military and its party officials.      Unlike other countries, investment will not serve to create a      middle class of entrepreneurs, only reinforce allegiance to a      regime that has murdered tens of thousands of people whose      crime was the desire for democracy and to live in a free      society. SLORC is in desperate need of foreign currency.      Cutting off access to US funds will be a severe blow to      SLORC.       Your decision to move forward on this issue will not be      popular with the US business community or countries in Europe      and Asia. There are many who place trade and money over      Burma's deplorable narcotics, political, and human rights      record. I applaud your courage and will do everything in my      power to see you succeed.       The United States has a very special place in the hearts of      my countrymen. During the massive democracy demonstrations in      1988, students could be seen marching in Rangoon carrying      American flags and demonstrating in front of the US Embassy.      Supporting us in our struggle is the International Republican      Institute. This organization funds pro-democracy activities      inside Burma. The Burmese people desperately want what      Americans have: the ability to live in peace without fear of      government persecution, respect for human rights, and social      justice. American ideals will always be a symbol for what we      can achieve.       I want to personally thank you for your leadership and      raising your voice to support those who are oppressed. I look      forward to assisting you in any way possible.       With my highest consideration,           Yours sincerely,                                                         Sein Win,     Prime Minister.                                                                    ____                                        The Government of Karenni,                                 Office of the Prime Minister,                                                     June 9, 1995.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC       Dear Senator McConnell: The Government and people of      Karenni are happy to learn that you have prepared to      legislate sanction against SLORC in the U.S. Congress.       We give all our support to your efforts and we thank the      Senators and Congressmen who sponsored this legislation to      impose economic sanctions on Burma.       Meanwhile, the Karenni National Progressive Party (KNPP)      has entered a cease fire ``understanding'' with SLORC. This      is done on convenience because we are pressured by      intimidation from SLORC.       KNPP wants peace and progress. For this reason it has been      fighting the war against SLORC and the Burmese Governments      preceeded it. With the cease-fire in place, the KNPP hopes to      be able to achieve progress. That was why it has agreed to a      cease-fire with SLORC. But contrary to expectation, no      progress is possible because the SLORC has reneged on its      agreement with KNPP. It has, in the name of existing Burmese      laws and regulations, put all kinds of obstacles in the way.      Although the KNPP has reminded SLORC of the agreement reached      between it and KNPP, the SLORC simply turns a deaf ear to the      reminders. On the other hand it continues collecting porter      fees--60 kyats per household--in some townships monthly. It      is believed that the porter fees collected will be used in      areas where cease-fire has not been reached or signed.       KNPP is of the opinion that only when there is a nation-     wide cease-fire between SLORC and all armed groups fighting      it, will the people be free from being made to contribute      porter fees, to serve as porters and to contribute forced      labour.       We, therefore, request the international organizations,      like the UN or democratic countries, like the United States      to put pressure on SLORC so that a nation-wide cease-fire in      Burma can take place.       The hard-learned fact we now experienced as mentioned above      is that the SLORC will continue its formally bullish practice      over all the cease-fire signatories.       We find our national security is still precarious and there      is no sign of democratic return in Karenni and also all over      Burma itself. For this belief, we send a memorandum to sub-     committee of House Foreign Affairs Committee, in which we      seek U.S. protection and aids. A copy of this memorandum is      sent to you by airmail postal service.       We wish you success in this efforts of yours.       May God bless you and your sponsorial comrades.           Your sincerely,                                                    Aung Than Lay,     Prime Minister, Government of Karenni.                                                                    ____                                          The New Mon State Party,                                         General Headquarters,                                                     June 6, 1995.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Your Excellency: Information of your efforts at imposing      economic and trade sanctions on Burma under the brutal regime      known as the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC)      is very encouraging to us. Current situation shows that, only      by international economic and diplomatic pressure can      liberate Burma from the atrocious control of the ruling      military junta.       It appears that the world business community is now      mesmerized by SLORC's promises of the proverbial pot of gold      at the end of the rainbow. The economy is only open for the      Burmese generals and their associates to line their pockets      and they are in complete control of all business contracts      and are interested in upfront money in the form of signature      bonuses paid in dollars.       Any evidence offered that the regime is easing its      oppression is superficial. What the military leadership is      seeking is international legitimacy at the lest cost to      itself.       In spite of no foreign threats whatsoever, SLORC is      boosting up its armed forces to over 350,000 heading to      500,000 just to rule the country at gun point.       The best example of the Burmese leadership's political      failure is their attitude toward the ethnic minorities. For      nearly half a century it has used the bankrupt policy of a      military solution to Burma's political problems. It just does      not have adequate capacity to realize that Burma's ethnic      problems are a political problem that requires a political      solution.       May I urge you as President of the New Mon State Party and      Chairman of the National Democratic Front to do everything      possible to eliminate U.S. foreign investment in Burma until      a legitimate democratic government is in power.           Yours truly,                                                    Nai Shwe Kyin,     President.                                                                    ____                                    Kachinland Projects U.S.A.                                                      For Human Rights                                       and Democracy in Burma,                                                    June 13, 1995.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: I write on behalf of the Kachin-     American & Friends USA, Inc., for Democracy and Human Rights      in Burma, a US citizens' organization dedicated to the      purpose of restoring democracy and human rights in Burma,      especially in the Kachin areas. We want to let you know that      we support your proposed resolution to impose trade sanctions      against Burma most strongly. We are ready to support your      leadership through active citizen input to our      representatives in the US Congress. If we could be of help in      other ways please let us know.       We have been unspeakably outraged by the severe persecution      of our people over the years for no apparent reason than the      fact that they are Kachin. We have felt most painful and      helpless because the one political movement, the Kachin      Independence Organization, has been hand-tied by the cease-     fire agreement. While Kachin leaders have been honor-bound,      SLORC's oppression and predations against our people have      continued, as has their despicable hypocrisy about opium      production and trading.       We support in the strongest manner any pressure that could      be applied against SLORC, by the US and by the international      community. And we will continue our strong protest against      SLORC's deadly rule in ethnic minority areas with their      occupation army. This pariah regime must be condemned and      cast aside.       We hope that you are determined to exercise your leadership      in a manner that will have a strong, effective and lasting      impact. We are ready and eager to come to your assistance      whenever called.           Most sincerely yours,                                               La Raw Maran, Ph.D.     Executive Director.                                                                    ____         American Federation of Labor and Congress and Industrial            Organization,                                 Washington, DC, February 6, 1995.     Hon. Warren Christopher,     Secretary of State, U.S. Department of State, Washington, DC       Dear Mr. Secretary: I write to you to express my strong      concerns about the continuing egregious behavior of the State      Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) regime of Burma.      Directly contradicting its claims that it seeks peace and      national reconciliation, SLORC sent the Burmese army to      viciously attack, capture and sack Manerplaw, the      headquarters of the Karen people and key base area for many      groups, including the Federation of Trade Unions Burma      (FTUB), seeking to restore democracy in Burma.       We believe that the blatant, unprovoked attack on Manerplaw      is a major setback for the cause of democracy in Burma and      merits a strong response from the U.S. Government. In the      ``two visions'' policy laid out by Deputy Assistant Secretary      Hubbard during his visit to Rangoon, the U.S. indicated that,      if progress by SLORC on issues of democracy and human rights      was not forthcoming, the U.S. would renew its campaign to      isolate the regime. In line with this policy, now is the time      for the U.S. to show, by actions, that it is serious.       Accordingly, we urge the U.S. Government to implement a      full trade and investment embargo against Burma. Since most      U.S. investment enters Burma through joint ventures with      SLORC government agencies or entities wholly controlled by      the regime, implementing sanctions would have a direct impact      on the ability of the SLORC to repress its people and conduct      war on groups opposed to this illegitimate government. The      withdrawal of the Commercial Officer from the U.S. Embassy in      Rangoon would further underscore this message. We also renew      our call for the U.S. Government to exert pressure to block      development and aid projects of international institutions      that benefit the SLORC.           Sincerely,                                                    Lane Kirkland,     President.                                                                    ____                                       Democratic Burmese Students                                           Organization (USA),                                      Rockville, MD, July 7, 1995.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: I write this letter on behalf of      the Democratic Burmese Students Organization. We are students      in exile from Burma who were witnesses to the 1988 massacre      of peaceful demonstrators by the Burmese regime. We, the      Burmese students, are now living throughout the United      States. We are writing in support of your efforts to draft      legislation imposing economic and trade measures against the      military regime in Burma.       In view of the lack of freedom and democracy and the      persistent refusal on the part of the current SLORC regime to      honor the national mandate given in 1990 elections, we      commend any measures that the U.S. Congress takes to help the      emergence of a legitimate government, which is democratic and      responsive to the basic needs of its people.       We believe that your proposed legislation will set a      progressive direction for U.S. policy that promotes democracy      in Burma. It will also send a clear signal to the SLORC that      the U.S. insists on commitment for the immediate release of      all political prisoners including democratic leader Daw Aung      San Suu Kyi and the implementation of the full democratic      process. We believe that renewed action by the U.S. Congress      to increase pressure on Burma will bear critical influence on      the SLORC. We shall, therefore, support any of your measures to this      effect.           Sincerely yours,                                                    Shwe Sin Htun,     Representative, DRSO (East Coast).                                                                    ____                   [From the Desk of Betty Williams]                                                     July 6, 1995.     Senator Mitch McConnell,     Russell Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: I wish to take this opportunity to      offer my support to the initiative you are preparing to      undertake on behalf of my sister laureate Aung San Suu Kyi      and the people of Burma. It has been brought to my attention      that you intend to introduce legislation on July 11, 1995      which will ban all U.S. foreign investment in Burma.       On June 26, 1995, while commemorating the 50th Anniversary      of the United Nations, Bishop Desmond Tutu, Lech Walesa,      Oscar Arias Sanchez and myself presented a letter to the      United Nations which included the signatures of seven other      Laureates asking for the release of Daw Suu. The letter      stated, ``She has endured six long years of solitary      detention without trial at the hands of the military regime.      There is no sign at all of her release. We resolutely oppose      political oppression disguised as criminal detention.''      Bishop Tutu, in a statement to a forum at the UN Anniversary      called for sanctions to be imposed on Burma.       This legislative initiative is long overdue and will play a      critical role in bringing about a transfer of power to the      democratically elected 1990 representatives, allowing them to      take their rightful (and legitimate) seats in parliament.       I offer congratulations for implementing this endeavor and      hope that your colleagues in the Senate will join you in this      worthy effort which I hope will lead to a political dialogue      and settlement of the Burma conflict and, most importantly,      democracy in Burma.           Most sincerely,                                                   Betty Williams,     Nobel Laureate 1976.                                                                    ____                                      United Front for Democracy &                                        Human Rights in Burma,                                 North Potomac, MD, July 25, 1995.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     U.S. Senator, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Senator: The United Front for Democracy and Human      Rights in Burma and its affiliated organizations in the      United States, Canada, Europe and Asia want to heartily      commend you for the hearing on the Trade and Investment      Sanction bill held on July 24, 1995.       On behalf of these organizations, I was present at the      hearing and wish to express our views regarding the various      statements made there. While we thank Assistant Secretary      Winston Lord and Assistant Secretary Gelbard for their      perspectives and their views on the counternarcotics issue      and your sanction bill, our organizations disagree with their      approach. We heartily endorse the views expressed in the      opening statement made by you and the statements made by Khin      Ohnmar and the representatives of Human Rights Watch/ASIA and      the AFL-CIO as well as the statement submitted by Prime      Minister Dr. Sein Win of the NCGUB.       Our organizations, after very careful consideration of the      present situation and after hearing the various views at the      hearing as well as those of individuals and other      organizations closely observing the developments in Burma,      feel very strongly that the only language the SLORC, one of      the most repressive and regressive regimes in the world,      would understand is the comprehensive trade and sanctions      legislation against Burma that you propose to introduce. We      also believe that this is the right time for the introduction      as Daw Aung San Suu Kyi herself has acknowledge publicly as      quoted by you, ``We are nowhere near democracy. I have been      released, that is all. The situation has not changed in any      other way.'' Most prudent Burma observers including      Ambassador Lord are of the opinion that the reason for Suu      Kyi's release was not out of good intention or desire to      change to democracy and national reconciliation in Burma, but      due to international pressure including your proposed bill as      well as the forthcoming ASEAN meeting in Brunei.       Enclosed herewith also is the statement made by the United      Front on the release of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.           Yours sincerely,                                                      U Ba Thaung,                                                 Chairman.                                 ______      By
