 President, I rise this evening, as well, to join my colleague in support of the fair aerospace competition resolution that passed this body 96 to 0.  Thousands of American aerospace workers have lost their jobs in the past decade. That trend is going to continue unless we take action.  This evening I especially thank leaders on both sides of the aisle--Senator Frist and Senator Reid--for their help and support of this measure. Senators Grassley and Baucus of the Finance Committee have been of great help. And, as always, I am proud to serve with Senator Maria Cantwell, my colleague from Washington State and another strong advocate for America's aerospace workers.  Our country invented the aerospace industry 100 years ago. Through it, American workers have done more than feed their families and pay for mortgages; they have made air travel safer and brought economic growth and innovation to every corner of our economy.  Many in this body have heard me talk for years about Europe's efforts to distort the commercial aerospace industry. In short, Airbus has done everything it can to kill our aerospace industry. Airbus has received billions in illegal launch aid. Airbus has triedto play tricks on this side of the ocean with their slick PR campaign. And Airbus will continue the unfair tactics until they completely dominate the global aerospace market.  While Airbus is doing all of these things to hurt American workers, it is actually trying to get us to think they are a friend to the very men and women they are putting out of work.  Unfortunately, EADS, Airbus, and European governments will do and say anything to dominate the global aerospace market. I am here today to call their bluff and show this body, once again, that Airbus is no friend of the United States or our workers and to ensure that their doubletalk is exposed for all to see.  I have worked closely with several U.S. Trade Representatives on this issue over the years. For the past several months, the United States has tried to negotiate with the Europeans, but it is very clear that the Europeans do not take our concerns seriously. Those discussions appear to have broken down, and the Europeans are threatening a radical escalation if we pursue our right to file a WTO case.  You would think after all Airbus has done to kill American jobs, they would at least make a good-faith effort now that we are finally calling them to account for their behavior. But the Airbus and European leaders have done just the opposite. They have pounded their chest about how their latest subsidized plane will dominate the industry.  Instead of coming clean--or at least stopping their trade-distorting behavior--Airbus has sought to influence public opinion. They have pursued a deceptive public relations campaign. They have taken out ads in the Capitol Hill publications and major newspapers around the country, just like the one behind me.  Airbus claims to be a good friend of American workers, but it is selling to America's sworn enemies. Airbus claims to support hundreds of thousands of American jobs, but they cannot document them. Airbus claims it wants to be a more American company, but then it turns and preaches European domination when they think we are not looking.  We need to stand up for this unfair competition and send a strong signal to the Europeans that this Congress and this country will not allow a European-subsidized company to destroy America's aerospace industry.  They can talk out of both sides of their mouth all they want, but I am here to lay the facts on the table and to stand up for our workers.  Mr. President, I applaud the Bush administration, and specifically Ambassador Robert Zoellick, for the work they are doing to end unfair trade practices in the aerospace industry. This administration entered into negotiations in good faith. They wanted to restore balance and fairness to the commercial aircraft trade.  Unfortunately, Europe has never taken these talks or this issue seriously. Our willingness to seek a negotiated settlement has been greeted by more arrogant entitlement from Airbus and its European backers. While publicly committing to negotiations, Airbus and European leaders have been working behind the scenes to continue subsidies to Airbus in spite of U.S. threats to file a WTO case.  Now European Commission Ambassador John Bruton is saying, `` . . . one result of a case would be that maximum aid would be given'' for Airbus's new A350.  Today, this campaign is more directly than ever in Congress's line of sight. I hope to clearly show Airbus is not an American company and Airbus is simply continuing its policy of saying and doing anything to get what it wants.  A week ago last Friday, European Union Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson wrote an eye-popping piece in the Washington Post. He, once again, restated baseless accusations against Boeing in an effort to justify billions of dollars in illegal Airbus launch aid.  The issue Mandelson correctly identifies as central to American concerns is the massive subsidies in the form of launch aid, landing rights, and other giveaways that European governments give to Airbus. Now the Europeans would like you to think that we offer similar subsidies to Boeing, but the facts simply don't line up. I don't need to talk at great length about the subsidies tonight, but I think it is worthwhile to make you all understand what those subsidies actually do.  European governments give Airbus huge direct subsidies to build new airplanes. These subsidies take the form of launch aid, supplier subsidies, R&D subsidies, and facilities subsidies. These subsidies create an uneven playing field and allow Airbus to do what normal, private companies cannot afford to do. They develop new products without any risk.  One American company is playing by traditional business norms--borrowing money at commercial rates, being responsible to shareholders, and knowing if they don't make a profit, they are in trouble. That is why Boeing ``bets the company'' when they develop a new plane. Airbus enjoys virtually a risk-free product development, and it operates far outside of the bounds of fair competition. All of this comes at the expense of U.S. companies and American workers.  What does that mean in real terms? Let's take the new superjumbo Airbus A380 as an example. According to a January 20 article in the Financial Post, titled ``The Airbus 380,'' A380 subsidies are officially at $4.3 billion. Other estimates put it at over $6 billion.  The same day, the independent newspaper said:       To break even on its own investment, Airbus needs to sell      250 of the A380. To repay the four governments it needs to      shift to 700. To count as a real commercial success, Airbus      needs to sell twice that number. So far, it has firm orders      for 149.  It is no wonder that last summer respected industrial analyst Richard Aboulafia of the Teal Group called the plane a ``bloated airborne welfare queen.''  No other company in the world would be able to handle such huge cost overruns. But Airbus can because if the plane fails, they will simply write off the costs and move on to the next one.  To make matters worse, they have been making outlandish claims in this country for years. First, they claim Airbus has created and supports 120,000 jobs in this country. The Commerce Department can only document 500. Airbus says it subcontracts with as many as 800 firms in the United States, though they have moved that number up and down over the years. The Commerce Department can only come up with 250.  This last week, our Commerce Department released an exhaustive study done at the request of this Congress on the U.S. jet transport industry. That 150-page report once again comes to the same conclusion we have heard time and time again. Airbus is not an American company, and Airbus does almost nothing to support the hundreds of thousands of American workers who depend on this important industry.  Airbus and EADS are not helping America's aerospace industry; they are destroying it. In 15 years, 700,000 American workers have lost their jobs while Europe keeps adding new workers to the EADS and Airbus payroll. That is simply unacceptable.  Looking at their claims in American press alone, Airbus appears to be a pseudo-American company looking to create more jobs and helping to grow our economy. That is not the real story. Take a look at what Airbus proprietors say in Europe when they think we are not looking. A few months ago, with a lot of pomp and circumstance, the latest European Airbus product, the A380, was unveiled with four heads of state. Their comments show Europe's true intentions.  From the Spanish Prime Minister, Jose Luis Rodriquez Zapetero:       The European Union has built the plane that is the standard      bearer for European and global aeronautics.  He went on to boast:       What we see here today is Europe cannot be stopped.  He is saying that Europe, not a company, cannot be stopped.  From the French President, Jacques Chirac:       It is a technological feat and a great European success.      When it takes to the skies, it will carry the colors of our      continent, and our technological ambitions to even greater      heights.  From the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair:       It is European cooperation at its best. Airbus demonstrates      that we can achieve more together in Europe than we ever can      alone.  Finally, the German Chancellor, when asked about subsidies to Airbus, said:       We have done that in the past, we are doing it now, and we      will do so in the future.  This does not sound like a company bent on doing anything for American workers, but, again, that is what Airbus and its supporters are saying and doing to get what they want.  Unfortunately, the examples only continue. I do not have to look any further than the NBC Nightly News to find another shocking attack on American values and workers. For years, Airbus told us they will do anything to get a deal, and apparently they will sell to anyone. Not long ago, NBC News uncovered direct evidence of Airbus efforts to sell military aircraft to a country focused on destabilizing and undermining American interests in the Middle East, a country that is currently in the pursuit of nuclear weapons, a country to which no real American company would dare sell weapons.  NBC News was able to get a camera crew into an airshow in Kish, Iran, and they found EADS pitching their military helicopters to Iran.  I ask unanimous consent that the full transcript of the NBC story be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                  European Firms Display Wares in Iran              [By Lisa Myers & the NBC Investigative Unit]       Kish, Iran.--As President Bush pressures European allies to      get tougher with Iran, NBC News got a rare glimpse inside the      country--at an Iranian air show attended by some of the      world's leading military contractors eager to do business      with America's adversary.       On the island of Kish, mullahs mixed with Ukrainian      generals amid photos of the Ayatollah Khomeini. Iran's      contempt for the United States was clear--emblazoned      underneath a helicopter, in Farsi: ``Death to America.''       It's generally illegal for American companies to do      business with Iran. But NBC News found more than a dozen      European defense and aviation firms eager to fill the void.      Some do business with the Pentagon, yet they were actively      selling their wares to Iran.       ``We sell to Iran [sic] Air Force,'' said Francois Leloup      from Aerazur, a French company that markets fighter pilot      vests, anti-gravity suits and other protective gear for      military pilots.       ``We sell mainly to security people like police,'' said      Arnaud Chevalier with Auxiliaire Technique, which was      representing a group of companies at its exhibition booth.      Some of the brochures on dispay showed tank helmets,      communication systems for light armored vehicles and an      ``infantry headset.'' Chevalier said such equipment was ``not      for sale.''       NBC News showed our video from the air show to arms expert      John Pike, director of the nonprofit organization      GlobalSecurity.org.       ``I think that the Europeans would sell their grandmothers      to the Iranians if they thought they could make a buck,''      says Pike.       Also exhibiting at the show--European Aeronautic Defence      and Space Company (EADS) and its subsidiary Eurocopter--which      has launched a campaign in the United States to get a bigger      share of Pentagon contracts, featuring ads that wrap the      company in the American flag.       But if the company is so pro-American, why is it ignoring      U.S. policy to isolate Iran?       ``As a European company, we're not supposed to take into      account embargoes from the U.S.,'' says Michel Tripier, with      EADS.       ``The emphasis here is on our civil helicopters. We are not      offering military helicopters here,'' he adds.       Yet, prominent on the company's video in Iran--a military      helicopter.       ``It says `Navy' in their own promotional videotape,'' says      John Pike. ``I guess they're hoping Iran's navy is going to      want to buy it.''       EADS says the helicopter just happened to be on the video,      and that it abides by U.S. and European rules against selling      military goods to Iran.       Another company, Finmeccanica, recently won a contract to      build a new version of the presidential helicopter, Marine      One, as part of a group led by U.S. contractor Lockheed      Martin.       It was also in Kish showing off its helicopters to Iran.       ``This company is building the American president's new      helicopter, and they're trying to trade with the enemy!''      exclaims Pike.       Steven Bryen used to be the Pentagon official responsible      for preventing technology from going to countries like Iran.      Now he's the president of Finmeccanica in the United States.      Does he think Iran is an enemy of the United States? .       ``I think they're our enemy at this point,'' says Bryen.      ``I mean, they're behaving like our enemy.''       So why would Bryen's company trade with an enemy?       ``In Europe, they don't call it the enemy,'' he says. ``If      it's a civilian item that doesn't threaten anyone, then I      don't have a problem with that.''       European subsidiaries of NBC's parent company, General      Electric, have sold energy and power equipment to Iran, but      GE recently announced it will make no new sales. (MSNBC is a      Microsoft-NBC joint venture.)       Still, even with the president now pushing hard to isolate      Tehran, European allies are likely to continue their role as      what one company called, ``a reliable partner for Iran.''
