Speaker, it is my privilege to commend an outstanding citizen of Indiana's First Congressional District, Mr. Ernest Niemeyer. On Friday, January 24, 1997, a testimonial dinner at the Radisson Star Hotel in Merrillville, Indiana, was held to honor Ernie for his 28 years of dedicated public service.  Ernie has devoted most of his life to improving and maintaining an outstanding environment for Indiana's First Congressional District. Over his distinguished career, Ernie served as a Lake County councilman for 4 years, Indiana State senator for 12 years, and Lake County commissioner for 12 years.  Ernie's public service began in 1962, when he was elected as a Lake County councilman. In 1968, Ernie was appointed to the Lake County Parks Board. Ernie was immediately elected president. Under his stewardship, the park board obtained the first two county parks: Lemon Lake and Stoney Run. In 1970, Ernie successfully ran for sixth district State senator. Ernie served his constituency as the chairman for the agricultural subcommittee. In this capacity, he introduced and was successful in passing legislation for funding projects, including the Williams Levee in the Kankakee River. Ernie was then promoted to senate majority whip. In 1984, Ernie was elected as third district Lake County commissioner, where he proudly served as a senior member. During this tenure, he served twice as commissioner board president.  Over the years, Ernie has also devoted time to numerous committees and boards. He has served as chairman of the Lake County Drainage Board and the Kankakee River Basin Commission. He also was an active member of the County Planning Commission, the Lake County Solid Waste District, and the Indiana State Association of County Commissioners.  Ernie's unselfish dedication to his civic duty must also be commended. Ernie was a member of the Lowell VFW, and Post 101 American Legion. He is a past president of the Indiana Auctioneers Association and past director of the National Auctioneers Association. Ernie was also a president of the Indiana Livestock Auction Markets Association, and he still retains membership in the Lowell Chamber of Commerce.  In addition, Ernie answered his country's call and joined the U.S. Army during World War II. He served 2 years in the South Pacific Theatre as a combat infantryman with the 158th Regimental Combat Team. This regiment was engaged in battles in the jungles of New Guinea leading to the liberation of the Philippines from the Japanese imperial forces. During those campaign battles in the Philippines, Ernie earned and was awarded the prestigious Combat Infantryman's Badge, three battle stars, and individual campaign ribbons. For bravery and dedication beyond the normal call of duty to his comrades in battle, he was honored with the Bronze Battle Star Special Award.  After returning home, Ernie took steps to begin his professional career as an auctioneer. In 1951, he graduated from auctioneers school and established one of the most successful auctioning businesses in northern Indiana. Ernie shares this business with his son, Rick.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in commending Ernie for his tireless efforts to improve the quality of life for Indiana's First Congressional District. Ernie, his wife, Norma, and their children, Doyle, Rick, and Pam, can be proud of his record of unselfish dedication to the public. His service will forever remain a part of northwest Indiana's great history.                          ____________________
