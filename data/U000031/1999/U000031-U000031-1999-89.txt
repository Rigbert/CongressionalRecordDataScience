Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Tiahrt amendment. I have to say, and I mentioned this earlier today on the House floor, when a number of us met with the Speaker and the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Young), the new chairman of the Committee on Appropriations, earlier this year, we talked about this bill and how we would like to support it but, for a number of reasons we were not able to.  Much to the credit of Speaker Hastert, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Young), the chairman of the committee, and now the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Tiahrt), we are really offsetting all of the costs of this supplemental appropriation bill. Because of that, we are not adding to the debt. We are not adding to the deficit. We are looking to make this bill work in the right way. I think all of our colleagues should support this bill and this amendment to make it even stronger than the committee reported out. I rise in strong support.
