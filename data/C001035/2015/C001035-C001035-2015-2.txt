I know that the chairman and vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee worked hard to ensure that a cyber security bill passed this year.  Unfortunately, however, the American people and economy will remain vulnerable to a catastrophic cyber attack against our critical infrastructure even after this bill becomes law.  Critical infrastructure refers to entities that are vital to the safety, health, and economic well-being of the American people, such as the major utilities that run the Nation's electric grid, thenational air transportation system that moves passengers and cargo safely from one location to another, and the elements of the financial sector that ensure the $14 trillion in payments made every day are securely routed through the banking system.  The Senate-passed cyber bill included an important provision I authored with the support of Senators Mikulski, Coats, Reed, Warner, Heinrich, King, Hirono, and Wyden that would have required the Department of Homeland Security, in conjunction with the appropriate Federal agencies, to undertake an assessment of the fewer than 65 critical infrastructure entities at greatest risk of causing catastrophic harm if they were the targets of a successful cyber attack.  By ``catastrophic harm,'' the Department of Homeland Security means a single cyber attack that would likely result in 2,500 deaths, $50 billion in economic damage, or a severe degradation of our national security. In other words, if one of these entities upon which we depend each day were attacked, the results would be devastating.  Following the assessment, the provision then required a report to Congress describing the steps that could be taken to lessen the vulnerability of these entities and to decrease the risk of catastrophic harm resulting from such a cyber attack against our critical infrastructure.  Inexplicably, this provision, which was supported by a majority of the members of the Senate Intelligence Committee, was eliminated in the negotiations between the leaders of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees.  I am told that this important provision was dropped because of opposition from certain industry groups that claimed that the current investment and regulatory structure is sufficient to protect our critical infrastructure; yet our provision explicitly included existing regulators in the assessment process and required no new mandates. Compromise language that would have made this even clearer was also rejected.  Our provision appropriately distinguished between the vast majority of businesses, such as a retail store or a chain of small ice cream shops, and the fewer than 65 critical infrastructure entities that could debilitate the U.S. economy or our way of life if attacked; yet the final version of the cyber bill treats these very different entities in exactly the same way.  I ask unanimous consent that a November 30, 2015, letter sent from a majority of the Senators on the Senate Intelligence Committee to the chairmen and vice chairmen of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees that corrects the Record on what this provision does and why it is necessary be printed in the Record following my remarks.  These fewer than 65 entities warrant our special attention because there is ample evidence, both classified and unclassified, that demonstrates the threat facing critical infrastructure and the deficiencies in the cyber security capability to defend them.  The Director of National Intelligence, Jim Clapper, has testified that the greatest threat facing our country is in cyber space. He has stated before the Armed Services Committee that the number one cyber challenge that concerns him the most is an attack on our Nation's critical infrastructure.  His assessment is backed up by several intrusions into the industrial controls of critical infrastructure. Since 2009, the Wall Street Journal has published reports regarding efforts by foreign adversaries, such as China, Russia, and Iran, to leave behind software on American critical infrastructure and to disrupt U.S. banks through cyber intrusions.  Multiple natural gas pipeline companies were the target of a sophisticated cyber intrusion campaign beginning in December 2011, and Saudi Arabia's oil company, Aramco, was subject to a destructive cyber attack in 2012.  When I asked Admiral Rogers, the Director of the National Security Agency with responsibility for cyber space, how prepared our country was for a cyber attack against our critical infrastructure in a hearing this summer, he replied that we are at a ``5 or 6.''  Last month, the Deputy Director of the NSA, Richard Ledgett, was asked during a CNN interview if foreign actors already have the capability of shutting down key U.S. infrastructure, such as the financial sector, energy, transportation, and air traffic control. His response? ``Absolutely.''  When it comes to cyber security, ignorance is not bliss. The least we should do is to ask DHS and the appropriate Federal agencies to describe what more could be done to prevent a catastrophic cyber attack on critical infrastructure that could cause thousands of deaths and/or a devastating blow to our economy or national defense.  Congress has missed an opportunity to improve our Nation's cyber preparedness by refusing to even ask DHS or the appropriate Federal agencies to understand and identify what more could be done to prevent a catastrophic cyber attack on the fewer than 65 critical infrastructure entities.  A cyber attack on our critical infrastructure is not a matter of ``if,'' but a matter of ``when.'' We are at September 10 levels in terms of cyber preparedness--a sentiment expressed by former Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta in 2012 and in the 9/11 Commission's 10th anniversary report released last year.  We cannot afford to wait for a ``cyber 9/11'' before protecting our critical infrastructure. By rejecting this provision, this Congress has elected to take just such a risk.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                                Washington, DC, November 30, 2015.     Hon. Richard Burr,     Chairman, Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Washington          DC.     Hon. Michael T. McCaul,     House Committee on Homeland Security,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Devin Nunes,     House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Washington,          DC.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein     Vice Chairman, Senate Select Committee on Intelligence,          Washington, DC.     Hon. Bennie G. Thompson,     House Committee on Homeland Security,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Adam B. Schiff,     House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Washington,          DC.       Dear Chairman Burr, Vice Chairman Feinstein, Chairman      McCaul, Ranking Member Thompson, Chairman Nunes, and Ranking      Member Schiff: We strongly support the enactment of a      voluntary cybersecurity information sharing bill, which will      promote better communication between the private sector and      the federal government on cyber threats and vulnerabilities.      For 99 percent of businesses, the voluntary information      sharing framework established in law should be sufficient to      avoid catastrophic harm.       It would be a mistake, however, to treat the country's most      critical infrastructure, upon which our people and our      economy depend, the same way as a retail business, such as a      chain of small ice cream shops. That is why Section 407 of S.      754, the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA)      appropriately distinguishes between the vast majority of      businesses and those entities already designated by the      federal government as critical infrastructure at greatest      risk. Unless Section 407 of S. 754, the Cybersecurity      Information Sharing Act (CISA) is retained in the final      cybersecurity bill, these very different entities will be      treated exactly the same way under this legislation.       Critical infrastructure refers to entities that are vital      to the safety, health, and economic wellbeing of the American      people, such as the major utilities that run the nation's      electrical grid. Section 407, however, only applies to the      fewer than 65 entities that have already been designated by      the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) as the critical      infrastructure entities where a cyber attack would likely      result in catastrophic harm. By catastrophic harm, DHS means      a single cyber attack that would likely result in 2,500      deaths, $50 billion in economic damage, or a severe      degradation of our national security.       Given these devastating consequences, we urge you to retain      Section 407 of CISA. Ample evidence, both classified and      unclassified, testifies to the threat facing critical      infrastructure and the deficiencies in the cybersecurity      capability to defend them. Since 2009, the Wall Street      Journal has published reports regarding efforts by foreign      adversaries, such as China, Russia, and Iran, to leave behind      software on American critical infrastructure or to disrupt      U.S. banks through cyber intrusions. Multiple natural gas      pipeline companies were the target of a sophisticated cyber      intrusion campaign beginning in December 2011, and Saudi      Arabia's oil company, Aramco, was subject to a destructive      cyber attack in 2012.       Admiral Mike Rogers, the Director of the National Security      Agency, has said publicly     that ``We have . . . observed intrusions into industrial      control systems . . . what concerns us is that . . .      capability can be used by nation-states, groups or      individuals to take down the capability of the control      systems.''       At a recent Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on      cybersecurity, the Director of National Intelligence was      asked what one cyber challenge concerned him the most. He      testified that it was a large-scale cyber attack against the      United States' infrastructure. At a subsequent open hearing      of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Senator      Collins asked Admiral Mike Rogers how prepared our country      was for such an attack against our critical infrastructure.      His answer, on a scale of 1-10, was that we are at a ``5 or      6''. That is a failing grade that we cannot ignore.       Section 407 has been mischaracterized in correspondence we      have received, so we would also like to clarify some key      facts about it. First, Section 407 is not counter to the      overall voluntary nature of CISA, and it does not impose new      incident reporting requirements on the fewer than 65 covered      entities. Of course, many critical infrastructure entities,      such as those in the electrical sector, are already subject      to mandatory incident reporting to their federal regulators.       Section 407 simply requires DHS to undertake an assessment      of the critical infrastructure that it has identified where a      single catastrophic cyber attack could cause deaths and      devastation and then report to Congress what actions could be      taken to lessen their vulnerability and to decrease the risk      of catastrophic harm resulting from such an attack.       Despite claims to the contrary, Section 407 is also      consistent with existing government authority, regulations,      and programs. The text of the provision clearly states that      the report and strategy required by DHS must be produced ``in      conjunction with the appropriate agency head . . .''      Appropriate agency head means the head of the existing      sector-specific agency for such an entity or the existing      federal regulator for that entity.       Section 407 will also likely reduce, rather than increase,      the existing liability risk for the critical infrastructure      entities that have already been identified as being at      greatest risk of cyber attack. Liability risk is incurred      when an entity actually fails to mitigate cyber      vulnerabilities that they should have known about and      addressed. Rather than increasing this risk, Section 407      seeks to share the burden of defending critical      infrastructure against the most sophisticated cyber attacks      by requiring the Secretary of Homeland Security to conduct an      assessment of the cybersecurity of only the fewer than 65      entities. Following this assessment, Section 407 would      require the Secretary to develop a strategy to mitigate the      risk of catastrophic effects. The least we should do is to      ask DHS and the appropriate federal agencies to describe what      more could be done to prevent a catastrophic cyber attack on      critical infrastructure that could cause thousands of deaths      and/or a devastating blow to our economy or national defense.       Finally, we urge you to review the list of entities that      are, in fact, covered by Section 407. Ironically, many of the      trade associations who oppose this provision do not represent      a single entity that would be covered by this amendment      because none of their members has been designated as critical      infrastructure at greatest risk. The list of entities and the      classified intelligence regarding the threats to critical      infrastructure have been provided to your respective      committees.       If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to      contact us.           Sincerely,     Susan M. Collins.     Daniel Coats.     Martin Heinrich.     Mazie K. Hirono.     Barbara A. Mikulski.     Mark R. Warner.     Angus S. King, Jr.     Jack Reed.
