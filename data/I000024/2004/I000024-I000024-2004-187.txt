1072, the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient Transportation Equity Act, be printed in the Record. The estimate was not available when the report was filed by the Committee on Environment and Public Works.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE COST ESTIMATE     S. 1072--Safe, Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient          Transportation Equity Act of 2003       Summary: Assuming appropriation action consistent with the      funding levels specified in the bill, and assuming the      appropriation of amounts necessary to complete highway and      environmental studies and regulations required by the bill,      CBO estimates that implementing S. 1072 would cost $172      billion over the 2004-2009 period and about $48 billion after      2009.       CBO estimates that enacting S. 1072 would reduce direct      spending by about $1.7 billion over the 2004-2009 period and      by about $3.4 billion over the 2004-2013 period. Finally, the      Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimates that enacting S.      1072 would reduce revenue collections by $52 million over the      2004-2009 period and by $130 million over the 2004-2013      period.       S. 1072 would extend the authority for the Federal-Aid      Highway program. For this program, the bill would provide      about $218 billion of contract authority over the 2004-2009     period, and it would authorize the appropriation of about      $2.6 billion over the same period. S. 1072 also would require      the Department of Transportation (DOT) and the Environmental      Protection Agency (EPA) to complete certain studies and      regulations concerning highway construction and air quality.       Consistent with the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit      Control Act, CBO assumes for this estimate that the contract      authority for the Federal-Aid Highway program would continue      at the same rate provided immediately before the program      would expire at the end of 2009. Hence, this estimate      includes an additional $4.9 billion in contract authority in      each year over the 2010-2013 period.       S. 1072 would make several changes to current law that      would affect direct spending. The legislation would end      funding for DOT's Minimum Guarantee program, increase funding      for the Emergency Relief program, provide DOT the authority      to spend certain fees, and provide DOT the authority to share      monetary judgments pertaining to fraud in the federal highway      and transit programs with state and local agencies.       JCT estimates that enacting S. 1072 would result in lower      revenue collections by expanding the State Infrastructure      Banks program and by changing the eligibility requirements of      the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act      (TIFIA) program. Under current law, five states can use      grants from the Federal-Aid Highway program to fund a state      infrastructure bank. S. 1072 would extend that authority to      all states. S. 1072 would change the TIFIA program by making      smaller projects eligible for credit assistance. Both      provisions would decrease revenue collections by increasing      the use of tax-exempt bonds.       S. 1072 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector      mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act      (UMRA); any costs to state or local governments would result      from complying with conditions of federal assistance. In      general, the bill would benefit states by reauthorizing      federal highway programs for the next six years.       Estimated cost to the Federal Government: The estimated      budgetary impact of S. 1072 is shown in Table 1. The costs of      this legislation fall within budget function 400      (transportation).       Basis of estimate: For this estimate, CBO assumes that S.      1072 will be enacted this spring. We also assume      appropriation action consistent with the authorization and      contract authority levels in the bill. Estimates of outlays      are based on historical spending patterns of the Federal-Aid      Highway program. CBO estimates that implementing S. 1072      would cost almost $172 billion over the 2004-2009 period and      that enacting S. 1072 would lower direct spending by about      $3.4 billion over the 2004-2013 period. JCT estimates that      enacting S. 1072 would lower revenues by $130 million over      the 2004-2013 period.

Most outlays that result from the contract authority,  however, are subject to obligation limitations contained in appropriation acts and are therefore  discretionary. S. 1072 would provide contract authority for the Federal-Aid Highway program. CBO assumes  appropriation action will continue to limit outlays from the portions of the Federal-Aid Highway program that  are subject to limitations under current law as well as new components of the program that would be authorized  by S. 1072.\2\ Estimate provided by Joint Committee on Taxation.     Spending subject to appropriation       Over the 2004-2009 period, S. 1072 would provide about $218      billion of contract authority and authorize the appropriation      of about $2.6 billion for the Federal-Aid Highway program.      The bill also would require DOT and EPA to complete certain      studies and regulations. Assuming appropriation action      consistent with the contract authority and authorizations      specified in the bill, and assuming the appropriation of      amounts necessary to cover the studies and regulations, CBO      estimates that implementing S. 1072 would cost almost $172      billion over the 2004-2009 period.       Under current law, most spending from the Federal-Aid      Highway program is considered discretionary because it is      controlled by annual limitations on obligations set in      appropriations acts. For this estimate, CBO assumes      appropriation action will continue to limit outlays from the      Federal-Aid Highway program.       S. 1072 would require DOT and EPA to complete certain      studies and regulations concerning highway construction and      air quality. The bill would require DOT to assess the      condition of the surface transportation system and develop a      plan to ensure this system will continue to meet the nation's      transportation needs, and it would require EPA to improve the      methodology for measuring air particles. The bill also would      require DOT to issue regulations to improve worker injury      rates and traffic flow during road construction, and it would      require EPA to issue regulations for the management of air      quality data during disasters. Based on information from DOT      and EPA, CBO estimates that completing these studies and      regulations would cost $7 million over the 2004-2009 period,      subject to appropriation of the necessary amounts.     Direct spending and revenues       The legislation would end funding for DOT's Minimum      Guarantee program, increase funding for the Emergency Relief      program, provide the authority to spend certain fees, and      provide the authority to share certain monetary judgments.      CBO estimates these changes would lower direct spending by      about $3.4 billion over the 2004-2013 period and reduce      revenues by $130 million over the same period. The bill's      changes in direct spending and revenues are detailed in Table      2.       Minimum Guarantee Program. Of the total amount of contract      authority for the Minimum Guarantee program, current law      exempts $266 million of contract authority for fiscal year      2004 from any limitation on obligations. Consistent with the      Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act, CBO      assumes this program continues at the same rate through      fiscal year 2004 and in each of the following years. Under      this baseline assumption, $639 million of contract authority      for the Minimum Guarantee program is exempt from annual      limits on obligations set in appropriation acts, and the      resulting outlays are therefore considered mandatory. S. 1072      would eliminate funding for this program. CBO assumes that      eliminating funding for the Minimum Guarantee program would      lower direct spending by $5.2 billion over the 2004-2013      period relative to the current baseline.       Emergency Relief Program. Current law provides permanent      authority for the Emergency Relief program and limits the      program's obligations to $100 million each year. Because      appropriation acts do not control spending from the program,      its outlays are considered mandatory. S. 1072 would raise the      limit on obligations to $300 million each year. CBO estimates      that this provision would increase direct spending by $1.7      billion over the 2004-2013 period.

Estimate provided by Joint Committee on Taxation.       Spending of Certain Fees. Under current law, DOT collects      fees from participants in classes held by the National      Highway Institute and participants in the TIFIA program.      These fees cover a portion of the administrative costs of the      classes and the TIFIA program. S. 1072 would provide DOT the      authority to spend the fees without further appropriation.      Based on information from DOT, CBO estimates the department      will collect--beginning in 2005--$4 million each year from      participants in classes held by the National Highway      Institute and $1 million each year from participants in the      TIFIA program. CBO estimates that this provision would      increase direct spending by about $45 million over the 2005-     2013 period.       Monetary Judgments. S. 1072 would provide DOT the authority      to share monetary judgments pertaining to fraud in the      federal highway and transit programs with state and local      agencies. This provision would apply to judgments in criminal      prosecutions as well as civil judgments. Under current law,      monetary judgments that result from criminal prosecutions are      deposited in the Crime Victims Fund and later spent. Civil      judgments, however, are not spent under current law. The      federal government received an average of $18 million each      year in monetary judgments from civil cases over the 1999-     2003 period. Because the federal government pays most costs      associated with fraud investigations and generally requires      states to provide only 20 percent of the total cost for most      surface transportation projects, we expect that DOT would      share 20 percent of such judgments with the states. Hence,      CBO estimates that this provision would increase direct      spending by $4 million each year, beginning in 2005, and by      $36 million over the 2005-2013 period.       Revenues. Enacting S. 1072 would lower revenue collections      by expanding the State Infrastructure Banks (SIBS) and the      TIFIA programs. JCT estimates that enhancing both provisions      would lower revenues by $52 million over the 2004-2009 period      and $130 million over the 2004-2013 period.       Under current law, five states can use grants from the      Federal-Aid Highway program to fund a state infrastructure      bank. States use infrastructure banks to finance      transportation projects by providing loans to local      governments or repaying bonds. S. 1072 would extend that      authority to all states. JCT estimates that this provision      would increase the use of tax-exempt bonds and therefore      decrease federal revenues by $73 million over the 2004-2013      period.       For a project to receive credit assistance under the TIFIA      program, current law requires the projects' total cost to      equal or exceed the lower of the following two amounts: $100      million, or 50 percent of the states' grants from certain      highway programs in the previous fiscal year. S. 1072 would      change those two amounts to $50 million and 20 percent of the      states' highway grants. Credit assistance under the TIFIA      program can cover a portion of the remaining cost with tax-     exempt bonds. JCT estimates that enacting S. 1072 would      increase the number of projects that receive credit      assistance under TIFIA and, therefore, increase the use of      tax-exempt bonds, reducing revenue collections by $57 million      over the 2004-2013 period.       Intergovernmental and private-sector impact: S. 1072      contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as      defined in UMRA. Any additional costs to state or local      governments to comply with grant conditions would be incurred      voluntarily. In general, the bill would benefit states by      reauthorizing federal highway programs for the next six      years.       Subtitle E, Environmental Planning and Review, would      clarify and expand existing conditions of aid by requiring      Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) and states to      consider additional environmental factors during the planning      process and to update long-range transportation plans more      frequently. MPOs and states have to comply with various      transportation planning requirements in order to receive      federal assistance. According to MPO representatives, the      provisions of the bill may require smaller organizations to      hire additional staff, however, CBO does not expect those      costs to be significant. Furthermore, states and MPOs receive      various forms of funding under title 23 and title 49 that      would cover planning-related expenses. S. 1072 would increase      the amount of title 23 funds set aside for MPOs.       States would benefit from other provisions of the bill,      including funding to establish or update systems to report      incidents more quickly, to develop intermodal passenger      facilities, and to encourage the collection of tolls on      certain interstate highways and high-occupancy-vehicle lanes.
