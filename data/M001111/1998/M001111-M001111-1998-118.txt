 We demand higher learning skills. We have a responsibility to do something about it. We can't just say, ``Oh, it's a local school district problem.'' ``Oh, it's a State problem.'' ``Oh, it's somebody else's problem.''  We have a responsibility in the U.S. Senate as leaders in this country to send a message that we want to make a difference and we are listening to the people we represent that class size makes a difference.  Let me also tell you what some students say, because I have a group of students who are my advisors. They are called my student advisory youth involvement team or SAYIT. I go to them and ask them to tell me what they think of the issues we are debating.  On the issue of class size, this is what students say:  Brook Bodnar, who is age 16, recently moved from a school with larger classes to Olympia High School which has smaller classes. She says:       . . . with smaller classes I'm learning so much more. Class      is going so much faster.  That is what a student says.  Jared Stueckle, age 16, a junior at Selah High School, believes education should be a higher priority in funding and that class size is a good investment. Jared says:       The classes in which the number (of students) is lower I      generally do better, but in a crowded class, the teacher does      not give us enough individual attention.  I have numbers of comments from young students. They are excellent. I ask unanimous consent they be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                Class Size Reduction--What Students Say       Meghan Sullivan, age 15, a 10th grader at Tumwater High      School, says: ``. . . reduction is needed especially at the      K-5 grade levels. This is the beginning of their education      and this is where they form study habits and learning skills,      so it's more important to get some one-on-one contact with      teachers.''       Antonella Novi, age 18, a senior at Anacortes High School,      says: ``Smaller class sizes enrich the learning experience      for the student and the teaching experience for the      teacher.''       Jaime Oberlander, age 16, a junior at Tumwater High School,      says: ``I know that I have learned more in smaller classes. I      have a stronger relationship with the teacher. I am less      intimidated to participate in class discussions or ask for      help when I need it. I also receive more feedback from my      teacher . . . my teacher can spend more time critiquing my      work and helping me to learn.''
