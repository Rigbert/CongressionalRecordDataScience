Steve Tokarski. I can truly say that when it comes to service to one's community, few people can match the outstanding efforts of Steve Tokarski. Steve has always been a dedicated, distinguished, and honorable citizen. Having known him for many years, I can say with certainty that he is one of the most involved citizens I have ever known. Steve has served the Polish American community in Northwest Indiana and beyond for many years, and for his efforts, he will be honored at a banquet hosted by the Silver Bell Club on Sunday, September 21, 2008, at the Salvatorian Monastery in Merrillville, Indiana.  An attorney by trade, Steve began his career after completing his Doctor of Jurisprudence degree from the Indiana University School of Law in 1969. Prior to that, he attended Purdue University, where he earned his Bachelor of Arts degree. Mr. Tokarski's desire to serve his community, paired with his passion for his chosen profession, eventually led to him serving not only as a deputy prosecutor for Lake County, Indiana, but also asthe attorney for the City of Lake Station and the Town of Schererville. Steve's knowledge of law and his overwhelming desire to serve his community made him a perfect fit to continue his work on behalf of the Polish American community, and his willingness to serve has made him very successful in the many posts he has held.  Indisputably, Steve Tokarski has been extremely successful throughout his legal career. However, his efforts on behalf of the Polish American community have truly set him apart from his peers. As a member of the Polish National Alliance (PNA), he has served as the Director for the Indiana/Michigan region, as a member of the Board of Directors, as Chairperson of the Rules and Regulations Committee, and as a member of the Education Committee, the Financial Control Committee, and the Membership Committee. He also served as Parliamentarian, First Vice-Chairperson, and Secretary for various conventions. Additionally, Steve has served as President of PNA Council Number 127 and of PNA Lodge Number 2365--Silver Bell Club.  In addition to his efforts with the PNA, Steve has also been extremely active in the Polish American Congress (PAC), currently serving as the President for its Indiana division, a position he has maintained since 1977. Mr. Tokarski has also served as the National Director and the Parliamentarian for the Council of National Directors of the PAC and as Chairperson of the By-Laws and Grievance Committees. He has also served as Vice President of the PAC's charitable foundation since 1995.  Steve's community involvement does not end with his service to these two outstanding organizations. He is also an active member of several Purdue University alumni associations, as well as the Purdue President's Council, and he has held positions as Secretary-Treasurer and State Vice President of the National Advocates Society since 1984.  When not engaged within the community, Steve spends his spare time with his loving wife of 35 years, Marsha. Steve and Marsha, a stained glass artist and former science teacher, have two sons: David and Christopher.  Madam Speaker, Steve Tokarski has given his time and efforts selflessly to his church, his community, and the Polish American people of Northwest Indiana and beyond. His efforts have touched the hearts of many people throughout the years, and at this time, I ask that you and all of my distinguished colleagues join me in commending him for his lifetime of service and dedication.                          ____________________
