If someone owned a daycare facility and hired, without any background check and without adequate investigation, an employee with a long criminal record of being a sexual predator, someone hired this person to work in a daycare center and that employee then harmed one of the children at the daycare center, I think the Senator from Rhode Island and I would agree that many would argue that daycare center was negligent, it had a responsibility it did not meet, and that this daycare center should be held responsible, even in court, for the harm that came to the child.
