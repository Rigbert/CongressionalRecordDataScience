Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the past and present men and women of the Deale Volunteer Fire Department and Rescue Squad. This October, they will be celebrating their 50th anniversary of service to the citizens of Deale, MD.  Prior to the fire company's inception in 1946, the citizens of Deale relied upon surrounding communities to provide their fire protection. As the population grew, following World War II, it became apparent that Deale could no longer rely entirely on other communities and it needed its own fire department. In October 1946, a small group of community leaders started the Deale Volunteer Fire Department. They were Tilghman Franklin, Gordon Phipps, Oregon Nutwell, Ray Clark, Sterling Knopp, Maurice Whittington, and Joseph Adcock.  As with most volunteer fire companies they started off small. They didn't have much money and hadn't been in the community long enough to establish a very large volunteer base. However, what they lacked in resources they more than made up in hard work. Their first fire engine was purchased second hand from the Clinton Volunteer Fire Department and they used a local businessman's garage as a firehouse. The first few years of the department were difficult because the department had to be entirely self-sufficient. They raised the necessary funds to purchase all the equipment and start construction on a proper firehouse by hosting oyster roasts, game parties, and collecting donations from the community.  In 1951, the fire department started receiving tax funds from Anne Arundel County. This steady revenue, supplemented by their fundraising activities, allowed the department to complete the second stage of the firehouse construction which began in 1948. Additionally it allowed them to hire Junior Windsor and James ``Tutti'' Revell to be the first full-time professional firefighters for the department.  The department continued to grow with the community during the succeeding four decades. They made three additions to the existing firehouse, purchased new equipment, added ambulance service, and expanded their volunteer base and their activities in the community. Under the able leadership of Chief Tommy Manifold, President Gayle Moreland, and Delegates Matt Zang, Tammy Ladd, Jack Browing, and Leonard King the Deale Volunteer Fire Department is 71 members strong and operates three pumper engines, one ambulance, two brush units, and three fire and rescue boats.  The members of the Deale Volunteer Fire Department and Rescue Squad, past and present, are all heros. Not because they have all saved a child from a burning house, but because for the past 50 years they have given their time, their effort, and risked their lives on behalf of their community. They don't do it for money. They don't do it for fame or acclamation. They do it, Mr. Speaker, because they care. They care about the safety of their fellow citizens and they care about the welfare of their community above that of their own--and that Mr. Speaker is my definition of a hero.  Mr. Speaker, I am honored to congratulate the 50 years of service the Deale Volunteer Fire and Rescue Squad has given their community and wish them continued success in their mission.                          ____________________
