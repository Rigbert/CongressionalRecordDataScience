 I would like to take a bit different tack because I met Chairman Murtha for the first time in 1977 when I was an associate staff on Appropriations. My Member and my mentor, Adam Benjamin, Jr., was a member of the Appropriations Committee that year. Mr. Murtha, Mr. Carney, Mr. Benjamin and others were instrumental in that year, not only in that appropriations process, but in also establishing the Steel Caucus, because they were very concerned about people who worked in their district.  What I took away as a staffer from that relationship with Mr. Murtha is the fact that he always treated me and every other staff he came into contact with with respect. He always heard what I had to say and what other staff had to say, whether, as Mr. Obey implied, he always agreed with you or not, and he always treated you very professionally.  I had no conception during those 6 years working as a staff member that the time would come that I would serve as a colleague on the committee with Mr. Murtha, would serve on the subcommittee, and would be blessed enough to call him a friend. He was a friend to every person he encountered. He was a good friend to the people he represented, because he was most concerned with those who worked hard, who needed a job or who needed a hand up.  Our country is much richer because of that attitude that Mr. Murtha carried with him every day, and the world is certainly a much better place than it would have been had he not walked among us.  The fact is, as far as his activities on the Defense subcommittee, and my Member was a former marine as well, I was always struck that while some people are very focused on weapons systems, Mr. Murtha, while never losing sight of the big picture, was most concerned about that individual man or woman who was in the field, who was risking their life and who was serving our country. As he would suggest, operation and maintenance, how you train, how you provide for their safety, how you equip that person and their family and those children was the most important thing for him.  He taught me many valuable life lessons. I am a better person, and we are all better people because of Mr. Murtha. He will be greatly missed, and I deeply appreciate the gentleman from Pennsylvania for this opportunity.                              {time}  1745
