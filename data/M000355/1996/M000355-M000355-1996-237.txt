 GORTON. Yes.  Mr. McCONNELL. The Senator, of course, is entirely correct. It is totally impossible to level the playing field--the argument that we always hear by the proponents of this bill. As the Senator indicated, the expression of newspapers, of course, is not impacted atall; as a matter of fact, specifically exempted from expenditure. I will just read this from the current law, which has not changed under the bill:       The term ``expenditure'' does not include any news story,      commentary, or editorial distributed through the facilities      of any broadcasting station, newspaper, magazine, or other      periodical publication, unless such facilities are owned or      controlled by any political party, political committee, or      candidate.  In other words, that kind of speech, which is enormously significant in the political discourse that surrounds any particular campaign year is completely outside of the speech limits imposed by this bill. The Senator from Washington is entirely correct, to the extent that the speech of candidates is suppressed, the speech of others is enhanced.
