 President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m., Thursday, March 9; that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and that morning business be closed; finally, that 30 minutes of the majority time on H.J. Res. 57 be under the control of Senator Blunt or his designee.
