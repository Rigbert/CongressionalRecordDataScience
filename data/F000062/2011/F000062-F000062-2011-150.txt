 President, I rise today to join my colleague, Senator Scott Brown, in submitting a resolution that expresses the regret of the U.S. Senate for the passage of discriminatory laws against Chinese immigrants. These laws are no longer in effect today. However, I believe it is important for Congress to express regret for the many injustices that were experienced by Chinese immigrants as a result of these policies, and for all of us as Americans to learn from this difficult chapter in our Nation's past.  Let me begin by offering a brief history of the Chinese Exclusion Act. In the 1870s, an economic downturn created political pressure to slow the growing population of Chinese immigrants who were coming to the United States to pursue a better way of life. In California, State laws and local ordinances were enacted that denied the Chinese basic rights and privileges such as the right to own land and the ability to access public schools.  At the urging of some California lawmakers, the U.S. Congress subsequently passed laws that further denied the rights of Chinese immigrants. The harshest of those measures was the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 that explicitly prohibited all State and Federal courts from naturalizing Chinese persons. This legislation was the first federal law ever enacted to exclude a group of immigrants solely on the basis of race or nationality.  The Chinese Exclusion Act was followed by the passage of the Geary Act in 1892, which extended the Chinese Exclusion Act for 10 years and required all Chinese persons in the United States to register with the Federal Government to obtain certificates of residence to prove their right to be in the U.S.  In order to fully understand this Nation's deep-rooted hostility toward the Chinese during this time period, it is important to contrast the U.S. Government's vastly different treatment of European immigrants who entered the United States through Ellis Island. European immigrants were not subjected to the same burdensome and humiliating screening requirements as the Chinese.  Most are familiar with the stories of those coming to Ellis Island and seeing the Statute of Liberty in New York Harbor. However, often forgotten are the experiences of Chinese immigrants who made it to America by way of Angel Island in California.  In 1910, the U.S. Government opened the Angel Island Immigration Station as a way to isolate Chinese immigrants from the city of San Francisco and the remainder of the bay area in northern California. These immigrants were brought to Angel Island Station where they were separated from family members, subjected to embarrassing medical examinations and grueling interrogations, and detained for months or sometimes years.  Despite these hardships, Chinese immigrants persevered, and they continue to make invaluable contributions to the development and success of our Nation. The enactment of Chinese exclusionary laws is a shameful part of our history that must not be forgotten. It is my hope that this resolution will serve to enlighten those who may not be aware of this regrettable chapter in our Nation's history. In addition, I hope the resolution will help heal and bring some closure for those who lived through this difficult time and are still with us today.  I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan resolution.                          ____________________
