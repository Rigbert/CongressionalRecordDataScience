Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to the gentlewoman's amendment. I believe that we need to set conditions to close the detention facility at Guantanamo. This includes retaining the option to transfer detainees from this facility elsewhere. It is in the United States' national security interest to do so.  Guantanamo has become a rallying cry. It serves as a recruitment tool for terrorists and increases the will of our enemies to fight while decreasing the will of others to work with America.  Part of the rationale for establishing Guantanamo in the first place was the misplaced idea that the facility would be beyond the law--a proposition rejected by the Supreme Court. As a result, the continued operation of this facility creates an impression in the eyes of our allies and enemies alike that the United States selectively observes the rule of law.  There is no reason that we should impose on ourselves the legal and moral problems arising from the prospect of indefinite detentions at Guantanamo after more than one decade. Working through civil courts since 9/11, hundreds of individuals have been convicted of terrorism or terrorism-related offenses and are now serving long sentences in Federal prison. Not one has escaped custody.  Mr. Chairman, I strongly oppose the gentlewoman's amendment and reserve the balance of my time.
