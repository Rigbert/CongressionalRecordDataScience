 President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be placed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 443       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Hoh Indian Tribe Safe      Homelands Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:       (1) The Hoh Indian Reservation, located along the Hoh River      and the Pacific Ocean in a remote section of Jefferson      County, Washington, is the homeland of the Hoh Indian Tribe,      a federally recognized Indian tribe.       (2) Established by Executive Order in 1893, the Reservation      is approximately one square mile, but its habitable acreage      has been reduced over time due to storm surges, repeated      flooding and erosion, and lack of river dredging.       (3) Due to its location along the river and ocean and      frequent torrential rains, 90 percent of the Reservation is      located within a flood zone and, in fact, has flooded      repeatedly over the last five years. In addition, 100 percent      of the Reservation is within a tsunami zone, leaving most of      the Reservation unfit for safe occupation.       (4) The Tribe has repeatedly suffered from serious flood      and wind damage to homes, tribal buildings, and utility      infrastructure that have caused significant damage and      resulted in critical safety and environmental hazards.       (5) Federal agencies such as the Bureau of Indian Affairs,      the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the      Federal Emergency Management Agency have limited authority to      assist the Tribe with housing and other improvements and      services due to the dangerous and unsustainable location of      the Reservation.       (6) The Tribe has purchased from private owners near the      Reservation approximately 260 acres of land in order to move      key infrastructure out of the flood zone.       (7) In addition, the State of Washington's Department of      Natural Resources has transferred ownership of 160 acres of      land to the Tribe.       (8) An approximately 37 acre parcel of logged land,      administered by the National Park Service, lies between the      current Reservation land and those lands acquired by the      Tribe, and the only road accessing the Reservation crosses      this parcel.       (9) Together, the lands described in paragraphs 6, 7, and 8      would constitute a contiguous parcel for the Reservation and      would     create a safe area for members of the Tribe to live and      rebuild their community.

(2) In order to maintain its use as a natural wildlife      corridor and to provide for protection of existing resources,      no logging or hunting shall be allowed on the land.       (3) The Tribe may authorize tribal members to engage in      ceremonial and other treaty uses of these lands and existing      tribal treaty rights are not diminished by this Act.       (4) The Tribe shall survey the boundaries of the Federal      land and submit the survey to the National Park Service for      review and concurrence.       (b) Cooperative Efforts.--Congress urges the Secretary and      the Tribe to enter into written agreements on the following:       (1) Upon completion of the Tribe's proposed emergency fire      response building, Congress urges the parties to work toward      mutual aid agreements.       (2) The National Park Service and the Tribe shall work      collaboratively to provide opportunities for the public to      learn more about the culture and traditions of the Tribe.       (3) The land may be used for the development of a multi-     purpose, non-motorized trail from Highway 101 to the Pacific      Ocean.
