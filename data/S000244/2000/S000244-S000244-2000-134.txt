Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Ohio for yielding. I have always supported Buy American provisions. I support his efforts again. Obviously the money that we are authorizing under this bill should, to the greatest extent possible, go to goods and services that are made in the USA and done by Americans, and I think the gentleman has emphasized that point. This amendment improves a very good bill.
