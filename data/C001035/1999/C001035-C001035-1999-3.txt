President, we are awaiting one final legislative measure that we expect to clear tonight. In the meantime, I thank the floor staff for all of their assistance with this legislative flurry this evening and earlier today. I also express my thanks to the staff of the Senate for their ongoing assistance to me and to other Senators.  I take this opportunity to also praise my own staff, which has worked so hard during this last legislative session. It has been a very productive one, and I feel very fortunate to have such a talented and hard-working staff to support me in my efforts to serve the people of Maine. I thank the presiding officer for his patience as we have proceeded through this last-minute flurry of legislation. We can be proud of the fact that we have been able to clear a great deal of legislation today that will make a real difference for the families of America.                          ____________________
