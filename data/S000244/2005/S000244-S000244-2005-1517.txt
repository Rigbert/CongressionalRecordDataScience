Speaker, this bill does not require the States to do anything or not do anything. It has been very clear from the beginning of the debate on this legislation. What the bill does is it says that a driver's license has to meet certain standards if it is to be acceptable for Federal ID purposes, such as getting on an airplane.  What the motion to recommit does is force the States to do something, or not do something; and that goes directly against the notion of federalism that is contained in this bill and which was drafted by the Committee on Government Reform.  The first vote that we had yesterday on this legislation was on whether we should waive the law relative to unfunded mandates. The vote on that was 228 ``aye'' to 191 ``no.'' The author of this motion to recommit, as well as the 190 who joined him in saying that we should not waive the unfunded mandate law, is now asking the States to have another unfunded mandate.  I would urge all of the 191 who voted ``no'' on the Jackson-Lee objection to consideration of the rule to bring this up to join me in voting ``no'' on this motion to recommit, together with the 228 who voted the right way yesterday.  Vote ``no'' on the motion to recommit; vote ``aye'' on passage.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
