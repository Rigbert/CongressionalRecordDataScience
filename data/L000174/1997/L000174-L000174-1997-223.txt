President, for the past 5 months, we have been engaged in a troubling debate on how best to protect the health of our children, our elderly and our environment. Since the Environmental Protection Agency announced the proposed new standards for air quality, we have witnessed an unprecedented campaign by industry to block these new standards. Opponents instantly attacked the goals rather than sitting down to work with Congress and the administration on how to achieve these goals in a reasonable and cost-effective timeframe. I applaud EPA Administrator Carol Browner for standing up against the onslaught of industry backlash on the new standards. Today, President Clinton showed equal commitment by supporting the thrust of Administrator Browner's recommendation. This decision will reduce the smog and soot that drifts into Vermont from outside the State. I congratulate President Clinton for standing up for the health of our children and our environment. We can now begin the process of finding the most cost-effective means of implementing these standards.  In Vermont, we recognize the benefits of high environmental standards. Over the years, conservationists and the business community have worked together to protect the environment. Vermonters know that a healthy environment promotes a healthy economy. Yet despite our commitment, Vermont and other Northeastern States have become the dumping ground for pollution that seeps across our borders each night with the wind. The new ozone standard makes the biggest pollutors accountable and will reduce the burden on States in the Northeast in their battle to maintain our high standards for air quality. Acid rain taught us that tough State environmental standards were not enough to protect us. We saw some of our healthiest forests die off from pollution borne from outside our region. This situation demands tough national environmental standards to ensure a level playing field.  The new air standards will address two central issues: Where the smog and soot is landing and how to use new scientific evidence to continue improving efforts to protect public health. We learned from the acid rain debate that emissions from dirty coal-fired powerplants in the Midwest can be transported farther than 500 miles. More than 40 percent of the pollution in Vermont is from outside the state. We also know that utility restructuring will encourage increased generation at the powerplants in the Midwest. The new standards proposed by EPA will reduce the smog and soot that drifts into Vermont from these powerplants. Today's decision is a clear victory for the Northeast because we now have a standard that will reduce air pollution at its source.  Since the passage of the Clean Air Act we have made considerable strides in reducing some pollutants. The level of lead pollution we and our children breathe today is one-tenth what it was a decade ago. That figure by itself is a tribute to the success of the original Clean Air Act. If we learned one thing from the acrimonious debate in Congress last year on environmental issues, it is that the American people do not want to halt the progress we have made and merely rest on our environmental laurels. Americans want to keep moving forward on cleaning up our environment. Unfortunately, as I listen to the debate on the Clean Air Act this Congress, I fear that we are not heeding their call. Instead of looking at ways to strengthen the Clean Air Act, we are trying to undercut the existing regulations.  Today, the President recognized the 130 million Americans in 170 major cities who continue to breathe unhealthy air. Congress should listen as well and approve the standards. I will work with my colleagues in theSenate to oppose efforts to block the implementation of these new standards. Members of the House of Representatives have already launched their attack on the standards by introducing legislation to block the President's decision and weaken these standards. It is important to Vermont and to the Nation that we set aside the acrimonious debate that occurred on these standards and work together to develop a cost-effective implementation plan.  The recommendations of the Ozone Transport Assessment Group that were approved by 32 States lay out several concrete steps to clean up our air in the Northeast. I challenge Administrator Browner and the administration to move quickly on these recommendations. In particular, I want Congress and the administration to look at what probably has become one of the largest loopholes in the Clean Air Act: Allowing the dirtiest power plants to continue to operate with vastly inadequate pollution controls. The need to go back and close this loophole now--in this session of Congress--assumes greater urgency because of the deregulation of the electric utility industry.  Tomorrow's United Nations conference on the environment reminds us that we share the air, the water and our planet. There can be no greater legacy that we leave behind for our children and grandchildren than a society secure in its commitment to a healthy and environmentally sound future.                          ____________________
