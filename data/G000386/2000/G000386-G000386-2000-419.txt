 President, the Senate has taken an important step toward real bankruptcy reform on a bipartisan basis. None of this would have been possible without the hard work and cooperation of the ranking member on the subcommittee, Senator Torricelli. We introduced the bill together.  We have a good bill that will restore personal responsibility and crack down on abuses of debt collectors and provide key information to credit card customers about the problems of minimum payment.  I believe we go into conference in a strong position. I think our bill in the Senate is better than the House companion. We will have a spirited conference, I believe, but this year will be easier than last year since the bills are much closer.  In any event, the Senate has done a good job. I thank Senators Hatch, Sessions, Reid, Torricelli, Biden, and Leahy for the strong support they showed for reform.  I also thank Rene Augustine and Makan Delrahim of Senator Hatch's staff; Jennifer Leach and Eric Shuffler of Senator Torricelli's staff; Jim Greene of Senator Biden's staff; Eddie Ayoob of Senator Reid's staff; and Kolan Davis and John McMickle of my own staff for their hard work on this bill.  I also thank Ed Haden and Sean Costello of Senator Sessions' staff.  Of course, this bill would not be here if not for Senator Reid working with us on the floor and Senators Hatch and Leahy helping steer this very difficult bill through the Senate as they helped get it out of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Of course, in this regard, I also thank the people who supported our legislation.  Most important, if anybody had asked me when we adjourned last year if we could have passed the bill this early this year, if at all, I would havebeen very pessimistic about it. But because of the cooperation we have had on the other side of the aisle, it was possible. Once again, in a very generic sense, I thank all who made this a bipartisan effort and made it possible to accomplish this goal.  I yield the floor.
