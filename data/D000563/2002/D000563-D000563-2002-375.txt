President, amendment No. 3072 to the energy bill to establish a Consumer Energy Commission. This amendment is simple, yet it has the potential to significantly benefit American families and businesses. It should garner widespread support.  Like many of my colleagues in the Senate, I am pleased that we have turned to debate on an energy bill to address our nation's energy challenges. This debate marks the first time Congress has comprehensively considered energy policy since 1992. As we consider the many facets of this important topic, we must remember what has happened with energy in our country during the past decade.  One word you will often hear to describe energy during the past decade, especially in the last few years, is ``crisis.'' The California electricity experience has been cast in terms of a crisis, and many have pointed to Enron as an indication of problems in our energy policy. While we may disagree with the extent of the energy crisis, as well as ways to address it, I think we can all agree that one energy challenge our nation faces is consumer price spikes.  Let us take the example of gasoline. We all know that prices have significantly fluctuated at the pump. The Administration's energy policy indeed cites ``dramatic increases in gasoline prices'' as one of the challenges we face. The Consumer Federation of America and Public Citizen have also called attention to energy price spikes, explaining that American consumers spent roughly $40 billion more on gasoline in 2000 than in 1999. In the spring of 2000, the cost of gasoline in Chicago shot up to $2.13 per gallon, well-above the unusually high national average of $1.67 per gallon at the time.  Yet gasoline is not the only energy product for which consumers have had to pay dramatically fluctuating costs in recent years. Residential heating oil, residential natural gas, commercial natural gas, industrial natural gas, and motor gasoline, have all had fluctuating prices over the past 15 years.  If we break down these numbers month-by-month, you can see incredible price spikes. In just a matter of one month, the national average price of gasoline jumped by 20 cents per gallon, residential heating oil rose by 10 cents per gallon, and residential natural gas leapt by 50 cents per thousand cubic feet.  In some areas of the country and sectors of the economy, price spikes were greater and had drastic impacts. Home heating and cooling bills crippled family budgets in the Midwest and Northeast. Farmers and industries dependent on natural gas for the production of fertilizer and other chemical products suffered economically.  To address the chronic national problem of significant energy price fluctuations, I am offering an amendment to the energy bill that would establish a Consumer Energy Commission. This 11-member Commission would bring together bi-partisanly appointed representatives from consumer groups, energy industries, and energy- and trade-related agencies, to study the causes of energy price spikes and make recommendations on how to avert them.  It is true that the Federal Trade Commission recently studied gasoline price spikes in the Midwest. Indeed, several studies have investigated potential abuses of market power in the energy industry. Other studies have looked at the long-range supply and demand projections for energy products. But previous studies have tended to focus on a small set of issues, and on the perspective of industry or government. I think the best approach is not to look at these issues narrowly, but rather to consider the big picture. Most importantly, we need to give consumers a voice.  When consumers go to pay their grocery bills, or their tuition bills, or even their residential electricity bills in most states, and when businesses go to pay for raw materials, prices are rather predictable. But when they go to pay for their heating and cooling, natural gas, or gasoline, families and businesses face the frustrating reality of wild price swings. We need to bring consumers to the table with representatives of the energy industry and government, in order to study price spikes. We need these groups to work collectively, and to consider a range of the possible causes of energy price spikes. We need them to look at both the supply and demand sides, including such potential causes as maintenance of inventory, delivery of supply, consumption behaviors, implementation of efficiency technologies, and export-import patterns.  After the Consumer Energy Commission has studied energy price spikes comprehensively, its charge will be to develop options for how to avert or mitigate price spikes. These recommendations can range from legislative and administrative actions to voluntary industry and consumer actions that can help protect consumers from the fluctuating costs of energy products.  This Commission will be well-balanced, not only to reflect all groups with a stake in energy price spikes, but also to reflect both political parties. No commission has ever before brought together such a diverse group to study such a complex problem in a holistic manner. No commission has ever promised to see things from the perception of consumers: families and businesses that routinely face energy price spikes. The Consumer Energy Commission is long overdue, and I urge my colleagues to support it.                           AMENDMENT NO. 3074
