President, 45 minutes ago exactly, history was made in America just across the street, not far from the steps of the Senate. If you go to those steps at this moment and look directly to the east, you will see the U.S. Supreme Court building. At 2 o'clock eastern time in that building the 111th Justice appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court received her official investiture. It was a moment of great historic significance because the elevation of Sonia Sotomayor to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court marks the first time in our history that a person of Hispanic descent will serve on the highest Court of our land. In the course of our history, with 111 Supreme Court Justices, if my memory serves, only four have not been White males--two African Americans, two women, and now Justice Sotomayor.  The ceremony was very short. The President of the United States was there, the Vice President, a number of Members of Congress, and of course the other eight Supreme Court Justices and the retiring Justice Souter. There was a very stately, dignified, gracious presence as the Court was convened. After Eric Holder, the Attorney General, read the commission which authorizes the investiture of Justice Sotomayor, the oath was administered to her by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, John Roberts. The entire ceremony took 4 minutes. One of the Senators standing next to me, Mel Martinez, who will retire from the Senate this week, said it would have taken longer if they had television cameras here. Those of us who serve in the Senate and served in the House know of what he speaks.  But the fact is, in that 4-minute period of time a page was turned in American history. We are offering an opportunity now for a person to serve on the Supreme Court--immensely qualified, a person with a great background in her life and her achievement to serve on the highest Court of the land.  Across America, in neighborhoods and towns and communities and schools, perhaps a child will look up and, when they learn of the appointment and ascension of Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, realize that the great promise of America continues, that this still is a land of opportunity, and that door to opportunity was opened a little wider just across the street at the U.S. Supreme Court about 45 minutes ago.                          ____________________
