Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Bob Krieble, a gentleman whose extraordinary humanitarianism and dedication to the development of democracy and capitalism in the Russian Republics is truly commendable. As founder of the Krieble Institute, Bob Krieble has committed his vast expertise and resources to teaching the people of the Russian Republics the fundamentals of success in a Democratic and Capitalist society. In fact, Bob Krieble has been responsible for training literally thousands of individuals in the basics of developing businesses and promoting economic growth. To this day, Bob Krieble travels extensively for this purpose, conducting seminars designed to educate the Russian leadership and share his knowledge of the principles of a capitalist economy. Indeed, Bob Krieble's knowledge and experiences were well received in his recent testimony before the Helsinki Oversight Committee.  As the 104th Congress commences, Members should take note of Bob Krieble's efforts as we strive to reestablish a bipartisan foreign policy designed to spread democracy and economic freedom throughout the Russian Republics. His work is truly representative of the commitment needed to ensure the successful transition to democracy and capitalism in the Russian Republics.  Mr. Speaker, a short time ago, remarks entitled ``The cold warriors'' were delivered by radio commentator Paul Harvey in recognition of the philanthropy of Bob Krieble. This piece was broadcast on over 2,000 radio stations, including the ABC radio network. I respectfully submit this commentary and request that it be entered into the Record.                           The Cold Warriors                    radio commentary of paul harvey       The Cold War did not end by default. It was fought and won      by the persistent efforts of some uncommon Americans.       The late Jerry Wiesner was a casualty of that war. His      shuttle diplomacy resulted in a stroke which should surely      earn him a Purple Heart.       The subsequent efforts of Bob Krieble merit a Silver Star.       Thirty-five years ago, with money borrowed from friends and      neighbors, he started the Loctite Corporation. With      inventiveness, diligence and long hours he built Loctite into      a Fortune 500 Corporation owning scores of patents in      silicones and anaerobic adhesives.       Krieble was seventy--what many consider retirement age--     when he undertook a more enormous challenge: to re-educate      the communist countries of the old USSR to social democracy      and economic capitalism.       His Krieble Institute has since trained more than 10,000      students from the former Soviet Empire in how to start a      business, how to distribute goods and services, how to run a      public office.       Bob Krieble is bankrolling this training and dispatch of      pragmatic missionaries mostly out of his own pocket.       His meetings with world leaders including the Russian      leadership continue at a frenetic pace. At 78 his missionary      zeal and energy are undiminished.       And he has recruited other retired executives for his      seminar trips, re-mobilizing the brain power that formerly      ran such corporations as Otis Elevator, Thibaut de St. Phalle      and the U.S. Export-Import Bank.       Krieble's ``trainers'' share their vast business and      political experience with struggling entrepreneurs and      democratic leaders in the now fragmented Russian Republics      ``freely.'' They even pay their own travel expenses.       In one after another of the world's backward nations      ``white missionaries'' are being excluded.       But Krieble's capitalist crusaders are welcomed everywhere.       While government agencies imagine that a transfusion of      dollars will resurrect democracies which never were . . .       Bob Krieble and his fellow ``ambassadors'' are sharing      their lifetimes of experience in the spawning and care and      feeding of competitive capitalism.       The ``way of life'' which has prospered us above all others      is being introduced to a generation that had been taught that      capitalism was their enemy.       Bob Krieble will tell you that his efforts are not entirely      altruistic. With the awesome weapons now available he does      not want his grandchildren to live in fear of incineration.       And so he goes . . .       Airliner to airliner carrying his luggage . . .       Shuttling around the world in a tedious pilgrimage . . .       Educating all who will listen get off the self-pity-pot and      get on their feet and reach for the stars.                               ____________________
