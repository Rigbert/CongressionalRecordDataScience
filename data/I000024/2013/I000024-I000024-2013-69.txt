President, let me start off, before the leader leaves the floor--and I was hoping to do this before the Chaplain of the Senate, Dr. Barry Black, left. I had a horrible loss eight days ago, losing a son. It was so touching to me--and I thank Barry Black, who included a good bit of some things about my son and about me in his opening prayer. Also, the comments that were made, the very gentle comments, and very helpful, that were made by the majority leader. So, through the Chair, I wish to thank Harry Reid very much for the comments he made.                          ____________________
