President, I will close and give the floor to Senator Stevens for whatever purpose brings him here.  We believe what happened on the floor of the Senate is significant. We said there must be a change of course in Iraq; we cannot continue. This failed policy brought us to this point. We owe it to our servicemen and their families and the American people to have a plan for success that will bring stability to Iraq on a timely basis, give them responsibility for their own future, and start to bring American troops home.  Our critics say we want to cut and run. No, we want to stop the loss of life by Americans in Iraq. We want to make sure the Iraqis know it is their responsibility for their future.  I certainly believe, as others do, that someone such as Ahmed Chalabi is one of the reasons we made fatal errors in the beginning of this invasion of Iraq. He should not be treated as a hero. I didn't vote for this war. In the fall of 2002 when we were debating use of force, I offered an amendment to defend the United States from an imminent attack by Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. That amendment got to the heart of the matter with the intelligence of weapons of mass destruction so cloudy. It would have raised the threshold for war. It failed.  Now we have to move forward making certain that we keep in mind first and foremost our commitment to our troops and our commitment to our mission. This is a historic vote today with the adoption of the Democratic amendment as changed by Senators Warner and Frist. I sincerely hope this vote will mean a change in policy to bring our troops home safely.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
