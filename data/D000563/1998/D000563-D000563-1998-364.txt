 My objection to your unanimous consent request is not based on the belief we should be doing less business but in the hope we will be able to do a little more--specifically, that the two judges who are pending on the Executive Calendar since November of last year from the State of Illinois, judges I referred to earlier as coming from districts with extraordinary problems because of these vacancies, I hope these judges can be considered, and considered very soon.  I have tried to say to all of my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, that I stand ready to work with you to move this calendar's agenda as quickly as possible. I hope they will empathize with the challenge that faces us in the Southern and Central Districts of Illinois and that we can call these judges for consideration as quickly as possible.  For that reason, for that reason alone, I do object.
