Chairman, I rise today in opposition to the Rahall amendment that would kill the effort to repeal the national speed limit.  I oppose this amendment on two fronts. First, reasons for the original speed limit are no longer valid. In 1973, because of the OPEC oil embargo, the Federal Government mandated that States lower speed limits to conserve oil. This original directive was in the interest of national security. The oil crisis has eased, automobiles are safer, and get far better mileage. In short, there is little reason to keep the mandate in place.  Second, and more importantly, the 55 m.p.h. speed limit is disregarded by an average of 7 out of 10 drivers. It is a law that breeds contempt of the law and the men and women who must enforce the unenforceable. Highway patrolmen are a limited resource. If more officers are required to enforce speed limits, fewer can be assigned to other safety activities, such as removing drunk drivers or stopping drug trafficking. Numerous studies have shown that raising the speed limit to 65 m.p.h. does not increase the overall speed on interstates.  The truth remains this--repeal is not a move by the Federal Government to raise speed limits, it simply gives States, which are in the best position to set speeds, the power to do so. Furthermore, interstates and Federal roads were built with taxpayers' money. This Congress should have gotten the message last November. The Federal Government doesn't have any money--it takes it from our citizens in the form of taxes.  I urge colleagues to oppose the Rahall amendment and support speed limit repeal.
