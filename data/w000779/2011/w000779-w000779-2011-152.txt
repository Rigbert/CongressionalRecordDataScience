President, in March, I was compelled to place a hold on the nomination of Jo Ann Rooney to be Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, when I was not satisfied that the military had properly investigated the mistreatment of some members of the Oregon National Guard who were demobilizing at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, JBLM.  I am pleased to say that today I am lifting that hold.  I have had meetings and exchanged letters with Secretary of the Army John McHugh, Army Vice Chief of Staff General Peter Chiarelli, Major General Philip Volpe, Jo Ann Rooney, and Dr. Clifford Stanley, who will be Dr. Rooney's supervisor if she is confirmed. I have also received several documents related to the investigations, and written answers to more than 60 questions about the investigations.  I am satisfied that the actions taken by the Army put them on the right path to ensuring that future National Guard soldiers receive all of the care and benefits to which they are entitled.  I will continue to closely monitor the implementation of the changes the Army is making. However, I believe that Dr. Rooney would, if confirmed, work to ensure that all servicemembers get appropriate medical care, and improve the demobilization process.  I would urge the Senate to quickly and positively act on Dr. Rooney's nomination.                          ____________________
