Speaker, because I understand what the gentleman is saying, I think it is important to note that every working person in America pays taxes. We call it FICA tax, and 50 percent of Americans pay more FICA tax than they do, but we are using, as the gentleman knows, part of their taxes because there is a surplus in the Social Security account for general expenditures. So in that sense, the overwhelming majority of employees are paying.
