Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. In response to the gentleman from Ohio, I am pleased that he accepted the point of order. We had this discussion last year. We have started the process of the hearings. We have had a report back from the GAO. We are looking into this issue. But I would like to stress one thing for those that may not be aware of this. Just disbursing moneys to all the tribes does not solve the health issue. One of the problems that I have had with the BIA, and especially this present administration, is that in my State they recognize 227 tribes. We do not have 227 tribes in my State. We have probably 11 tribes in my State. Those 11 tribes supply very good health services to all the members of those tribes because they have enough money to do the job correctly. And because of administrative costs, I would suggest all the smaller tribes would apply for money but yet not provide the health care.  I have no one in my State that is asking for this type of pro-rata formula be used in my State. They think it would destroy a very efficient, very high class health system. And so for that reason, we are going to look at this. But I hope we are not trying to give everybody a little piece of the apple when there is not enough apple left to make a pie. Really that is what we are attempting to do.  I want to thank the gentleman for his accepting the point of order, but this issue goes far beyond just supposedly being fair. This goes to the basics of good health care. We have the Yukon-Kuskokwim area which has one of the finest health care systems, it provides health care for basically 58 tribes. If we were to split that up in 58 small groups, we would have no health care for the recipients. So this is a health care issue which I feel very strongly on. We are going to work on it and try to get more money so that we can do it for everyone.                              {time}  1415  But just to spread it out does not solve the problem of good health care.
