 President, I rise in strong support of the amendment offered by my colleague from Vermont. The amendment restores funding for the Forestry Stewardship Incentives Program [SIP]. Landowners who sign up for the Forest Stewardship Program are often new to the practice of forest management, the cost-share components assists them in making land more productive more rapidly.  The SIP was designed to assist nonindustrial private landowners in implementing good management practices. Recent surveys indicate over 9 million private nonindustrial landowners; by contrast, the Nation has only over 2 million farmers. In Kentucky, we have over 300,000 private landowners who have over 10.9 million acres of forest land to manage.  This amendment preserves one of the only nonregulatory Federal programs in existence for nonindustrial private forest landowners.  The Kentucky Stewardship Incentive Program is a very successful program. It is a cooperative effort of Kentucky's environmental community. The cost share assistance helps private landowners in implementing a forest stewardship plan on rural land with existing tree cover and other lands including cropland, pasture land, surface mined land.  The Kentucky Stewardship Incentive Program:  Encourages private forest landowners to manage their forest lands for economic, environmental, and social benefits;  Complements and expands other forestry assistance programs;  Gives priority to tree planting, tree maintenance, and tree improvement practices;  Increases the quality and quantity of Kentucky's timber resources, and  Maintains and improves the habitat for a diverse mixture of native wildlife.  This is an extremely beneficial program that helps private forest landowners provide better land management and improve our natural resources.  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.
