Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding this time to me, and I rise in strong support of this legislation and suggest to my colleagues that this issue is not solely about 38 projects, as meritorious as those projects may be. It is about the proper balance between the Congress of the United States and the Executive.  I did not support the line-item veto. I supported the enhanced rescission alternative of the gentleman from Texas [Mr. Stenholm], which allowed the President to take out projects that the President thought were either fraud or wasteful or untimely or against the policy of the administration.  In this instance the administration acted far too broadly and far beyond those constraints. This legislation, therefore, in my opinion, seeks to address balancing the responsibilities of this Congress, which under article I of the Constitution of the United States is to set the policies for this Nation and the executive's authority to carry out, but also to ensure that those policies are perceived by the administration as not to be wasteful or against policy. In my opinion, this veto went so broadly as to substitute the judgment of the administration for that of the Legislature, and that is not appropriate under the Constitution of the United States.  Therefore, I urge my colleagues not just because these 38 projects themselves have merit, but more importantly so that the proper balance between the executive and legislative branches of Government is focused upon by both the administration and by the Congress, and I want to congratulate the gentleman from California [Mr. Packard] for his leadership and the gentleman from North Carolina [Mr. Hefner] for his leadership in bringing this matter before the Congress in a context which does not need to be critical of the administration, but simply to say as we try out this new procedure, and it is brand new, we need to make sure that we do so in a context that is judicious and proper.
