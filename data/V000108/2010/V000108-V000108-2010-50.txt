These distinguished recipients will be honored during the Chamber's annual awards and installation banquet, which will take place on Thursday, February 4, 2010, at River Pointe Country Club in Hobart, Indiana.  The Hobart Chamber of Commerce utilizes members of the community in order to improve and develop business, industry, and the professions. Each year, the Chamber members and friends gather together to honor outstanding businesses and volunteers, and to commemorate specific accomplishments within the community. This year, the Chamber will honor the memory of Nancy Norris and Shirley Campbell, two remarkable individuals whose impact on the Hobart community will leave a lasting impression.  Continuing a tradition that dates back more than fifty years, the Chamber will honor its 2009 Outstanding Businesses. The first of the 2009 Outstanding Business award recipients is Alligator Construction. Alligator Construction first opened its doors nine years ago. Owners Dave and Maryann Ferner credit the support of their community for allowing them to grow from a window and siding company to a total remodeling company. Throughout Hobart and beyond, Alligator Construction's quality craftsmanship and commitment to meeting the customers' demands can be seen in the many successful projects they have undertaken. Regional Federal Credit Union, founded in 1961, is also being recognized as an Outstanding Business for 2009. Regional Federal Credit Union continues to flourish as a company committed to community involvement and volunteerism, as well as the promotion of financial education in the school system. The company has seen success and growth throughout Northwest Indiana by providing the community with excellent service in meeting the needs of their customers. The final Outstanding Business for 2009 is Strack and Van Til. What began in 1959 as a partnership between Nick Van Til and Ernie Strack, two local grocery store owners, has emerged as an organization now boasting an astonishing thirty supermarket locations throughout Indiana and Illinois. Priding itself on quality products and quality service, Strack and Van Til has been a leader not only in the grocery business but in the Northwest Indiana community as well. Each of these fine businesses is truly worthy of this tremendous honor.  During this year's banquet, the Hobart Chamber of Commerce will honor Ms. Virginia Curtis with the Lifetime Achievement Award. Ms. Curtis, a longtime resident of Hobart, has been a member of the Chamber for more than thirty years and currently serves on its board of directors. Ms. Curtis is credited as the driving force behind the city's Independence Day festivities and was even selected in 2009 as the Grand Marshal for the parade. Well known for her work as a staff writer for several local newspapers, Ms. Curtis also owned a local restaurant and now serves as the president of the Hobart Community Improvement Committee. For her selfless commitment to her community, I congratulate Ms. Virginia Curtis on this prestigious award.  The Hobart Chamber of Commerce will also congratulate Saint Mary Medical Center for an astonishing 103 years of service to the Northwest Indiana community. The hospital continues to be a leader in the healthcare field and has maintained excellence in providing quality care to those in need. For its outstanding service, Saint Mary Medical Center has received countless awards, including the Distinguished Hospital for Patient Safety Award and the 2008 Hobart Chamber of Commerce Large Business of the Year award. For their many years of service and for the many lives its dedicated staff has improved, I commend the Saint Mary Medical Center.  Madam Speaker, at this time, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring the Hobart Chamber of Commerce 2009 award winners. For their dedication and commitment to the community of Hobart as well as Northwest Indiana, they are all worthy of the honors bestowed upon them.                          ____________________
