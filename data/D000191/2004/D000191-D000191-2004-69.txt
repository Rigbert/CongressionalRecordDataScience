Speaker, I thank the ranking member for the time.  Well, as the chairman said, he is almost always correct, and he was certainly correct with the number of $375 billion. It was confirmed by our own Federal Department of Transportation.  This is an essential investment. This is an investment. There are a lot of things we do around here where we are spending money. We do not see a real product, but in this case it is an investment in the future of our country. As the chairman said, it has to do with our economic competitiveness.  We are concerned about the economy and the need to put people back to work and competitiveness in our businesses. This is about just-in-time delivery. We cannot have just-in-time delivery when we have to divert a truck for 2 or 300 miles because of a failing weight-limited bridge, as exists all over the country; and a number of bridges are in that condition on Interstate 5 in my State.  It is about livability. It is about dealing with congestion, management, movement of people; and it is also about jobs, and that is a very important part of this debate that we cannot leave out.  The difference between the number being asked at the White House and the number put forward by the chairman, supported by, I believe, every other member of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, figures out to about 1 million jobs a year over 6 years. For every billion dollars we invest in the infrastructure of this country, transportation infrastructure, it yields about 47,000 jobs, direct construction jobs, small business suppliers, and spillover effects into our communities.  So the difference in the number, and I hope they are listening down at the White House, is 1 million jobs a year over 6 years. Now, why can we not get there? A lot of people do not seem to know about the Highway Trust Fund. We have a very robust Highway Trust Fund and a substantial balance. We can spend down some of that balance. We can capture the ethanol money that is being used to subsidize that product of dubious value. We could look at bonding. We could do all of this without increasing taxes. We could get to a much higher number, even a number higher than that in the United States Senate; but minimally, I would hope that that is where we can end up in these negotiations.  It has been 9 months, 9 months that we have been acting under temporary legislation that does not allow us to fully address the needs of this country and increase the investment in our infrastructure. Nine months is too long. Let us not let it go beyond this one more temporary extension. Let us get a robust bill this summer before Congress leaves for its August recess.  I thank the gentleman for yielding the time.
