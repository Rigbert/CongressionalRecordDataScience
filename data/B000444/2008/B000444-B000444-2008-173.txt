 President, the Federal Law Enforcement Congressional Badge of Bravery Act of 2007 establishes an award to honor exceptional acts of bravery in the line of duty by Federal law enforcement officers. This bipartisan bill is cosponsored by Senators Arlen Specter and John Sununu and it is supported by the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association along with other law enforcement groups.  An ``ABC Nightly News'' series last November reported that 2007 may turn out to be one of the deadliest years in history for law enforcement officers. That sour prediction has come to pass. The National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund--which commemorates the service and sacrifice of law enforcement officers and helps promote law enforcement safety--found that officer deaths were up sharply nationwide last year. There were 194 fatalities--34 percent more than the year before.  Unfortunately, with crime on the rise around the country the increase in fallen officers should be no surprise. The FBI's Uniform Crime Report for 2006--the gold standard of crime reports in our country--must be taken seriously. Murders were up 1.9 percent on top of the previous year's increases--these were the largest increases in 15 years. What's more, violent crime rose 1.9 percent.  Clearly, our Federal law enforcement officers are doing their jobs in an environment more fraught with danger than ever. Police departments around the country are scrambling in an arms race to match the firepower of the bad guys. In my view, we should give special recognition to those Federal law enforcement officers who are going above and beyond to protect us in this kind of environment.  With this bill Congress can continue its support of the brave men and women law enforcement officers who risk their lives every day making sure our communities are safe. I hope this bill will be accepted by the full Senate.                                 ______                                       By
