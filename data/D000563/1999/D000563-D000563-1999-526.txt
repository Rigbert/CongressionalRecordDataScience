President, in summary, I am proud to be a cosponsor of this bipartisan legislation. I am also proud to be a member of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Governmental Affairs Committee, which Senator Collins chairs. This has been one of the best assignments I have had in the Senate because Senator Collins is not afraid to tackle tough issues. We have gone after the issue of food safety with fascinating hearings which I believe will lead to improving America's food supply and really protecting America's families.  She has shown extraordinary courage in addressing this issue of Medicare fraud. Frankly, it took a very good investigative team and her determination to bring us to this moment where this legislation is being introduced.  Mr. President, 39 million Americans rely on Medicare. If you have a parent or grandparent who is elderly or disabled, they may view Medicare as their health insurance plan. Without it, think where America would be if elderly people and disabled folks had to rely on their own resources to pay for their medical care.  We pay a great deal of money each year in America to keep Medicare, this health insurance plan, solvent and working; about $218 billion a year. What Senator Collins is addressing is the fact that we know for a fact that each year we waste anywhere from $13 billion to $21 billion a year. You say: How does that happen? Is it a matter of the bureaucrats moving the paper around, and they get it wrong? No, for the most part, it comes down to people who are setting out to intentionally defraud the Government, and they are so good at it, we lose at least $35 million a day--a day--to these smoothies, these swindlers, these con artists who prey upon the Medicare system as an open pot of money they can reach into and grab.  When Senator Collins' investigators went out, they found that some of the people who claimed to be providing medical services and medical equipment do not even exist. The addresses they gave, when we traced them, turned out, if they were true addresses, would be smack dab in the middle of a runway at the Miami International Airport, and no one checked up on it. Year after year, we send out money automatically to these folks without verification.  The legislation I am introducing with Senator Collins will really put some teeth in the law and say we are not going to tolerate this anymore. Themoney that is being taken out of this program is at the expense of the elderly and disabled and certainly at the expense of America's taxpayers.  Can I give one illustration of this? Nursing homes provide care for elderly people who suffer from incontinency. It is something which happens to many older folks. Nursing homes are supposed to provide adult diapers for seniors who find themselves in this predicament. However, one of the groups that we discovered decided they would try to invent a way to bill the Federal Government for these 30-cent diapers that are needed for elderly people, so they changed the name of the diaper to ``female urinary collection device'' and billed the Federal Government $8 an item: a 30-cent diaper, billed them $8--clearly fraudulent, taking money right out of the Treasury, money that, frankly, should be there for the real needs of senior citizens.  The stories go on and on. With this bill, we try to step forward and say we are going to put an end to it or at least reduce it dramatically. We are going to create incentives for people who take the time, as many seniors should with the help of their families, to go through their medical bills. Really, that is the first line of defense. When a senior under Medicare receives a medical bill, I know it has to be a challenge--it is for me and I am an attorney--they should go through it page by page and look for things that do not make sense. When they discover these things and call into the hotline under Medicare, we can many times track down abuses and fraud and help not only that senior, but every senior and Americans in general.  I salute the Senator from Maine. Her leadership on this issue is absolutely essential.                                 ______                                       By
