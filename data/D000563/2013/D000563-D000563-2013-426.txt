By your presence, you send a message to every village, every city, and every nation. A message of hope. A message of victory.''  Today, I would like to recognize a father and daughter who are sending their own message of hope and victory Mark and Michele Panozzo from Rockford, IL.  Last week, Michele Panozzo was recognized as the 2013 Outstanding Athlete Award by the Special Olympics of Illinois. Earlier this year, Michele and Mark Panozzo were both recognized as the Northern Illinois Special Olympics Athlete and Coach of the Year.  This father-daughter duo started their involvement in the Special Olympics more than 25 years ago when Michele, who has Down syndrome, was 8 years old. Her first sport was basketball. Over the years she has competed in a variety of sports, including softball throw, bowling and bocce.  Her dad, Mark, has been by her side as her coach the whole time. And it is not just Michele who Mark helps. He is also the coach of the Rockford Red Hots, a team of 45 Special Olympics athletes from the Rockford region. Mark and Michele spend nearly every weekend with the Red Hots, whether at a competition, a practice, or at social outings with teammates and their families.  Special Olympics is more than sports and competitions to Mark and Michele. It is a community that has welcomed and befriended them. Mark says he treasures Special Olympics because of the smiles he sees on Michele's face after a competition, whether she won a gold medal or finished last. Mark still proudly shows off a photo of the first time Michele competed in the Special Olympics; she was just 8 years old, her hair was in pigtails and her face was lit with excitement  Mark has worked for the U.S. Postal Service for more than 30 years. Years ago he switched his schedule to work nights so he could pick up Michele from school every day. Michele volunteers 3 days a week delivering meals to home-bound seniors, helping at the food pantry and sorting clothes at the local donation center.  In July of 1968, the first Special Olympics Summer Games were held at Soldier Field in Chicago. Only one thousand athletes competed. Today, it is a growing, global movement in more than 170 countries, serving nearly 3.5 million athletes with intellectual disabilities. In Illinois, Special Olympics is making a difference in the lives of 21,000 athletes and nearly 40,000 volunteers and by organizing 170 competitions each year.  I join the Special Olympics of Illinois in commending Michele and Mark Panozzo for their dedication to Special Olympics. I am sure that Eunice Kennedy Shriver would be proud of what Michele and Mark have contributed to the Special Olympics community, and I am too.                          ____________________
