 President, I thank the Senator from New York. He serves as the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts of the Judiciary Committee, and he more or less heads all of the hearings with respect to these judges. He has done an excellent job. He is thorough. As everybody knows, he is a smart and intelligent man. He has made a very eloquent statement. So I thank him.  Last week I came to the floor and discussed the nuclear option. I recognize today that we are now faced with going down this path. I am concerned that once begun, it is going to be hard, if not impossible, to reverse it.  I find it ironic in his statement the majority leader said:       All Members are encouraged to ensure that rhetoric in this      debate follows the rules and best traditions of the Senate.  That is exactly what this side of the aisle is fighting for--the rules and the traditions of the Senate. We are standing up to those in the other party who want to break the rules and precedent of the Senate. So in reality, it is those of us on this side of the aisle who are asking the majority leader to follow all the rules and precedents of the Senate, not just the one he supports or any other group of Members might support.  Some have argued this debate is too inside baseball or, more appropriately perhaps, too inside the beltway and that Americans don't care about it. However, I believe that is wrong. To date, I have received about 16,000 phone calls, and they are running three to one in favor of opposing the nuclear option.
