 Second, I ask my friend and colleague from Ohio if he is aware the Executive Office of the President released a Statement of Administration Policy on September 24. In reference to this particular program it said as follows:       The administration is pleased the committee bill puts $13      million for the President's School Choice Incentive Fund      Initiative. . . .  It doesn't refer to Mayor Williams' School Choice Incentive Fund Initiative.  Mr. DeWINE. In respond to my colleague, we all like to take credit for many things. I am sure the President is taking credit for this. I am sure I will probably take credit for it, too, if it passes. There will be many fathers and mothers of this program.  All I know is what the Mayor will tell us. The Mayor will say this is a program he put together.  What I would emphasize to my colleague is that this is a program that the Mayor says is a balanced program.  I will quote from a letter the Mayor has sent to me. I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                Washington, DC, September 11, 2003     Hon. Mike DeWine,     Chairman, Senate Committee on Appropriations, Subcommittee on          the District of Columbia, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman DeWine: Thank you for your leadership on the      District of Columbia's FY 2004 Appropriations bill. By any      measure, it is a great bill for the city. In particular, I am      grateful for your support for the District of Columbia School      Improvement Initiative, which will help us advance the      important school reform efforts underway. Certainly, the      private school scholarship element has generated significant      debate, and I hope that I have made the case to your      colleagues that its passage is consonant with home rule and      will strengthen our public education system.       I, along with the Chair of the District Council's Education      Committee, Kevin Chavous, and the School Board President,      Peggy Cooper Cafritz, believe that we must continue to do      everything possible to strengthen our nation's public      schools. This is why, in addition to a private school      scholarship program, we have insisted on strong federal      financial support for both the District of Columbia Public      Schools (DCPS) and the public charter schools.       Since becoming Mayor, I have overseen an increase in the      public education budget by more than 50 percent. This      demonstrates my commitment to public schools as tremendously      important institutions in our city. This increase has allowed      our charter school movement to expand to 40 schools and has      permitted us to launch the Transformation Schools Initiative      in 15 DC public schools,     which we hope will revitalize our lowest-performing schools.      After consulting with education officials, however, I have      concluded that these aggressive reforms, while promising,      will take years to reach most of our children. So, as these      foundations expand and improve, I think it is prudent to look      to the assets provided by our private schools, at least for a      limited period of time.       The proposed scholarship initiative will not drain      resources from our public school system. I have agreed to      hold the public schools harmless from any loss of local      funding arising from students' enrollments in private schools      through the federally funded scholarship program. Moreover,      because Title I funding is based largely on census data, we      do not anticipate that DC will lose significant federal      funding as a result of this program. Thus, under the      scholarship initiative, our public schools will receive the      same amount of funds as they otherwise would have, in order      to educate fewer students.       Since our city began to debate the issue of expanded school      choice, there has been speculation that this initiative will      have an impact far beyond the borders of Washington, DC. Some      say that what we do in the District will affect national      education policy and the likelihood of pilot programs in      other cities. For me, however, the issue of vouchers is more      localized.       This initiative was designed by District leadership for      District residents and is not being imposed on the District      from outside, as some would have you believe. As mayor, I am      trying to make the best choices for the residents of this      city, and without a state government to which, under normal      circumstances, I would make this request. In this regard, I      believe it is appropriate for the federal government to act      on behalf of the nation's capital when the local mayor and      school board president seek assistance.       You have been a strong supporter of the District of      Columbia and of our aspirations for self-government. Our city      continues to improve in many ways. I hope we can count on      affirmative action from the Senate in support of the School      Choice Improvement Initiative and the entire FY 2004 District      of Columbia Appropriations bill.       Again, I thank you for the extraordinary leadership and      commitment you have shown toward the District. I look forward      to continuing to work closely with you in taking the      necessary actions to support the District of Columbia.           Sincerely,                                              Anthony A. Williams,                                                            Mayor.  Mr. DeWINE. This is a letter dated September 11, 2003, to me as chairman of the Subcommittee on the District of Columbia, a two-page letter from Mayor Williams to me.  I would like to quote a part of this letter to my colleagues. This is the third paragraph:       Since becoming Mayor, I have overseen an increase in the      public education budget by more than 50 percent. This      demonstrates my commitment to public schools as tremendously      important institutions in our city. This increase has allowed      our charter school movement to expand to 40 schools and has      permitted us to launch the Transformation Schools Initiative      in 15 DC public schools, which we hope will revitalize our      lowest-performing schools. After consulting with education      officials, however, I have concluded that these aggressive      reforms, while promising, will take years to reach most of      our children. So, as these foundations expand and improve, I      think it is prudent to look to the assets provided by our      private schools, at least for a limited period of time.       What the Mayor clearly is saying is that as we improve our      public schools, as we have the charter schools, we need      another alternative for some of our students.  Let me quote again, if I could, from the letter:       The proposed scholarship initiative will not drain      resources from our public school system. I have agreed to      hold the public schools harmless from any loss of local      funding arising from students' enrollments in private schools      through the federally funded scholarship program. Moreover,      because Title I funding is based largely on census data, we      do not anticipate that DC will lose significant federal      funding as a result of this program. Thus, under the      scholarship initiative, our public schools will receive the      same amount of funds as they otherwise would have, in order      to educate fewer students.  Let me quote another part of the letter:       This initiative was designed by District leadership for      District residents and is not being imposed on the District      from outside, as some would have you believe. As mayor, I am      trying to make the best choices for the residents of this      city. . . . In this regard, I believe it is appropriate for      the federal government to act on behalf of the nation's      capital when the local mayor and school board president seek      assistance.  At this point, before I yield to my colleague, I ask for the yeas and nays.
