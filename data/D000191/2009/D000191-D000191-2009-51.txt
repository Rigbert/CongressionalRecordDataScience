  Mr. DeFAZIO. The premise of taxpayer support for the auto companies was twofold--preserve our productive capacity and maximize job retention.  Well, the plan has kind of gone off track here. The resolution of Chrysler, losing tens of thousands of jobs through the unnecessary closure of dealerships, and now Chrysler is going to close their most productive, modern engine plant in the world and build one in Mexico? How is that in the taxpayers' interest?  The leadership of the financier from Wall Street, Mr. Rattner, needs to be brought under control here. GM's now on deck. The Obama administration has to reconsider their approach. Don't endorse the closure of thousands of dealerships. Don't support the export of our productive capacity.  It is rumored that GM wants to manufacture their cars in China. Preserving a corporate shell while losing productive manufacturing capacity and tens of thousands of jobs is not in the taxpayer interest and should not receive the endorsement of the Obama administration nor this Congress.                          ____________________
