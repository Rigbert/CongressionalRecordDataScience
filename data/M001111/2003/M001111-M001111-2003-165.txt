  There is no other piece of legislation that is before us where this is relevant. In fact, I have offered this six times on the Department of Defense authorization bill, even postcloture, and it was considered relevant.  I am shocked and amazed that women are being told today they are not relevant. I am furious that women are being told they are not relevant when it comes to the Department of Defense, when it comes to their health care, and when it comes to the Senate.
