 Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time.  Unfortunately, I rise in opposition to this legislation. While this bill does include important consumer protection provisions, such as the provision that I and other members of the committee fought for, which would provide free annual credit reports to consumers who request them, and would also allow consumers to receive more information about their credit scores identical to a very good law in the State of California, there are major flaws in this legislation.  For a start, even in terms of that pro-consumer provision, we are not quite sure when that will go into effect, and I fear it will not go into effect as soon as it should.  Secondly, I think the major concern that I and consumer organizations all across this country have is that this legislation would permanently preempt the States from passing stronger consumer protection laws in order to aggressively punish identity thieves and to improve the accuracy of consumers' credit reports.  I may be the conservative on the committee, but it has long been my belief when we are dealing with an issue of protecting consumer rights, we cannot take away the ability of the States to pass stronger consumer protection laws. I find it very ironic from day one of this discussion that conservatives who have told us over and over again how much they dislike the big bad Federal Government stepping on States' rights, in fact have brought that provision into this legislation.  So if the State of Vermont or the State of California or the State of Ohio wants to go further in this area, well, my goodness, that big bad Federal Government, which we have heard so much about, is able to say sorry, you cannot do it. Attorneys general, governors, State legislators, you cannot do that, and I think that is wrong.  During the course of the debate on the committee, there was a very interesting discussion over an amendment that I and the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Bachus) brought forth which deals with the issue of what I call credit card switch and bait, and I will be bringing forth an amendment to win support of it. It is not included in this bill, and it should be.  Mr. Chairman, what is going on in this country is that people who pay off their credit card debts on time every single month nonetheless are seeing huge increases in the interest rates that they are paying. How does that happen? It happens because maybe 3 years ago they took out a loan which is still outstanding, or maybe they had an emergency medical bill and they had to borrow money, and arbitrarily the credit card company has determined they are a greater financial risk and their rates can double or triple. I think that is wrong.  This bill has some positive provisions, but we can do much better, and I would urge a ``no'' vote on it.                              {time}  1545
