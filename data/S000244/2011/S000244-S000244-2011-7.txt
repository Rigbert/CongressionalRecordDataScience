Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.  The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 1 o'clock and 37 minutes p.m.), consistent with the fourth clause in section 5 of article I of the Constitution, and notwithstanding section 132 of the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946, the House adjourned until tomorrow, Monday, August 1, 2011, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                          ____________________
