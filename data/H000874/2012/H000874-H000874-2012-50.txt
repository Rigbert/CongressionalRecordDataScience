Nadler has a resolution. I'm not sure if Mr. Grimm and Mr. King are on the resolution, but I presume they're on the resolution as well. It's a bipartisan resolution expressing condolences to those who were devastated not only in terms of property but some, of course, lost family members and life, whether or not that resolution might be brought to the floor so that this House can express its regrets and condolences and sympathy with those who were so devastated.
