Speaker, I rise today to thank the distinguished minority leaders of both the House and the other body for settling what to me has long been a confusing issue.  In spite of all the legislation the Republican Congress has passed so far, the Social Security lockbox, tax relief, and debt reduction, the Ed-Flex bill, and the military readiness bill, to name just a few, we have listened for months to Democrats bluster about the do-nothing Congress.  When I picked up my copy of The Hill yesterday, I finally began to understand what they mean by a do-nothing Congress. They mean themselves. On the front page, the distinguished minority leader of the other body proclaimed his disappointment that the first session of the 106th Congress was not more productive, while only a few lines of newsprint away the distinguished minority leader of the House claimed that the Democrats have dominated the Congressional agenda since 1994.  So, Mr. Speaker, if the Democrats are in control and nothing is being done, then I ask the Members, who is to blame?                          ____________________
