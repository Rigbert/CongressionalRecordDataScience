So as we have lost these jobs and lost these businesses, and our economy is sinking--a jobless recovery is no recovery where I live--we see other countries who now take over our manufacturing jobs, like China, and because they are selling more to the United States, they have dollars and turn around and own our debt.  So our workers do not have the jobs, their children have the debt, and China is holding the mortgage. Is that the fact?
