Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.  I want to say just to clarify as this debate proceeds, our side believes, based upon what we have been able to count, we categorically deny that there is substantial proof that there is anywhere near the number of 600, 500, 400, 300, 200 confirmed noncitizen voters in this election.  Now, the majority has not shown us their analysis yet, so we cannot analyze their figures. But ours show that their figures are wildly inflated.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton).
