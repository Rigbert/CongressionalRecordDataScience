President, I join in saluting my colleague, friend, and roommate--we share a house on Capitol Hill--Senator Schumer. I am sure he speaks for Senator Gillibrand, as well, in expressing sympathy for the loss that occurred outside the city of Buffalo last night, with the crash of this Continental Airlines flight.  My sympathy goes out to all the families and friends and my admiration to all the first responders. This is a time when communities gather together, become a family, work hard to try to appease the loss but to make certain we are doing everything in our power to lessen the pain these families will feel.                          ____________________
