 President, I rise to discuss the situation in Louisiana, particularly New Orleans, as it relates to the Katrina hurricane. I do that because of a very devoted constituent by the name of Craig Van Waardhuizen of 3716 Pearl Lane, Waterloo, IA. We are members of Prairie Lakes Church, Cedar Falls, IA, a Baptist church. He approached me because he had bad experiences in trying to help people in Louisiana at the height of the hurricane and the period of time thereafter.  He says things just were not right. That is quite obvious to all of the country. I had a chance to hear it from a person who witnessed it. He kept a diary of his experiences. He is a sincere enough individual to spend time with me, sincere enough individual to put things down in writing, and he is a sincere enough person who would like to have things that happened to him not happen again in a future natural disaster.  So I promised my friend in Waterloo that I would make sure the entire Senate knew of his situation. It will be on record for people to refer to so corrective action can be taken.  I suppose most of this falls in the area of FEMA's responsibility, but I am not so sure but what some of it doesn't fall into the area of local responders and to State people as well. But FEMA is the one most referred to. So I am going to spend my time reading word for word from this diary so that people will know the trials and tribulations of one bus driver, trying to help people all the way from Iowa, going to Louisiana to help people there who had problems.  This starts on September 1, which is the Thursday after Katrina hit. I believe Katrina hit either on that Saturday or Sunday, the 27th or 28th of August. Presumably some time after Katrina hit, my constituent friend was desiring to help the people in need there. He was affiliated with a bus company that could provide transportation. This starts on September 1, but presumably on the days of Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday before September 1, he was trying to get involved in helping:       September 1, 2005, Thursday: Another day of searching on      the internet and contacting our motorcoach associations has      brought no success as we (Northwest Iowa Transportation,      Inc.) look for ways to help in New Orleans. We have coaches      and drivers available to go help in moving people out of the      New Orleans area. However, we do not believe that we should      just drive down to New Orleans without any contact. It is      discouraging when you want to help and yet can't find the      avenue to help.       September 2, Friday: There is a light in the tunnel. Today      we were contacted by Utah Transportation Management to see if      we had any coaches and drivers that could go help in      evacuation of New Orleans. Finally a way to head to New      Orleans and provide the assistance that we have wanted to do      since a hurricane hit last Monday. Since this help will fall      under FEMA we will be able to use four drivers and two      motorcoaches to drive straight through to New Orleans. After      finding three other drivers who were willing to help in this      effort I head out to New Orleans. We pack extra supplies in      the coaches along with water and food for ourselves. We also      take along extra paper towels and toilet paper. About 9:00      p.m. we head south from Waterloo--  That is Waterloo, IA--     ready to go provide assistance to those in need.       Saturday, September 3: Driving straight through the night      and switching off with driving we arrive at the staging area      at Le Place, LA. The first thing we notice is the large      number of motorcoaches waiting in the staging area and many      more like ourselves, just pulling in. Our first order of      business was to get in line to refill with fuel. We didn't      stop for fuel on our way as we had been told that FEMA would      provide fuel for all motorcoaches when we arrived at Le      Place. We are ready to go to work and start moving people.      The fuel was brought in by the National Guard and they did      all the refueling in Le Place. Finally, it was our turn to      get fuel. While fueling, we visited with the other drivers to      find out what had been happening. We learned that after      fueling you would get in another line and wait for orders.      Nobody seemed to know who was in charge of the operation and      there was very little communication. Finally a man with an      orange vest came and asked us to get in line to go transport      people. We lined up with 12 other coaches. Nobody moved until      the state patrol was ready to provide escort. At last we have      action. We are headed into New Orleans to do what we came      down to do, move people. We had traveled about 10 miles when      we were pulled onto the shoulder. No reason given for pulling      all of us over. We sat and waited on the side of the highway      wondering what was going to happen.       After a waiting about 45 minutes we started traveling      again, and it was soon apparent     that we were headed back to the staging area. This whole      operation seems to lack leadership and direction. We arrived      back at the staging area at Le Place. Then we were sent down      I-10 to the scale house and were staged with about 40 other      coaches. Even the State patrol assigned to us didn't know      what was going on. About 10 pm a deputy sheriff patrol showed      up with some food for us. They didn't have any news or      information. About 11 pm the State patrol said to stay with      the motorcoach as we might be called upon at any time. As      drivers we decided to get as much rest as we could while we      had the opportunity.  So then presumably they slept the evening. That is a presumption on my part because it goes on now to Sunday, September 4. This is the fourth day of this tribulation.       Last night was a long night with little sleep as it is hard      to sleep on the coach. About 4 am a group of school buses      arrived from Houston, TX. They had been told to report to      this staging area and wait. The morning passed by very slow      and we never saw or heard from anybody that knew what was      actually happening. This is really amazing as we are all here      to work and provide help and we are just sitting along the      interstate. At the scale house on the other side of the      interstate a unit of federal border patrol agents is also      waiting for instructions. They have been waiting since      Tuesday for orders.  So that means that they had been waiting for 5 days, the Federal border patrol was waiting--that's my assumption--waiting for orders. My writer says:       I asked the state patrol to radio to the main staging area      where we fueled to see what was going on. The patrol had as      many questions as we did. It sure seems like mass confusion      and no clear leader. I really wonder who is in charge of this      operation. About noon a guy shows up in an orange vest and      tells us that we are moving to a new staging area at Lake      Charles, LA. Soon the rumor is going around through the      drivers that we will be moving people out of temporary      shelters to better places. We move to Lake Charles with high      hopes that we will finally be moving people. At the edge of      Lake Charles we are pulled onto the shoulder of the      interstate. With over 60 motorcoaches sitting on the shoulder      of a major interstate (I-10), this is an accident waiting to      happen. The school buses from Houston are headed back to      Houston as they were told there was no work for them. What a      waste of resources to have them drive all the way from      Houston to New Orleans only to turn around and head back. A      highway patrol escort arrives and leads us to a large parking      area at the Lake Charles airport. We are all parked in a row      with no other instructions. When the last coach is parked a      man who tells us he is the dispatcher for this operation      arrives and tells us that we are going to regroup.       This man has made arrangements for us to have a hot meal      supplied by the Lake Charles Firefighters in the armory at      the airport. During this meal he informs us that rooms in a      motel have been reserved for us for the night. As we sign up      for our rooms we are told to report back tomorrow at 1:30 pm      for more instructions. Since the rooms are in Beaumont, TX he      arranges to have five motorcoaches to take us as a group. At      least we will have a good bed to sleep in tonight and we will      be able to take a shower.  Now, Monday September 5.       Continued conversation with other drivers reveals only      rumors and no facts. About noon we head back to Lake Charles      to report in at this temporary dispatch office at the      airport. When we report in, we are told there will be no      movement until tomorrow. This is disappointing and hard to      understand, especially as we listen to the radio and hear      about this huge need to get people moved. Seems to me that      there has to be a better way to organize and run this system.      Who is in charge and who gives the orders to all of us      (drivers)? There is very limited and very poor communication.      If I ran operations like this, the company would lose all of      its business and drivers. Calling back to the office--  I think he means his own office--     and to any other contact I can come up with doesn't provide      any help. About 2 pm the dispatcher comes around looking for      two coaches that have two drivers. We are just what he is      looking for and we offer to be of service. He tells us to      head to Fort Smith, AR as soon as we can hit the road and to      report in at Fort Smith. We head right out and make the trip      to Fort Smith. As we are going down the road we find out that      a mistake has been made. Instead of Fort Smith at Fort Smith,      AR, it is Fort Chaffee. The drive to Fort Smith is a long      one, about 500 miles. Upon arrival we are to report to Fort      Chaffee for instructions. As we are travelling we begin to      notice many other motorcoaches headed the same direction.  September 6, Tuesday.       We arrive . . . and find the directions we were given in      Lake Charles to be wrong. Finally, we arrive at Fort Chaffee      and enter the base. The guards at the gate are very      surprised to see us and they wonder why we are reporting      at 2 a.m. The guards give us direction to the area where      the people are housed. We get to that area only to find      out nobody knows why they sent us to this base. Once again      I get on the phone calling the numbers I was given. These      calls just get voice mail and nobody ever returns the      calls. One of the guards gives me the phone number of the      base commander. I give him a call (at 2 a.m.) and have a      nice conversation with him. I can see that he has no      information to help us out. He suggests getting a motel      room and coming back in the morning. There are no motel      rooms available and it is now 4 a.m. We decide to head      back into Fort Smith to top off the fuel tanks and get a      hot breakfast. Looks like we are in a race headed nowhere.      At 8 a.m. we report back to the base. We are wondering why      we were sent over 500 miles to just sit and wait. The      guards at the base are telling us that the people are      being moved out to other places to live. Many of the other      coaches from Lake Charles are showing up this morning.      About 10 a.m. there is movement and they begin to load      coaches to move people on. Some guy comes along and tells      us to hang in there and we will soon be working. At noon      we are moved into position to load people. However, we      received no instructions or information as to where we      will be going. Even the people we are loading don't know      where they are headed. What a way to treat people who have      lost everything they have. Soon we are loaded and waiting      to go someplace. A representative of the state of AR comes      aboard and wishes the people a good future. At the same      time we are told we will be escorted by the state police      to Siloam Springs, AR. We are part of a 12 coach move with      a highway patrol escort for every three coaches. The drive      is supposed to take about 90 minutes. The actual drive      took us over three hours as the escort never went faster      than 40 mph. All of the people are very thankful for the      help in moving them and they are very pleasant considering      what they have all been through.       Finally we arrive at Siloam Springs at a church camp. It      seems like the whole community is here to welcome the people      and help them make a home. It is very heart touching to see      all the generous help. We unload and clean our two coaches.      Feeling tired and hungry we head back towards Fort Smith.      After what happened last night we see no need to arrive at      Fort Chaffee in the middle of the night. We find rooms in      Fayetteville and shut down for the night. The whole trip is      nothing like we had hoped or thought it would be. Maybe we      will feel better in the morning.  Morning is September 7, Wednesday. So this would be the seventh--it is my judgment this is the seventh day that my constituents were going through this trial and tribulation.       Our week of service is almost over and we sure haven't      [done] much of any good. We have spent more time driving      around empty as they have moved us all over. This morning we      went back to Fort Chaffee and waited for new orders. Many      other drivers were also waiting to see what we were to do.      About noon we get the word that we were to report back to      Lake Charles for the next duty. Here we go again on a 500      mile drive with no passengers. Does anybody really know what      is going on? As we drive to Lake Charles, we know it will be      about 9 p.m. when we arrive. Hopefully somebody will be      around to fill us in. No such luck. When we arrive at Lake      Charles the parking lot is filled with hundreds of      motorcoaches. There are hundreds of coaches and drivers. Many      drivers are very upset as they just sit idle. At Lake Charles      we are told to report back in the morning and we are also      told good luck on finding any lodging. Looks like another      night of sleeping in the coach. I make some phone calls and      find out there are some rooms at the casino. I call them and      ask about rooms and explain what we have been doing. The      manager gives us a deal on three rooms for the four of us. At      least we will have a bed to sleep in and be able to take a      shower in the morning.       September 8.  This will be Thursday.       This is the last day that we can help as we need to return      to Iowa tonight. The coaches need to be back to go on charter      trips. We will report to the temporary dispatch office early.      With hundreds of coaches just parked it doesn't look good.      The dispatcher said there is no work today and the next      opportunity might be tomorrow. I ask if there is anybody that      needs to move north as we could take people north as we head      home. Nothing available today and with all the idle coaches      it looks bad for tomorrow. I sign us out and we start back      home. I am glad that we came down and tried to help. There is      a huge sense of disappointment in the fact that we drove      about 3,000 total miles and only hauled 47 people 103 miles.      It seems like a huge waste of valuable resources and money.      Especially as I look over a parking lot filled with hundreds      of motorcoaches.       Somebody made the order to get all these coaches here and      now they sit idle. It easy to see why people get frustrated      with the system. Along with these coaches sitting idle, many      school buses were moved to the area and never used. They were      sent back home as they weren't needed. Today we learned that      in the city of New Orleans all of the school buses were left      to get caught in the flood. Why weren't they used before the      hurricane and flood to get people moved out of harm's way in      New Orleans. There are a large number of public officials at      all levels and the news media pointing fingers trying to put      the blame on FEMA when they should look at themselves. Why      did the school buses get left and not used? Why didn't people      heed the notice to get out and move to a safer area?       I think the whole process needs to be looked at and      evaluated for making improvements. We were not the only ones      to wonder what was going on. Almost all the drivers were      asking who is in charge and where are the lines of      communication. Of all the people who gave us orders, none      of them seemed to understand operations and dispatch. From      my viewpoint, it appears to me that many of those who were      supposed to manage the coaches didn't have any idea of      what to do and just how much help they needed.     September 9.       After driving through the night we arrived back in Iowa. We      are tired and ready to be back in our own homes. The hardship      we went through was very minor compared to what all the      displaced families were going through. As a team, we all      agreed that we would go again and we would do whatever we      could to provide assistance to people in need. Hopefully, if      there is a next time, there will be better organization and      all involved parties will work together.       About 10 a.m. I received a call from the dispatcher in Lake      Charles saying he had a trip for us. He was looking for us      and wondered where we were. This is a good example of poor      management as this was the same person I had signed out with      yesterday morning in Lake Charles. What a joke and what a      lack of management. I just hope that all of the drivers and      coach companies didn't get mad at the system. If they did get      upset with the whole system, there might not be enough help      the next time.       I would go and help again. It seems like the call to come      and help was about two days late. Then when the call went      out, too many resources were brought into play and then there      was overkill. I do hope to be able to sit down and talk with      somebody who evaluates this operation.  Let me say parenthetically that he is going to continue to talk to other people, but he asked me to be part of this communication, to lay out, as he saw it, the problems, in hopes that action will be taken here and at the local responder level and the State level to make sure these things don't happen again.  I am going to say that sentence again that I just was distracted from.  I do hope to be able to sit down and talk with somebody who evaluates this operation.     Someway, somehow, there has to be a method to get operation      managers in the right place to guide a mass movement of      people as fast as possible. Maybe when this is all over      people will have time to look back and make new plans.       The saddest part of this whole experience was the      difference of the news media coverage to the real situation.      The devastation was huge. The generous helping spirit of the      American people was huge. A large number of resources      available and there were people willing to provide      assistance. Yet, many of these resources were poorly used as      the lines of command and communication were poor. We went      down to New Orleans to work hard and help. That goal of      providing help was not accomplished in my eyes. Yes, we moved      about 94 people on our two coaches. However, we only moved      those people 100 miles and we spent the rest of our time      driving empty as we were moved from place to place. There      needs to be a better system of command and coordination.       I am very thankful for this opportunity to go and help, no      matter how small the help seemed to be. The people we moved      were very thankful and they greatly appreciated the efforts      of many. My heart hurts for those people who have lost      everything but their lives. I also know that we had the right      kind of intentions as we went to help.  I now turn to September 20. I just have 3 more days--no, 6 more days. Anyway, they went back to Iowa and then they were called upon again for an opportunity because of Hurricane Katrina. So September 20:       Once again the call has come for help in the gulf area of      LA and TX as hurricane Rita moves into the area. We have the      opportunity to provide service again to those in need. The      people who have called us, have assured us that there are      better plans and communications in place this time. They have      told us that lessons were learned from Katrina. This evening      we are headed out with two coaches and four drivers. This      combination allows us to get to the area in a straight      through drive and be ready to work. Our orders call for us to      report to a rest stop on 1-49 north of Lafayette, LA. This      will be our staging area. Before we leave, we put extra      supplies on board, take some food and pack some bedding. We      learned from the last time of helping that we might have to      spend nights sleeping on the coach. We depart with high hopes      and a thankful heart for this opportunity to provide help.      The people who called for this help are aware that we can      help until Sunday evening. The drivers and coaches need to be      back in Iowa for other charter work next Monday.     September 21.       The drive down was interesting and we saw a lot of others      headed south with the same purpose in mind. We did encounter      a slight problem in southern MS. There is a bug that is      called the ``love bug'' which is bad at this time of the      year. We had to make a couple of extra stops to clean the      windshields off. These bugs are nasty. Despite the delay we      arrived at the staging area about 4:00 pm. The staging area      was a rest stop on 1-49 which was closed down for public use.      First order of business was to report in and fuel. After      fueling, we reported in for duty. The first thing we were      told was to get in line and wait for orders. This is sure      looking like the Katrina help situation. The old hurry up and      wait plan. Fortunately, we had stopped for a good hot meal in      Lafayette and were good to go. As the night moved along it      appeared that we were going to sit and do nothing.     September 22.       A short night of limited sleep in the seat of the coach. It      is difficult to sleep on a coach. Good thing we brought food      with us. We were able to save some snack bars for breakfast.      About 7:00 am the dispatcher came looking for two coaches. We      took the call and headed into Lafayette to help evacuate      people from a hospital. At 9:00 am we were loaded with about      18 passengers on each coach. We waited on our orders and we      waited and waited. About 1:00 pm a doctor connected with      Homeland Security gave us the go ahead. We were part of an      escorted convoy moving these people from Lafayette to Monroe,      LA. A four hour drive under good conditions. Our passengers      had been on the coach since 9:00 am and they were not given      any food. A very long day for everybody with no food. All of      these people had been moved out of New Orleans before Katrina      and now they had to move again. This time they moved from a      hospital to a gym on the campus of LA Tech in Monroe. Sure am      glad we have an escort as the road is jammed with people      moving north. There are no gripes on our part as we are doing      the work we came down to do. After unloading the people and      helping them get moved into the gym, we took the opportunity      to shower in the locker room. That was a refreshing moment.      Then the drive back to the staging area. As we watched all      the traffic moving north, we assumed we would be assigned a      task as soon as we got back. That turned into a bad      assumption. Upon our return to the staging area, we refueled      and parked in line. Here we go again, another long night on      the coach. Sleep. didn't come easy and I went for a walk. As      I was walking I noticed some empty parking places near the      front of the line. I went back to the coaches and moved us up      in the line with the thought that we might get an assignment      quicker. We didn't come back down to park in a line and wait.       September 23, 2005.       Hurricane Rita is moving closer to shore. Why are we not      moving people? The word among the drivers is that there was a      coach accident in TX and things are on hold. This brings up      the subject of safety. The majority of the coaches in use are      top of the line, with excellent drivers and a great safety      record. However, there are some coaches operating with lights      out, broken air brakes and other safety related issues. These      coaches should be pulled to the side and put out of service      until they are repaired. There are more than enough coaches      here that are in excellent condition to be used. Poor      condition coaches. should not be used. We are in a stressful      situation, moving people whose lives are in danger. The coach      accident in TX is a tragic deal. I don't know if it could      have been avoided.       3:00 am, action at last. Ten coaches have been asked to      move to the Baton Rouge airport to move people. We are part      of the ten. Upon arrival at the airport we report in. Only,      the airport was not expecting us and wonders why we were      sent. This brings back bad thoughts of a couple of weeks ago.      The airport folks find a place to park us while they      determine the next step. We get parked right next to the      National Guard base. The Guard asks all the drivers with the      ten coaches in for a hot breakfast. This is very welcome and      sure beats the snack foods. After breakfast we head back to      the coach to nap and rest for whatever the next move might      be. By noon the rain has started and Rita is nearing land.       Listening to the radio we hear about people who needed help      to get out of the area. Why are we sitting here? At this      point it is too late to go to the areas in need as we would      arrive at the same time as the hurricane. We can only wonder      why.       About 3:00 pm we get orders to move. We are moved to a      large building in Baton Rouge and told to park along side the      building. The rain is starting to come down hard. The coaches      left at the rest stop on 1-49 are being moved further north      to get out of harms way. Two FEMA representatives come out of      the building and brief us. We are parked right along side the      FEMA headquarters. We are at the main command post. Our      orders are to stay prepared to move in case the building has      to be evacuated. This is hard to believe. We have been      assigned directly to the FEMA staff. During our discussion we      ask if we can stay in the building tonight as we have been in      the motorcoach since reporting for duty. The two staff      members tell us they will check on that possibility. We never      hear from them the rest of the night. The hurricane hits      land near the LA-TX state line. It is no picnic in Baton      Rouge. The wind is high and the rain comes down in sheets.     September 24.       With all the wind and the heavy rain it was difficult to      get much sleep. It is very hard to believe and understand why      we were not allowed to come in the building. It would have     been a lot safer inside and there was a floor that was      devoted to sleeping quarters. They even had cots for people      to use. Yesterday the two staff members had told us we could      come in the building and use the showers. When we tried to do      this, security would not let us near the building and      security would not call the two staff members inside. This is      crazy. We are good enough to sit outside during a hurricane      to be on call to provide evacuation transportation. Yet, we      are treated like criminals when we try to get in to use the      showers. On the door there is a sign about a national news      conference at 2 p.m. I tell the other three drivers with me      that we will receive orders to move before 1:30 p.m.       Sure enough, at 1:30 p.m. we are given orders to move to      the staging area at Le Place. The FEMA staff didn't want us      parked near the building when the press conference was taking      place.       We follow orders and head to Le Place to report in and top      off the fuel tanks. There is water everywhere from all the      rain. At Le Place we drive through water to report in. Once      again the orders are to park and wait. We spend more time      driving around empty and waiting for orders than we do      working. Nothing is going to happen the rest of today. In the      parking area there are city buses from Atlanta, GA. They were      asked to come to the area to help move people. Thus far they      have done nothing but sit and wait. We said welcome to the      crowd.       Nightfall comes with no place to obtain lodging. However,      there are a couple of restaurants open in the area and we can      get a good meal. We spend our evening talking with other      drivers and listening to all of the frustration just sitting      around. This frustration builds larger each day as you see      resources sitting idle.     September 25.       We are tired and weary from spending the past six nights      trying to sleep in the coach. This morning we are able to      take a shower at the truck stop. The $9.00 to get a shower is      worth every cent.  I sure wouldn't pay it.       After showers, we meet with the drivers of the other eight      coaches we were with in Baton Rouge. As we are talking the      dispatcher gives us orders to drive into New Orleans. We are      going to be moving a National Guard unit out of New Orleans      to the area where Rita has gone through.       After taking most of the morning it get organized the unit      is ready to move out. We will be bringing up the rear of the      convoy: Our route will be I-10 to Lafayette where the unit      has been reassigned. I have discovered that these orders were      issued at 1 a.m. this morning and it took eight hours for      them to move through channels to us and the military. What an      amazing chain of command. The commander of the unit fills us      in on the route and how to drive in a convoy. The members of      the unit are very happy to ride in the air conditioned coach.      Upon arrival in Lafayette they set up a command center at an      old Service Master store. We have to wait until the command      releases us before we can go back to Le Place. The afternoon      goes by slowly as we wait to be released from duty. The      commander holds us as he sees no reason to be stationed in      Lafayette as they have very little damage. Once again, I want      to ask who is in charge. About 9 p.m. we are released to go      back to Le Place.       Arriving in Le Place we find hundreds of coaches parked and      waiting for orders. This brings back all the thoughts about      wasteful use of resources. Our time is up; we need to head      back to Iowa. I make the arrangements to be released and we      head out for home.     September 26       Another long night of driving and we finally get home, a      very tired group. This has proved to be another growing      experience. Sleeping every night in the motorcoach, only      getting one good meal a day, and only having two showers all      week. We all learned a lot about ourselves and what we are      able to do when needed.       The hardest thing to accept this trip was sitting out the      hurricane in the motorcoach. It is very difficult to      understand and accept the fact that we were not allowed in      the FEMA building during the hurricane. Good enough to be a      safety valve, but not good enough to be allowed in the      building.       Hopefully, at some point in the future I will have an      opportunity to share with the right folks and work with them      to improve the system and the way it works as it relates to      motorcoaches. Especially in the area of equipment safety and      using motorcoaches to move large numbers of people in an      emergency.  That is the end of his diary. He ends with a little paragraph that says:       Thoughts of Craig Van Waardhuizen while working through the      Katrina and Rita hurricanes in LA. I was lead member of a      four member team providing motorcoach service with two      motorcoaches. I am a Terminal Manager and Operations Director      for Northwest Iowa Transportation, Inc (a motorcoach carrier      in Iowa with membership in UMA, ABA and IMG).     Craig Van Waardhuizen.  I thank my friend Craig for sharing his experiences with the people of the Nation through this, but most importantly for the Senate and my Senate colleagues to take this into consideration.                          ____________________
