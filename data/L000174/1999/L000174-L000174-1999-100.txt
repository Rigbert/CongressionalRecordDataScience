He and I and the distinguished Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch, and the distinguished Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Torricelli, have been working to clear amendments throughout the day.  Earlier today we cleared--what?--12, I believe, on this. We just cleared another large number. I mention this because Senators are coming to the floor offering amendments and clearing them. I commend those Senators who have been moving forward.  I also thank the distinguished senior Senator from Connecticut who has withheld his own debate so we could do this.  I thank him for that and yield the floor.
