Chair, thus, I encourage all my colleagues to oppose this sort of backward maneuver and oppose the final bill.  In closing, I would like to say, and to acknowledge publicly, a very big thank you and congratulations to Taunja Berquam on her upcoming retirement from Congress. I know she will have a bright future ahead.  After her distinguished and exemplary service with the Army Corps of Engineers, including in Iraq, she dedicated over a decade of her brilliant life and mind to the important task of managing the Appropriation's Energy and Water Development, and Related Agencies Subcommittee accounts during my tenure as ranking member, as well as for Representative Peter Visclosky before me.  Taunja's high-minded commitment to democratic principles is unyielding. Our committee is losing a trusted and honorable adviser. Her expertise and no-nonsense approach served our members, the staff, and the American people extraordinarily well.  Taunja, you will be missed, and you can leave knowing that you made a positive difference for America's future in nuclear readiness, in our energy future security, and in vital Army Corps development from coast to coast. We thank you.
