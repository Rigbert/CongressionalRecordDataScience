Speaker, this motion is also not germane under House rule XVI, clause 7, because it is one individual proposition attempting to amend another individual proposition.  The base constitutional amendment relates to flag desecration. The amendment proposed in the motion to recommit relates to the Old Age Survivors and Disability Trust Fund and is a separate proposition.                              {time}  1400
