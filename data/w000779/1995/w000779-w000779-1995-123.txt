Speaker, the House will consider H.R. 1555, the Communications Act of 1995 after the Fourth of July district work period.  If done properly, telecommunications legislation will open the doors to radical advances in technology for our constituents. In reshaping America's telecommunications laws, the Congress must consider as many potential applications of telecommunications technology as possible. After all, it's been 60 years since the last rewrite to telecommunications law.  During Commerce Committee consideration of H.R. 1555, the Communications Act of 1995, I raised the issue of telemedicine in an effort to expand the use and development of this exciting health care technology. Telemedicine is a diverse collection of technologies and clinical applications. The defining aspect of telemedicine is the use of electronic signals to transfer information from one site to another. Telemedicine's potential is immense; including for rural care, emergency care, home care, medical data management, and medical education.  I offered and withdrew an amendment to allow licensed physicians in one State to conduct consultations with licensed health care practitioners in another State. I withdrew the amendment at the request of Members who sought additional time to explore the issue with the objective of crafting a bipartisan floor amendment.  Bipartisan discussions continue today. It remains my objective, working with colleagues from both sides of the aisle, to produce bipartisan legislation to bring telemedicine's many benefits across State lines to the American public.  I call the attention of my colleagues to the report printed below titled, ``Telemedicine and State Licensure.'' The report outlines current problems facing telemedicine and the need for a bipartisan solution.  H.R. 1555, the Communications Act of 1995 is our opportunity to free telemedicine from the regulatory morass which threatens to keep this technology from the American people.The American Telemedicine Association--Telemedicine and State Licensure                              Introduction       The primary purpose of telemedicine is to give all citizens      immediate access to the appropriate level of medical care as      disease or trauma requires. Currently, each state must      license each physician or dentist who desires to practice      medicine within its borders. This mode of licensure, while      appropriate for practices limited by state boundaries, unduly      constricts the practice of telemedicine. As a result, medical      services today stops at state boundaries. American consumers      are blocked from accessing medical care available in other      states absent their ability to travel away from their own      homes and communities.       The challenge facing all concerned with advancing medicine,      and the sincere intent of our effort, is to preserve the      credentializing and monitoring efforts of each state while      providing instant and immediate access to appropriate levels      of care where not otherwise available.     The Current State of Physician Licensure in the United States       In some states, there are limited exceptions to the rule      that a physician or dentist must possess a license in each      state to which he practices medicine. Statutory      ``consultation exceptions'' allow an out-of-state physician      or dentist to enter a state to see a patient at the behest      (and in the presence) of a locally licensed physician or      dentist. However, consultations are often required to be      limited in duration, and a number of states which possess      them are acting to close them for telemedicine practitioners.      In 1995, Colorado, South Dakota, and Texas have considered      amendments to their consultation statutes prohibiting out-of-     state telemedicine practitioners from ``entering'' without      being licensed in their state. Utah repealed its consultation      exception effective in 1993, and the Kansas Board of Healing      Arts passed a regulation (which conflicts with its statutory      consultation exception) which requires out-of-state      telemedicine practitioners to be licensed in Kansas.       Additionally, a number of states prohibit out-of-state      consultants from establishing regularly used hospital      connections. If consultants cannot use telemedical facilities      at out-of-state hospitals, this limits the availability of      specialized healthcare to underserved areas. The      ``consultation exceptions'' are simply not useful or      dependable for the future of telemedicine. They are easily      amended to exclude telemedicine practitioners, they      require the presence of a locally licensed physician      (which may not always be possible), and only one-half of      the states possess exceptions broad enough to be used by      telemedicine consultants.       While some have argued that the distant patient is      ``transported'' to the physician or dentist via      telecommunications, this is a weak legal argument unlikely to      stand up in trial. It is instead probable that a majority of      state courts would find that a telemedicine practitioner is      practicing medicine in the patient's state. If the      telemedicine practitioner is not licensed in the patient's      state, this would have an extremely negative impact upon the      physician's malpractice liability, malpractice insurance      coverage, exposure to criminal prosecution, and potential      loss of licensure in his home state as well as remedial legal      recourse for an injured patient.       Licensure by reciprocity and licensure by endorsement have      long served physicians or dentists who wished to be licensed      in two or three states. However, reciprocity and endorsement      fall short of the needs of physicians or dentists practicing      via a telecommunications network. Today, reciprocity is      rarely used, and licensure by endorsement still requires that      applications, personal interviews, fees, pictures, school and      hospital records, and even letters from locally licensed      physicians or dentists be submitted to each state where a      license is desired. Each state's requirements are minutely      different, and the expense and time involved in receiving      licensure by endorsement in more than one or two states makes      it prohibitive, if not impossible, to achieve.                Is Individual State Licensure Required?       The Tenth Amendment of the U.S.Constitution reserves to the      states the power to protect the health and safety of state      citizens, hence the ability of the states to regulate and      license healthcare providers. Almost every state statutorily      defines the practice of medicine, and a typical statute      reads:       ``The practice of medicine means . . . to diagnose, treat,      correct, advise or prescribe for any human disease, ailment,      injury, infirmity, deformity, pain or other condition,      physical or mental, real or imaginary, by any means or      instrumentality.''       It appears that despite the presence of a primary/referring      physician, the physician consulting via telemedicine who      attempts to diagnose the patient is practicing medicine where      the patient is located. The phrase ``by any means or      instrumentality,'' while not common to all states, frequently      appears in state definitions. Courts would determine that      telemedicine was      the ``instrumentality'' used to reach a diagnosis, and find      that the state definitions bring telemedicine consultants      under their jurisdiction. States guard their power to      regulate for health and safety purposes, and the U.S.      Supreme Court has upheld their ability to do so.2      Therefore, it is unlikely that state courts would      surrender jurisdiction over an out-of-state physician or      dentist who practiced medicine via telecommunications on a      patient located in their state. Courts will find that the      medicine was being practiced where the patient was      located, and therefore the physician or dentist should      have been licensed in the patient's state. Such a finding      would have a chilling effect on telemedicine, since      licensure cannot be obtained in every state by every      specialist who participates in even one consultation.       The means for attaining these goals are to have the patient      under the care of a physician licensed in the same state of      residence but allowing consultative evaluations of the      patient by specialists licensed in another state. Other      health care professionals, such as physician assistants, must      be under the supervision of a licensed physician.          is interstate transmission of telemedicine required?       Just as the technology for the transmission of sound and      images has witnessed revolutionary change, so too has      medicine. These advances in telecommunications and medicine      have made advanced medical care available where not thought      possible before. Today, there are compelling needs to use      interstate transmission of telemedicine from medical, social      welfare, and economic perspectives:       The unpredictable immediacy of eruptions of disease or      trauma may command the services of unpredictable types of      specialists requiring licensure reciprocity in all 50 states.      Epidemic outbreak of disease is not limited to state      boundaries. The interstate mobility of specialty expertise is      needed throughout the United States to meet the demands for      combating injury or illness wherever and whenever it may      occur.       Medicine has witnessed the emergence of super-specialized      medical care centers in numerous critical areas. These      centers are located in regional tertiary care facilities      serving multi-state areas. Receiving medical attention      through these centers currently requires the transport of      most referred patients out of state. In addition, the lack of      proper recuperative care in their home community after a      patient returns home has prohibited the patient from      returning home sooner. The development of telemedical      links to local primary care facilities will enable many patients to      remain in-state under the primary responsibility of      physicians or dentists licensed in their home state. The      development of telemedical links to specialty care centers      can reduce the cost of transport and can lead to substantial      reductions in the costs of patient care.       Developing metropolitan-wide systems of care for many      cities also requires crossing one or two state boundaries.      There are 25 major metropolitan areas in the United States      that include more than one state. In each of these areas,      state licensing requirements effectively limit the ability of      physicians or dentists and other health care practitioners to      serve the health care needs, via metropolitan wide      telemedical systems, of the population base residing in their      own communities. This limitation can lead to great      disparities in access to health care due to the consumer's      place of residence.       The widespread shortage of health professionals in many      parts of rural America has long been recognized as a critical      public policy issue. In many cases, access to health care      could be greatly improved with the development of telemedical      links with health facilities located in nearby states.                               conclusion       Statutes are being considered among the states which would      require out-of-state physicians or dentists treating patients      across state lines via telecommunications to possess licenses      in the state ``entered.'' Already in the vast majority of      states the telemedicine practitioner would be considered to      be practicing medicine upon a patient located there, thus      providing the patient's state with jurisdiction over any      malpractice action. Additionally, malpractice insurance      coverage is generally predicated upon the physician being      licensed where he practices. In other words, a physician sued      for malpracticing via telemedicine in a state where he is not      licensed might find himself without coverage, as well as      responsible for his own defense costs. Failure to possess a      state license would be used to establish negligence upon the      part of the consulting physician. Criminal prosecution for      practicing without a license could result, and the      physician's home state could institute disciplinary action      against him for his actions in the distant state.      Telemedicine possesses incredible potential to increase      healthcare accessibility, but is severely hampered by legal      impediments of which licensure is one of the most obvious.      Fortunately, licensure problems have the greatest potential      to be alleviated by the passage of statutes aimed at      addressing these issues.       Emerging from these careful considerations is the need to      preserve the credentializing and monitoring efforts of each      state while providing instant and immediate access to      appropriate levels of care where not otherwise available.      Such actions should allow for immediate response to instances      of disease and trauma while securing for each state and its      citizens the continuance of the credentializing and      monitoring of quality within its boundaries with additional      specialized back-up as needed.                               footnotes     \1\ALA.
