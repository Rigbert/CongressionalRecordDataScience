The Senator and I have worked on this concept together. We went back to a day when the Senator from Missouri, Harry Truman, decided to ask the same hard questions of the administration during the Second World War, trying to find instances where tax dollars were being wasted and people were profiteering and soldiers were getting equipment that wasn't up to standard.  I ask the Senator from North Dakota: Isn't it curious that Senator Harry Truman, a Democrat from Missouri who created this commission and asked hard questions, when there was a Democratic President named Franklin Roosevelt, was suggesting that when it comes to profiteering, Congress doesn't do the administration nor the people of this country any favors by saying we are going to protect our own party in the White House? Shouldn't we be dealing with a nonpartisan issue of waste at the expense of taxpayers and, more importantly, at the expense of soldiers?  Isn't it true that at the hearings which Senator Dorgan has chaired bringing together whistleblowers who tell us these terrible stories of waste of millions of dollars of taxpayers' money, that absent these hearings there has been very little done on Capitol Hill by way of oversight of the giants who are winning these no-bid contracts, multibillion-dollar contracts, and wasting too much of taxpayer dollars?
