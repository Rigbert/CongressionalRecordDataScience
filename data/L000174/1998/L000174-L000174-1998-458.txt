President, on February 23, 1998 in Ankara, Turkey, a penal court handed down an important decision regarding human rights. Eleven board members of Turkey's largest independent human rights group, the Human Rights Association, were acquitted of charges of disseminating separatist propaganda and inciting racist and ethnic enmity at a December 1996 meeting. A request by prosecutors to close the organization was also rejected.  Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz has pledged to make progress in protecting human rights, and the February 23rd decision is a commendable step forward by the Turkish Government in that process. Hopefully, the decision will encourage human rights advocates to pursue reforms in Turkey and protect them from similar persecution in the future. An active civil society in which people can organize and express their opinions without fear of prosecution and official harassment is essential to the fulfillment of Prime Minister Yilmaz's goal.  Unfortunately, this step forward was recently marred by a step back. OnMarch 12, 1998, a Turkish court acquitted ten policemen who were accused of beating and sexually abusing a group of teenagers. According to an article in the ``Washington Post'', the teenagers were arrested in December 1995 on charges of scrawling leftist graffiti and of belonging to a radical leftist armed group, a charge for which they were later acquitted. Over the course of the eleven days in which they were detained by police, the teenagers were allegedly blindfolded, stripped, molested, raped with police batons, and subjected to electric shocks to the genitals.  According to the State Department's 1997 Country Report on Human Rights Practices, a judge in the case not only allowed the policemen to remain on active duty during the trial, he also relieved them of their obligation to personally appear in the courtroom. While these ten policemen walk freely, the teenagers will struggle with the physical and emotional consequences of their ordeal for years to come.  Turkish officials have made some attempts to reduce abuses perpetrated by security officials against detainees. However, despite a constitutional ban on torture, improvements in government cooperation with foreign human rights inspection teams and new police training programs, torture remains common. According to the State Department, the climate of impunity fostered by the rarity of convictions of police or other security officials for killings and torture, ``remains the single largest obstacle to reducing human rights abuses.''  Mr. President, I welcome Prime Minister Yilmaz's pledge to make progress on implementing human rights reforms. I applaud the recent decision to acquit the members of the Human Rights Association. However, as the brutal incident involving the teenagers illustrates, there is a great deal more to be done. Turkish officials must take an active, visible, and sustained role in addressing all facets of human rights--from promoting civil and political liberties to upholding the rule of law. Lasting reforms will not be realized in Turkey until Prime Minister Yilmaz's pledge is backed by consistent efforts to bring human rights violators to justice.                          ____________________
