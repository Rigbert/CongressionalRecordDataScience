 President, 2 days ago, I spoke proudly of my State's 150th birthday celebration this year and also the Smithsonian Institution's cooperation with that effort. By the way, the Smithsonian Institution happens to be 150 years old as well this year, and they are celebrating that anniversary throughout the year. But for 2 weeks, beginning on June 26, there is going to be a celebration of my State on The Mall. Specifically, though, on June 26 there will be a birthday party for Iowa from 6:30 to 8:30 p.m. in the Centennial Building on The Mall across from the Smithsonian castle.  I hope that Americans will come to see, over the course of those 2 weeks, demonstrations about Iowa industry, Iowa agriculture, Iowa education, Iowa history, culture--everything--that will be on display there.  I announced that I was going to speak a little bit and shortly every day on a certain aspect of Iowa.  I want to make reference to spreading the spirit of Iowa. As I talk about the Iowa spirit, I will talk about the role of weekly and daily newspapers throughout the history of Iowa, my State.  So it is time to say, ``Extra, extra--read all about it.''  Mr. President, Iowa celebrates its 150-year-old heritage this year. And at the end of this month and during the first week of July, Iowa will participate at the Festival of American Folklife on our National Mall to showcase our folks and way of life. Billing the celebration as ``Iowa--Community Style,'' hundreds of Iowans and Iowa natives will pitch in to spread the sesquicentennial spirit to more than a million visitors.  Of course, Iowa's story of community wouldn't be complete without sharing a vital and continuing chapter integral to community life in Iowa. Iowa's first newspaper started in Dubuque when the Dubuque Visitor issued its premiere edition on May 11, 1836. And Iowa's longest running newspaper continues to roll off the presses each day in southeast Iowa. The Burlington Hawkeye's first edition dates back prestatehood, to July 10, 1837. To this day, the local newspaper office remains an important hub of activity on Main Street in Iowa's 99 county seats and surrounding communities. More than 340 hometown weekly and daily newspapers currently report local events in Iowa.  As you may know, Iowa consistently ranks at the top in literacy and other tests of scholastic achievement. Perhaps it's no small wonder that my State also holds the highest per capita number of newspapers in the country. Just take one county in Iowa, as an example. Situated on the banks of the Missouri River in northwest Iowa, Sioux County has a population of about 30,000 people and boasts no less than seven published newspapers each week. Known to be well-read, Iowans are serious about keeping abreast of current affairs in our local, national and international communities.  In fact, an international venture between Iowa media outlets and foreign journalists started 3 years ago. The International Center for Community Journalism, based in Grinnell, IA, has helped to match journalists from the Ukraine, Russia, Georgia, Bulgaria, Mongolia, and Thailand with more than 30 newspapers in Iowa. Iowa families open up their homes for 2 or 3 months while the visiting journalist works at their local newspapers.  Many times, Iowa journalists and journalism educators will reciprocate the stay in the foreign country. This exchange of information, culture, and talent has helped to spread the Iowa spirit and a vital understanding of the importance of a free press in a democratic society. The program soon willinclude journalists from Hong Kong, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Vietnam.  Without a doubt, Iowans have grown to depend on their hometown papers for school news, high school sports coverage, business items, local government and politics, community announcements, and human interest stories. Typical of any endeavor in my State, be it enterprise, education or entertainment, newspapers in Iowa place great emphasis on quality. Combining news reporting and advertising, the local newspaper is a constant and reliable source for the community.  The Iowa Newspaper Association each year awards top honors to newspapers in Iowa for general excellence; for delivering the best editorial, front, sports, and feature pages; for best coverage of local government, agriculture, and education; and, for overall community service.  Merchants and shopkeepers on Main Street rely on the local newspaper to advertise upcoming sales and promotions. And readers pay close attention to the ads.  For sure, Iowa's hometown newspapers wouldn't miss this once-in-one-hundred-and-fifty-years-opportunity to help spread Iowa's spirit. Visitors to the cafe on The National Mall will find a grand newspaper stand displaying many of Iowa's hometown papers. You can discover for yourself a trove of Iowa's ink in the Herald, Journal, Gazette, Review, Leader, Express, Record, Bee, Chronicle, Register, Times, and Courier, just to name a few. I would encourage those who plan to celebrate with Iowa--community style, to stop by and ``read all about it.''                          ____________________
