Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to the Speaker of the House, John Boehner.  Speaker Boehner and I, as some would note, do not always agree. We have been on opposite sides of this floor and on opposite sides of debate many times. However, that is behind us for John Boehner.  In all of the years I have served with him, Speaker Boehner has shown me the same kindness, grace, and friendship that he has shown so many of his House colleagues on both sides of the aisle.  John Boehner is a gentleman in the truest sense of the word and is a leader who, even in the act of stepping back from his position in the leadership, has always put the best interests of our country first.  When it came time to make difficult decisions, even in the face of strong opposition from some in his own party, Speaker Boehner was willing to work across the aisle to make sure that this House was achieving its most fundamental responsibilities to those we had the honor of serving.  We did not have a catastrophic default on our debt--at least twice--in large part because of John Boehner's determination not to let it happen. Millions of children benefitted from the forms of No Child Left Behind because John Boehner, the chairman of the committee, put children's interests first and worked in partnership with the late Senator Ted Kennedy and Congressman George Miller.  That was in the best traditions of a President Bush-sponsored piece of legislation--a Republican chairman, a Democratic chairman, and a ranking Democrat working together on behalf of our country's interest.  John Boehner worked to keep his Conference and this House marching forward down a productive path. History will be the judge of his success as the leader of his party, but all of us who have had the honor of serving with him will judge him as we know him--a considerate and thoughtful individual, who is a patriot and who cares deeply about this House and the Nation it serves.  I want to thank him, as I would hope all of our Members would and, frankly, those Members who served with him, but who are not in this House now, for his service and for his friendship.  I want to wish him well and wish him luck out there on the golf course, where I am sure he will be spending a lot more time--I am going to be envious of that--in addition to the time that he will spend with his family and in continuing to serve his community, his State, and his Nation.  John Boehner served his country and this House of Representatives with fidelity and responsibility, and we should all thank him for that.  We wish the Speaker and his wife, Debbie, well as they embark on a new phase of their lives. He has served his country well. I am confident that he will continue to do so.                          ____________________
