Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Representative Stephanie Stuckey Benfield upon her retirement from the Georgia General Assembly and to thank her for her fourteen years of service.  For years, Stephanie has valiantly fought for women's rights, the environment, and families. She has been a leader in the Democratic Party, an advocate for all Georgians, and a dear friend.  Born in Eastman, Georgia, Stephanie has always been an outdoors enthusiast. Her love for nature has translated into an active dedication to improving the environment and a commitment to clean water and air that grew stronger when her son was diagnosed with asthma.  Stephanie obtained both her undergraduate and law degree from the University of Georgia. While in office, she received several prestigious awards, including the Environmental Leadership Award by the Georgia Conservation Voters and the Georgia Urban Forest Council Award for Promoting Arbor Day in public schools. It goes without question that her most notable accomplishment, however, has been her impeccable and unwavering service and support to Georgians.  We all know how much Stephanie adores her husband, Robert H. Benfield, Jr., her son, Robert, and her daughter, Beverly. Although we will miss Stephanie's enthusiasm and infinite knowledge in the General Assembly, I applaud her for continuing to be a proponent of the environment. Upon the end of her term, she will be the full-time leader of GreenLaw, where she will maintain her pledge to prevent air and water pollution that endangers human health and degrades Georgia's natural resources.  Representative Benfield, we will miss you terribly; you leave enormous shoes to fill. Thank you for your 14 years of service and for always putting the people of Georgia first.                          ____________________
