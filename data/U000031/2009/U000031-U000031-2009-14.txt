Speaker, as dean of the Michigan Republican delegation, I have the sad duty to relay the news that our former colleague Carl Pursell from Michigan passed away this morning. He was the ranking member on the Labor-HHS appropriations subcommittee for many years. He retired in 1993.  I would yield to Mr. McCotter who represents Plymouth, Michigan.  Mr. McCOTTER. I thank the gentleman.  I grew up in Carl's district. We watched as he went from a Wayne County commissioner to a Michigan State Senator and then into this illustrious body. As a young person growing up getting interested in politics, Carl's example was an inspiration. It showed that a fine and decent gentleman could come from the small town of Plymouth, retain his Main Street truths, and do the people's business in this, the people's House.  The last several years have not been kind to Carl. He is in a far better place, and we are all diminished. Our best goes out to his family, and we would appreciate it if you keep him in your prayers.
