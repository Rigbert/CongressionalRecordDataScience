 President, today I wish to honor the life of one soldier from Kentucky who gave his life in service to our country. SPC Kevin J. Graham of Benton, KY, was killed in Kandahar, Afghanistan, on September 26, 2009, when the enemy attacked his vehicle with an IED. He was 27 years old.  For his service in uniform, Specialist Graham received many medals, awards, and decorations, including the Bronze Star Medal, the Purple Heart, the Army Good Conduct Medal, the Combat Infantryman Badge, the National Defense Service Medal, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal with Bronze Service Star, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, the Army Service Ribbon, the Overseas Service Ribbon, the NATO Medal, the Expert Marksmanship Badge, the National Defense Service Medal, and the Army Service Ribbon.  Soldiering was not simply a vocation to Specialist Graham; it was a way of life and it was a calling. From a young age, friends and family recall his strong desire to become a soldier.  ``Before he went into the Army, he would see guys in uniform and say he needed to be doing something like that,'' says the Reverend Jonathan Goodman, Kevin's pastor from Benton's Calvary Baptist Church. ``He felt like it was his life's work, and he was honored to serve his country.''  Kevin was born in 1982 in Illinois and raised in Wisconsin. He moved with his parents to Marshall County, KY, about 5 years before his death. As a child Kevin received his education through Christian Liberty Academy as a homeschooler. He was a member of Paddock Lake Baptist Church in Wisconsin, where he was involved with the youth group and assisted the youth pastor.  As a young boy Kevin and his best friend used to dress up in Army fatigues and patrol the neighborhood. Neighbors would say they felt safe because they knew someone was watching out for them. Kevin's interest in the military also included a love of military history. He would read endlessly about the Civil War and World War II and talk often with his father, grandfather, and others who had served about their experiences. Kevin collected memorabilia from different conflicts, including some given to him by veterans. His interest in military aviation led him to spend his summers at an airfield in Kenosha, WI, to see hundreds of World War II planes gather in formation.  Kevin also learned to shoot at an early age. By the time he was 16, he had earned a job overseeing the skeet range at the local shooting facility. Heearned many badges for his marksmanship, including one for hitting his target 73 out of 75 times.  Kevin also had a love for old cars. He bought a 1965 Pontiac Le Mans and rebuilt it from the ground up. He attended countless car shows and won several trophies.  In July 2007 Kevin fulfilled a lifelong goal and honored the service of his father Daniel, who earned a Purple Heart for his service in Vietnam, by enlisting in the U.S. Army. He completed basic training that November.  One of Kevin's closest friends, Tristan Miller, joined the Army within months of Kevin. Kevin ``was enlisting in a time of war and he chose to enlist as an infantryman,'' Tristan recalls. ``Kevin knew what he was going into. This was something he volunteered to do. Kevin knew something was wrong out there, and he was going to take a stand about it.''  Kevin was later based at Fort Lewis, WA, where he met the woman who would become his wife, Krystal, in the fall of 2008. On March 22, 2009, they were married, just a few days before Kevin's 27th birthday. Kevin also grew very close to Krystal's son Brian and enjoyed spending time as a dad.  Then, in July, Kevin was deployed to Afghanistan--his first deployment. He deployed as part of 4th Platoon, Alpha Company, 1st Battalion, 17th Infantry Regiment, 5th Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 2nd Infantry Division, based out of Fort Lewis. He was promoted to specialist and assigned to be a mortar carrier driver, a responsibility given to those soldiers among the best able to remain calm in the face of a crisis. No doubt Kevin's lifetime of preparation, going back to his boyhood neighborhood patrols, served him well for his greatest and final role.  ``It was an honor to be his parents,'' says Sandra Graham, Kevin's mother. ``Truly an honor.''  We are thinking of Kevin's family and friends today, including his wife Krystal, his stepson Brian, his mother Sandra, his brothers Daniel, Sean, and Scott, and many other beloved family members and friends. Kevin's father, Daniel Graham, a hero in his own right, has sadly passed on.  Mr. President, I know my U.S. Senate colleagues join me in expressing our deepest condolences to the family of SPC Kevin J. Graham and great gratitude for his life of honorable service and his enormous sacrifice in uniform. Without heroes like Specialist Graham, our country could not be free. I hope it is some small measure of comfort to his family that the life of Specialist Graham has been remembered and appropriately honored here in the U.S. Senate.  Those of us in this body must never forget the men and women such as Specialist Graham who built the foundation upon which our democracy stands.                          ____________________
