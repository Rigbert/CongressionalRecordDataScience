I particularly thank the Senator from Virginia, Mr. Warner, who has acted as good counsel to both the Senator from Alaska and the Senator from Illinois.  Let me tell my colleagues what this amendment does because I think the Senate can be proud of the outcome. What we are going to do is to increase combat pay for the men and women in uniform by 50 percent from $150 a month to $225 a month, and we are going to increase the family separation allowance by 150 percent from $100 month to $250 a month. Our action in this fiscal year will be retroactive to October 1. So it covers the entire fiscal year. It is going to mean a helping hand through a difficult time for the men and women in uniform, and their families.  As I have said, and I am sure the Senator from Alaska will agree, there is no amount of money that we can give these men and women, nor their families, to compensate them for what they are giving to our country, but this effort on the Senate floor, in a bipartisan fashion, shows we are dedicated to work together to express our gratitude not just in speeches but by giving a helping hand to these families who are struggling.  I send a modification of the amendment to the desk on behalf of myself, Senators Stevens, Inouye, Warner, Chambliss, Mikulski, Dole, Daschle, Landrieu, Clinton, and Pryor.
