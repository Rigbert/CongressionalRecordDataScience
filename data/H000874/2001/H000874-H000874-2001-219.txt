Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that information.  Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Texas, the majority leader, indicates that there are some possibilities of discussions with some of the committees resulting in bills being reported to the floor.  Would the gentleman be able to inform us as to what those possibilities are, realizing they may or may not come to the floor? Do we know what the possible bills that might come to the floor would be?
