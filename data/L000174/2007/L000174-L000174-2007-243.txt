President, no one, no one supports forced abortion or forced sterilization. Let's be honest about that. What this is, there is a provision in the U.S. law called the Kemp-Kasten amendment. It is designed to ensure that U.S. Government funds do not go to organizations engaged in coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization. We all support that. But the law has been construed differently by the White House to deny funds to the UNFPA because it is a program in China.
