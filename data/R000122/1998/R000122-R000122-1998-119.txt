President, I rise to honor Brigadier General Joseph N. Waller on the occasion of his retirement from the Rhode Island Air National Guard.  For the past thirty-one years, General Waller has dedicated himself to the citizens of our country and the Ocean state. He was first assigned to the 143rd Special Operations Squadron in July 1967 as a troop carrier pilot. The next year he was assigned as a tactical airlift pilot, a duty he performed for the next twenty-three years. During this time, he also served as a flight leader and instructor pilot. General Waller is a command pilot who has logged 4,500 flying hours.  General Waller is noted not only for his piloting skills, but also for his leadership. In 1981, he was selected as commander of the 143rd Tactical Airlift Squadron. In December 1987, he was reassigned to Headquarters, Rhode Island National Guard and named Deputy Chief of Staff. Three years later he became Chief of Staff. The very next yearhe was elevated to the position of Assistant Adjutant General, the position he holds today.  General Waller chairs the Eastern Region of the Air National Guard Long Range Planning Process and serves as the Air National Guard Assistant of Strategic Planning to the US Air Force Long Range Planning Office. He is well suited to these positions because during his thirty years in the Rhode Island National Guard, General Waller has witnessed and provided leadership through immense change. When General Waller first joined the Guard in the 1960s, the United States was immersed in turmoil both at home and abroad. The goals and role of the military in the states and overseas were confused and conflicted. During the next decade, the United States moved to an all volunteer force, fundamentally changing the nature of the Guard. Then in the 1980s, military goals and perspectives shifted again during an enormous buildup which peaked in 1985 with a record budget of $300 billion.  Now, once again, the Guard is adjusting to new era of reduced force structure, budget constraints, and base closures. Members of the Guard no longer train one weekend a month and two weeks each summer. Instead, they participate 110-120 days a year and work side-by-side with their active duty colleagues on missions in countries around the world. General Waller has been through it all and has never wavered from the core values of the Guard: integrity first, service before self, and excellence in all that is done.  General Waller is clearly an outstanding soldier. His military awards and decorations include the Legion of Merit; Meritorious Service Medal with two bronze oak leaf clusters; Air Force Commendation Medal; Air Force Achievement Medal; Outstanding Unit Award; Combat Readiness medal with three bronze oak leaf clusters; National Defense Service Medal with one star; Air Force Longevity Service Award Ribbon with one silver and three bronze oak leaf clusters; Armed Forces Reserve medal with gold hourglass; Small Arms Expert Markmanship Ribbon; Air Force Training Ribbon; Rhode Island Star with one oak leaf cluster; Rhode Island Defense Medal; and Rhode Island National Guard Service Medal with eagle and ``V'' device.  General Waller is also an outstanding citizen. He is the devoted husband of Carol, the loving father of Wendy, Jay and Jill and the proud grandfather of three boys. Throughout the years he has also given to his community as a Boy Scout Master and a Sunday school teacher.  General Waller rose from the enlisted ranks and has occupied and succeeded at virtually every level of command. He inspired and empowered those around him. He cares deeply for the Guard and the people in it. We are honored by the legacy he leaves behind and aspire to ensure that General Waller is always proud of the Guard in the future.                          ____________________
