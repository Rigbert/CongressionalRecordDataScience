Specter, and I came to the floor to offer our amendment--at least to get it filed--on habeas corpus, which has been joined by many Senators on both sides of the aisle. That was objected to.  I am just wondering: We have been trying every day since. Can the managers give me some idea of when Senator Specter and I may begin the debate on that amendment?  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, may I say this is one time I am glad I am not in the majority.
