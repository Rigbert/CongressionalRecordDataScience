President, many on the Senate Armed Services Committee have been quite distressed over some of the uncertainties, some of the things that happened in conjunction with the tragedy of the U.S.S. Cole. Even though it is a delicate thing to talk about, there are people still around who believe that the President took some actions, such as sending the cruise missiles into Afghanistan and the cruise missiles into Sudan, without consultation with the Joint Chiefs of Staff, without consultation with the Intelligence Committee, the Senate Armed Services Committee, the House Armed Services Committee, something that was done and nobody knew it was going to happen. There are a lot of people who believe that might have been politically motivated.  I think it is very appropriate tonight to urge the President that if something should happen that we would have to take some kind of action in the next few days, in that there are only 13 days until a national election, make sure there are no suspicions out there. I want to get on record urging the President to work closely on any proposed action that could take place as a result of the U.S.S. Cole tragedy, to work closely on the matter, in full consultation with all members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, with the top service commanders in chief, as well as the members of both the Senate Armed Services Committee, the House Armed Services Committee, and the Intelligence Committees. By doing this, we could preclude any types of suspicions, allowing us to participate in what would have to be a major decision.
