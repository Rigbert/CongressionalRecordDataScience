Mr. Speaker, December 4 through December 9, 1995, the Government of Japan will host an international conference on Sustainable Contribution of Fisheries to Food Security in collaboration with the Food and Agriculture Organization [FAO] of the United Nations. This Conference will provide an excellent opportunity for international awareness and understanding of the varied economic, social, and cultural diversity of the utilization of marine resources throughout the world. Delegates representing government and nongovernmental organizations will discuss options and strategies to ensure the sustainable contribution of fisheries to the world's food security in the future.  While the present food fish production throughout the world is approximately 72 million tons, it is projected that the demand for food fish will reach 105 million tons in the year 2010, when the world population reaches 7 billion. Clearly, nations must initiate measures to achieve a sustainable increase in fish production through cooperation on rational utilization measures and implementation of sound conservation programs. It is clear that those of us living at the end of the 20th century have the responsibility to provide a stable food supply system and maintain those reasonable resources for present and future generations. Living aquatic resources are renewable and can provide increased food for human consumption through responsible management and appropriate harvest and handling practices. Such a goal can be achieved if utilization of these resources is based on objective scientific and socio-economic data and principles that recognize and respect the importance of culture and traditions, guarantee the integrity of ecosystems that support living aquatic food resources, and encompass sound management measures through national, and where appropriate, multinational management programs.  I commend the Government of Japan for taking the initiative in hosting this important Conference and I wish the delegates to the Conference much success in their deliberations. As chairman of the Resources Committee of the House of Representatives, I look forward to reviewing their observations, conclusions, and recommendations.                          ____________________
