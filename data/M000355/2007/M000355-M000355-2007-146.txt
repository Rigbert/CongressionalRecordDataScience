 President, I am pleased the Judiciary Committee will begin hearings this morning on the nomination of Judge Michael Mukasey to be the Nation's 81st Attorney General.  Judge Mukasey has outstanding qualifications and a sterling reputation. Throughout four decades, he selflessly devoted his life to public service, culminating in his selection as Chief Judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.  As a jurist, Judge Mukasey handled complex legal problems judiciously, thoughtfully, and fairly.
