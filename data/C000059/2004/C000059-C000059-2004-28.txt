 Mr. Speaker, I rise in favor of this rule. Certainly water is extremely important, not just to California but the entire west, and certainly to all of those who have been associated with the current CALFED program, ecosystem restoration activities appears to be somewhat haphazard. The measurable outcome has focused on dollars spent rather than increased numbers of fish and wildlife. This legislation proposes new congressional oversight and accountability, requiring Federal agencies to report on certain ecosystem restoration program goals and accomplishments. For example, landowners want to see accomplishments of land and water management plans and how new ecosystem restoration plans will fit into the big picture.  The manager's amendment to the bill will be reducing the Federal cost of implementation of this from over a billion dollars 4 years ago, and $890 million as introduced to a Federal authorization of $427 million.  This bill has bipartisan support. H.R. 2828 is the product of congressional deliberation and lengthy negotiations. That is why it was reported by the Committee on Resources with bipartisan support. Democrats and Republicans throughout the State of California support this bill because it is balanced in nature and it will be, as I mentioned, not just good for California but the entire West.  I urge the adoption of this rule.  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone).
