Mr. Chairman, I thank my good friend the gentleman for yielding me the time.  Mr. Chairman, first I would like to thank the gentlewoman from Florida [Ms. Ros-Lehtinen] and the gentlewoman from Georgia [Ms. McKinney] for cosponsoring this amendment with me, and for their leadership on the issue of trying to provide a modest amount of funds to the War Crimes Tribunal for the people who has suffered in Rwanda.  Mr. Chairman, the outbreak of warfare in Rwanda was accompanied by an outbreak of genocidal violence all too reminiscent of what happened in the former Yugoslavia. Under cover of long-standing tribal rivalries, an effort was launched by leaders of one tribe to bring about the systematic extermination of another.  It is important that the international community show that this kind of crime against humanity will be detected, prosecuted and punished. The Rwanda tribunal was created by Security Council Resolution 955 on November 8, 1994. Many Members no doubt remember that date for other reasons, but for Rwandans it was an important sign of hope that the world had not forgotten their sufferings and there would be a prosecution for committing these heinous crimes.
