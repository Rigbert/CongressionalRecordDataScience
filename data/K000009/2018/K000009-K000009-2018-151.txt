Speaker, I am pleased to join my fellow co-chairs of the bipartisan Congressional Ukraine Caucus to introduce a Joint Resolution, which reaffirms the sovereignty and the freedom to choose their destiny for the people of Europe and Eurasia.  Since the fall of communism, the countries of Eastern Europe and Eurasia have made great progress in developing democratic institutions, free markets, and strong civil societies. Many have demonstrated their commitment to these important ideals through their accession in liberal institutions such as the European Union and that NATO Alliance, which are critical to our national security.  Indeed, the American people have stood with freedom-lovers across this region, to spread the blessings of liberty and democracy to these nations. For this reason since 1959, the President of the United States has proclaimed the third week of July as ``Captive Nations Week.'' This very special occasion shined a light on the plight of nations oppressed by Soviet Russian regime, and continues to reaffirm America's commitment to those dedicated to democracy, rule of law, freedom, and justice.  Tragically, Russia's thirst for power would seek to thwart the forward progress of these nations. Russia seeks to undermine democratic institutions, and thus strengthen is dictatorial and tyrannical hold on that region through hybrid warfare. This includes election meddling, disinformation campaigns, extrajudicial assassinations, the intimidation of journalists, and other forms of despicable behavior. Russia invaded and illegally occupies regions of Ukraine and Georgia, and seeks to rip away these nations' ability to choose their democratic future. It is a shame to have such bestial behavior on this earth.  This resolution builds on the ``Captive Nations Week'' Resolution, and invites the President through an annual proclamation to set the record straight that all nations have the right to self-determination, territorial sovereignty, and to choose their own destinies. It sends a message to our partners in the region that we stand with those that embrace liberty, instead of those that seek to tear it down. By standing together, we ensure a more democratic, secure, and prosperous world.                          ____________________
