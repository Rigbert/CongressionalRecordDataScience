President, every year we get to this point at the end of a Congress where many bills get packaged together and move through under unanimous consent. Usually this process works well and gives each of us an opportunity to work out concerns we might have about any particular bill. Unfortunately, last night two bills were approved that should have received much greater scrutiny by the full Senate. Instead, they squeaked through because the proponents cleverly bundled them with over 100 other uncontroversial, local-interest bills.  Together, the Cape Fox Land Entitlement Adjustment Act and the University of Alaska lands bill will give away huge chunks of our federal lands in Alaska. Individually, they represent what I fear will be facing us in the near future--the quiet erosion of our federal lands for the benefit of private interests. These bills turn over more than 260,000 acres of federal lands in Alaska without addressing fundamental public concerns about public access, logging, roadless areas and the impact on fish and wildlife.  Both of these bills are opposed by many Alaska and national environmental organizations.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record two letters, dated July 16, 2002 and September 4, 2002, outlining some of their concerns that were not heard as these bills were being rushed to the floor and passed last night.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:   Alaska Coalition, Alaska Conservation Voters/Alaska Conservation  Alliance, Alaska Rainforest Campaign, Alaska Wilderness League, Earth   Justice, Eyak Preservation Council, Mineral Policy Center, National    Audubon Society, National Wildlife Federation, Natural Resources Defense Council, League of Conservation Voters, Scenic America, Sierra   Club, Southeast Alaska Conservation Council, The Endangered Species              Coalition, The Wilderness Society, U.S. PIRG,                                                    July 16, 2002.     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Bingaman: We are writing you to urge you to      oppose S. 2222, the Cape Fox Entitlement Adjustment Act of      2002. Introduced earlier this year by Senator Frank Murkowski      (R-AK), and currently being considered by the Energy and      Natural Resources Committee, this bill is an attempt to      benefit special interests by giving away valuable Tongass      National Forest lands--lands owned by all Americans. Opposed      by many Southeast Alaskans, S. 2222 attempts to trade the      Tongass for commercial development including clear cutting      and mining.       This bill proposes to give Cape Fox and Sealaska      Corporations more than 11,000 acres of valuable Tongass      National Forest lands in Berners Bay near Juneau in return      for 3,000 acres of mostly roaded and clearcut lands near      Ketchikan and certain subsurface rights. With the transfer of      the publicly owned lands, the Corporations gain the rights to      log, subdivide, sell, or develop this swath of land on the      northwest side of Berners Bay. Despite the importance of      Berners Bay to Alaskan residents, Senator Murkowski has not      held a local hearing on the land exchange issue in Juneau.      This bill is bad public policy and should not see the light      of day.       Berners Bay is one of Juneau's most important recreation      areas for kayaking, hunting, camping, bird watching,      commercial touring and many other activities. The traded      lands could be closed to public access, beautiful views and      hunting grounds replaced with stumps and no trespassing      signs. The Bay contains abundant wildlife, including four      species of salmon, wolves and brown and black bears. It is an      important stopover for migratory birds as well as foraging      grounds for Steller sea lions.       The Alaska Department of Fish and Game, City and Borough of      Juneau, and commercial     fishermen have long supported protection of Berners Bay's      high value fisheries and vast recreational opportunities.      Additionally, the Auk Kwaan tribe, original settlers of the      area, recognizes Berners Bay as an integral part of their      traditional territory. These ancestral lands contain village      site, burial grounds, and the sacred Spirit Mountain. Berners      Bay is a critically important wild area for southeast Alaska      residents and visitors alike.       The public lands to be given away include Slate Lake, where      the Coeur d'Alene Mines Corporation anticipates dumping mine      tailings from its proposed Kensington gold mine. Slates Lake      is perched above a productive salmon stream in Berners Bay.      Giving away these lands would risk contaminating the land and      harming its irreplaceable natural resources.       Again, we urge you to oppose S. 2222. Please do not      schedule a mark-up of this bill by the committee. The Tongass      National Forest is a national treasure that deserves to be      treated with care and in the best interest of the American      people.

The Hon. Harry Reid,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Reid, We are writing to urge you to keep S.      2222, the Cape Fox Land Entitlement Adjustment Act of 2002,      off the floor of the United States Senate. This bill was      introduced earlier this year by Senator Frank Murkowski (AK-     R), and passed through the Energy and Natural Resources      Committee in late July.       Even with the changes in language made during the mark-up      process, this bill is an attempt to benefit special interests      by giving away valuable Tongass National Forest lands, which      are owned by all Americans. Opposed by many Southeast      Alaskans, S. 2222 attempts to trade Tongass lands for      commercial development including clearcutting and mining.       This bill proposes to give Cape Fox and Sealaska      Corporations more than 11,000 acres of valuable Tongass      National Forest lands in Berners Bay near Juneau in return      for 3,000 acres of mostly roaded and clearcut lands near      Ketchikan and certain subsurface rights. With the transfer of      the publicly owned lands, the Corporations gain the right to      log, subdivide, sell, or develop this swath of land on the      northwest side of Berners Bay. Despite the importance of      Berners Bay to Alaskan residents, Senator Murkowski has not      held a local hearing on the land exchange issue in Juneau,      nor had a public appraisal prepared prior to the passage of      this legislation through committee. We believe that a public      appraisal should be required before this legislation is      allowed to proceed. This bill is bad public policy, and is      another attempt by Senator Murkowski to appease special      interests during his governor's race.       Berners Bay is one of Juneau's most important recreation      areas for kayaking, hunting, camping, bird watching,      commercial touring and many other activities. The traded      lands could be closed to public access, and beautiful views      and hunting grounds replaced with stumps and no trespassing      signs.
