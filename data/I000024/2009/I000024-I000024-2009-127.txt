President, first, I compliment the Senator from Ohio.When he was Governor of Ohio, he had the reputation of being the most knowledgeable person on air issues. Of course, the primary concern we had at that time was that we had a crisis in energy, and the one thing that had to be in the mix to resolve that crisis was to do something with nuclear power. There is nobody who has carried that banner more forcefully than the Senator from Ohio. I appreciate our joint efforts to make that happen. I believe we will be successful with the number of applications that are there right now and the progress that has been made.
