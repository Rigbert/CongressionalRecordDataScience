Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my chairman, Chairman Rangel, for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, this is a historic day. As President Kennedy said in his book ``Profiles in Courage,'' there comes a time when men must act according to the dictates of their conscience and not according to political expediency.  We have a mission. We have a mandate. We have a moral obligation to lead this Nation into a new era where health care is a right and not a privilege. Now is the time. Be on the right side of history, the right side of the sick, the right side of the vulnerable. We have been tracked down by the spirit of history. If we fail to act on health care, if we fail to do what we must do, history will not be kind to any of us.  So I say to you, my colleagues: be not afraid. Be not afraid. Be of the courage. The time is always right to do what is right. On this day, at this moment, answer the call of history, and pass health care reform, and pass it today. Pass it now for the people of this country.
