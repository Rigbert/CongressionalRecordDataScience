 We anticipate a full and robust debate on that bill, with a fair and open amendment process.  In addition, the House sent us the TRIA bill a few moments ago. That bill passed the House 416 to 5. We will look to vote on it tomorrow and send it to the President for signature as soon as possible.                          ____________________
