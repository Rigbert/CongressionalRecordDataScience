President, we have a Tax Code in America which creates incentives and rewards to companies all across the United States.  I am proposing what I call the patriot employers' tax credit. It is a tax credit for those American companies that hire Americans and keep their jobs in the United States, for companies that pay at least half of their employees $15 an hour--and we picked that number because at that wage, one doesn't qualify for the basic safety net programs--companies that provide good health insurance for their employees, good pension programs for their employees, and companies that give a preference to veterans and to those in the Reserve and National Guard who are serving overseas. I think those companies deserve our encouragement, a reward of a tax credit for patriotic employers.  I hope my colleagues will join me in standing up for the companies that stand up for America.
