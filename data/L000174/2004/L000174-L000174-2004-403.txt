President, Senator Campbell and I have worked on this for some time. I serve in the Judiciary Committee where it passed nearly unanimously. Having served in law enforcement, I know what it is like.  Our bipartisan amendment will establish national standards for law enforcement officers to carry concealed firearms so that they may respond immediately to crimes across State and other jurisdictional lines, as well as protect themselves and their families from vindictive criminals.  I look forward to the Senate approving our bipartisan amendment today to make our communities safer and to better protect law enforcement officers and their families.
