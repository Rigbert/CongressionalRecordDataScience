If we want to exact change in China, why not use our marketplace as the lever? Why go through this complicated process of giving them permanent trade status globally, knowing the kind of indentured servitude that is going on in that country? And I might add there also, particularly with women, because 80 percent of the people who are exploited in that country are women. There is forced abortion. Girls in that country do not have rights to education as women in societies that are free have.  In many ways, I also feel like I am speaking out for them, because I know they cannot speak out in their own country. Yet, this is the kind of system that we are going to hold up and say, well, we as Americans, we endorse this system. That is still a Communist system.  I find this place incredible, that we would have Members of Congress saying, believe them. Every trade agreement we have signed with them during the decade of the nineties, when we reduced, when they said that we will reduce tariffs to allow in goods, if that had happened, our trade deficit would be getting better. It is getting worse. They are earning more off of us. We are not able to get in there.
