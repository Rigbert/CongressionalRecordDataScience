m. on Tuesday. Following the cloture vote, if not invoked, the Senate will then either seek consent to set the next cloture vote at 2:30 p.m. on Tuesday or, if consent cannot be granted, the Senate would recess until 2:30 p.m. In either case, the cloture vote on the motion to proceed to fast track will occur at 2:30 p.m. on Tuesday.  I further ask unanimous consent that if the Senate is not previously in recess, the Senate stand in recess from the hour of 12:30 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. for the weekly policy luncheons of each party to meet.
