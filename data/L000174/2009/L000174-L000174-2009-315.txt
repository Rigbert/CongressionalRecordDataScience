President, Marcelle and I have gotten to know Buddy and Julie Miller over the years--especially with their friend of ours, Emmy Lou Harris. So many times when I have traveled I have listened to Buddy and Julie's music on my headphones and one of the great thrills I had was when they dedicated a song to Marcelle and me years ago at the Birchmere.  The Wall Street Journal this week wrote an excellent article about the ``first couple of Americana.'' I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Wall Street Journal, Apr. 28, 2009]Buddy and Julie Miller: First Couple of Americana Sings of Setbacks and                                 Sorrows                            (By Barry Mazor)       Nashville--By virtue of their broad musical      accomplishments, Buddy and Julie Miller have essentially      reigned since the mid-1990s as the unpretentious but royal      couple of Americana music, that lovably motley modern-roots      music genre derived from the American music traditions of      country, folk, gospel, roots rock and more. Their CDs,      whether recorded together or individually, have consistently      garnered high praise for both the songs they write for them      and for the often touching, sometimes feisty country-soul      delivery. Their long-incubating new release, ``Written In      Chalk'' (New West Records), is no different in that regard.       Songs of theirs have been recorded by everyone from country      hit makers Lee Ann Womack, Patty Loveless, the Dixie Chicks      and Dierks Bentley, to jazz great Jimmy Scott. Mr. Miller was      seen bringing his always coveted, tasteful guitar work behind      Alison Krauss and Robert Plant on this year's Grammy Awards      show, as he did throughout their recent tour of major arenas.      (Led Zeppelin veteran Mr. Plant performs a comic duet with      Mr. Miller on the     new release.) And Mr. Miller has produced records for Solomon      Burke, Jimmie Dale Gilmore and Allison Moorer.       Still, Mr. Miller, 56, and the more flamboyant Mrs. Miller,      52, are by temperament genuinely modest, and each, during      separate recent interviews, remarked on being taken aback by      the international outpouring of good wishes and concern that      followed Mr. Miller's triple-bypass surgery. He'd felt a      heart attack coming on after a Feb. 19 performance with      Emmylou Harris, Patty Griffin and Shawn Colvin in Baltimore.       ``The first month was rough; then it got better,'' Mr.      Miller noted. ``I feel like I'd been beaten with baseball      bats by a couple of the Sopranos, but I'm doing good. I've      got a free pass to rest--no dates until June.       ``You know, after the heart attack and surgery, a side      effect was that all my senses were really heightened. For a      week or so, I could smell somebody down the hall and my      hearing was really heightened. And that kind of beautiful      note that John Deaderick plays on keyboards on the record,      the kind that really hurts you, would make me start weeping      uncontrollably. It was kind of cool; I was hoping I could      hold on to part of that--although it wouldn't be so good on      stage!''       Nine of the dozen songs on ``Written In Chalk'' were      written by Mrs. Miller, and--some comic change-ups and love      songs with attitude aside--most of them concern loss or      learning to be reconciled with personal setbacks, as titles      such as ``Everytime We Say Goodbye'' and ``Hush, Sorrow''      suggest. As many fans of the Millers are generally aware,      Mrs. Miller has not been seen on stage harmonizing with Mr.      Miller or engaging in their George Burns-Gracie Allen style      badinage for the past five years. She's been sidelined by the      severely exhausting, painful condition fibromyalgia and by      the sudden loss of her brother, killed when he was struck by      lightning. Some of the new songs that seem most to reflect      that experience in particular were, in truth, composed before      the event.       ``One of the things that sort of broke me,'' Mrs. Miller      recalls, ``was that I went to Texas to be with my mother      after my brother died, and when she asked about the record      I'd been working on for half a year before that, I couldn't      remember one single thing about it, not a note. When I came      back to Nashville and found the notebook with those songs in      it, they were all so strangely prophetic that it freaked me      out.''       As a practical matter, Mr. Miller's packed schedule and      Mrs. Miller's physical restrictions made it difficult to get      this record made, delayed it, and inevitably affected the      nature of their collaboration on it. There are, for instance,      fewer outright duets on the record than on previous joint      efforts.       ``I worked on this so long, starting and stopping in      between tours,'' Mr. Miller recalls, ``that it was hard to      gain perspective on it. It started out as her record, but she      couldn't finish it, and it went back and forth. It's      difficult for Julie to start and stop; she kind of gives      everything together, everything she's got. So she would just      get started sometimes and I'd have to go back on the road,      which was really, really difficult for her--and that went on      for years.''       ``It's funny,'' Mrs. Miller says. ``We live just a few      blocks from Music Row, where people make appointments to meet      and write songs for three hours. But I have to get totally      lost in my soul and go oblivious to time and space and      surroundings--and Buddy's the only person I can do that with.      But he's been so busy and structured, and me so completely      not. Unless I'm pressured, it's like I have my own radio      station going that I can just tune into for songs; it's like      whoever is doing the songwriting in me is playing, and three      or four years old. Once you let them know they have to do it,      they can't handle it.''       It's more than a little surprising, but Mrs. Miller has not      actually heard the released ``Written In Chalk'' CD. ``Is      that ridiculous?'' she asked. ``I never listen to anything      I'm on after it's recorded, because I'm always tormented;      I'll wish there was something I hadn't done.'' With the      record overdue, Mr. Miller finished mixing the recordings in      their state-of-the-art home-based studio, as he would most of      the time--but to speed getting the job done at last, he did      it with headphones on, so Mrs. Miller couldn't hear the sonic      calls he was making, a source, they both admit, of some      tension.       Mrs. Miller, however, characterizes her husband as ``one of      the all-time great singers in the universe, with a unique      sound--strong yet feeling very deeply, and emotionally      vulnerable.'' And Mr. Miller says that the songs his wife      writes ``are unique, not contrived; they come from such a      pure place. She never writes anything that hasn't come from      somebody's experience that's affected her. There's a place of      innocence and depth at the same time that really gets me.''       Mr. Miller hopes, he says, that the many songs his wife has      backed up and stored will still yield an outright Julie      Miller album sometime soon, but that's far from a foregone      conclusion. He, meanwhile, is already booked to finish      producing a gospel CD for Patty Griffin, to return as musical      director of the Fall Americana Music Awards, and then to get      to work on a record project with the jazz- and country-     influenced Bill Frisell and Marc Ribot.       Whatever (and whenever) the musical outcomes, the Millers      can be sure that there's an audience waiting expectantly--     with considerable love.                          ____________________
