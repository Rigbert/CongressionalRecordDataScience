 President, responding to the Senator from Nevada and going back to his efforts of last Wednesday before we adjourned for the national Veterans Day holiday, I can say that on that day as well as other periods of time over the weekend, and even as late as yesterday, between his efforts working with me and the efforts of our respective staffs, I have found the Senator from Nevada very cooperative. As a result of his cooperation, what we thought was an impossible amount of amendments to work our way through to bring this bill to finality has been dramatically reduced. The Senator needs to be credited with that extra effort.  I encourage Members on my side of the aisle to reach agreement. There may be one or two items that are above my pay grade, maybe even above the pay grade of the Senator from Nevada, that will have to be decided by leadership, but except for those items, we are making tremendous progress. I want to work in that direction, and I assure the Senator from Nevada of my efforts in that direction.
