President, when the predecessor to this bill was introduced in the last Congress, I raised a number of concerns about the bill. I am glad to see that this amendment is much improved from the Hatch-Feinstein gang bill in the last Congress.  This amendment also contains proposals that Senator DeWine and I have worked on together. For example, this amendment contains new procedures for law enforcement to obtain clone pagers. These are pagers held by law enforcement that duplicate the numeric messages received by a drug dealer or other criminal. This is a useful tool for law enforcement and I have long worked to streamline the procedures for the FBI, the DEA and other law enforcement agencies to obtain legal authorization to use clone pagers.  For including this clone pager proposal in the amendment, along with the other improvements made by the sponsors, they should be commended. I know they worked hard on this amendment.  I remain concerned about some of the penalties in this amendment. The amendment calls for a new death penalty and new mandatory minimums that should be revised in conference.
