 President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today it stand in adjournment until the hour of 12 noon on Monday, September 29. I further ask that on Monday, immediately following the prayer, the routine requests through the morning hour be granted and the Senate immediately resume S. 25, the campaign finance reform bill.
