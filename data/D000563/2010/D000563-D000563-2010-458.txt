President, there will be no rollcall votes during Monday's session of the Senate. Senators should expect the next vote to occur at approximately 2:30 p.m. on Tuesday, July 20. That vote will be on the motion to invoke cloture with respect to H.R. 4213, which extends unemployment benefits through November.                          ____________________
