Mr. Speaker, today marks the midway point in Newt Gingrich's Contract With America. It is an extremist document which sets back the clock. It is a contract which rewards the wealthy at the expense of our children, our senior citizens, the poor and hard working class Americans. Let's look back over the past 50 days and review what this band of extremists has done.  The new majority has reduced the number of police that were to patrol our city streets through their crime bill--this is their Contract With America. They have proposed denying food to hungry school children through elimination of the School Lunch Program--this is their Contract With America. The Republican majority has passed a bill which will make it more difficult to protect our air and keep our water clean. They would cut nutrition programs for our senior citizens--these, too, are the Contract With America. The Republicans seek to gut the Corporation for Public Broadcasting which through its PBS stations provides educational television for us and our children--this is the Contract With America. And the Republicans have vowed ``to fight with all their being'' a small increase in the minimum wage, a wage which provides those who receive it a living standard 30% below the poverty level--alas, this also is the Contract With America.  And the new, extreme, Republicans have done all this while advocating tax cuts for the top 1% of Americans. This, my friends, all of this, is their Contract With America.  Of course, not everything they have done these 50 days has been bad. The Congress did pass the Congressional Accountability Act which makes the Congress live by the same Labor and Civil Rights laws as those in the private sector. Of course, the last Congress, the Democratic Congress, passed the same bill with more than 400 votes.  Mr. Speaker, if these are the accomplishments of the Republican Congress, if this is what they've done to us in the first 50 days, imagine what they'll do to us in the next 50 days and in the next two years.  We need a government that is leaner, not a government that is meaner. We need a federal government that is less bureaucratic, not one that is less compassionate.  Newt Gingrich and his Republican colleagues have gone too far. In their rush to the right, they have forgotten not just those on the left, but those in [[Page H2031]]  the middle. The vast majority of Americans not only want our government to be smaller, they want it to work better. They want a government that protects our children and looks out for our senior citizens. They want to insure that the air we breath and the water we drink are pure and clean. They want their neighborhoods to be safe and their kids to be able to go to college. They want to earn a decent wage and be able to save a little money at the end of each month. All of these things, Mr. Speaker, all of these are what the American people want. The Republican Contract With America does none of them.  The American people deserve better than this extreme Contract With America. And the time has come that we not just pray and we not just speak. The time has come for action. I did not sign this contract. The American people did not sign this contract. The time for action is now.                          ____________________
