President, before he leaves the floor, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts, both for his focus on bipartisanship with respect to the overall package and for his very thoughtful comments about the assisted suicide issue. I think he has summed it up very well.  I feel bad that I had to object to consideration of the tax legislation this morning. I will take just a minute or two to describe why and then go on to talk about the overall issue as it relates to pain relief and what is in the tax bill.  I know it is an inconvenience to a number of Senators to have me talk about this subject at length. This is an important time in the year for colleagues. I regret the inconvenience. But I believe what is in the tax bill is going to cause so much pain and suffering to families all across the country, that the interests of those families who are going to suffer if this tax bill as written becomes law have to come first.  First and foremost, I want the Senate to understand that before we are done, I am going to speak at length about exactly what the consequences will be for families all across this country, who needlessly are going to suffer great pain that could be averted, if the bill becomes law as written.  In addition, while the majority leadership in the Congress is attempting to throw Oregon's vote on assisted suicide into the trash can, Oregonians are holding on to ballots such as this one. They are wondering if this ballot, this sacred vote, really counts.
