I ask the Senator a second question. Would he not want to make an exception, as well, for the rescue of the NATO forces in Yugoslavia if we would perhaps have a downed flier and ground troops could be sent in for rescue, and that would not require congressional authorization. I think that would be consistent with the Senator's earlier statements about the emergency authority of the President as Commander in Chief.
