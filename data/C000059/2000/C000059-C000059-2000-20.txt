 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5398, legislation which will allow the Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana to sell, lease, or otherwise transfer its interest in any real property which is not held in trust by the United States. This bill is necessary because Federal law limits a tribe's authority to sell land which it owns, even though that land is not held in trust.  I urge support for this bill.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
