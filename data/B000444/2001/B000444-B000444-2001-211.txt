  Let me back up. If I can say to my friend from Tennessee, the language in the McCain-Feingold bill on page 15 says:       In General.--The term ``electioneering communication''      means any broadcast, cable, or satellite communication      which--[subsection] (i) refers to a clearly identified      candidate for elective office[.]  Is the interpretation of those who put that language in that it must mention the candidate by name?
