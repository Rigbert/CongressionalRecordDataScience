 President, as chairman of the Joint Committee on the Library, I want to take this opportunity to recognize the symbolic handover of the historic 1507 Martin Waldseemiller Map from German Chancellor Angela Merkel to the American people. This event took place Monday at the Library of Congress.  The map is often referred to as ``America's birth certificate.'' It was designed and printed by Martin Waldseemiller, a 16th century scholar and cartographer who worked in France. This mapmaker departed from accepted knowledge of the world at that time. He portrayed, in remarkably accurate fashion, the Western Hemisphere separating two huge and separate bodies of water, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.  There were 1,000 copies of the map printed from woodcuts, but only a single surviving copy exists today. The Library of Congress worked for decades to acquire this map from its owners. The map was housed for more than 350 years in the 16th century castle belonging to the family of Prince Johannes Waldburg-Wolfegg in southern Germany. The map was long thought lost, but it was rediscovered in storage in the castle in 1901.  In 1992, knowing of the Library's great interest in acquiring the map, Prince Waldburg-Wolfegg notified the Library that the German national government and the Baden-Wurttemberg state government had granted an export license. This license permitted the map, which is considered a German national treasure, to come to the Library of Congress.  The purchase of the map was accomplished through a combination of appropriated funds and matching private funds. Congress has played an important role in making this acquisition possible, as it has throughout the Library's history. Congress's first major purchase was Thomas Jefferson's library, which is the seed of the vast collections the Library holds today. Another once-in-a-lifetime purchase made possible by congressional support is the Gutenberg Bible, which is on display in the Jefferson Building.  The Library will begin displaying the map to the public in the Thomas Jefferson Building later this year. The map will be part of the Library's new visitor's experience. As an important acquisition to the Library's treasures, the map will be on view for limited periods of time as preservation standards permit.                          ____________________
