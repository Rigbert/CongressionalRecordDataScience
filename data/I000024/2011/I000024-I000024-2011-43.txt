President, I asked for unanimous consent to be recognized following the remarks by the Senator from Tennessee. It has been called to my attention that the Senator from Virginia would like to have the floor at this time, so I renew my unanimous consent request that I be recognized at the conclusion of the remarks of the Senator from Virginia.
