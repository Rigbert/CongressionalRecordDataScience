Chair, America is on the verge of becoming an energy superpower. Not only do we possess more energy than any other country, but we are capable of using that energy to accomplish great things.  Perhaps most important of all to manufacturing states like Michigan, we can use our energy advantage to reverse the gradual decline in American manufacturing that has been going on for decades and create a real resurgence in the years ahead. The Promoting New Manufacturing Act will help us achieve that goal and continues our efforts to build the Architecture of Abundance.  The U.S. has all the ingredients to strengthen our domestic manufacturing dominance. We have the affordable energy supply to run our factories, especially our growing abundance of natural gas. We have private investors willing to invest billions of dollars on new projects in America. We have a workforce that is second to none but many of whom need jobs. And we have the technical knowledge to build manufacturing facilities that are the cleanest and most efficient in the world. All we need is a regulatory process that will allow it to happen.  We all know about Keystone XL, which despite our best efforts, is still caught up in red tape. I wish I could say that bureaucratic nightmare is an isolated incident, but sadly, it isn't. Potential future manufacturing facilities face a similar regulatory maze that can delay projects for years on end or stop them outright.  We want to be a world leader in manufacturing, not in red tape. I am glad the President identified the potential of new American manufacturing in his State of the Union address, and acknowledged that there is red tape that needs to be cleared away. Passage of H.R. 4795 will help make this goal a reality.  The Promoting New Manufacturing Act is a good starting point. We know changes to National Ambient Air Quality Standards are on the horizon, which will ultimately have an impact on how much of this manufacturing renaissance we can actually get permitted into existence. This bill takes some very sensible steps toward a more transparent and timely process for air permits under EPA's New Source Review program. It increases transparency by making more information publicly available on these permit applications, and gives the states and permit applicants the critical information they need to ensure that when it comes to air quality standards, future implementation rules and guidance documents are developed, proposed, and finalized in a timely manner.  I hope that we can all agree that the current regulatory process leaves room for improvement. I urge my colleagues to support our pending manufacturing renaissance and to support this constructive legislation.  The CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired.  Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment under the 5-minute rule. The bill shall be considered as read.  The text of the bill is as follows:                               H.R. 4795       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
