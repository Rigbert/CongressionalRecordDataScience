Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time.  I see that Sue Quantius is back. As I said, the chairman and I have been on this subcommittee I think just about the same time. I think he has been on maybe a session before me. Sue Quantius, I am not sure how long Sue has been with us, but I know she worked on the Senate side.  I mentioned the health care of our people, and I know it is a particular interest of the chairman, and our expert on the committee is Sue Quantius. She has done an outstanding job; she is one of the most knowledgeable people in Washington on health care issues and particularly on NIH funding and NIH resources, objectives, and responsibilities. I want to rise, as I know the chairman has, and as I know the gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. Obey] has, in thanking her for the service that she has given.  The American public and this House ought to be very proud of the staff of the Committee on Appropriations. It is arguably the most bipartisan, nonpartisan staff on Capitol Hill. To the great credit of the gentleman from Louisiana [Mr. Livingston], our chairman, when he became chairman, most of the staff stayed because we all on both sides of the aisle perceive them as very true professionals who know their subject, who work hard, have great talent and great commitment to the product of this committee and to this country.  Sue, on behalf of myself and all of us on this side of the aisle, and I know the gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. Obey] has already done that, and I know our present chairman in office has done that, but I want to join them and say thank you and to wish you Godspeed. Your next endeavor, your next employer is a very fortunate entity indeed. Thank you very much.
