President, I again want to thank my colleague from North Dakota for her very eloquent plea to our colleagues.  I know we can do this. I know we can find a path forward. I know we can get a sufficient number of votes so that we can proceed and debate the many amendments that have been filed on this bill. I know we can do it. The victims of this horrific crime deserve no less from the United States Senate, so let's not fail them. Let's not fail them.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
