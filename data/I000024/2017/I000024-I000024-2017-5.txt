President, as to my very good friend from Virginia--and he is a very good friend--I think he needs to reread this bill.  Now, I am older than he is and most of the people around here, but I do remember the Reagan tax cuts. This is a Reagan tax cut.  I listened to the other side and a lot of the liberals on the other side, because there is a difference between Democrats and Republicans, and we understand that. But they come out and say: Oh, it is always class warfare. It is always that they are doing this for the rich. The rich are going to get richer. Well, that is not the way this worked out.  There is a group called the National Tax Foundation. The National Tax Foundation did an analysis of this, and they did it State by State. In my State of Oklahoma, the average family of four will get an increase in their take-home pay of $2,000. Now, where does it come from? There is the standard deduction, for example. The Senator talked about this being for the rich. This isn't for the rich. The standard deduction actually goes from $6,000 to $12,000. If you are married, it is from $12,000 to $24,000.  There is the child tax credit. We are all concerned about the child tax credit. Several Republicans wanted to do even more than that. Right now, as the law is, it is $1,000, but it is going to be increased after this is over, after we vote. After we have a major tax reduction, that child tax credit will go from $1,000 to $2,000 per child. That is a huge thing. That is not for the wealthy.  I listen sometimes when they talk about how this is going to increase the deficit. I have to tell you, though, that I remember very well. In fact, I remember so well. I have given speeches over time. Reagan reduced taxes twice. One was in 1981 and one in 1986. In 1986 and 1981, the total amount of revenue that came into the Federal Government was $469 billion. He had a huge reduction in rates. Yes, the top rate went down from 70 percent to 50 percent, then the others went down in accordance with a similar percentage.  Now, what happened to that was that, while the total amount that came in before the tax cuts was $469 billion, afterward, it was $750 billion. The same thing happened in 1986. In 1986, the total revenue that came into the Federal Government was $569 billion. At the end of that period of 10 years that they were measuring, it was $1 trillion.  Now, the problem is, the other side is always saying that our deficits increased during that time period. Yes, they did, but I have to say this: It was not because of Ronald Reagan, it was because the House and the Senate were run by liberal Democrats, and as fast as the increase in revenue came in, they were spending not just the increase but even more.  So that is one of the differences now. I anticipate that we are going to have a conservative House and Senate for the years to come, and we will just have to wait and see what is right.  I do agree with my friend from Virginia, though, in one respect; that is, he and I both had the hardest job in the world. You never know what a hard job is until you are mayor of a major city. There is no hiding place, and if they don't like the trash, it ends up in your front yard.                          ____________________
