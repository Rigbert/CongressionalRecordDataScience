That was the chant we heard across the United States from the Republican side of the aisle during the last Presidential campaign. The notion was that if we just started drilling in every direction, we could solve America's energy problems. It was an irresponsible chant, failing to address the most fundamental issue of our time: the future of America's national energy picture.  What you heard this morning from the Republican leader is a return to the subject but ignoring the past. What we know is this: We know we have become more and more dependent on foreign oil. It costs us, as a Nation, $1 billion a day that we are sending overseas to other countries to buy their oil to sustain our economy. This dependence, unfortunately, leads to commitments we have to make--military commitments, political commitments, economic commitments--because of this dependence on foreign oil.  The second reality is this: We understand there is a new, emerging energy technology in the 21st century. It is an energy technology based on efficiency, economy, and the reduction of costs. There are other countries in the world that are taking the lead in this area, not the least of which is the nation of China.  I recently heard from Michael Bennet of Colorado, who spoke to us at a Democratic Senate luncheon. He came up with a statistic which in many ways is hard to believe but equally scary, and here is what it is: The largest export of the United States of America of any product is in the aircraft industry. Look at Boeing. Look at all of the aircraft we are exporting around the world. It is our major export. Yet if you compare our major export to the export by China--by China--of energy technology to the world, they are now at 50 percent of the value of our annual aircraft exports. China has decided that the future of the world is based on new, clean energy technology, and they are doing something about it. They don't come to their leadership and squabble, at least not in a public fashion; they get focused--focused on creating businesses and jobs and being ready to compete in the 21st century.  The third premise of our energy policy goes to something on which the Senator from Kentucky may or may not agree with me. I happen to believe the activities of humans on this Earth make a difference when it comes to the planet. I happen to believe when we look at glacial melt around the world, it reflects the fact that the world is changing. Ever so gradually, it is getting warmer. As the Earth increases its temperature, it changes weather patterns, the currents of the oceans, the land we live on, the crops we grow, and our future. Some people don't accept that. Some don't see a connection. They don't believe any of the carbon released into the atmosphere creates a problem. I have met many of them. Some are people who in good faith don't come to the same conclusion I reach. I respect them, but I respectfully think they are wrong.  What have we learned from the gulf crisis? We have learned a lot. Yesterday I had one of the vice presidents of BP America in my office. I talked to him about how we have reached this point. I said: When we have reached the point where we are drilling deep, going after the tough, deep oil to fuel our economy and its needs, we are engendering more problems and more challenges than before. Had there been a spill of oil in downstate Illinois or in Alaska or Texas, it would have been terrible, but it could have been contained much more quickly than this gusher of oil coming from the floor of the Gulf of Mexico. As we explore in new areas, tougher, more challenging areas, we run greater risk. That is a reality.  I take exception to the remarks of the Senator from Kentucky who suggested this administration is not doing everything in its power to deal with this spill in the gulf. Let's look at what we have done. This President called in BP and made it clear that the cost of this damage will be borne by that oil company, not by the taxpayers. I was pleasantly surprised when the Governor of Mississippi, Haley Barbour, a man who in the past was as passionate in his beliefs as I am in my Democratic beliefs, came out and praised President Obama for sitting down with BP and getting a commitment of $20 billion in a fund to deal with the economic losses associated with this spill. BP has bought commercials that most of us have seen saying: We will pay for this, all of it. I don't know if the Senator from Kentucky thinks that is unimportant. I believe it is important.  Secondly, I am as troubled by the continuing spill as anyone. I know the President feels that has to end and end immediately. But as the Senator from Kentucky knows, we don't have a U.S. department of deep sea drilling. It doesn't exist. What we are relying on is the private sector's capacity, technology, equipment, and expertise to find a way to cope with this problem. I am as frustrated as any American that on day 75 of this spill, it has not come to an end. But it continues. The President focuses on this every day, as does his Cabinet.  Yesterday we had a meeting with Interior Secretary Ken Salazar. The man has spent day after weary day devoting himself completely to this. Carol Browner, an environmental assistant in the White House, was there talking about the massive commitment which we have made. She was asked pointblank: Are you providing the booms, the things they spread out in the water to stop the flow and spread of this oil, are you supplying all of the booms requested by all of the States in the Gulf of Mexico?  She said: We are supplying not only 100 percent of their requests but over 100 percent of their requests, and we are going to continue to manufacture and secure this boom to protect our shoreline. She said: Of course, we haven't done everything right, but when we see a problem, we move on it quickly to try to solve it.  We are talking about the commitment of thousands of vessels to skim the surface of the gulf and to try to salvage as much of this oil as possible. It is a massive national commitment by our government, by the private sector. The suggestion of the Senator from Kentucky that the President is not focused on it is not accurate nor fair.  I believe we need to focus on energy. We need to be honest about the future when it comes to energy. If we accept the premise that we will continue to be dependent on foreign oil indefinitely, that we will spend a billion dollars a day, sending it to many countries which not only disagree with us in terms of our values but turn around and spend our dollars against us to foster and to be patrons to terrorism, if we accept that, then we will do nothing about a national energy policy. If we accept the premise that we should do nothing about clean energy technology and all the potential for business and jobs it creates, that America is going to take a back seat to China and other countries, then we will do nothing about the national energy policy. If we accept the premise that there is no global warming and we should not lose a moment's sleep worrying about it, then we will do nothing about a national energy policy.  That is what we hear from the other side of the aisle, do nothing, say no. Over and over throughout this congressional session, the response of Senate Republicans has been say no. When we tackled the tough and controversial issue of containing health care costs, runaway costs that are affecting every business, every family and every level of government, Republicans said: No, we will not engage. We will not be part of that conversation.  When we went after Wall Street reform and said: After this recession, we have learned lessons; we will not allow these titans on Wall Street to repeat their mistakes and kill more jobs in the future, all but four Republicans said: No, we are not interested in that conversation. We don't want to be part of that effort.  Now we find again, in one of the most telling and important issues of the moment, unemployment compensation for the hundreds of thousands of Americans out of work, Republicans have said, no, we will not lend a helping hand to the people of America out of work.  I look at the numbers of those who are unemployed across the country, who will lose their benefits because Republicans continue to say no. I look at States such as Kentucky, the home State of the Republican leader, where 22,600 Kentucky families had their unemployment cut off because Senator McConnell and his colleagues voted no when it came to extending unemployment benefits. In my State of Illinois, 80,000 families had their unemployment cut off this month because Republicans said no. One of my friends who is a woman out of work, with a family, called me over the weekend at home. We keep in touch. She said: Let me tell you, Senator, what it means. They are cutting off the utilities. I don't know what to do. Three kids in the house and a grandson, and they are cutting off my utilities.  That is the real world of the real votes cast by the other side of the aisle.  This morning the New York Times had an editorial which I want to make reference to. I ask unanimous consent that this editorial be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, June 30, 2010]                   Who Will Fight for the Unemployed?       Without doubt, the two biggest threats to the economy are      unemployment and the dire financial condition of the states,      yet lawmakers have failed to deal intelligently with either      one.       Federal unemployment benefits began to expire nearly a      month ago. Since then, 1.2 million jobless workers have been      cut off. The House passed a six-month extension as part of a      broader spending bill in May, but the Senate, despite three      attempts, has not been able to pass a similar bill. The      majority leader, Harry Reid, said he was ready to give up      after the third try last week when all of the Senate's      Republicans and a lone Democrat, Ben Nelson of Nebraska,      blocked the bill.       Meanwhile, the states face a collective budget hole of some      $112 billion, but neither the House nor the Senate has a plan      to help. The House stripped a provision for $24 billion in      state fiscal aid from its earlier spending bill. The Senate      included state aid in its ill-fated bill to extend      unemployment benefits; when that bill failed, the promise of      aid vanished as well.       As a result, 30 states that had counted on the money to      help balance their budgets will be forced to raise taxes even      higher and to cut spending even deeper in the budget year      that begins on July 1. That will only worsen unemployment,      both among government workers and the states' private      contractors. Worsening unemployment means slower growth, or      worse, renewed recession.       So if lawmakers are wondering why consumer confidence and      the stock market are tanking (the Standard & Poor's 500-stock      index hit a new low for the year on Tuesday), they need look      no further than a mirror.       The situation cries out for policies to support economic      growth--specifically jobless benefits and fiscal aid to      states. But instead of delivering, Congressional Republicans      and many Democrats have been asserting that the nation must      act instead to cut the deficit. The debate has little to do      with economic reality and everything to do with political      posturing. A lot of lawmakers have concluded that the best      way to keep their jobs is to pander to the nation's new      populist mood and play off the fears of the very Americans      whose economic well-being Congress is threatening.       Deficits matter, but not more than economic recovery, and      not more urgently than the economic survival of millions of      Americans. A sane approach would couple near-term federal      spending with a credible plan for deficit reduction--a mix of      tax increases     and spending cuts--as the economic recovery takes hold.       But today's deficit hawks--many of whom eagerly      participated in digging the deficit ever deeper during the      George W. Bush years--are not interested in the sane      approach. In the Senate, even as they blocked the extension      of unemployment benefits, they succeeded in preserving a tax      loophole that benefits wealthy money managers at private      equity firms and other investment partnerships. They also      derailed an effort to end widespread tax avoidance by owners      of small businesses organized as S-corporations. If they are      really so worried about the deficit, why balk at these      evidently sensible ways to close tax loopholes and end tax      avoidance?       House lawmakers made an effort on Tuesday to extend jobless      benefits but failed to get the necessary votes, and it      remains uncertain if an extension can pass both the House and      Senate before Congress leaves town on Friday for a weeklong      break. What's needed, and what's lacking, is leadership, both      in Congress and from the White House, to set the terms of the      debate--jobs before deficit reduction--and to fight for those      terms, with failure not an option.
