President, just before he leaves the floor, let me tell Senator Sessions how much I appreciate the kind words and enjoy working with him. We serve on the Budget Committee together and talk often about economic issues. I wish to tell my colleague that I look forward to working with him on tax and budget issues in the days ahead especially.                           Amendment No. 626  Mr. President, what I would like to do now is take just a couple minutes to talk about the amendment offered by the distinguished Republican leader, Senator McConnell, to extend trade promotion authority--what is known as TPA--for 2 years.  I am certainly interested in working with the leader. Certainly, Chairman Baucus has made it very clear that he wants to continue to work on this issue. But I would oppose the McConnell amendment this afternoon, and I want to outline specifically why.
