Mr. Speaker, today I have introduced legislation that will assist disabled veterans who were exposed to extremely cold weather conditions for prolonged periods of time while defending our nation during World War II and the Korean war, and more recently while serving in the peacekeeping mission in Bosnia. In fact, Mr. Speaker, veterans of the Battle of the Chosin Reservoir in Korea are recognized as having suffered especially high rates of severe cold injuries.  In many instances, service members did not seek or were unable to obtain medical care after cold injuries because of battlefield conditions, which impeded the ability of veterans to acquire supporting documentation, such as buddy letters, which are often used to support claims to the Veterans Administration. For too long, our Government has failed to recognize the severity of the injuries suffered by these veterans, and this legislation will help to right that wrong.  Mr. Speaker, my bill instructs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to create and maintain a registry of veterans exposed to extremely cold weather for a great length of time. It will use that information to analyze all clinical data obtained by the Department of Veterans Affairs in connection with exams and treatment given to veterans that may help in determining what kind of association there is between the disability and the cold weather. In addition, if a veteran suffers from a cold weather injury after serving in a war or battle that was fought in prolonged, extreme weather circumstances, it would be presumed--for the purpose of disability benefits--that the injury was caused by the severe weather.  Veterans from all over New Jersey, and the Nation, have been requesting that we provide a simplified process of recognizing and identifying this service-connected affliction, which has been ignored for far too long. We have the moral obligation and duty to ensure that our veterans are cared for when injuries and disabilities result from war and service to our country.  Mr. Speaker, I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Larry St. Laurent, director, and John Dorrity, assistant director, of the Ocean County Veterans Service Bureau, for their hard work and assistance in writing the Veterans Cold Weather Injury Compensation Act.  I would urge all of my colleagues to please consider supporting this bill.                          ____________________
