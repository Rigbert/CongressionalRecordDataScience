 President, as you know, I have very strong reservations about the exports of Alaskan North Slope oil. I am concerned about jobs in my State, the price of oil to consumers across our Nation, and the environmental impact lifting this ban may produce. However, after a day of negotiation, I am pleased to offer several amendments en bloc to the bill that the chairman has agreed to. These en bloc amendments will ensure a full review of export impacts.  They mandate that the President, along with the Attorney General and the Department of Commerce, will review environmental impacts, consumer price increases, and anticompetitive practices that would hurt independent refineries and shipyards who employ thousands in my region.  I believe we have come far to negotiate this agreement that now speaks first for the people of the Pacific Northwest before the exporting of this oil begins.  I thank the chairman for his work in moving toward this amendment.
