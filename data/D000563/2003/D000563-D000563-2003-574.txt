President, I rise in praise of yesterday's Supreme Court decision in the Michigan case--the most important affirmative action case in a generation. I along with 11 of my colleagues--Senators Daschle, Kennedy, Clinton, Corzine, Edwards, Feingold, Kerry, Landrieu, Lautenberg, Schumer, and Stabenow--filed an amicus brief in support of the university's affirmative action programs.  I am disappointed that the Court struck down the undergraduate admissions program, but I believe that the opinion upholding the law school program represents a significant victory for affirmative action and for America.  The Court's decision reaffirms the compelling interest in racial and ethnic diversity--universities may continue to include race as one factor among many when selecting its students. Diversity programs promote the integration and full participation of all groups in our society. The core holding of Grutter v. Bollinger, the law school case, and Gratz v. Bollinger, the undergraduate case, boils down to this: universities must look at each applicant individually.  Michigan Law School's program was upheld because the law school performs an individualized consideration of every applicant. Race is considered, but not in a mechanical manner. The University of Michigan's undergraduate program was struck down because the Court said its point system was too rigid and too mechanical. The bottom line is that university affirmative action--when done right--is alive and well in America. Not surprisingly, the law school opinion was 5-4 and, not surprisingly, Justice O'Connor was the swing vote. She has been the crucial swing vote in so many important Supreme Court cases over the past 20 years that she is now routinely referred to as ``the most powerful jurist in America,'' and indeed, as ``the most powerful woman in America.'' Both descriptions may well be true.  I would like to briefly discuss what I think are the three most important aspects of yesterday's decision.  First, the Court set out a clear roadmap for affirmative action. The question is no longer whether race can be used to further diversity, but how it can be used. The majority of universities are already practicing affirmative action the right way. As discussed in today's Washington Post, most universities currently have admissions programs that are similar to Michigan Law School's. And for those that don't, a quick fix would be to go out and hire more admissions officers. Many universities have large endowments, so I am confident they have the ability to hire a few more staff. As a result, they will be able to conduct the flexible, individualized analysis that the Court now demands.  I personally agree with Justice Souter's dissent in the undergraduate case--their point system is a far cry from the quota system that was struck down in Bakke. Underrepresented minorities automatically get 20 points out of a possible 150, but so do athletes, low-income applicants, and those who attended disadvantaged high schools. To me, this type of point system does not seem unconstitutional.  But in any event, universities now have clear guidance. I think Justice Scalia will be proven wrong in his dire prediction that the Michigan decisions will lead to an avalanche of new affirmative action litigation.  Another important aspect of yesterday's decision is that it recognizes the value of diversity not only on campus, but for other critical areas of our society as well. Eliminating affirmative action in universities would have harmful ripple effects for the nation.  For universities, the Court noted that ``classroom discussion is livelier, more spirited, and simply more enlightening and interesting'' when the students have ``the greatest possible variety of backgrounds.''  For society at large, diversity has even more tangible benefits. Citing to an amicus brief filed by a large number of Fortune 500 companies, Justice O'Connor wrote that ``American businesses have made clear that the skills needed in today's increasingly global marketplace can only be developed through exposure to widely diverse people, cultures, ideas, and viewpoints.''  Referencing an amicus brief filed by dozens of retired U.S. military leaders--including Generals Norman Schwarzkopf, John Shalikashvili, Hugh Shelton, Anthony Zinni, and Wesley Clark--the Court wrote that ``high-ranking retired officers and civilian leaders of the United States military assert that, `based on their decades of experience,' a `highly qualified, racially diverse officer corps . . . is essential to the military's ability to fulfill its principle mission to provide national security' ''.  In addition, the Court brought the issue of diversity close to home. Noting that law schools represent ``the training ground or a large number of our Nation's leaders,'' the Court observed that individuals with law degrees occupy more than half the seats in the United States Senate (59), a third of the seats in the House of Representatives (161), and roughly half the state governorships.  A third important aspect of yesterday's decision is the rejection of the Bush Administration's position that both Michigan programs were unconstitutional and should be struck down. It gives you an idea of how conservative the Bush Administration is. Even this Supreme Court--in which 7 of 9 members were appointed by Republican Presidents--rejected its arguments.  Contrary to the misleading assertions of President Bush and other opponents of affirmative action, the Court held that Michigan Law School's policy of seeking a ``critical mass'' of minority students did not as a de facto quota.  Between 1993 and 2000, the number of African Americans, Native Americans, and Latinos in each class varied from 13% to 20%. As the Court noted, diminishing stereotypes about ``minority viewpoints'' is ``a crucial part of the Law School's mission, and one that it cannot accomplish with only token numbers of minority students.''  The Court also rejected the Bush Administration's position that you could attain diversity through race-neutral means, such as the ``percentage plans'' in Texas, Florida, and California, which guarantee admission to all student about a certain class-rank threshold in every high school in the state.  The Court rejected this argument for two main reasons: 1, percentage plans don't work for graduate and professional schools, and 2, they are, ironically, even more mechanical and inflexible than the Michigan undergraduate program.  The Court shot down another central argument of the Bush Administration--that affirmative action programs were invalid unless they had a definitive end date. As Justice O'Connor observed: ``It has been 25 years since Justice Powell first approved the use of race to further an interest in student body diversity in the context of public higher education. Since that time, the number of minority applicants with high grades and test scores has indeed increased. We expect that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today.''  I hope that Justice O'Connor is right.  The Michigan case is yet another reminder of the fragile balance on the Supreme Court, and how high the stakes will be if a Justice retires.  If there were a switch of a single Justice in yesterday's case, things would be dramatically different today. If there had been a fifth vote to end race-conscious affirmative action in America's universities, we would face a sudden reduction in minority students on our Nation's college campuses, especially at the elite ones.  The dean of Georgetown Law School--my alma mater--speculated yesterday that if the decision had gone the other way, Georgetown's minority enrollment would have been cut in half.  America cannot afford to turn back the clock on opportunity for all of our citzens and--by a 5-4 margin--the Supreme Court agrees.                          ____________________
