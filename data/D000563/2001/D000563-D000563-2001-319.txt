President, I am introducing a bill today, along with Senator DeWine and Senator Feingold, to cut off the source of income that is fueling horrendous conflicts in Sierra Leone, Angola, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, the illicit trade in conflict diamonds.  The brutal wars in these African Nations may be thousands of miles away, but the source of the funds that buy the weapons may be as close as your ring finger. Our legislation says, if you can't prove to U.S. Customs agents that your diamonds are legitimate, take your business and your diamonds somewhere else.  I am pleased that the diamond industry and the human rights community are united in their support for this bill. They met many times with our staffs to work out a compromise that everyone is enthusiastically supporting.  We can and must do more than look with horror at the pictures of children with missing hands, arms or legs. We must take a strong stand that says to the world that this nation, which purchases 65 percent of the world's diamonds, will not buy the diamonds that fund rebels and terrorists.  American consumers who purchase diamonds for some happy milestone in their lives, like an engagement, wedding, or anniversary, must be assured that they are buying a diamond from a legitimate, legal, and responsible source.  Setting up a system that would allow American consumers to have confidence that they are buying ``clean'' diamonds would also serve our local jewelers and diamond retailers.  It is hard to imagine today that diamonds could become unfashionable, but if consumers associate diamonds with guerrillas who hack off the arms of children, instead of the joyous life events that are now associated with the gemstones, the diamond industry in our country could suffer a sharp decline.  The jewelers in our local malls and downtown shops do not want to support rebels and terrorists in Africa any more than consumers do. This legislation aims to protect our local merchants, as well as cut off funds to African rebels.  I heard from a jeweler in my hometown of Springfield, Illinois, Bruce Lauer, President of the Illinois Jewelers Association, who wrote:       The use of diamond profits to fund warfare and atrocities      in parts of Africa is abhorrent to all of us. The system      created by your bill to bar U.S. imports of conflict stones      will allow retail jewelers to be confident that the diamonds      and diamond jewelry they sell have no part in the violence      and suffering that are prevalent in Sierra Leone, Angola, or      other conflict areas.       As the owner of Stout & Lauer Jewelers in Springfield, I      know first hand the importance of diamonds to my customers. A      diamond is a very special purchase symbolizing love,      commitment and joy. It should not be tarnished with doubt. .      ..We want to be able to assure our customers unequivocally      that the diamonds in our stores come from legitimate sources.  What carnage are these conflicts in Africa causing? The photos of maimed and mutilated men, women, and children in Sierra Leone are the most visible results of the terror tactics by the Revolutionary United Front, RUF. This rebel group has also used murder and rape, pressed children into becoming soldiers, and caused a mass movements of refugees as people flee the terror. The Congressional Research Service has released some conflict-related statistics for the Sierra Leone, Angola, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. I would like to repeat some of them for the Record: Out of a population of more than 5 million people, there are approximately 490,000 refugees from Sierra Leone in neighboring countries and anywhere from 500,000 to 1.3 million internally displaced people. Estimates of the numbers of people who have died in the conflict range from 20,000 to 50,000. More than 5,000 children have fought in direct combat roles, with 5,000 more used in supporting roles. There are no figures on how many people lost limbs or were otherwise mutilated, but World Vision reports that there are 2,000 amputees in just one camp in Freetown.  In the long conflicts in Angola and Democratic Republic of Congo, DRC, diamonds have been a contributing factor. The United Nations recently issued a report showing that the conflict in the DRC has become increasingly resource driven, as parties illegally exploit diamonds and other mineral wealth, including tantilite, the mineral now in high demands for cell phones and other electronic devices.  Last year the United States worked with the international community and the diamond industry to stem the flow of conflict diamonds. The United Nations has taken action to ban the conflict diamond trade and recommended that a ``simple and workable international certification scheme for rough diamonds be created.''  The United States also participated in May 2000 in the Technical Forum on Diamonds, which became known as the ``Kimberley Process'' after the city in South Africa where the group met, along with representatives from other countries, the diamond industry, and non-governmental organization. The group recommended the establishment of an international export regime like the one set up in the bill I introduce today. However, since that time negotiations on setting up such a system have slowed. I believe that this bill will help spur action to complete negotiations and set up a system to track and certify diamond exports.  The bill that I am introducing today with Senator DeWine and Senator Feingold is similar to H.R. 918, introduced by Congressman Tony Hall and Congressman Frank Wolf in the House. But our bill also incorporates some changes that represent a compromise that the diamond industry and the human rights community were able to come together to support. The bill was also written to be compliant with US obligations in the World Trade Organization, WTO.  Among other provisions, the bill does the following: The bill requires diamond imports--including rough, polished, and jewelry--to come from a ``clean stream'' and spells out the details of this system (which may be superceded by an international agreement if the United States is a party to it). Implementation of any system shall be monitored by US agencies and a presidential advisory commission, which include human rights advocates and representatives of the diamond industry.  Violators will be subject to civil and criminal penalties, including confiscation of contraband. Significant violators' US assets may be blocked. Proceeds from penalties and the sale of diamonds seized as contraband shall be used to help war victims, through humanitarian relief and micro-credit development projects.  Diamond-sector projects in countries that fail to adopt a system of controls shall not be eligible for loan guarantees or other assistance of the US Export-Import Bank or OPIC.  The bill provides waiver authority to the President under limited circumstances, and spells out the process for determining them under what limited conditions, the President may delay applicability of the law to a ``cooperating'' country. In issuing such a waiver, the President must report to Congress on that country's progress toward establishing a system of controls and concluding an international agreement. Criteria for determining whether a country is cooperating must be developed with public input.  The bill requires no action by the Treasury Secretary or Customs Service that would contradict the United States' obligations to the World TradeOrganization, as it finds in a dispute proceeding. If another country successfully challenges the United States at the WTO, Congress intends for the United States to bring its actions into conformity with its WTO obligations.  Both the President and the General Accounting Office are to report as to the system's effectiveness and on which countries are implementing it.  The bill encourages the diamond industry to contribute to financially-strapped African countries that may have difficulty bearing the costs of setting up a system of controls, and authorizes $5 million of assistance from the United States to do the same.  I ask my colleagues to join with us in cosponsoring the bill we introduce today and take a positive step in ending the bloody violence fueled by the sale of conflict diamonds.                                 ______                                       By
