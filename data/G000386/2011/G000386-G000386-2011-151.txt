 President, I wanted to address the issue of patent reform--a bill the Senate has already passed by an overwhelming margin. It is my understanding the House of Representatives is expecting to pass a patent reform bill the House wants, and in the process the House wants the Senate to agree very soon thereafter and do it without a formal conference.  I want my colleagues to understand why I hope the House-passed bill will contain a provision that was not in our Senate bill but passed unanimously out of the House Judiciary Committee.
