Res. 353       Whereas according to the American Cancer Society, in 2000,      182,800 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer and 40,800      women will die from this disease;       Whereas in the decade of the 1990's, it is estimated that      about 2,000,000 women were diagnosed with breast cancer,      resulting in nearly 500,000 deaths;       Whereas the risk of breast cancer increases with age, with      a woman at age 70 years having twice as much of a chance of      developing the disease as a woman at age 50 years;       Whereas at least 80 percent of the women who get breast      cancer have no family history of the disease;       Whereas mammograms, when operated professionally at a      certified facility, can provide safe screening and early      detection of breast cancer in many women;       Whereas experts agree that mammography is the best method      of early detection of breast cancer, and early detection is      the key to saving lives;       Whereas mammograms can reveal the presence of small cancers      up to 2 years or more before a regular clinical breast      examination or breast self-examination, reducing mortality by      more than 30 percent; and       Whereas the 5-year survival rate for localized breast      cancer is over 96 percent: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That the Senate--       (1) designates October 20, 2000, as ``National Mammography      Day''; and       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation      calling upon the people of the United States to observe such      day with appropriate programs and activities.
