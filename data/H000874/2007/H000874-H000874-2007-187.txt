We believe the TRIA bill is a very, very important bill. Chairman Frank has been very involved in this, as have bipartisan Members of the Financial Services Committee been involved in this. The gentleman is correct. As a result of what has happened for next week, we determined that both the FHA bill and the TRIA bill, which were both scheduled for the beginning of next week, would be moved until hopefully the following week.                              {time}  1545  We believe for TRIA and FHA, in light of the subprime issues, that Chairman Frank is working with the administration. I know he has talked to Secretary Paulson with respect to their proposals and ours on ways to respond to the subprime crisis, the mortgage foreclosure crisis.  So we want to put those bills back on as soon as we can.  The TRIA bill, as you observed, has raised an issue of PAYGO, as to whether or not there is a financial consequence of the legislation. The CBO has made an estimate. Clearly, however, there is no payout if a terrorist attack doesn't happen, so there is a contingency it would have to happen. We are trying to address that, which we did not anticipate, frankly. As a result, however, we are trying to look at this to see whether or not we can both move the legislation as quickly as possible as well as accommodate the issue of PAYGO.
