 President, today I rise to mourn the death and celebrate the life of a close friend, Dr. Rudy J. Ellis, Sr., who passed away this past Monday, June 2, 1997.  Dr. Rudy Ellis was an inspiration to those who knew him. He was a respected orthopedic surgeon in Louisville, KY, and was the team physician for University of Louisville athletics. Through the years, Rudy touched the lives of many people in the community as well as the thousands of Cardinal athletes that he treated during his 35 years as U of L's team doctor.  I had one thing in common with Rudy, we both started at the University of Louisville at about the same time. He became the U of L team physician in 1961. Since that time, he treated athletes in all sports, except when he stepped down from the Cards' football and baseball teams in 1986. Dr. Rudy Ellis has done more good for more people through the university than virtually anyone else.  As a U.S. Senator, I get to travel across Kentucky and meet many great people who have made a difference in the State. And if I had to make a list of the truly great Kentuckians, Dr. Rudy Ellis would rank in the Top five.  A former member of the U of L's board of trustees and board of overseers, Rudy was one of the pioneers in sports medicine in Kentucky. He opened the Rudy J. Ellis Sports Medicine Center in 1980. And over the years, he has been an integral part of the athletic programs at many Jefferson County high schools, by providing free annual physical examinations for the 4,000 athletes in the school system. In 1993, to show their appreciation for his hard work and compassion for the young athletes, the athletic directors from across Kentucky created an award for people who provide distinguished service to high school sports. Who better to receive the first award than the man they named it after, Dr. Rudy Ellis.  High school gyms and the University of Louisville weren't Rudy's only stomping grounds; he also participated in the athletic programs at Bellarmine College, Lindsey Wilson Junior College, Hanover College, St. Catherine College, Spalding University, Louisville Redbirds, Kentucky Colonels Basketball Team, CBA Catbirds Basketball Team and Louisville Shooters Basketball Team. And in 1994, Rudy was recognized for all his work when he was inducted into the Kentucky Athletic Hall of Fame.  Mr. President please join me in extending my heartfelt sympathy and prayers to the Ellis family, his wife Ruth Anne and his four children, John, Jim, Linda and Amy, and to all those whose lives he touched. He will be missed very, very much.  Mr. President I ask that two articles from the Louisville Courier-Journal be printed in the Record.  The articles follow:                [From the Courier-Journal, June 3, 1997]             Ellis, Beloved U of L team Doctor, Dies at 78                          (By Ashley McGeachy)       Dr. Rudy J. Ellis, the caretaker of University of      Louisville athletes for more than 35 years, died of an      apparent heart attack yesterday morning. He was 78.       Details of Ellis' death were sketchy, but he and his wife,      Ruth Anne, were in Vicksburg, Miss., over the weekend for his      high school reunion. He died there.       Ellis was said to be in fine health as he embarked on the      trip. He had suffered a heart attack five years ago to the      day of his death, but he had suffered no serious health      problems since.       An orthopedic surgeon, Ellis became the team physician for      all U of L sports in 1961 and worked with all athletes      through 1986 when he stepped down from the Cards' football      and baseball teams. He was a U of L institution who never was      paid for his work.       As news of Ellis' death spread throughout the U of L      community, there was sadness over the loss of the soft-     spoken, gentle man who healed whoever was ailing.       ``He loved athletes whether it was a high school kid or a      professional,'' said Cardinals basketball trainer Jerry May,      who worked with Ellis since joining U of L as a student      trainer in 1971. ``He loved to make sure that they were taken      care of. He probably never got paid much for any athlete he      ever saw, but the prerequisite wasn't whether they could pay.      The prerequisite was them being hurt.''       May drove the Ellises to the airport Thursday night for      their trip to Mississippi and was scheduled to pick them up      last night.       ``He was like a father to me,'' May said. ``We were very      close. We roomed together (on road trips) and have ridden      many a mile together.''       Said a teary Sherry Samenick, a U of L trainer who worked      with Ellis for 17 years: ``He's the epitome of loyalty,      dedication, love, friendship and selflessness. . . . He      didn't turn anybody down.''       Ellis helped everyone from the biggest stars at U of L to      high school athletes to ailing fans and media members. He      helped Darrell Griffith and Scooter McCray when they had knee      problems, Dwayne Morton when he broke his hand, Samaki Walker      when he fractured his foot and, most recently, DeJuan Wheat      when he sprained his ankle during the NCAA Tournament in      March.       ``I don't care how long you're at it, you never get used to      it,'' Ellis once said of dealing with players' injuries.      ``You get real close to these kids, kind of feel like they're      your own children, and you get a little frightened every time      they take a spill.''       When Scott Davenport, an assistant basketball coach at U of      L, broke his arm at age 6, Ellis fixed it. When Davenport's      son, Doug, fractured his leg seven years ago, Ellis' son,      John, fixed it.       ``One generation set one; one generation set the other,''      Davenport said, adding, ``How many people do you meet in a      lifetime who have never had anything bad said about them?''       Said U of L athletic director Bill Olsen: ``Dr. Ellis meant      a lot to this program. . . . His caring and compassion for      people extended beyond athletes. Everyone had a lot of      confidence in Doc. He was your best friend; he was a father      figure to many student-athletes and in many ways was a      coach.''       Jock Sutherland, the longtime radio announcer for U of L,      added: ``He was a great person. There aren't many people      outside of your family that you can say you love. I actually      love Rudy Ellis. I love everything he stands for.''       The university honored Ellis in 1995 with a scholarship in      his name. He was inducted into the Kentucky Athletic Hall of      Fame in 1994.       A native of Mississippi, he attended Mississippi State on a      football scholarship and was the Bulldogs' starting      quarterback from 1938 through '40. He graduated from U of L's      medical school in '43 and became the Cards' team physician in      1961 at the behest of Peck Hickman, then the basketball      coach.       He opened the Rudy J. Ellis Sports Medicine Center in      Louisville in 1980, and he served at times as team physician      for the Louisville Redbirds and the old Kentucky Colonels. He      worked with Bellarmine College, Lindsey Wilson College,      Hanover College, St. Catharine College and Spalding      University in addition to the Jefferson County Public      Schools.       Pearson's Funeral Home on Breckinridge Lane is handling the      services, although the family didn't plan to make      arrangements until today.       Ellis is survived by his wife and four children, sons John      and Jim, and daughters Linda and Amy.                 Louisville Has Lost a Doctor To Us All                            (By Rick Bozich)       I didn't want to call Dr. Rudy Ellis' home at 10:45 on a      Tuesday night during Super Bowl week. But when you're a      newspaper person on deadline, where else were you going to      turn for an explanation of how an anterior cruciate ligament      works and how you repair it?       You called Rudy Ellis, doctor to us all.       The first thing he did was tell me to stop apologizing for      calling at that hour.       The second thing was to explain everything he knew about      the anterior cruciate ligament, how he repaired one and how      long the recovery is.       And, finally, after he asked how I was enjoying New      Orleans, the third thing he did was make me promise to call      back later that evening if I had further questions about      anything he had just patiently explained in incredible detail      for 20 minutes.       ``Don't worry about it, paaaart-ner,'' Ellis always said in      that soft comforting drawl that rolled all the way back into      his boyhood days in Mississippi. ``We'll take care of it.''       Ellis did not believe in the doctor-patient relationship.      He believed in the friend-friend relationship. He was an      orthopedic surgeon who handled sports-related problems, but      his real specialty was his warm and compassionate      personality.       It did not matter whether you were a University of      Louisville Cardinal, a Louisville Redbird, a Kentucky      Colonel, a five-morning-a-week jogger or a substitute third      baseman in a Sunday night softball league--you lost a      tireless friend when Rudy Ellis died yesterday.       Ellis was as concerned about your knee as Darrell      Griffith's knee, as worried about your shoulder as Felton      Spencer's shoulder, as interested in your day as he was in      anything he was doing in the most action-packed retirement I      have ever seen.       You were just as likely to find him and his associates at      the Streetball Showdown as you were at Freedom Hall, where he      served so many years as the U of L team physician.       Jim Watkins, the athletic director for Jefferson County      Public Schools, cannot remember when this state has conducted      finals for any sport without representatives of Ellis' office      on the scene.       In 1993 athletic directors across Kentucky created an award      for friends of high school sports, outside of school      personnel, who provide distinguished service. Not only did      the athletic directors give Ellis the first award, but they      also named it the Dr. Rudy J. Ellis Award.       ``Nobody could be more deserving,'' Watkins said. ``Or more      humble.''       Ellis never sent the high schools a bill. He only sent      every patient on the way with a smile, convincing you that if      you followed his instructions you'd be hanging on the rim      again soon. No wonder so many local athletes who have become      professionals never let another doctor take their temperature      until they checked with him.       Griffith was not Dr. Dunkenstein, the 1980 college      basketball player of the year, when he met Ellis. Griffith      was a terrified Male High School sophomore wincing from every      breath after taking a hard shoulder to his chest at practice.       ``You look a little worried, son,'' Ellis said after Wade      Houston, the Male coach, brought Griffith to the office.      ``Well, you're going to live. In fact, you'll be fine.''       ``Dr. Ellis wasn't in medicine for the money,'' Griffith      said. ``He was really in medicine to help people. When you      looked in his eyes, you saw he really cared about you.''       Ask any high school athlete who attended Super Saturday.      For at least the past 15 years, Ellis organized a battalion      of local doctors and trainers who provided physical      examinations for any high school athlete. He insisted that      the Super Saturdays be staged three times a year so athletes      from fall, winter and spring sports were covered. Watkins      said the doctors examined 1,500 to 2,000 students at each      session.       At each free session, that is.       ``There aren't many people like Rudy Ellis,'' Watkins said.      ``He truly believed it was his responsibility that every      athlete had quality medical care.''       ``Louisville has lost a great man,'' Griffith said.       And Louisville has lost a great friend.                          ____________________
