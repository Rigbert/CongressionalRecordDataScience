 The gentleman does not want to speak to that, Madam Speaker. We do know the facts that were testified to in the committee.  The gentleman, like the President, seeks to distract.  I reject out of hand any assertion that either Mr. Schiff or the committee spied on anybody. Did they pursue discovery so that they could get the facts and the truth? They did.  I don't know the amount. I am not a member of the committee. I am not a member of the Intelligence Committee. I am not privy to all the information that may be available, but I reject, again, out of hand that either the chairman or the committee spied on people.  The gentleman has been a Member of this body for some period of time, and I am sure he watched what went on with Benghazi. Thousands and thousands and thousands of pages were received by subpoena, with cooperation by the Obama administration. The chairman of the Government Oversight Committee had thousands and thousands and thousands of pages of subpoenaed evidence or information.  But I will, frankly, Madam Speaker, look at this information because I believe it is a very serious and egregious accusation that Mr. Schiff or the committee spied on anybody.  They may not like the discovery process. They may not like the information that was complied by the discovery process. They may be upset that it did not absolve the President of the United States from clearly abusing his power as President of the United States for his personal gain. But I have no reason to believe it, and no evidence has been offered, just a bald-faced assertion that somehow, Madam Speaker, Mr. Schiff spied on people. I reject that and believe that to be totally without merit.
