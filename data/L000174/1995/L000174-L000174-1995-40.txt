President, the distinguished senior Senator from Virginia and the distinguished senior Senator from South Carolina, both of whom are dear and respected friends of mine, and I have had some discussion on this. I anticipate asking for--and there may be others for that matter--a vote on the motion to proceed.  I tell the Senate and my distinguished colleagues that if I had intended to hold up the motion to proceed, of course, I would use the parliamentary tactic, instead, of asking for a vote on the motion to proceed requiring the reading of the bill which--it is about this big for anybody who cares. That is about 1\1/2\ feet high, and it would take a very considerable time to read. I am not going to request that, of course. I have never engaged, in my 21 years here in the Senate, in such tactics. I will, however, ask for the vote on the motion to proceed, and I assume the majority of Senators will vote to proceed.  I do this because of my concern about one provision, as I said earlier, on landmines. This is a provision that was neither in the House bill nor in the Senate bill. We passed by a two-thirds rollcall vote in the Senate a provision on landmines. The House had nothing.  When it became contentious, I said to the distinguished chairman of the committee, to the distinguished Senator from Virginia, and to the distinguished Senator from Georgia, Mr. Nunn, ``Why don't we just remove the Senate provision?'' In other words, recede to the House, which is no provision.  It is my understanding that was going to be done. It was my understanding in the conversations with the Senators involved that would be done.  I was then told by Senate staff--not by Senators, but by some Senate staff--that they could not allow their Senators to go along with such a commitment. I find that frustrating, of course, because Senators are the ones elected. And I have found that the Senators I have dealt with--especially those whom I have just talked with--have always been extremely truthful with me, as I have always tried to be with them. But my concern was--and apparently sometimes we are considered merely constitutional impediments by our staff. In this case, the staff did not want us any longer to be impediments. In any event, this is a matter that could be solved, and could be solved easily before the conference report comes to a final passage.  I made suggestions to the distinguished Senator from Virginia, following a suggestion made by the distinguished Senator from South Carolina, of a way that we could solve this problem. That would require cooperation from the other body, and I hope that cooperation might be forthcoming.  I just thought this explanation, for Senators wondering what is going on, would be required.                          ____________________
