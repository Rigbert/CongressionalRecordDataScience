 EDWARDS. That is absolutely correct.  Let's suppose we had a young child who needed a particular kind of care and every physician who had treated that child recommended the care for the child. But there was a less costly procedure that could be used, so the care was denied. Throughout the appeals process, the determination of whether it ought to be reversed or not would be based on what is the least costly, because it is totally controlled by the definition written by the HMO.  In the language the Senator from California has just read to me, where it says it shall be within the ``sole discretion,'' what that ultimately means is whatever appealing body is deciding, which is bound by that definition, which they are by this amendment--if they are bound by that definition, every appealing body would be left with no alternative but to affirm the decision because the contract says it is left within the sole discretion of the HMO.  It goes to the very heart of the Senator's amendment. It goes to the very heart of this debate. The whole question is, Are health insurance bureaucrats going to make health care decisions or are health care decisions going to be made by doctors and health care professionals?
