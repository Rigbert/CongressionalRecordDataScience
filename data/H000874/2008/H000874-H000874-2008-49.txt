 We've had discussions about this. As I said at my press conference on Tuesday, there have been no discussions about including that moratoria in a CR. I want to make it clear; there haven't been discussions about it that we won't or we will. My expectation is, though, we passed a bill, we think it is a good bill, we think it opens up drilling. And there will be some discussions both on the Senate side--we don't know what the Senate side is going to do with it--and with the White House on that issue.  We've had pretty open discussions with the White House on this issue. I know there's been a letter signed by a large number on your side about that issue. The White House is obviously sensitive to that, but I don't think that's going to be a stumbling block.
