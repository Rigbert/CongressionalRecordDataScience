 President, human trafficking affects every State in this Nation--every single one of them. In Kentucky we have heard reports of victims as young as 2 months old--2-month-old victims of human trafficking. We heard about a Kentuckian who said she was sold for sex from the age of 5 until she was able to physically break free as an adult. Stories such as these may shock the conscience, but they are hardly unique in our country.  The Judiciary Committee recently heard the story of Aviva, who was barely a teenager when she was kidnapped and forced into modern slavery. Listen to this. Aviva was sold to as many as 10 different men a night. Freedom was stolen from her, innocence ripped away. Aviva's trafficker tried to stamp out everything that made Aviva Aviva. Aviva even forgot what it felt like to be human anymore.  Democrats have said they were in favor of helping victims such as Aviva. Democrats demanded that I bring the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act to the floor. But now that the very legislation is here on the floor, our Democratic friends seem to have changed their tune completely--a totally different tune. Now that they have a chance to actually help the victims, they decided they are more concerned about a few sentences in the bill--a provision they seemed perfectly fine with until just recently. They are more concerned about those few sentences than actually solving the problem the bill would address.  Now, this provision has been included in countless bills they have voted for and cosponsored. It is language they were perfectly happy to endorse again in another bill this very week--2 days ago. But that bill was designed to help doctors, not children enslaved by sex traffickers. So it is OK to vote for that kind of language if you are trying to help doctors, but not OK to vote for that kind of language if you are trying to help these poor young children. Obviously our Democratic friends think that doctors are worthy of their help. What about the victims of modern slavery?  Now, the rationale for this filibuster seems to shift by the day, and it is almost incomprehensible. Their foremost concern seems to be about treating this specific kind of money this way, versus treating that specific kind of money that way. It is hard to follow; isn't it? Focusing all their attention not on the victims of these crimes but on financial assessments levied on the people who perpetrate them--the traffickers.  Honestly, I am not sure why anyone would think money collected from criminals ought to get more consideration than money collected from law-abiding taxpayers. What a strange argument. But this is where they have planted their flag. That ridiculous argument is where they have planted their flag.  Their contention is essentially that the victims of trafficking should get no help at all because Democrats say the money they would receive might be considered ``private'' and that this bill should not pass, therefore, because the bipartisan Hyde principles it contains might apply to those private funds. If that argument sounds contrived and illogical to you, you are not alone.  Now we find out it is not even true. Let me repeat that. The very heart of the Democrats' argument isn't even true. That is what the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service told us just yesterday.  So I would ask my Democratic friends to listen to this closely. CRS, the Congressional Research Service, answered some very straightforward questions posed by the senior Senator from Texas, my friend and colleague Senator Cornyn. Here is what they said to Senator Cornyn: Money deposited in the General Treasury from traffickers, as the Federal law requires, is Federal money, according to CRS.  So let me repeat. The Democrats have been blocking an antislavery bill over money they call private, and they are not even correct about this. Our Democratic colleagues have also blocked this bill because they say Hyde has only applied to annual spending orappropriations--not mandatory spending. It is another argument that the Congressional Research Service tells us is simply not true--not true.  The experts at CRS say Hyde has applied to mandatory spending of Federal funds out of the General Treasury, as the Cornyn amendment provides. And CRS concludes that Hyde just applied to mandatory spending in the very doc fix bill that 100 percent of our Democratic friends voted for 2 days ago.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the CRS memorandum be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.  I ask my Democratic friends to stop this. Stop this. Take a breath and think about what is being done. Children are being sold into sexual slavery, having their freedom and self-respect ripped away. Will they finally allow the Senate to help them or will they continue some debunked crusade?  We have offered several compromises to address the concerns they have raised. We will soon vote on another one that Senator Cornyn has been offering. He has been reaching out to our Democrat friends for weeks now to try to find a solution to this nonproblem. The findings of CRS make it clear that we are doing nothing extraordinary or unusual here. We are simply applying long-accepted principles that Americans overwhelmingly support. Most people would think that sounds pretty reasonable. It is time to get serious and pass this important legislation.  A large, bipartisan majority of the Senate has already voted repeatedly to approve this bill. With the support of a couple more courageous Democrats, we can bring an end to this debunked filibuster today.  The victims who survive brutal abuse don't need more of our friends' illogical contortions and justifications. They just need help, and they need it now. They need the help the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act would provide.  Why don't we finally get around to fixing this problem? The time to do that is now.  I yield the floor.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                               Memorandum                                                   April 15, 2015.     To: Senate Committee on the Judiciary.     From: Edward C. Liu, Legislative Attorney; Jon O.          Shimabukuro, Legislative Attorney.     Subject: Analysis of S.Amdt. 1120 to S. 178.       This memorandum responds on an expedited basis to your      request for an analysis of specific questions you have posed      regarding a draft amendment denoted ``ALB15639'' which      appears to be identical to S.Amdt. 1120 to S. 178. Your      questions have been reproduced below verbatim followed by our      responses. ``1. Does the text of ALB15639 require all special assessments to be                deposited in the General Treasury Fund?''       Yes. Section 3302(b) of Title 31 of the United States Code,      also known as the miscellaneous receipts statute, requires      that all money received for the federal government must be      deposited in the General Fund of the Treasury unless      disposition of the receipts is otherwise specified by law. S.      178, as amended by S.Amdt. 1120 does not appear to specify a      different treatment for the assessments received.       The new Sec. 3014(d) created by S.Amdt. 1120 would specify      that ``consistent with [the miscellaneous receipts statute],      there shall be transferred to the [Domestic Trafficking      Victims'] Fund from the General Fund of the Treasury an      amount equal to the amount of the assessments collected under      this section, which shall remain available until expended.''      The transfer of funds from the General Fund does not affect      the disposition of the assessments in a way that would      supersede the miscellaneous receipts statute, though the end      result for the respective balances of the General Fund and      the Domestic Trafficking Victims' Fund appears to be      mathematically equal to directly depositing the assessments      into the Domestic Trafficking Victims' Fund. The conclusion      that the assessments are deposited into the General Fund is      reinforced by the clause requiring that the transfer occur      ``consistent with'' the miscellaneous receipts statute. ``2. Once the special assessments in ALB15369 are deposited into the   General Treasury Fund, would they be classified as federal funds?''       Yes, amounts in the General Fund are considered ``federal      funds'' by the Office of Management and Budget (``OMB''). In      the Analytical Perspectives volume of the Budget for FY2016,      OMB provides background information on budget accounts. This      information would seem to be instructive for determining how      funds, i.e., amounts, in the Treasury account will be      classified. OMB observes:       When money is received by the federal government, it is      credited to a budget account, .  . . . All budget accounts      belong to one of two groups of funds: federal funds and trust      funds. . . . The federal funds group includes the ``general      fund,'' the largest fund in the government used for the      general purposes of government and special funds and      revolving funds, both of which receive dedicated collections      for spending on specific purposes. Where the law requires      that federal fund collections be dedicated to a particular      program, the collections and associated disbursements are      recorded in special fund receipt and expenditure accounts. .      . . Money in a special fund must be appropriated before it      can be obligated and spent. The majority of special fund      collections are derived from the government's power to impose      taxes or fines, or otherwise compel payment. ``3. Do precedents exist for applying the Hyde amendment to mandatory                spending from the General Treasury Fund?''       Yes. Mandatory spending can be generally defined as federal      spending which is controlled by laws other than      appropriations acts. In recent years the Hyde Amendment has      included a clause extending its scope to trust funds to which      money was appropriated in that same annual appropriations      act. For example, the consolidated appropriations act for      FY2015 includes a Hyde Amendment with this clause, and also      appropriates funds from the General Fund to the Federal      Hospital Insurance Trust Fund. The Federal Hospital Insurance      Trust Fund is used to pay for services provided to Medicare      beneficiaries under Part A of the program. Because these      payments from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund are      controlled by the Social Security Act and are considered to      be mandatory spending, this would appear to constitute an      example of mandatory spending that was subject to the      versions of the Hyde Amendment.``4. Is not the language in Section 221(c) of H.R. 2 (Hyde language in  House-passed SGR legislation) attached to mandatory spending from the                        General Treasury Fund ?''       Yes. Section 221(a) of H.R. 2 amends Sec. 10503 of the      Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) which      appropriates funds to the Community Health Center Fund (CHC      Fund) for certain fiscal years, out of any monies in the      Treasury not otherwise appropriated. Section 221 extends the      funding provided in Sec. 10503 for fiscal years 2016 and      2017. Pursuant to Sec. 10503, amounts in the CHC Fund are      available until expended, and are to be used by the Secretary      to increase funding of community health centers and the      National Health Service Corps. Subsection 221(c) of H.R. 2      further provides that:       Amounts appropriated pursuant to this section for fiscal      year 2016 and fiscal year 2017 are subject to the      requirements contained in Public Law 113-235 for funds for      programs authorized under sections 330 through 340 of the      Public Health Service Act.       On its face, this restriction would appear to apply to the      amounts appropriated to the CHC Fund for fiscal years 2016      and 2017. The spending of funds appropriated for those fiscal      years would appear to be controlled by Sec. 10503 of ACA, and      would not appear to be controlled by an appropriations act.      Therefore, spending from the CHC Fund would appear to be      classified as mandatory spending subject to the restriction      in subsection 221(c) of H.R. 2.``5. Is the language on page 4, lines 8-14 of ALB15639 (Hyde language)   also attached to mandatory spending from the General Treasury Fund''       Yes. The new 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3014(e)(3), as added by S.Amdt.      1120, states that:       Amounts transferred from the [Domestic Trafficking      Victims'] Fund pursuant to this section for each of fiscal      years 2016 through 2019 are subject to the requirements      contained in Public Law 113-235 for funds for programs      authorized under sections 330 through 340 of the Public      Health Service Act.       S.Amdt. 1120 further provides that amounts in the Domestic      Trafficking Victims' Fund shall be used by the Attorney      General, in coordination with the Secretary of Health and      Human Services, to award grants or enhance victims'      programming, ``without further appropriation.'' This      provision is found in an authorizing measure which amends      Title 18 of the United States Code, and not an appropriations      act.       Therefore, using the same definition of mandatory spending      as provided above, the Domestic Trafficking Victims' Fund      would appear to be mandatory spending that is subject to the      restrictions in the new 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3014(e)(3) that would      be added by S.Amdt. 1120.                          ____________________
