Sandra and Marvin's membership in the Gary Teachers Union date back to the beginning of their careers in 1961 and 1962, respectively, and the impact they have had on the quality of life for educators in the city of Gary is immeasurable. For their lifetime of service to the Gary Teachers Union, the Indiana Teachers Union, and the American Federation of Teachers, Sandra and Marvin were honored at a retirement celebration that took place at the Genesis Convention Center in Gary, Indiana, on Friday, August 15, 2008.  Sandra Jean (Carr) Irons' career in education began following her graduation from Kentucky State College in 1960, where she completed her Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Chemistry. Following that, shewent on to receive her Master's degree in Teaching Mathematics from Purdue University, West Lafayette. Prior to her work with the Gary Teachers Union, Sandra was a mathematics teacher for the Gary School Corporation from 1961 to 1971. Following her ten years in the classroom, Sandra was elected President of the Gary Teachers Union, a position she held until her recent retirement on June 30, 2008. During those years, she served in many other capacities, not only with the Gary Teachers Union, but with the Indiana Federation of Teachers and the American Federation of Teachers as well.  Sandra has also participated in numerous civic and community organizations, including: the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the Lake Area United Way, the Lake County Mental Health Association, the Coalition of Labor Union Women, the YWCA, and the Gary Educational Foundation. For her outstanding efforts, Ms. Irons has received many accolades and awards.

From 1962 to 1981, Marvin was employed by the Gary Community School Corporation as an elementary school teacher. During that time, he began his career as the Working Conditions Committee Chairperson for the Gary Teachers Union. He held this position for more than 30 years before his recent retirement on June 30, 2008. During this time, he has also held other positions with the Gary Teachers Union, including the Coordinator for the Pre-Retirement Planning Seminar, as well as several other posts with the Indiana Federation of Teachers, where he served as its president, the Northwest Indiana Council of Teachers Unions, and the American Federation of Teachers' Progressive Caucus.  Throughout the years, Marvin has also donated much of his time to various community and civic organizations, including: the Lake Area United Way, the Referral Emergency Agency, the Northwest Indiana Open Housing Center, Tots and Teens, and Saint Timothy Community Church.  Madam Speaker, Sandra Irons and Marvin Setzer, Jr., have given their time and efforts selflessly to the teachers, as well as to the students and the community, in Gary, Indiana. Throughout the years, and through their efforts, the quality of life for their colleagues has improved, and the pair has served as true role models to their peers and as true friends to Northwest Indiana.
