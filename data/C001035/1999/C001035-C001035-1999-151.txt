President, I ask the Chair lay before the Senate a message from the House of Representatives on the bill (S. 376) to amend the Communications Satellite Act of 1962 to promote competition and privatization in satellite communications, and for other purposes.  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message from the House of Representatives:       Resolved, That the bill from the Senate (S. 376) entitled      ``An Act to amend the Communications Satellite Act of 1962 to      promote competition and privatization in satellite      communications, and for other purposes'', do pass with the      following amendment:       Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert:     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Communications Satellite      Competition and Privatization Act of 1999''.     SEC. 2. PURPOSE.       It is the purpose of this Act to promote a fully      competitive global market for satellite communication      services for the benefit of consumers and providers of      satellite services and equipment by fully privatizing the      intergovernmental satellite organizations, INTELSAT and      Inmarsat.     SEC. 3. REVISION OF COMMUNICATIONS SATELLITE ACT OF 1962.       The Communications Satellite Act of 1962 (47 U.S.C. 101) is      amended by adding at the end the following new title:        ``TITLE VI--COMMUNICATIONS COMPETITION AND PRIVATIZATION      ``Subtitle A--Actions To Ensure Procompetitive Privatization     ``SEC. 601. FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION                    LICENSING.       ``(a) Licensing for Separated Entities.--       ``(1) Competition test.--The Commission may not issue a      license or construction permit to any separated entity, or      renew or permit the assignment or use of any such license or      permit, or authorize the use by any entity subject to United      States jurisdiction of any space segment owned, leased, or      operated by any separated entity, unless the Commission      determines that such issuance, renewal, assignment, or use      will not harm competition in the telecommunications market of      the United States. If the Commission does not make such a      determination, it shall deny or revoke authority to use space      segment owned, leased, or operated by the separated entity to      provide services to, from, or within the United States.       ``(2) Criteria for competition test.--In making the      determination required by paragraph (1), the Commission shall      use the licensing criteria in sections 621 and 623, and shall      not make such a determination unless the Commission      determines that the privatization of any separated entity is      consistent with such criteria.       ``(b) Licensing for INTELSAT, Inmarsat, and Successor      Entities.--       ``(1) Competition test.--The Commission shall substantially      limit, deny, or revoke the authority for any entity subject      to United States jurisdiction to use space segment owned,      leased, or operated by INTELSAT or Inmarsat or any successor      entities to provide non-core services to, from, or within the      United States, unless the Commission determines--       ``(A) after April 1, 2001, in the case of INTELSAT and its      successor entities, that INTELSAT and any successor entities      have been privatized in a manner that will not harm      competition in the telecommunications markets of the United      States; or       ``(B) after April 1, 2000, in the case of Inmarsat and its      successor entities, that Inmarsat and any successor entities      have been privatized in a manner that will not harm      competition in the telecommunications markets of the United      States.       ``(2) Criteria for competition test.--In making the      determination required by paragraph (1), the Commission shall      use the licensing criteria in sections 621, 622, and 624, and      shall not make such a determination unless the Commission      determines that such privatization is consistent with such      criteria.       ``(3) Clarification: competitive safeguards.--In making its      licensing decisions under this subsection, the Commission      shall consider whether users of non-core services provided by      INTELSAT or Inmarsat or successor or separated entities are      able to obtain non-core services from providers offering      services other than through INTELSAT or Inmarsat or successor      or separated entities, at competitive rates, terms, or      conditions. Such consideration shall also include whether      such licensing decisions would require users to replace      equipment at substantial costs prior to the termination of      its design life. In making its licensing decisions, the      Commission shall also consider whether competitive      alternatives in individual markets do not exist because they      have been foreclosed due to anticompetitive actions      undertaken by or resulting from the INTELSAT or Inmarsat      systems. Such licensing decisions shall be made in a manner      which facilitates achieving the purposes and goals in this      title and shall be subject to notice and comment.       ``(c) Additional Considerations in Determinations.--In      making its determinations and licensing decisions under      subsections (a) and (b), the Commission shall take into      consideration the United States obligations and commitments      for satellite services under the Fourth Protocol to the      General Agreement on Trade in Services.       ``(d) Independent Facilities Competition.--Nothing in this      section shall be construed as precluding COMSAT from      investing in or owning satellites or other facilities      independent from INTELSAT and Inmarsat, and successor or      separated entities, or from providing services through      reselling capacity over the facilities of satellite systems      independent from INTELSAT and Inmarsat, and successor or      separated entities. This subsection shall not be construed as      restricting the types of contracts which can be executed or      services which may be provided by COMSAT over the independent      satellites or facilities described in this subsection.     ``SEC. 602.
