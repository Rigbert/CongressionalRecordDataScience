 President, I rise today to introduce the Crime Victims with Disabilities Act of 2008.  Adults with disabilities experience violence or abuse at least twice as often as people without disabilities, and adults with developmental disabilities are at risk of being physically or sexually assaulted at rates four to ten times greater than other adults. In fact, an estimated 5 million crimes are committed annually against persons with developmental disabilities and an estimated 70 percent of these crimes are not reported.  Adding insult to injury, individuals with disabilities suffer additional ``victimization'' within the justice system, due to lack of physical, programmatic, and communications accommodations needed for equal access.  The Crime Victims with Disabilities Act takes a commonsense approach to fixing this problem by providing funds to increase the investigation, prosecution, and prevention of crimes against persons with disabilities and by facilitating collaboration among criminal justice agencies and other agencies and organizations that provide services to people with disabilities to improve services to those who are victimized.  Collaboration among criminal justice agencies and agencies and organizations that provide services to individuals with disabilities is necessary to ensure that crimes are reported and investigated properly, prosecutors are properly trained, appropriate accommodations are provided to disabled victims, and communication between criminal justice agencies and organizations that provide services to individuals with disabilities is effective.  The bill funds a modest grant program that would allow States, units of local government, and Indian Tribes to develop programs to facilitate collaboration among criminal justice agencies and agencies and organizations that provide services to individuals with disabilities for these purposes. The bill authorizes $50,000 for each planning grant and $300,000 for each implementation grant for a total authorization for the grant program of $10 million for the first year.  The bill also authorizes $4 million over 4 years to fund research to assist the Attorney General in collecting valid, reliable national data relating to crimes against individuals with developmental and related disabilities for the National Crime Victims Survey conducted by the Bureau of Justice Statistics of the Department of Justice as required by the Crime Victims with Disabilities Awareness Act. Currently, the Bureau of Justice Statistics does not specifically collect this data, leaving many crimes against persons with disabilities unreported in the survey and making it difficult to address this problem adequately.  The Association of University Centers on Disabilities, the National Center for Victims of Crime, the National Council on Independent Living, the National Disability Rights Network, the National Child Abuse Coalition, Easter Seals, the Arc of the United States, and United Cerebral Palsy have endorsed the bill. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this bill which will protect some of the most vulnerable members of our society--individuals with disabilities who are victims of crime.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3668       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Crime Victims with      Disabilities Act of 2008''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds the following:       (1) Adults with disabilities experience violence or abuse      at least twice as often as people without disabilities, and      adults with developmental disabilities are at risk of being      physically or sexually assaulted at rates four to ten times      greater than other adults.       (2) Individuals with disabilities suffer from additional      ``victimization'' within the justice system, due to lack of      physical, programmatic, and communications accommodations      needed for equal access.       (3) Women with disabilities are more likely to be      victimized, to experience more severe and prolonged violence,      and to suffer more serious and chronic effects from that      violence, than women without such disabilities.       (4) Sixty-eight to 83 percent of women with developmental      disabilities will be sexually assaulted in their lifetime.       (5) An estimated 5,000,000 crimes are committed against      individuals with developmental disabilities annually.       (6) Over 70 percent of crimes committed against individuals      with developmental disabilities are not reported.       (7) Studies in the United States, Canada, Australia, and      Great Britain consistently show that victims with      developmental disabilities suffer repeated victimization      because so few of the crimes against them are reported.       (8) The National Crime Victims Survey conducted annually by      the Bureau of Justice     Statistics of the Department of Justice, does not      specifically collect data relating to crimes against      individuals with developmental disabilities, nor do they use      disability as a demographic variable as they use other      important demographic variables, such as gender, age, and      racial and ethnic membership.     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.       (a) In General.--The purpose of this Act is to increase the      awareness, investigation, prosecution, and prevention of      crimes against individuals with a disability, including      developmental disabilities, and improve services to those who      are victimized, by facilitating collaboration among the      criminal justice system and a range of agencies and other      organizations that provide services to individuals with      disabilities.       (b) Need for Collaboration.--Collaboration among the      criminal justice system and agencies and other organizations      that provide services to individuals with disabilities is      needed to--       (1) protect individuals with disabilities by ensuring that      crimes are reported, and that reported crimes are actively      investigated by both law enforcement agencies and agencies      and other organizations that provide services to individuals      with disabilities;       (2) provide prosecutors and victim assistance organizations      with adequate training to ensure that crimes against      individuals with disabilities are appropriately and      effectively addressed in court;       (3) identify and ensure that appropriate reasonable      accommodations are provided to individuals with disabilities      in a safe and conducive environment, allowing crimes to be      reported accurately to law enforcement agencies; and       (4) promote communication among criminal justice agencies,      and agencies and other organizations that provide services to      individuals with disabilities, including Victim Assistance      Organizations, to ensure that the needs of crime victims with      disabilities are met.
