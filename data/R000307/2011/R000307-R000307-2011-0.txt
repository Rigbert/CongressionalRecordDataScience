President, I rise today in honor of the U.S. Marine Corps as it celebrates 236 years of sacrifice and service to this great Nation. In the spirit of a true marine, ooo-rah and happy birthday. This week, it is fitting that our great and deliberate body, the Senate, passed a bill to honor and revere the Montford Point marines, the first African Americans to serve in our Corps. Last night, the Senate passed legislation to award the Montford Point marines the Congressional Gold Medal. I can think of no better way to honor these gentleman, most of whom are now in their nineties, for being a part of our Nation's history during a difficult time, both abroad and at home.  In 1942, the U.S. Marine Corps opened its doors for African Americans to play a role in combat. Unfortunately, these men were not trained where marines before them had done so. Instead, from 1942 to 1949, the Corps trained Black marines at Montford Point Camp in North Carolina.  Like true marines, even with segregated training, these men fought shoulder to shoulder next to every marine in World War II. Their actions were significant during our campaign in the Pacific. Their service to the Corps is now a significant thread in its history. The Marine Corps extols the virtues of courage, intelligence, integrity, and leadership. I am proud that the spirit of the Corps resonated in every one of these marines, even in a time of great inequality. In theater, a marine is a marine. We are brothers, regardless of color or creed. The duty every marine pledges to mission and man is equal. It is what makes our Corps the great fighting force that continues today.  I applaud our Commandant, General Amos. Without his commitment to this initiative honoring the Montford Point marines, we may not have passed the bill so easily. I am very proud of my Corps, humbled by all the men and women who continue to join our Armed Forces, and to the Senate for finally recognizing these incredible veterans in the appropriate way.  I am as proud of the Marine Corps today as ever. The Corps has dutifully accomplished exactly what the President and this Nation have asked of them over the past decade. Marines have turned the tide in Iraq and continue to wage ahead in Afghanistan. Marines continue to steer the course of how to succeed in land campaigns and remain always faithful, both to mission and fellow marine.  Today, we celebrate the Marine Corps. Tomorrow, we celebrate all our warfighters, those men and women in uniform who have committed their time, and put their lives in harm's way, for the defense of the United States. Thank you to all those who have served. God bless all those currently deployed around the world. Semper Fi.                          ____________________
