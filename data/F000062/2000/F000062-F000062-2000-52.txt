 President, I wanted to thank the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia for those very inspirational remarks.  He always amazes me, not only with his knowledge of history, but his knowledge of verse, his knowledge of literature, and, of course, his knowledge for the rules of the Senate.  I want to personally thank him for those very stirring words.                          ____________________
