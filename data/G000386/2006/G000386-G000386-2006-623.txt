 I will put it in this perspective. First of all, I hope what he says could happen. It seems to me that, No. 1, we are kind of in an environment where we believe we are wasting some time, in the sense that we are going through a lot of procedural motions that redebate something that was decided in a bipartisan way by this body back on December 18 on a 64-to-something vote, a very bipartisan vote. Normally, what we are doing now is trying to go to conference. We are faced with a lot of amendments--some that might be the same as what we dealt with previously. So that is kind of an environment that maybe a lot of us believe we should not have to go through because it is a waste of time. But now that is a fact of life. That is how the Senate operates.  So as what my friend, the distinguished Senator from Montana, said, it boils down to this: To the extent we can have a massive amount of transparency on what might be offered, with some limit on the number of amendments that might be offered, and get that settled very soon, then what happened in the sense of him saying we would fill up the tree with amendments, we would not do that.  That is what we would like to do. But it seems to me there has been some inability to know exactly how many amendments might come from the Democratic side of the aisle, what they were, and the extent to which they were germane versus nongermane. Obviously, the more that are nongermane as opposed to germane makes it even more difficult. If we can settle those things--I know Senator Baucus and I could settle those things, and we could be on our way to not filling the tree. So far we have not seen that sort of transparency.
