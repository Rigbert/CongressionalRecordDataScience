 President, I would like to take a moment this morning to mourn the passing of a devoted son of Louisville, KY, and someone I was lucky to call a very dear friend.  I can say without exaggeration that David Jones, Sr., was the single most influential friend and mentor I have had in my entire career. I have never forgotten something he told me when I was starting out in Jefferson County. He said: ``The most important word in the English language is `focus.' ''  David used his extraordinary focus and many other talents to build an extraordinary American business and to better his community. Whenever a local need had somebody--almost everybody, actually--stumped, David always seemed to end up in the thick of it, forging a path to success.  In the days ahead, many will rightly pay tribute to David's brilliance and his determination, but he was also one of the kindest, most decent, most generous individuals I have ever met. I will sorely miss his friendship, and Kentuckians will miss his extraordinary leadership.                          ____________________
