 President, I see the cost-benefit analysis as a very worthwhile procedure. I think I supported that. I have not had a chance to vote on it in past Congresses. But I support the concept. I think, as the Senator said, the concept is to end the rulemaking process. I happen to think that is not a very effective process that we go through. I think it is not refined well enough. I do not think there is a bureaucratic inclination to abide by it in good faith. I support that concept, but I do not think it has any relationship to what I am trying to accomplish by my amendment.  It is a worthy goal the Senator suggests, but it is a little more. I believe it is much more in depth and serves a whole different purpose than what I am trying to serve by my amendment.
