 President, I rise today to call attention to the fact that last week the Senate voted to provide an additional $300 million for medical research in the Fiscal Year 2000 Department of Defense Appropriations bill. I joined with several of my colleagues in urging that critical funding for cancer research be included in the bill.  Included in this account are $175 million for breast cancer research, $75 million for prostate cancer research, and $50 million for other medical research including ovarian cancer, osteoporosis, diabetes and childhood asthma.  In recent years, the DOD's Department for Health Affairs has made great strides in innovative medical research. The DOD Breast Cancer Research Program is an excellent example of these advancements. During its six years in existence, the program has grown from a small isolated project to a well-funded, efficient, and effective part of the cancer research community.  As was recommended by the Institute of Medicine, the program is overseen by a group of scientists and patient activists, which helps the program keep up with advancements of the scientific community. This structure has fostered a program praised for its innovation, flexibility, and efficiency.  Approximately 90 percent of the program's funds are devoted to research grants. The DOD Breast Cancer Research Program grants have encouraged scientific research to extend beyond traditional research. Specifically, Innovative Developmental and Exploratory Awards (IDEA) grants are targeted for innovative research efforts that explore new approaches in areas that offer the greatest potential.  The program also incorporates consumer and community needs in its research priorities. By including consumer advocates in decision-making and by bringing clinical trials into the community, the program has integrated the goals of advocates, scientists, and patients. This unique approach has proven successful both in the research the Program has produced and the future research it has inspired.  Similar to the Breast Cancer Research Program, the DOD Prostate Cancer Research Program is conducted according to the model established by the Breast Cancer Program. According to the American Cancer Society, approximately 179,300 American men will develop prostate cancer this year, and about 37,000 will die of this disease. Though I am encouraged by the news that the survival rate for this type of cancer has increased from 50% to 85%, we clearly can and must do more.  Replicating the much-praised Breast Cancer Program mission and structure, prostate research encourages innovation while creating a partnership between advocates and scientists. Research grants are designed to stimulate innovative research and to bolster the national effort against prostate cancer.  As co-chair of the Senate Cancer Coalition, I am very familiar with current cancer research efforts. The DOD cancer research programs are some of the most innovative and effective public-private partnerships that our country has in the battle against cancer. I am confident that commitment to this program will strengthen our nation's cancer research program and help to stop the spread of this dread disease.  The additional funding in the DOD appropriation bill is compatible with other progressive funding sources that have been explored in recent years. The Breast Cancer Research Stamp, which I sponsored in the Senate, has raised $6.6 million for breast cancer research. Thirty percent of these funds go to the DOD program.  With the work of research programs across the country, we have made some progress in the war on cancer: new cancer cases and deaths in the United States fell between 1990 and 1996; survival time has been extended dramatically for some cancers; we have improved therapies with fewer adverse side effects; and there is increased cancer screening and detection.  And yet, sadly, we have a long way to go. Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the US, exceeded only by heart disease. The American Cancer Society estimates that over 1.2 million new cancer cases are expected to be diagnosed in 1999 and about one half million Americans are expected to die of cancer this year alone.  But we must look at these disturbing statistics as an opportunity. What these statistics tell us is that we need to multiply, accelerate, and intensify our war on cancer. The additional $300 million for medical research in the Department of Defense Appropriations bill sends a strong signal that we are committed to combating this destructive disease. The Senate should be proud of sending this powerful message.                          ____________________
