I will be brief. I want it understood tonight that in the withdrawal of this amendment, I am doing this as part of a good-faith effort to find common ground with my colleagues. The people of Oregon feel so strongly about this issue that I could not let this bill go to final passage until it protects Oregon's election rights, but I would like to advance the consideration of the legislation by this body. That is why I am not objecting tonight.  Senator Smith and I will continue to work with our colleagues on a bipartisan basis to address this issue. I yield the floor.
