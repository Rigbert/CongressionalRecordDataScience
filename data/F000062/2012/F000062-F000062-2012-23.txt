R. 5949, and it goes on to say what the billwould do. It says it is vital and it produced and continues to produce significant information that is vital to defend the Nation against international terrorism and other threats.  I am very hopeful this bill will pass without amendment and thereupon can go directly to the President for signature.  I yield the floor.                               exhibit 1                                          Inspector General of the                                       Intelligence Community,                                    Washington, DC, June 15, 2012.     Hon. Ron Wyden,     Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.     Hon. Mark Udall,     Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Wyden and Senator Udall: Thank you for your 4      May 2012 letter requesting that my office and the National      Security Agency (NSA) Inspector General (IG) determine the      feasibility of estimating ``how many people inside the United      States have had their communications collected or reviewed      under the authorities granted by section 702'' of the FISA      Amendment Act (FAA). On 21 May 2012, I informed you that the      NSA Inspector General, George Ellard, would be taking the      lead on the requested feasibility assessment, as his office      could provide an expedited response to this important      inquiry.
