President, there were a number of hearings scheduled for today and tomorrow in the Judiciary Committee, hearings to be chaired by Senators Schumer, Biden, and Feinstein, which have been postponed. The reason we have done this is because of all the conditions of rooms and all, so we can save the time for the nominations hearing which has been scheduled for Thursday afternoon to be chaired by Senator Edwards, provided we can find the room for it. That will go on. The others are routine hearings which can be done at any time.                          ____________________
