  The answer is that the bipartisan tax relief returns to taxpayers, on a progressive basis, a small portion of the record level of Federal taxes.  Take a look at this chart. It shows that the largest tax cut went to taxpayers in the lower and middle income brackets. For instance, taxpayers with incomes between $10,000 and $20,000, will see their taxes reduced by almost 14 percent when the tax cut is fully in effect. Taxpayers with over $200,000 will see their taxes reduced by barely 6 percent.  The Democratic Leadership and many in the media, will focus, not on the burden taxpayers bear, but on the benefits of the tax cut. In other words, they will try to ignore the progressive nature of our current system and use isolated examples. For instance, they will say that a taxpayer at $50,000 of income gets more of a tax cut than a taxpayer at $10,000 of income. In fact, a taxpayer at $50,000 of income, pays considerably more tax than a taxpayer at $10,000 of income. Comparing two different taxpayers' tax relief benefits without looking at the burden is comparing apples to oranges.  Let us compare apples to apples. That is, the burden born by groups of taxpayers before and after the tax relief bill.  What I showed you before was the change in the tax burden for different categories of taxpayers. This chart allows you to see how progressive the current system is and how the tax relief bill made the tax system even more progressive. Keep in mind that this table includes all taxes. That's income taxes, payroll taxes, excise taxes, and corporate income taxes.  Let us compare the same two groups I talked about before. Taxpayers with incomes between $10,000 and $20,000 bore 1.2 percent of the Federal tax burden before the tax relief bill and 1.1 percent after the tax relief bill. Taxpayers with over $200,000 maintained their burden, 32.1 percent, before and after the tax relief bill.  You can see the bipartisan tax relief bill lightened everyone's Federal tax burden but did it in a progressive way.  What the tax relief bill aimed to do was send back to the American people a portion of the record-high levels of taxation. But the bipartisan tax relief bill sent the money back in a progressive manner.  Let us take a look at where we were early last year. You'll see the Federal Government was taking in record-high levels of individual income taxes. For instance in 2000, Federal taxes were taking 20.5% of GDP and individual income taxes were taking 10.2 percent of GDP.  According to CBO, those upward record-high level trends were going to continue throughout this decade. In fact, even when fully in effect, the bipartisan tax relief bill leaves both Federal and individual income taxes at near record levels.  Chairman Greenspan gave us a green light to provide broad-based tax relief because he foresaw a long-term economic problem. The record level of taxation, if left on track, would have been a drag on economic growth.  As a matter of fact, there is substantial agreement that the tax cut came at just the right time. The rebate checks and other relief arrived just as the recession started to hit home. According to the Department of Commerce, the tax relief boosted personal incomes by the highest amount in almost 10 years.  You can now see that those three widespread incorrect assertions about the bipartisan tax relief package have been countered. One, the tax relief package was bipartisan; not partisan as its critics claim. Two, the tax relief package did not cause either the short-term or long-term budget problems we face. Three, the tax relief package provides broad-based relief in a progressive fashion.  I would like to turn to the final part of my discussion. This is the most important part because it describes what the tax relief package means to typical taxpayers.  We took as a starting point President Bush's efforts to provide income tax relief to all Americans. This legislation includes the four main elements of President Bush's goals of providing tax relief to working families.  These goals are to: No. 1, provide tax relief for working families through reducing marginal rates; No. 2, reduce the marriage penalty; No. 3, expand the child tax credit; and No. 4, eliminate death taxes. Let's look at each one.  First, this legislation reduced marginal rates at all levels and creates the new 10 percent level proposed by the President. We also began to address the hidden marginal rate increases such as PEPS and PEASE that complicate the Code.  The 10 percent bracket means a tax cut for every American taxpayer. It was the source for the rebate checks that every taxpayer received last year. That's $600 for every family and $300 for every single person.  America is a society of opportunity. Over 60 percent of all families will at one time or another be in the top fifth of income in this country. A man will make more at 55, after 30 years of hard work, than he did at 25. A family should not face a crushing marginal rate tax burden when they finally get a good paycheck for a few years as a reward for years of hard work.  For those that have worked hard over the years, there is some marginal tax rate relief. Here, I am referring to small business. Small business generates 80 percent of the new jobs in this country. Small business owners receive 80 percent of the benefits of the marginal rate reductions. When fully phased in, the marginal rate paid by a successful small business will be the same as that paid by General Motors. I don't know how Senators can argue that 35 percent is an appropriate top rate for General Motors, but too low for Joe's Garage.  While I am on the topic of marginal rate relief one political development continues to surprise me. Those on the other side most opposed to the marginal rate relief come from the higher income states, the so-called high-tax or ``blue states'' that tend to be on each coast and around the Western Great Lakes. Taypayers in those states, in particular, bear the brunt of higher marginal rates.  It continues to surprise me that Senators from those high-tax paying states attempt to obstruct tax relief that is most meaningful to their constituents.  Federal taxes squeeze harder in those states where incomes are higher and the cost of living is higher. To this day, I do not understand the virgourous opposition these members have to relieving the high tax burden their constituents face. Instead, members from these states tend to focus on those who don't pay income tax. Maybe members from the other side of the aisle and who are from these states seem oblivious to this disproportionately heavy tax burden. Or maybe they think Federal taxes should be higher. Maybe it's liberal guilt. I cannot figure it out. One has to wonder what the folks in those states who work hard and pay high taxes would think if they took a look at these charts. One has to wonder what they'd think about higher taxes those on the other side seem to yearn for.  The first part of the package provides progressive income tax relief to every American that pays income tax. Let's move on to the second part.  The second part provides income tax relief for married families--for families where both spouses work and where only one spouse works. In addition, thanks to the advocacy of Senator Jeffords, we expanded the Earned Income Credit for married families with children. Further, there was wide bipartisan agreement to simplify the Earned Income Credit which will mean that hundreds of thousands of more children will receive the EIC benefits.  This package contains the first marriage penalty relief in 33 years. Let me repeat that. For the first time in 33 years, we're delivering marriage penalty relief.  Third, the President's desire to expand the child credit to $1000 was metin the bipartisan tax relief package. And in response to the concerns of Senators Snowe, Lincoln, Breaux, and Jeffords the child credit was expanded to help millions of children whose working parents do not pay income tax.  Let's take a look at an example. For a single mother with two children at $16,000 of income, this tax relief package means $600 more in her pocket for this year. That's an increase of almost 4 percent in this single mother's budget. I'm sure she can use the money.  The fourth part of the package dealt with the death tax. The death tax is reduced and finally eliminated--as called for by President Bush. We were successful in this effort due to the work of many Senators but I would particularly note the efforts of Senators Kyl, Phil Gramm, and Lincoln.  Thus, this legislation contained the four main elements of President Bush's efforts to provide tax relief for working families--marginal rate reduction, relief for married families, the expansion of the child credit and the reduction and ultimate elimination of the death tax.  I would remind my colleagues again that the hallmark of this legislation is that relief for low income families comes first. The marginal rate drop to 10 percent was immediate, the child credit expansion to low income families was immediate, the expansion of EIC was immediate.  The greater progressivity of the tax relief legislation is certainly due in no small part to the work of Senator Baucus.  Everyone knows Senator Baucus and other Democrats who crafted this package took a lot of heat from the liberal core of the Democratic Caucus. His objective, like mine, was a bipartisan tax relief package. It seems that while many are happy to talk about bipartisanship they can't stand to see bipartisanship practiced.  In addition to President Bush's proposals to provide tax relief to working families, the tax relief package included legislation that had been considered by the Finance Committee previously.  I believe that not all good ideas come from just one end of Pennsylvania Avenue. Thus, we included the Grassley/Baucus pension reform legislation which probably would not have made it in the bill without the longtime support of Senators Hatch and Jeffords.  That package means $50 billion in tax benefits for enhanced retirement security. That figure will be compounded many times over in retirement assets. A lot of folks like to play political football with retirement security issues. The bipartisan tax relief package actually moved the ball forward on retirement security.  Let's take a look at an example. Under the tax relief legislation, workers will be able to raise their IRA contributions to $5,000 annually. Workers will also be able to put away up to $15,000 annually in their 401(k) accounts.  In addition, the legislation contained over $30 billion in tax benefits targeted for education. Elements of this package included language to expand the prepaid tuition programs to help families pay for college--long advocated by Senators Collins, McConnell, and Sessions. In addition, the package provided a college tuition deduction thanks to Senators Torricelli, Snowe, and Jeffords, private activity bonds for school construction in response to Senator Graham's concerns, as well as an expansion of the education savings accounts--in honor of Senator Coverdell--thanks to the work of Senator Torricelli and Senator Lott.  Let's take a look at an example. Under this legislation, a young couple can contribute $2,000 per year per child to an education IRA. The account enjoys inside buildup tax-free and is available to pay tuition and other college costs.  None of us should forget the great winners of this legislation--the American taxpayer. We provided the American taxpayer the greatest amount of tax relief in a generation. And they deserve it.  With the bipartisan tax relief legislation in place, all taypaying Americans have a little bit more of their money in their pockets. Struggling families will have more money to make ends meet; parents and students will be able to more easily afford the costs of a college education; a successful business woman will be able to expand her business and hire more people; a father finally getting a good paycheck after years of work will be able to better provide for his aging mother; and, a farmer can pass on the family farm without his children having to sell half the land to pay estate taxes.  As an illustration of the breadth of this relief, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a State-by-State analysis of the per taxpayer benefits, prepared by the Tax Foundation.
