Speaker, reserving the right to object, I rise to note that the minority is not going to object.  But let me say we do want to raise a serious issue, that although this has been discussed with the minority, and I know it would not have been brought up, I presume, without such discussion, this is a very unusual procedure to bring up a unanimous consent request other than for speaking time in the period of time for special orders.  The minority, and I speak specifically, for the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia [Ms. Norton], does not want to slow up this legislation. This is obviously very important legislation. We understand the majority's moving this legislation. But we do want to register our concern that this unusual procedure be an exception and not a practice. We do not intend to object at this time.
