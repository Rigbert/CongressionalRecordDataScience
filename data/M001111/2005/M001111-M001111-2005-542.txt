 President, I am very proud to join the senior Democratic Senator from Maryland, along with all of my Democratic women colleagues, to declare that we are going to fight to make sure we have a guaranteed benefit to keep the security in Social Security.  A few short years ago, just after the 1932 stock market crash and the onset of the Great Depression, one of our Nation's greatest leaders, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, set out to create a program to provide peace of mind and a sense of security to America's retirees. During his crusade to create that program, FDR said there is no tragedy in growing old, but there is tragedy in growing old without means of support.
