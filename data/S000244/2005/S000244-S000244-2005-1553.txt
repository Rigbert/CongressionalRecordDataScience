Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge one of my constituents, Eugene P. Sinclair, M.D., as he completes his term as President of the American Society of Anesthesiologists, a 100 year old national professional organization currently representing over 39,000 anesthesiologists.  Founded in 1905, ASA is the predominant professional organization representing medically trained anesthesiologists. Since its founding, ASA has been the leader in the development of patient safety standards and guidelines for the delivery of safe patient care before, during and after surgery. The ASA's efforts on behalf of the specialty have been acknowledged by both the medical and lay press alike. Both The Institute of Medicine (IOM), inits 1999 report on medical errors, and the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO), in its report on improving the medical liability system and preventing patient injury, recognized the successes of organized anesthesiology in improving patient outcomes. In June, the Wall Street Journal, in a front page article, reported on the unique role ASA and anesthesiologists have played in addressing patient safety in the delivery of anesthesia and in reducing their liability costs, holding up anesthesiologists as a model for other specialties to follow.  Dr. Sinclair received his medical degree from Marquette University School of Medicine in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. After medical school, he served in the U.S. Army's distinguished 101st Airborne Division in Ft. Campbell, Kentucky for 3 years. Following his military service, Dr. Sinclair completed his anesthesiology residency at the Milwaukee County General Hospital and the VA Hospital in Wood, Wisconsin.  Dr. Sinclair is currently Chief, Anesthesia Service at the Orthopedic Hospital of Wisconsin. He has been active in the Wisconsin Society of Anesthesiologists, the Milwaukee Society of Anesthesiologists and the State Medical Society of Wisconsin and Milwaukee Country Medical Society.  For ASA, Dr. Sinclair has served as president-elect, first vice president, speaker of the ASA House of Delegates, delegate, and director. He has also served on numerous Society committees and task forces including the committees on quality management and ambulatory surgical care and the task forces on office-based anesthesia and practice management.  During his year as ASA President, Dr. Sinclair devoted countless hours to the pursuit of knowledge, consensus and education regarding the rare but highly publicized problem of awareness under general anesthesia. He also fostered partnerships with many other leading national medical organizations who share the common goal of improved safety and quality of care for the surgical patient.  These are extremely challenging yet rewarding times for anesthesiologists as they shepherd the most vulnerable of patients--from the tiniest babies to the frailest of the elderly--through the most intricate and, in many cases, life-saving, surgical procedures.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today in recognizing Eugene Sinclair, M.D., for his notable career achievements, his exemplary leadership, and his dedication to patient safety.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Pages E1840-E1841]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                 ACKNOWLEDGING EUGENE P.
