 President, I am pleased to introduce this bill today to address problems with the California energy market and the unwillingness of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to take the necessary action.  Last week, the lights went off in California and the governor declared a state of emergency. More than 1 million businesses and homeowners throughout the state lost power. Computers shut off, ATMs stopped dispensing cash, traffic lights went dark and heaters went cold, jeopardizing public safety, the economy, and people's lives.  The situation continues to worsen, and the prognosis for the future is dire. Unfortunately, the problem is not just limited to California. PG and Southern California Edison, our two largest blue chip utilities are on the brink of bankruptcy and have lost billions. The state's economy has also lost billions from work stoppages that seem to occur every single workday.  As goes California so goes the rest of the country, I believe. California is the 6th largest economy in the world. Already financial institutions and banks that have underwritten the debts of our utilities are being saddled with their own problems due to the uncertainty over whether they will be paid.  Those who believe that California deserves its present plight because of the state's deregulation bill are near-sighted. California passed a very flawed de-regulation bill in 1996. It was flawed because it relied almost entirely on a free market and assumed that there will always be adequate energy supply. What has resulted is an uncompetitive market and an absence of adequate supply.  I believe California shares a major responsibility here and I am encouraged that the state legislature is beginning to take action. However, the federal government also has a major responsibility because the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission under the Federal Power Act holds the only authority over energy generators and marketers. The state cannot address this.  Unfortunately, the FERC, even after concluding that rates in California are ``unjust and unreasonable,'' has failed to take the necessary action to solve the crisis. I am thus proposing legislation today to empower the Secretary of Energy to take the same action available to the FERC in instances when FERC has failed to take decisive action. Individual states would be able to opt out of any order from the Secretary as this bill is aimed at helping those states that need and want help.  I urge the Senate to take up and pass this bill as soon as possible.                                 ______                                       By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Levin,         Mr. Thompson, Mr. Lieberman, Ms. Collins, Mr. Schumer, Ms.         Snowe, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Reed, Mr. Durbin, Mr.         Wyden, Mr. Kohl, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Harkin, Ms. Stabenow, and Ms.         Cantwell):  S. 27. A bill to amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to provide bipartisan campaign reform; to the Committee on Rules and Administration.                      campaign reform legislation  Mr. McCain. Mr. President, today we confront yet again a very serious challenge to our political system, as dangerous in its debasing effect on our democracy as war and depression have been in the past. And it will take the best efforts of every public-spirited American to defeat it. We must overcome the cynicism that is growing rampant in our society. We must pass campaign reform legislation.  That is why first I want to thank our cosponsors for being here today. They are proof that momentum is on our side and that we will pass campaign reform legislation and finally follow the American people's will. Action on this issue is long overdue and I am hopeful that this year will present us with our best opportunity yet to achieve passage of meaningful campaign reform.  Our legislation is simple, bi-partisan, and achieves three primary objectives that will go far to reform our electoral system.  The bill: Bans soft money for usage in federal elections; Requires increased disclosure of electioneering communications by so-called independent organizations in a constitutional and clear manner (the Snowe-Jeffords language); and Codifies the Supreme Court's Beck decision, a court decision effectively ignored by the previous Clinton Administration and now, under this Act, a decision which would be strictly enforced.  After one of the closest elections in our nation's history, there's one thing the American people are unanimous about--they want their government back. We can to that by ridding politics of large, unregulated contributionsthat give special interests a seat at the table while average Americans are stuck in the back of the room. The Senate needs to act early on campaign finance reform so we can achieve meaningful reform and restore the public's faith in their government.  This is not a perfect bill. It does not attempt to solve all the evils that plague our campaign system. But we will not let perfect be the enemy of progress. We expect amendments to be offered to this legislation and we fully expect that many of those amendments will be constructive and add to our efforts. We look forward to that kind of positive debate.  Second, whatever bill passes, it must treat our corporate and union constituencies alike. We must resist any measures that skew this bill in favor of any one group. The soft money ban in this bill affects both corporations and unions.  And for my Republican friends, I want to emphasize again, if this bill passes, the $100,000-plus union soft money checks to the Democratic Party will no longer exist. According to the Washington Post, the ``biggest donor of soft money in the (last) campaign was the American Federal of State, County, and Municipal Employees (which) gave the Democratic National Committee $1.27 million in last October and early November. AFSCME's soft money total for the election cycle was $6.3 million.'' Passage of this bill will end this practice once and for all.  The key to our success now lies with a fair and open debate on this subject. In the past, we have been denied any constructive debate on this matter. I am hopeful that Senators Lott and Daschle and the co-sponsors of the bill can construct a fair unanimous consent agreement that will allow the Senate to take up and consider numerous amendments, work its will, and craft legislation that can and will be signed into law by the President. That is now our singular goal. And I am confident it can be achieved.  Mr. President, I hope we can soon take up and pass this crucial legislation.
