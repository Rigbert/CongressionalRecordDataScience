President, I rise today to offer legislation to protect the residents of Treece, Kansas from the potential danger of remaining in an area that is undergoing a Superfund cleanup. I commend my fellow Kansas colleague, Congresswoman Nancy Boyda, for introducing similar legislation in the House.  Treece is located in Cherokee County, Kansas. The Cherokee County site encompasses 115 square miles of former mining area. Mining in this area dates back to the early 1900s and at one time contained the richest lead and zinc ore production in the world. Although the drilling stopped in 1970, the effects of over 60 years of mining can be seen for miles around with mountains of milling left behind. Below these mountains, and surrounding areas, are enormous holes large enough to fit a football stadium, and they continually threaten the everyday safety of the residents of this community.  Cherokee County is part of a larger area known as the Tri-State Mining District that encompasses cities in southeastern Kansas, southwestern Missouri and northeastern Oklahoma. Within the Tri-State Mining District are two towns of particular importance, Treece, Kansas and Picher, Oklahoma. While these two towns are separated by a State line they are only a mere two miles away from one another. These two communities share more than a State line; they share a major highway, local stores, and most importantly the concerns of the aftermath of over 60 years of mining on their health, safety and the ultimate survival of their towns.  Currently Picher, part of the Tar Creek Superfund site, is undergoing a Federal buyout. The residents of Treece rely heavily on the services provided to them by Picher. Without that support the economic stability and ultimate survival of their town is in danger. Therefore, in order to assist the residents of Treece, I offer this legislation today to authorize the Environmental Protection Agency to make available to the state of Kansas $6,000,000, in 2009. This money will be used for the voluntary purchase of certain properties in Treece and will also allow for the relocation of community residents. This legislation will provide the residents of Treece an opportunity to relocate to another town of their choosing. An opportunity that they may not have without the Environmental Protection Agency's assistance.                                 ______                                       By
