President, today I am proud to introduce the Northern Forest Stewardship Act of 1995, a bill that represents the highest standards of the legislative process. The legislation we are introducing is founded on extensive research, open discussion, consensus decisions, and visionary problem solving. The goal of this bill is to capture perfectly the vision of Northern Forest Lands Council and northern communities.  The Northern Forest Lands Council process was initiated to avoid the divisive conflicts that have torn communities apart in some regions of our country. Too often we have seen parties fuel conflicts for political gain, exacerbate conflicts with misinformation, or prolong conflicts in hopes of a one-sided windfall. Over the past 4 years, the Northern Forest communities made dedicated effort to steer clear of divisive conflict to chart a future for themselves. They have worked hard to develop a consensus vision. We owe it to them to deliver the requests they have made.  This legislation delivers these requests. It goes no further than the Council's recommendations and nor does it fall short. This bill includes a package of technical and financial assistance programs that I believe this Congress can and should support. Sometimes studies are commissioned primarily to delay solution or pacify a problem. The Council's study was driven by a desire to achieve something. The northern forest delegation will not let this study sit on a shelf. Between the Family Forestland Preservation Act (S. 692) and the Northern Forest Stewardship Act, Congress can achieve for the people of the Northern Forest the requests they have made of us.  The legislation embodies the conservation ethic of the 1990's--non-regulatory incentives and assistance to realize community-based goals for sustainable economic and environmental prosperity. The rights and responsibilities of landowners are emphasized, the primacy of the state is reinforced, and the traditions of the region are protected. And yet, the bill also promotes new ways of achieving our goals and a common vision that did not exist several years ago. Moving ahead with the Council's work, we will pursue enhanced forest management, land protection that supports the recreational and wildlife needs of the region, integrated research and decision making, and increased productivity in the traditional industries and new compatible industries. Through this bill, I hope to boost sustainable development and protect the ecological integrity of biological resources across the landscape. The nation has taken notice of this highly successful effort as a model for meeting the conservation challenges of the country, and I am confident of its inevitable success.  I welcome the constructive input of people who will compare this legislation with the recommendations, research, and public participation in the Northern Forest Lands Council.  It is my goal to create a perfect representation of the future described in the report to Congress Finding Common Ground: Conserving the Northern Forest. Most of all, I want the Council's solutions to work, and work well. I hope all affected citizens will take advantage of the opportunity to shape the final product of their hard work.  I want to congratulate the members of the Council for their success, and most importantly the people of the Northern Forest for their enthusiasm for this process. Thousands of people took time from their busy lives to drive down to a school auditorium, local restaurant, or hotel auditorium to share their views on the Northern Forest. Hundreds more put pen to paper or picked up the phone to register their thoughts. Without their effort, this would be an empty process. It is a vibrant process and the will of the majority produced a brilliant piece of work.  I will include a short section by section summary of the bill for the Record that emphasizes the Council recommendation that inspired each provision. I also want to thank Senators Gregg, Jeffords, Cohen and Snowe for their contributions to this draft, and I look forward to working with entire delegation to refine this legislation if necessary, and move it through the Senate in the upcoming months.  Mr. President, the Council's process has the highest integrity, the recommendations reflect the true consensus vision of the Northern Forest communities, and I believe we owe it to Northern New England to follow through on their expectations.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                       Section-by-Section Summary                                Overview       The Northern Forest Stewardship Act takes the specific      consensus proposals of the Northern Forest Lands Council that      require Congressional action and translates them into      legislation. The Council's proposals reflect four years of      research and public input refined and condensed by the      diverse membership of the Council. This bill, together with      the Family Forestland Preservation Act (S. 692), goes no      further than, nor falls short of, the Council's proposals for      the Northern Forest lands. Affected parties are encouraged      submit constructive comments to their Congressional      delegation to make this a perfect representation of the      Council's consensus vision. The authorities in this bill are      voluntary opportunities for technical and financial      assistance to states, landowners, businesses and scientists      to work in partnership with the federal government and each      other to achieve stewardship goals.           section 1: title--northern forest stewardship act                        section 2: declarations       The first ten principles are lifted from the Council's      fundamental principles on page 15 of the report to Congress.      The eleventh one is added to make them relevant to this bill.                   section 3: marketing cooperatives       Section 3 implements recommendation #23 to facilitate the      formation of forestry cooperatives. Timber growers are      eligible to form cooperatives under the Capper-Volstead Act      of 1922, but few cooperative efforts in New England have been      successful. This provision directs the Secretary to provide      assistance and evaluate the opportunities to increase      profitability and improve forest management through      cooperatives.                section 4: principles of sustainability       Section 4 implements recommendations #10 and #11 to define      measurable benchmarks for sustainability and facilitate the      formation of best management practice to achieve      sustainability. The principles of sustainability for Sec      (4)(b) are lifted from page 42 of the Council's report.            section 5: northern forest research cooperative       Section 5 implements recommendations #33 to form a research      cooperative much like Senator Gorton's ``Blue Mountain      Institute'' in the 1990 Farm Bill with objectives defined on      page 86 of the Council's report.              section 6: interstate coordination strategy       Section 6 implements the recommendation on page 95 to      facilitate continued dialogue between the four states.      Section 6 names representatives to an interstate working      group with wide flexibility to include state roundtables.                  section 7: labor safety and training       Section 7 implements recommendation #27 to improve worker      safety and thereby reduce operating costs for forest products      companies.                      section 8: land conservation       Section 8 implements recommendations #16 and 17 to improve      funding opportunities for public land acquisition by both the      states and the federal government. This creates a new      authority to protect important recreation and conservation      land but does not guarantee increased funding. Section 8 also      establishes a public process for prioritizing public      acquisition.                section 9: landowner liability exemption       Section 9 expresses the Sense of the Senate that states      should enact laws to reduce the liability of landowners who      make their lands available for free public use as requested      in recommendation #26.                    section 10: nongame conservation       Section 10 expresses the sense of the Senate that a      mechanism is needed to protect non-game wildlife using a user      fee similar to the Wallop-Breaux and Pittman-Robertson      programs as requested in recommendation #14. A full      legislative proposal may be ready within the year and it      should be considered after it has been introduced.     section 11: authorization for appropriations/rural development       Section 11 provides such sums as necessary for      implementation and authorizes targeted rural development      funding for the Northern Forest states through the Rural      Development Through Forestry program.                                 ______      By
