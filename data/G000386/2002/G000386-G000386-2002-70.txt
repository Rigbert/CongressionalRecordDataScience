 President, I rise to oppose the amendment before us. For the third time in as many weeks, a mostly partisan Democrat prescription drug bill is about to fail on this floor. And beyond failing here, today's amendment, from what I've heard of it, fails seniors and taxpayers as well. I still haven't seen the bill language itself. But from what I've heard, it fails seniors because it fails to cover most of them. From what we know of the proposal--and we are only this afternoon getting the details--most middle income seniors will get next to nothing when it comes to prescription drug coverage.  My friends on the other side of the aisle have accomplished quite a feat--they have managed to write a Medicare prescription drug proposal that does less with more money. Their proposal provides generous coverage to beneficiaries below 200 percent of poverty. There is nothing wrong with that. I agree that scarce resources should be used wisely by Congress to target money where it is needed the most.  However, their proposal provides almost no assistance to Medicare beneficiaries whose incomes exceed $18,952 a year. A senior at 201 percent of poverty will receive no meaningful coverage under the Graham proposal until she has spent 17 percent of her income on drugs. A married couple at 201 percent of poverty will spend 25 percent of their annual income on drugs before both gain catastrophic coverage protection. To make matters worse. Three-quarters of seniors above 200 percent of poverty have other prescription drug coverage. Since these plans cover some drug expenses, and because the Graham plan does not have a basic benefit, these folks will receive no help even if they have total drug expenses over $3,300. A typical senior above 200 percent of poverty will receive approximately $6 of assistance every monthtoward their prescription drug expenses.  The Congressional Budget Office has given Graham a preliminary cost estimate of $389.5 billion. Keep in mind, though, that CBO did not have legislative language to review at the time they completed their cost estimate. So, depending on what legislative language is included in the Graham proposal--it could cost more than $400 billion.  The tripartisan bill with an official CBO cost estimate of $370 billion provides a solid benefit for all Medicare beneficiaries. Lower-income enrollees are provided with additional protections, which, as I said before, is appropriate.  What the tripartisan bill has that Graham does not is a significant drug benefit for every single Medicare enrollee. Under our 21st Century Medicare Act, enrollees will save on average 50 percent off their drug bills. And, lower-income enrollees will see a 95 percent savings in their drug bills.  The Graham bill fails these people. It fails them badly. Indeed, these failures amount to a massive failure for this body. Under Senator Daschle's leadership, Democrats and Democrats alone have tried to write partisan legislation on the Senate floor time and time again this summer.  That has gotten us nowhere. It has led to chaos, to partisanship and, as I said just a minute ago, to failure.  So, where are we now? It looks like we are ready for another mostly partisan vote on a pretty much partisan bill--another vote that will fail to get 60 votes, and will fail to give seniors the help they need.  We could have been somewhere far different from this. The House passed a bill. We could have been in conference with the House at this point. The President wants a bill. We could have been in the Rose Garden. Senator Daschle says he wants a bill, but what has taken place here over the last 3 weeks means he really wants something else: an issue.  Had regular order been followed, had the Finance Committee been given the right to work its bipartisan will, we could have had far more than just an issue. We could be far closer to providing real, affordable and universal prescription drug benefits than we are today. The sponsors of the Tripartisan bill, the only bipartisan bill in all of Washington to provide comprehensive, universal coverage on at a cost that is far lower than that in the amendment before us now, were ready and willing to talk to anyone about compromises. We still are.  But we were denied the right to a markup in the Finance Committee. I believe that if it had been given the chance to work its will, the Finance Committee would have reported out a bipartisan proposal, based on the tripartisan 21st century Medicare Act we introduced earlier this month.  I've said it before, everyone in this chamber knows that for anything of this magnitude to pass--and adding a prescription drug benefit to Medicare is the single greatest entitlement expansion in history--it needs to get 60 votes.  And everyone in this chamber knows that the only way to get 60 votes is to have bipartisan support. The proper place to find bipartisan support is in the Finance Committee, not on the Senate floor.  By bypassing the Finance Committee entirely and doing drafting on the floor--literally on the backs of envelopes--the Democrat leadership has led us to where we are today: In shambles.  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to sweep up the shambles on the Senate floor and start over. We can and should do better.  I ask unanimous consent that a statement by several organizations be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                    July 29, 2002.The Graham-Smith Proposal: Changing the Nature of Medicare is No Way to                Celebrate the 37th Anniversary of Medicare     To: Members of the United States Senate:       On June 14, 2002, our organizations sent a letter to      Chairmen Tauzin and Thomas in support of their Medicare      legislation. We were very clear when we gave our support that      our goal was to ensure a voluntary prescription drug benefit      which would be available to all Medicare beneficiaries.       The Graham-Smith low-income/catastrophic amendment provides      complete drug benefits for only the very poor. The Washington      Post reports that ``millions of seniors `in the middle' would      not qualify for any prescription drug benefits at all under      the Graham-Smith legislation.'' In short, the middle class      would, in fact, receive no meaningful coverage under the      Graham-Smith amendment. This means test violates the      fundamental principle of Medicare social insurance that it is      a universal program, not an anti-poverty program. It is      ironic that on the same day that America's senior celebrate      the 37th anniversary of the enactment of Medicare (July 30,      1965), the United States Senate will be considering a      proposal that takes us a very significant step away from the      general entitlement that Medicare has always been.       The passage of such legislation would change the nature and      intent of America's 37-year-old Medicare program. We      respectfully ask you to oppose this amendment and enact      meaningful prescription drug coverage which would give all      Medicare beneficiaries access, coverage and choice.
