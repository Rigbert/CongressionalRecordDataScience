You see, the Republicans have passed the Gingrich budget which makes deep cuts in Medicare, imposes new taxes on working families and, frankly, President Clinton and many of the congressional Democrats have said we find this unacceptable.  So how will Speaker Gingrich force through these changes? What he suggested we do is, frankly, to have the so-called train wreck, in other words, we do not appropriate money for Federal agencies so they have to turn out the lights, and even worse, we would basically not extend the debt ceiling of the United States as is necessary.  What is the debt ceiling? It is basically the full faith and credit of this Government behind our financial obligations. Now, there is a coalition of 130 Republicans led by a Michigan Republican Member of this House who has come up with suggestions to the Treasury Department printed in this morning's Washington Times about how they can get by even if we do not extend the debt ceiling. Do you know what they suggest, these Republicans? They suggest that we do not send the refunds to people for their income tax returns next year. That is one of their bright ideas.  The second one is, do not put money in the Social Security trust fund. That is the height of irresponsibility.                          ____________________
