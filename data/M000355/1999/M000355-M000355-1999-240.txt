 We just approved 18 more from a list compiled at 1 p.m., the deadline for getting amendments to the desk.  There are 5 more amendments we withdrew that will not be offered. That leaves 12 amendments, I say to my friend from Vermont, that remain to be addressed.  We are working on paring that list down further.
