 President, today, I and Senator Hatch are introducing a joint resolution to express the concern of the Congress regarding some recent remarks that inaccurately malign the integrity of the Nation's law enforcement officers.  It has been my privilege to work closely with our Nation's State and local police officers throughout my career. And, whether I have been dealing with officers who protect citizens in one of Delaware's smallest towns or those who patrol our Nation's largest cities, I have been impressed by the level of honor, commitment and integrity they have consistently upheld. Indeed, the evidence is that vast majority of our Nation's law enforcement officers are conscientious public servants who have a job where they must literally be willing to lay their life on the line everyday they go to work.  Let me be clear, I do not being to claim that there are no ``bad apples'' among the Nation's 540,000 police officers--as in every profession, there are ``bad apples'' who violate the law. But, this does not justify any sweeping indictment of the ethics of the entire police profession, any more than a case of malpractice by a doctor justifies sweeping criticism of the entire medical profession.  Because I believe it is simply unfair to make allegations about a whole profession based on the actions of a tiny minority and because I have enjoyed such a close and, I hope, mutually respectful relationship with our Nation's police officers, I am introducing this legislation so that the Congress is on record as recognizing the integrity of our Nation's police profession. I am happy to be joined by Senator Hatch on this measure, and I look forward to other Senators joining us in this effort.  The morale of our Nation's police officers is dependent upon the respect they feel from all of us, such is the case for any profession. This resolution is but one of many chances the Senate will have this year to indicate our confidence in our Nation's police. Later this year, I expect that the Senate will be faced with legislation that will nullify the provisions of the Violent Crime Control Act of 1994 that will add 100,000 more police to our streets. Those who believe that our Nation's police do not live up to the highest ethical standards may oppose this effort to add 100,000 officers to their ranks. But, those of us who know that the overwhelming majority of our police meet these high standards, must protect this effort to add 100,000 state and local police to America's neighborhoods.  I admit that the resolution I introduce today offers but some small measure of rhetorical support. The real support for our Nation's police will be shown by continuing our commitment to add 100,000 more officers to the ranks of those who protect us all. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.                          ____________________
