President, I am pleased to join with my colleague from Idaho, Senator Mike Crapo, in introducing the Geothermal Energy Investment Act of 2010. This legislation will amend an already existing investment tax credit for geothermal energy authorized under Sec. 48 of the tax code. The bill would provide geothermal energy with the same 30 percent investment tax credit that is now available to solar energy and fuel cell technologies in Sec. 48 and extend this 30 percent tax credit for geothermal through December 31, 2016, as it is for these other technologies. Without this legislation, new geothermal energy projects would be allowed only a 10 percent investment tax credit under Section 48. This legislation will create a more level playing field among clean, renewable energy technologies and support substantial growth in utility scale geothermal power, distributed on-site power generation, and heating for buildings and commercial processes.  Geothermal energy facilities provide a continuous supply of renewable energy with very few environmental impacts. Although the United States has more geothermal capacity than any other country, this potential has been barely tapped. This shortfall is partly due to the high initial cost and risk involved in locating and developing geothermal resources. Extending the 30 percent tax credit through 2016 will help give geothermal developers the assurance they need to make the long lead-time investments in exploration and development necessary to make expansion of geothermal energy a reality.  This legislation is identical to a bipartisan companion bill, H.R. 5612, that Representative Earl Blumenauer from Oregon has introduced in the House.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3788       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Geothermal Energy Investment      Act of 2010''.     SEC. 2. TEMPORARY INCREASE IN INVESTMENT TAX CREDIT FOR                    GEOTHERMAL ENERGY PROPERTY.
