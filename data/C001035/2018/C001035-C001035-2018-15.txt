President, I am delighted to commend Dr. Levesque Elementary School in Frenchville, ME, on being named a 2018 National Blue Ribbon Exemplary High Performing School. This outstanding school is one of only 349 schools across the country to receive Blue Ribbon recognition from the U.S. Department of Education this year.  Created in 1982, the Blue Ribbon Schools Program honors public and private schools that are either academically superior in their States or that demonstrate significant gains in student achievement. The schools singled out for this national recognition are models of high educational standards and accountability.  This award continues a tradition of quality education at Dr. Levesque Elementary School, which first received a Blue Ribbon in 1999. Serving 128 students from the small rural communities of Frenchville and St. Agatha in northern Aroostook County, this school is succeeding in its mission to encourage engaged lifelong learners. As a native of Aroostook County, I am especially proud of this accomplishment.  Faculty and staff are committed to both academic excellence and each child's social, emotional, and physical health. They work to ensure a safe and secure learning environment and to develop strong and collaborative relationships with parents and community members. Teachers emphasize math and reading, while also giving students rich and diverse opportunities, from art and music to robotics and physical education. The Franco-American communities of Frenchville and St. Agatha are bilingual, and the school provides daily instruction in the French language and Acadian culture.  The school's name is a tribute to Dr. Romeo Levesque, who provided expert, dedicated, and compassionate medical care to these communities for many decades. The strong school community, where students are encouraged to pursue their interests and to be of service to others, honors his memory.  I applaud the administrators, teachers, staff, and parents of Dr. Levesque Elementary School. Together, they are succeeding in their mission to build students' confidence and generate momentum for learning. They are making a difference in the lives of their students, helping them reach their full potential as independent, responsible learners and citizens. I congratulate the entire school community for this outstanding achievement.                          ____________________
