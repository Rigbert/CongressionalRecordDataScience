 Leahy) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:                              S. Res. 122       Whereas Slobodan Milosevic has been transferred to the      International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia to face      charges of crimes against humanity;       Whereas the transfer of Slobodan Milosevic and other      indicted war criminals is a triumph of international justice      and the rule of law in Serbia;       Whereas corruption and warfare under the Milosevic regime      caused Yugoslavia extensive economic damage, including an      estimated $29,400,000,000 in lost output and a foreign debt      that exceeds $12,200,000,000; and       Whereas democrats and reformers in the Federal Republic of      Yugoslavia deserve the support and encouragement of the      United States: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That (a) the Senate hereby--       (1) recognizes the courage of Serbian democrats, in      particular, Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic, in      facilitating the transfer of Slobodan Milosevic to the      International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia; and       (2) calls for the continued transfer of indicted war      criminals to the International Criminal Tribunal for      Yugoslavia and the release of all political prisoners held in      Serbian prisons.       (b) It is the sense of the Senate that the United States      should remain committed to providing foreign assistance to      support the success of economic, political, and legal reforms      in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, Senator Leahy and I welcome the news of the transfer yesterday of Slobodan Milosevic to the International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia, ICTY. Last year, we worked to include language in the fiscal year 2001 Foreign Operations Appropriations bill to condition assistance to Serbia on, among other issues, certification by the President that the government is cooperating with the ICTY on the ``surrender and transfer'' of war criminals to The Hague.  While our efforts to secure justice for the victims of Milosevic's atrocities through Section 594 of P.L. 106-429 contributed to dramatic events in early April, when Milosevic was first arrested, and again yesterday, the real credit for facilitating the transfer belongs to Serbian democrats and reformers, in particular Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic. I am pleased that they recognize the importance of forward progress on the issue of war crimes, and I think it bodes well for the country's overall prospects for successful economic, political, and legal reforms.  The resolution we submit today recognizes the courage of Serbian democrats and reaffirms our commitment to providing U.S. foreign assistance to support much needed reforms in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY). We hope that Prime Minister Djindjic, and other reformers, continue to demonstrate courageous leadership, such asthey did yesterday. Other indicated war criminals should be transferred to The Hague and all political prisoners in Serbian jails should be immediately released.  There is no victory sweeter than justice. It is now up to the ICTY to deliver justice to the victims and the survivors of atrocities committed in Kosovo, Bosnia, and Croatia.
