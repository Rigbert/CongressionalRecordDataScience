President, several analyses of the water infrastructure funding gap have been released. The analyses show gaps ranging from $3 billion a year to $23 billion a year. Regardless of which number one chooses, the evidence is mounting that we as a nation are not investing enough in the infrastructure that provides Americans with clean and safe water.  Much of that gap is due to the rising cost municipalities must incur to meet ever-growing Federal regulations. Regulations that are kicking in at a time when many treatment plants are exceeding their expected life time.  Clearly, if the Federal Government is going to continue imposing insurmountable costs on our towns, it must be willing to put forth a fair share of the money. As the Chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I am working with two of the sponsors of this amendment, Senator Jeffords and Crapo, to craft a water infrastructure bill.  One thing that we have had in common throughout these negotiations is a belief that more money is needed. I was very pleased to see that the budget committee restored the funding cut to the clear water SRF.  However, cutting or even level funding the program is not the answer. We simply must find a way to provide more resources to these programs, fulfill our obligations and then allow the States to run their programs without further Federal contributions, as Congress always intended.  While I very much support my colleagues' efforts to get more money for these programs, I have not yet settled on what I believe is the appropriate level. I am supporting this amendment in concept and urge my colleagues to also vote yes. As chairman of the EPW Committee, I assure my colleagues that we are on the verge of a true crisis.  I support the Crapo-Jeffords amendment.
