 President, I am very proud to be here this morning with the other Democratic women of the Senate in urging the leadership to talk about the issues that are the true priorities of the American people. The issue I am talking about today is so important, and that is the treatment of our Nation's veterans. Our military men and women and their families are sacrificing every day for all of us. It should be our duty to honor that sacrifice, whether it is with jobs or training, support or health care. But on this issue, the Republican leadership has failed miserably.  Today, the Department of Veterans Affairs continues to be overwhelmed and underfunded. Listen to what we know. The VA is currently seeing 38 percent more Iraq war veterans than they budgeted for--38 percent more. In fact, in fiscal year 2006, the VA expected to provide medical care to 110,000, but that number is now closer to 170,000, and those veterans are waiting over a year to get the specialty care they need and deserve.  In Seattle, we have VA medical centers with over 2,000 veterans on waiting lists to get an initial doctor's appointment. Veterans around the country are waiting 18 months just to get their benefits. On Monday it was reported in the New York Times that veterans' spouses are being faced with an impenetrable wall of bureaucracy as they try to collect their survivor benefits.  To me, and to my women colleagues, that is simply intolerable. We are also woefully unprepared for the rising toll of post-traumatic stress disorder and other battlefield-related mental illnesses that are hitting our troops. Right now, it is estimated that one-third--one-third--of the 1.3 million Americans who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan are facing mental health challenges when they get home. The Department of Veterans Affairs recently revealed to us that it is on a pace to see nearly 20,000 new cases of postcombat stress this fiscal year among troops. Guess how many they estimated to see: 2,900. So they thought they would have 2,900, but they are on a pace to see 20,000. A VA Under Secretary noted that some of our VA clinics don't provide mental health care, or if they do, she said, waiting lists render that care virtually inaccessible. Our service men and women, veterans, and their families deserve more than virtually inaccessible care. We have to do more.  On top of that, we have to be working to pass Federal legislation that addresses the employment needs of veterans who are coming back home from the battle front. Do my colleagues know that among 20- to 24-year-olds, unemployment for veterans is double that of nonveterans, and it is three times the national average? That is unacceptable. Iraq war veterans are coming home, they are losing their jobs, they are not getting medical care, they are having a hard time accessing benefits, and they are struggling to just get by.  We have a job to do in this Senate, and that is why the Democratic women are here today to talk about our checklist for change and focusing on our veterans. Last week, I successfully amended the fiscal year 2007 Agriculture appropriations bill to include $160 million to deal with the data theft of 26.5 million veterans. We have to make sure that our veterans don't have the double whammy of losing their data and then losing their health care to pay for it.  Our service men and women deserve a new direction. So today we challenge the Republican leadership to include the real cost of care for our veterans when they submit their budget and to do right by our veterans and our military families by holding hearings on the holes in transition assistance, mental health care, and health care that our veterans and families need.  Caring for our veterans is not a Republican or Democratic issue, it is an American issue. We call on this Congress to right now do the most patriotic thing we can do, and that is to fulfill our promise to our Nation's veterans.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter to Senator Frist from all of the Democratic women outlining our checklist for change and our call for action.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                  Democratic Women for Change,                                                    June 21, 2006.     Hon. William H. Frist,     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Frist, We, the Democratic women of the Senate,      are writing to challenge you to change direction, change the      tone, and change the agenda to match the priorities of the      American people.       There are approximately 50 days left in this legislative      session--still plenty of time to change direction and focus      instead on meeting the challenges that affect the American      people in their daily lives.       To that end, we present you with our ``Checklist for      Change''--nine challenges that Congress can meet right now.      We ask that these goals be considered during the remainder of      this session of Congress:       Safeguard America's Pensions: Americans deserve to retire      with dignity and financial security. We will continue to      oppose any plan to privitize social security, because seniors      deserve a guarantee rather than a gamble. Recent corporate      corruption and mismanagement has shown us that we must also      protect employee pension plans. The Republican Congress has      stalled these efforts. For the good of all American workers,      we challenge the Republican Congress to pass a clean pension      reform bill.       Keep Good Jobs in America: We need a jobs agenda that      fights for American workers and businesses. The flight of      American jobs overseas must be reversed. Currency      manipulation and the free flow of counterfeit goods from      countries like China have put American workers at an unfair      disadvantage for too long. We challenge the Republican      Congress to enact tax policies that Stop the outsourcing of      American jobs, to level the international playing field by      enforcing our trade agreements, and to raise the minimum      wage.       Make College Affordable for All: The best guarantee of a      good job is a quality education. In America, 170,000 college-     ready students don't attend college each year because the      cost is too high. Yet the Bush Administration has taken $12      billion from student aid programs to pay for tax cuts for the      wealthiest Americans. We cballenge the Republican Congress to      increase the maximum Pell Grant, make the college tuition      tax credit permanent, and cut student loan interest rates.       Protect America and our Military Families: It is our duty      to care for the brave men     and women who defend our nation at home and abroad. Yet the      Bush Administration consistently shortchanges healthcare and      other benefits for veterans, leaving many soldiers waiting a      year or more treatment. We challenge the Republic Congress to      provide benefits funding for veterans and to hold hearings on      mental health care and transition assistance for those coming      back from war abroad.       Prepare for Future Disasters: Nearly five years after      September 11th and ten months after Hurricane Katrina, the      Federal Government is still woefully unprepared to deal with      potential future disasters. We challenge the Republican      Congress to restore disaster to cabinet-level status; to      implement the recommendations of the September 11th      Commission; to develop safe evacuation plans; and to reform      the Stafford Act to better manage large catastrophes.       Make America Energy Independent: America's lack of a      coherent energy policy is weakening national security,      hurting our pocketbooks, violating our common values and      threatening our children's future. The Strategic Energy Fund      bill will cut our dependence on foreign oil in half by 2025,      invest in efficient energy alternatives and create good      American jobs. We challenge the Republican Congress to pass      the Strategic Energy Fund bill.       Make Small Business Healthcare Affordable: More than 46      million Americans are uninsured. Small businesses create two      out of every three new jobs in America and account for nearly      half of America's overall employment, yet just 26% of      businesses with 50 or fewer employees provide health      insurance. The Small Employers Health Benefits Program will      create affordable, private health insurance for small      businesses and give parents the comfort of knowing that their      children are protected. We challenge the Republican Congress      to pass this crucial legislation.       Invest in Life Saving Science: Stem cell research provides      real hope for cures to many of the world's deadliest      diseases. Against the wishes of the American people, the Bush      Administration and the Republican Congress have blocked      efforts to expand stem cell research so that scientists and      doctors have every tool at their disposal to keep us healthy      and safe. As a result, America trails the rest of the world      in research. We challenge the Republican Congress to pass      stem cell legislation this summer.       Protect our Air, land and Water: The Bush Administration      has been negligent in protecting Americans from environmental      hazards. They have ignored the consensus of the best      scientists in the world when it comes to the threat of global      warming, and they have recklessly reduced clean ups of toxic      waste at Superfund sites. We challenge the Republican      Congress to pass a comprehensive science-based bill to reduce      greenhouse gases and to restore funding for Superfund      cleanup.       We hope that you will put these bedrock issues on the      agenda, because the American people are counting on us to      fight for them. We can and must do better.           Sincerely,         Barbara Mikulski, Barbara Boxer, Maria Cantwell, Hillary            Rodham Clinton, Diane Feinstein, Mary Landrieu, Blanche            Lincoln, Patty Murray, Debbie Stabenow.
