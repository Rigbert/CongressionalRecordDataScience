President, I agree with the Senator from New Hampshire, and I intend to work with him in a bipartisan manner to promote land conservation by pushing forward the recommendations made by the Northern Forest Lands Council in 1994. As highlighted in S. 552, the Forestland Preservation Tax Act, certain tax polices work against the long-term ownership and management of forestland and instead force landowners to sell or change the use of their land. H.R. 2014 begins to address this program with the provisions for conservation easements and estate tax relief for small businesses and family farms. In the Northeast, the timber production is part of our agriculture and faces many of the same challenges as family farms.
