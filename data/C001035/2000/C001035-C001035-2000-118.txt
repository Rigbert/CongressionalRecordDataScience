President, I rise today to discuss with the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee the provision of the FY 2001 Defense appropriations bill that defers full funding for two LPD 17 class vessels. The Landing Platform Dock (LPD) 17, San Antonio class, is the latest class of amphibious force ship for the United States Navy. This ship shoulders the critical mission of transporting marines, helicopters, and air-cushioned landing craft to trouble spots around the world. Moreover, the LPD 17 is a model of acquisition reform.  Mr. Chairman, I am very concerned about the deferral of funds that would have been used to procure two LPD 17 class ships in fiscal year 2001. As chairman of the Senate Committee on Appropriations, what is the nature of your commitment to this program?
