President, I applaud the authorization of $15 million for the DOD-VA Cooperative Research Program. Authorization of these funds will guarantee the continuation of this laudable research effort.  The DOD-VA Cooperative Research Program supports important research that contributes significantly to the health missions of both DOD and the Department of Veterans Affairs [VA]. Since 1987, the VA medical and prosthetics research appropriation has been supplemented by funds transferred to VA under a cooperative agreement with DOD. The DOD-VA research program has become a truly collaborative effort and one that is mutually beneficial to both DOD and VA. The work performed under this program addresses conditions affecting both active duty personnel and veterans, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, the consequences of exposure to environmental hazards, wound repair, brain and spinal cord injury, and skin and vascular repair. No other program supports this type of mission-relevant cooperative research.  I expect that with this funding, areas of mutual interest to DOD and VA in the fields of medical and psychological research will continue. Specifically, this funding encourages innovative endeavors in accordance with the five jointly established programs: the DOD-VA environmental epidemiology research center; research on psychological diseases and post-traumatic stress disorder; cardiovascular fitness; research in prostate cancer and emerging pathogens; and casualty care enhancement.  It is imperative for the health and well-being of our veterans and active-duty military personnel that Congress continue to fund this important initiative by authorizing $15 million for the DOD-VA Cooperative Research Program. This is the least that we can do in recognition of the invaluable service rendered by our veterans and military personnel.                           AMENDMENT NO. 817   (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that the process of enlarging the North Atlantic Treaty Organization should be a continuous                                 process)       On page 347, between lines 15 and 16, insert the following:     SEC. 1075. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING EXPANSION OF THE                    NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANIZATION.       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:       (1) The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) met on      July 8 and 9, 1997, in Madrid, Spain, and issued invitations      to the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland to begin accession      talks to join NATO.       (2) Congress has expressed its support for the process of      NATO enlargement by approving the NATO Enlargement      Facilitation Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-208; 22 U.S.C. 1928      note) by a vote of 81-16 in the Senate, and 353-65 in the      House of Representatives.       (3) The United States has assured that the process of      enlarging NATO will continue after the first round of      invitations in July.       (4) Romania and Slovenia are to be commended for their      progress toward political and economic reform and meeting the      guidelines for prospective membership in NATO.       (5) In furthering the purpose and objective of NATO in      promoting stability and well-being in the North Atlantic      area, NATO should invite Romania, Slovenia, and any other      democratic states of Central and Eastern Europe to accession      negotiations to become NATO members as expeditiously as      possible upon the satisfaction of all relevant membership      criteria.       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate      that NATO should be commended--       (1) for having committed to review the process of enlarging      NATO at the next NATO summit in 1999; and       (2) for singling out the positive developments toward      democracy and rule of law in Romania and Slovenia.
