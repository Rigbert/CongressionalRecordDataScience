I wanted to ask you one final question that is another key element to reforming this outdated law. It should be clear to all that H.R. 2576 attempts to ensure that the Environmental Protection Agency takes the possible exposures to sensitive subpopulations into account when prioritizing, assessing and regulating high priority chemical substances. The goal, of course, is to ensure that factors that may influence exposures or risk are considered as the Agency assesses and determines the safety of chemical substances.  A concern, however, could be that the language regarding sensitive subpopulations may be read by some to promote the concept of ``low dose linearity'' or ``no threshold'' for many chemicals, including substances that are not carcinogens. This concept has not been firmly established in the scientific community. Does H.R. 2576 address this concern?
