 I want to say as we close this colloquy--which some people will say was one of our more tame colloquies--perhaps that's appropriate. On a week that we did have an opportunity to come together, I want to thank the gentleman. I want to again say that Neil Bradley did an excellent job working with John Hughes and my staff and the Financial Services staff of Mr. Frank, Mrs. McCarthy, Mr. Miller's staff, and the Senate.                              {time}  1510  I think we've done what we ought to do more of. And we passed a bill which, as you know, my party supported unanimously because we believe it does, in fact, make us more competitive in the international marketplace and will help keep and grow jobs. So I want to thank the gentleman for his work on that and, again, thank Mr. Bradley and Mr. Hughes for their work on that. And hopefully the Senate will act on that with dispatch.
