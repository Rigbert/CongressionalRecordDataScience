Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, just to conclude, I would especially like to thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos), as I said earlier, a Holocaust survivor himself, for his very clear and unambiguous statement in support of human rights globally, but especially as it relates to a very disturbing trend with regards to anti-Semitism, and for his eulogy today, on the floor, to his dear friend, Simon Wiesenthal.
