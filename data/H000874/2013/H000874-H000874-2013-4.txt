It is a message. Everybody on this floor, I presume, is for children's health, is for pediatric research, is for trying to make sure that our children are healthy and saved from disease and affliction. I presume all of us are for it, but talk is cheap.  The Ryan budget would have cut $800 million from pediatric research alone; 134 of the sponsors of this bill voted for the Ryan budget. In other words, on one hand you are given--theoretically, if there was money available to do this--$11 million for pediatric research with this hand--that is 113 over 10--and $800 million being taken away with this hand.  Who do you think you are fooling?                              {time}  1530
