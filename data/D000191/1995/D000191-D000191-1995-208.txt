Chairman, I am a bit puzzled as to how we can rule that the Coast Guard, in levying a confiscatory tax--that is, a boat operator in the southern part of my district last year was assessed one fee for five boats, and this year was assessed, because the Coast Guard person had to travel there, he did not think that was unreasonable, this year he was assessed five fees for the five boats as though five separate trips had been made and those were done in one trip. I am a bit puzzled how it can be that we are confronted with a confiscatory tax, which has been unilaterally imposed by the Coast Guard, and yet in this case when we are attempting--but it is being justified as a user fee--when we are attempting to adjust the user fee under the gentleman's amendment, we are determining it is a tax and we are out of order.
