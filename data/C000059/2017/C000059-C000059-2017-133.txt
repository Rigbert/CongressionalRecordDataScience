Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to the community of Lake Elsinore in Riverside County, California are exceptional. On Saturday, February 11, 2017 Steve Manos will be honored as the Citizen of the Year by the Lake Elsinore Chamber of Commerce.  Born in Santa Monica and raised in Lake Elsinore, Steve is a 29-year Lake Elsinore resident. In 2012, Steve was elected to serve as a Council Member for the City of Lake Elsinore, for which he served as Mayor in 2015. As an elected official Steve serves on several regional organizations. He has served as Chair of the Riverside County Habitat Conservation Agency, Commissioner on the Airport Land Use Commission, and represents all of the cities in the County of Riverside as the State Director for the League of California Cities. During his term Steve was proud to improve public safety by voting to staff and re-open the Rosetta Canyon Fire Station and add peace officers to the City's police force.  Steve has a great passion for economic development and during his term he has actively recruited new businesses--hundreds of new businesses have opened in Lake Elsinore since 2012, bringing over one thousand new jobs. He has been a relentless, unapologetic ambassador for the City. Steve is a devoted volunteer and charitable contributor having served at the local school district, his church,and community. He is a founding member of Lake Elsinore's major disaster Citizen Emergency Response Team.  In light of all that Steve has done for the community of Riverside County and the city of Lake Elsinore, it is only fitting to honor him as Citizen of the Year. Steve has contributed immensely to the betterment of our region and I am proud to call him a fellow community member, American and a constituent of the 42nd Congressional District of California. I add my voice to the many who will be congratulating Steve Manos on being named Citizen of the Year by the Lake Elsinore Chamber of Commerce.                          ____________________
