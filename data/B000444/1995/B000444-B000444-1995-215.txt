  The drug strategy and the drug budget provides the only single document that details our national drug strategy.  When he was Director, William Bennett testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in February 1990:       [A] year ago [before drug office was law], if you had asked      for a comprehensive picture of national drug policy, you had      to go to over 30 different agencies. Not anymore. William      Bennett, testimony, February 2, 1990.  Also, this is not a debate about the drug strategy. This is a debate about whether we have a drug strategy.  I disagreed with elements of the strategy proposed by Director Bennett, Director Martinez, and Acting Director Walters. But, if we did not have a drug strategy, we could never have had a drug policy debate.  To illustrate this point, I would point out that there are 85 departments, agencies, offices, and bureaus that make up the Federal antidrug effort. The drug director is the only person who is dedicated full time to bringing any order to this effort.  This year the Federal Government will spend $13.3 billion fighting against drugs. The President proposes that we spend $14.6 billion next year. I do not want to debate the specifics of the drug strategy.  My point is that with so much money being spent, we ought to be able to debate how we are going to spend these dollars. And, we can only debate if there is a policy for us to discuss. And there is only a drug policy if we have a drug strategy.  This amendment serves one central purpose: To make sure that we have a full-time general in command of our war on drugs.  Although drugs have dropped off of the media's radar screen for the moment, we cannot be lulled into a sense of complacency on this issue. Drug-related violence still shatters the night in cities, towns, and rural hamlets all across the country; hard-core addicts roam the streets in as great numbers as ever; and the recent surveys by the National Institute on Drug Abuse tell us that teenagers may be forgetting the lessons we have taught them over the past few years: Use of marijuana, LSD, and inhalants is on the rise among our young people.  This is no time to eliminate the drug office--we must redouble our efforts. We must bolster, not obstruct our Nation's ability to develop and mount an all-out attack on the drug scourge.  I am gratified that the Senate has worked in a bipartisan fashion to continue--and bolster--the Office of National Drug Control Policy.         to preserve the office of national drug control policy
