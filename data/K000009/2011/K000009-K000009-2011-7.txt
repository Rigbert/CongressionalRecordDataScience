And these are people who want to work. They have a record of working. They have actually collected their benefits. They've paid into the insurance fund for unemployment in their respective States. But when the economy doesn't recover as fast as it must, then what happens is, after they use up their first 26 weeks of unemployment, what are they supposed to do? Where are they going to work in order to provide for their families?  We've had to, at the Federal level, extend unemployment because of this massive recession that we are digging out of. We have had to extend people. These are people who want to work, who have worked, who have a working record. So they continue looking for jobs. And I can tell you, some of them have been looking for jobs for 3 and 4 years. It isn't that they don't want to work. How many have I talked to where they have sent out hundreds of resumes? They have gone door-to-door looking for work. They have tried, and yet the door keeps getting shut in their face.  At some point, any human being begins to think, There must be something wrong with me that I can't obtain work, when they have a very good record. Many of them are doing two and three jobs just to bring income in and then look to find a full-time job. It's very disruptive to family life. Many of them have moved in with their relatives now.  And they shouldn't feel like failures. I said to my audiences back home, It isn't your fault. You didn't do this to America. The biggest banks failed us. They failed our country. They've hurt us. They've created false money. Many of them became so rich that no normal person could even imagine what they're floating in.  But it isn't the fault of the ordinary worker. They shouldn't eat themselves up in self-agony. There's a lot of that out there.
