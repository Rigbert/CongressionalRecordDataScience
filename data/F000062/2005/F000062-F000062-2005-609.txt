 President, I rise today to join my colleague from New York, Senator Schumer, in offering an amendment which would address a serious loophole in the bankruptcy bill we are now considering it allows rich debtors to unfairly shield assets from their creditors.  In recent years a number of financial and bankruptcy planners have taken advantage of the law of a few States to create what is called an ``asset protection trust.'' These trusts are basically mechanisms for rich people to keep money despite declaring bankruptcy. They are unfair, and violate the basic principle of this underlying legislation that bankruptcy should be used judiciously to deal with the economic reality that sometimes people cannot pay their debts, but to prevent abuse of the system.  This loophole is an example of where the law, if not changed, permits, or even encourages, such abuse.  The amendment is simple: It sets an upper limit on the amount of money that can be shielded in these asset protection trusts, capping the amount at $125,000. This amount parallels the limit placed on the similar ``homestead exemption'' elsewhere in the bill. The homestead exemption allows some assets to be protected from creditors in bankruptcy where they are in the form a residential home.  The bottom line: Wealthy people will be able to preserve only $125,000 in an asset protection trust.  This amount, $125,000, is not a small sum. It is more than enough to ensure that the debtor is not left destitute. But I believe it is a reasonable amount. It is deliberately based on the now-accepted $125,000 limit for the homestead exemption, which will also remain available to a debtor.  Yesterday the New York Times, in an article entitled Proposed Law on Bankruptcy Has Loophole detailed the potential problem in this bill. The article quotes Professor Elena Marty-Nelson, a law professor at Nova Southeastern University in Florida, who states:       [i]f the bankruptcy legislation currently [before the      Senate] gets enacted, debtors won't need to buy houses in      Florida and Texas to keep their millions [t]he millionare's      loophole that is the results of these trusts needs to be      closed.  Professor Elizabeth Warren of Harvard Law School is also quoted in the article. She notes that:       [t]his is just a way for rich folks to be able to slip      through the noose on bankruptcy and, of course, the double      irony for her is that the proponents of this bill keep      pressing it as designed to eliminate abuse.  I unanimously consent that the full text of the article be printed in the Record.                [From the New York Times, Mar. 2, 2005]                Proposed Law on Bankruptcy Has Loophole                        (By Gretchen Morgenson)       The bankruptcy legislation being debated by the Senate is      intended to make it harder for people to walk away from their      credit card and other debts. But legal specialists say the      proposed law leaves open an increasingly popular loophole      that lets wealthy people protect substantial assets from      creditors even after filing for bankruptcy.       The loophole involves the use of so-called asset protection      trusts. For years, wealthy people looking to keep their money      out of the reach of domestic creditors have set up these      trusts offshore. But since 1997, lawmakers in five states--     Alaska, Delaware, Nevada, Rhode Island and Utah--have passed      legislation exempting assets held domestically in such trusts      from the federal bankruptcy code. People who want to      establish trusts do not have to reside the five states; they      need only set their trust up through an institution in one of      them.       ``If the bankruptcy legislation currently being rushed      through the Senate gets enacted, debtors won't need to buy      houses in Florida or Texas to keep their millions,'' said      Elena Marty-Nelson, a law professor at Nova Southeastern      University in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., referring to generous      homestead exemptions in those states. ``The millionaire's      loophole that is the result of these trusts needs to be      closed.''       Yesterday in Washington, Republicans in the Senate beat      back the first in a series of Democratic amendments aimed at      softening the effects of the bankruptcy bill on military      personnel, and the majority leader of the House vowed to get      quick approval of the bill if the Senate did not      significantly alter it.       ``We will grab hold of it just like we did class action if      it is a good and clean bankruptcy reform bill,'' said      Representative Tom DeLay, a Texas Republican, referring to      the quick action the House took last month on a measure      limiting class-action lawsuits.       The Senate bill is favored by banks, credit card companies      and retailers, who say it is now too easy for consumers to      erase their debts through bankruptcy. It is almost identical      to previous versions that have been introduced in Congress,      unsuccessfully, since 1998. Perhaps because the current bill      was written so long ago, some legal authorities say, it does      not address the new state laws that have allowed asset      protection trusts to flourish.       ``This is just a way for rich folks to be able to slip      through the noose on bankruptcy, and, of course, the double      irony here is that the proponents of this bill keep pressing      it as designed to eliminate abuse,'' said Elizabeth Warren, a      law professor at Harvard Law School. ``Yet when provisions      that permit real abuse by rich people are pointed out, the      bill's proponents look the other way.''       Senator Charles E. Grassley, an Iowa Republican, is the      main sponsor of the bankruptcy bill. His press secretary,      Beth Levine, said the senator's staff was unaware of the      trusts and the loophole for the wealthy that they      represented. ``The senator is always open to suggestions for      closing these loopholes,'' she said.       Money held in asset protection trusts can elude creditors      because federal bankruptcy law exempts assets governed by      ``applicable nonbankruptcy law.'' Intended to preserve rights      to property under state law, the exemption makes it difficult      for creditors to get hold of assets that they would not be      able to seize through a nonbankruptcy proceeding in state      court.       Asset protection trusts have become increasingly popular in      recent years among physicians, who fear large medical      malpractice awards, and corporate executives, whose assets      are at greater peril now because of new laws. The Sarbanes-     Oxley legislation, for example, requires chief executives and      chief financial officers to certify that their companies'      financial statements are accurate; anyone who knowingly      certifies false numbers can be fined up to $5 million. In      addition, under Sarbanes-Oxley, executives may have to      reimburse their companies for bonuses or other incentive      compensation they received if their company's financial      reports have to be restated in later years. ``Given all the      notoriety of what we're seeing today, from HealthSouth to      WorldCom, there is probably more of an impetus for executives      to consider going this route,'' said Scott E. Blakeley, a      lawyer at Blakeley & Blakeley in Irvine, Calif. ``And yet in      the bankruptcy bill, this topic is not touched.''       While it is difficult to quantify how much money is sitting      in domestic asset protection trusts, their popularity is      undeniable, bankruptcy specialists said. ``I've heard figures      for foreign asset protection trusts and those probably are in      the billions,'' said Adam J. Hirsch, a law professor at      Florida State University. ``I haven't seen any figures for      domestic asset protection trusts, but they could very well be      the same.''       Current federal bankruptcy law protects assets held in a      type of trust, known as a spendthrift trust, traditionally      set up by one family member to benefit another. But current      law does not protect the assets of people who set up      spendthrift trusts to benefit themselves. And the law limits      the purposes of the trusts that qualify for exemption.      Retirement planning or paying for education are two approved      purposes for such trusts. By contrast, domestic asset      protection trusts can be set up by the same people who plan      to benefit from them. In addition, there are no caps on the      dollar amount of assets they can hold and no restrictions on      their purpose, Ms. Marty-Nelson said. One limitation is that      the trusts cannot be set up by people who are already      insolvent.       The states that allow these trusts do so to attract the      significant money management and trustee fees that accompany      them, Mr. Hirsch said. ``It's what is known in the parlance      of legal policy analysis as a race to the bottom,'' he said.       The authors of the Delaware law, for example, noted when it      was passed in 1997 that it was meant to ``maintain Delaware's      role as the most favored jurisdiction for the establishment      of trusts.''       In some ways, asset protection trusts are similar to the      homestead exemption that keeps homes in Florida, Texas and      other states out of the reach of creditors. But the      bankruptcy law now under consideration limits this exemption      to $125,000 for those who purchased the home within 40 months      of their bankruptcy filing or for those who have committed      securities fraud.       Ms. Marty-Nelson said the bankruptcy bill should at least      apply such a cap to domestic asset protection trusts. Better      yet, she said, the bill should exclude these trusts from the      federal exemption altogether.       ``Congress can and should close this huge loophole,'' she      said.
