President, I rise today on tax day to introduce a new legislative proposal to help small businesses afford quality health insurance for their low-income workers. The number of uninsured is at an all-time high. More than 43 million people, including 11 million children, lack health insurance coverage. Workers in small firms are significantly more likely to be uninsured than workers in larger firms. Nationally, 34 percent of workers in small businesses with less than 10 employees are uninsured. This compares to the national average for all workers which is 18.2 percent. In Illinois, 183,781 workers in a small business in 1997 went without health insurance. For low-income workers the situation was even worse. Nationally, 41.3 percent of workers earning less than $16,000 were uninsured. Again in Illinois, 112,770 working for less than $16,000 in small businesses were uninsured.  This situation is deteriorating. Recent studies show that the number of small businesses offering health insurance has been declining. In 1996, 52 percent of small businesses offered their employees health insurance benefits. This level had fallen to 47 percent by 1998. For the smallest firms, those with 3-9 workers, the percentage of employees covered by employer-sponsored health insurance fell from 36 percent in 1996 to 31 percent in 1998.  Only 39 percent of small businesses with a significant percentage of low-income employees offer employer-sponsored health insurance--such companies are half as likely to offer health benefits as are companies that have only a small proportion of low-income employees.  One of the main reasons for this decline in employer-sponsored health insurance is cost. Small businesses pay on average 30 percent more for health insurance than larger firms and costs are increasing more rapidly for small businesses causing them to drop health insurance benefits.  Health insurance coverage is also related to income. High income workers have the highest rates of insurance. The very poor are generally covered by public sources of health care. It is most often the working poor who have the lowest incidence of insurance. Thirty-seven percent of those with family incomes between 100 percent and 125 percent of poverty are uninsured. In contrast, 92.2 percent of individuals in families with incomes over $50,000 have insurance.  Bearing all this in mind, I am introducing a bill that recognizes that the most concentrated pool of Americans without health insurance are low-income workers in small businesses (0-9 employees). The bill provides tax credits to small businesses when they provide health insurance to those low-income workers. The bill provides a tax credit of up to $600 for an individual policy for a worker making up to $16,000/yr. and a tax credit of up to $1,200 for a family policy for a worker making up to $16,000/yr. The tax credit is valued at 60 percent of what the employer contributes for the individual's health insurance, or 70 percent of what the employer contributes for a family policy, to the maximum of $600 and $1,200 for self-only and family policies respectively.  The proposal does not undermine the employer-based health insurance market, and does not undermine the protections and advantages that are available to group purchasers. Instead it is designed to help small businesses to provide quality health insurance benefits for their employees.                                 ______                                       By
