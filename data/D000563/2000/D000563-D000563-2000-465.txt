DOMENICI. I am bound by the rules of the Senate to use the CBO. The President doesn't, however. He uses OMB. Frequently, we are different. As a matter of fact, over the last 3 years, we have gone to the President's numbers, and we have gone back to CBO's numbers because we are trying to find out which is more apt to be right. So there is nothing precise about this. One is entitled--just as President Clinton did when he ran for office--to use his own economic experts as he puts his plan together.
