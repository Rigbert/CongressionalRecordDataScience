(a) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to combat      trafficking in persons, a contemporary manifestation of      slavery whose victims are predominantly women and children,      to ensure just and effective punishment of traffickers, and      to protect their victims.       (b) Findings.--The Congress finds that:       (1) Millions of people every year, primarily women or      children, are trafficked within or across international      borders. Approximately 50,000 women and children are      trafficked into the United States each year.       (2) Many of these persons, of whom the overwhelming      majority are women and children, are trafficked into the      international sex trade, often by means of force, fraud, or      coercion. The sex industry has rapidly expanded over the past      several decades. It involves sexual exploitation of persons,      predominantly women and girls, within activities related to      prostitution, pornography, sex tourism, and other commercial      sexual services. The rapid expansion of the sex industry and      the low status of women in many parts of the world have      contributed to a burgeoning of the trafficking industry, of      which sex trafficking by force, fraud, and coercion is a      major component.       (3) Trafficking in persons is not limited to sex      trafficking, but often involves forced labor and other      violations of internationally recognized human rights. The      worldwide trafficking of persons is a growing transnational      crime, migration, economics, labor, public health, and human      rights problem that is significant on nearly every continent.       (4) Traffickers primarily target women and girls, who are      disproportionately affected by poverty, lack of access to      education, chronic unemployment, discrimination, and lack of      viable economic opportunities in countries of origin.      Traffickers lure women and girls into their networks through      false promises of good working conditions at relatively high      pay as nannies, maids, dancers, factory workers, restaurant      workers, sales clerks, or models. Traffickers also buy girls      from poor families and sell them into prostitution or into      various types of forced or bonded labor.       (5) Traffickers often facilitate victims' movement from      their home communities to unfamiliar destinations, away from      family and friends, religious institutions, and other sources      of protection and support, making the victims more      vulnerable.       (6) Victims are often forced to engage in sex acts or to      perform labor or other services through physical violence,      including rape and other forms of sexual abuse, torture,      starvation, and imprisonment, through threats of violence,      and through other forms of psychological abuse and coercion.       (7) Trafficking is perpetrated increasingly by organized      and sophisticated criminal enterprises. Trafficking in      persons is the fastest growing source of profits for      organized criminal enterprises worldwide. Profits from the      trafficking industry contribute to the expansion of organized      criminal activity in the United States and around the world.      Trafficking often is aided by official corruption in      countries of origin, transit, and destination, thereby      threatening the rule of law.       (8) Traffickers often make representations to their victims      that physical harm may occur to them or to others should the      victim escape or attempt to escape. Such representations can      have the same coercive effects on victims as specific threats      to inflict such harm.       (9) Sex trafficking, when it involves the involuntary      participation of another person in sex acts by means of      fraud, force, or coercion, includes all the elements of the      crime of forcible rape, which is defined by all legal systems      as among the most serious of all crimes.       (10) Sex trafficking also involves frequent and serious      violations of other laws, including labor and immigration      codes and laws against kidnapping, slavery, false      imprisonment, assault, battery, pandering, fraud, and      extortion.       (11) Women and children trafficked into the sex industry      are exposed to deadly diseases, including HIV and AIDS.      Trafficking victims are sometimes worked or physically      brutalized to death.       (12) Trafficking in persons substantially affects      interstate and foreign commerce. The United States must take      action to eradicate the substantial burdens on commerce that      result from trafficking in persons and to prevent the      channels of commerce from being used for immoral and      injurious purposes.       (13) Trafficking of persons in all its forms is an evil      that calls for concerted and vigorous action by countries of      origin, transit countries, receiving countries, and      international organizations.       (14) Existing legislation and law enforcement in the United      States and in other nations around the world have proved      inadequate to deter trafficking and to bring traffickers to      justice, principally because such legislation and enforcement      do not reflect the gravity of the offenses involved. No      comprehensive law exists in the United States that penalizes      the range of offenses involved in the trafficking scheme.      Instead, even the most brutal instances of forcible sex      trafficking are often punished under laws that also apply to      far less serious offenses such as consensual sexual activity      and illegal immigration, so that traffickers typically escape      severe punishment.       (15) In the United States, the seriousness of the crime of      trafficking in persons is not reflected in current sentencing      guidelines for component crimes of the trafficking scheme,      which results in weak penalties for convicted traffickers.      Adequate services and facilities do not exist to meet the      health care, housing, education, and legal assistance needs      for the safe reintegration of domestic trafficking victims.       (16) In some countries, enforcement against traffickers is      also hindered by official indifference, by corruption, and      sometimes even by active official participation in      trafficking.       (17) Because existing laws and law enforcement procedures      often fail to make clear distinctions between victims of      trafficking and persons who have knowingly and willfully      violated laws, and because victims often do not have legal      immigration status in the countries into which they are      trafficked, the victims are often punished more harshly than      the traffickers themselves.       (18) Because victims of trafficking are frequently      unfamiliar with the laws, cultures, and languages of the      countries into which they have been trafficked, and because      they are often subjected to coercion and intimidation      including physical detention, debt bondage, fear of      retribution, and fear of forcible removal to countries in      which they will face retribution or other hardship, these      victims often find it difficult or impossible to report the      crimes committed against them or to assist in the      investigation and prosecution of such crimes.       (19) The United States and the international community are      in agreement that trafficking in persons often involves grave      violations of human rights and is a matter of pressing      international concern. The Universal Declaration of Human      Rights; the Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of      Slavery, the Slave Trade, and Institutions and Practices      Similar to Slavery; the International Covenant on Civil and      Political Rights; the Convention on the Elimination of All      Forms of Discrimination Against Women; the Convention Against      Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or      Punishment, and other relevant instruments condemn slavery      and involuntary servitude, violence against women, and other      components of the trafficking scheme.       (20) One of the founding documents of the United States,      the Declaration of Independence, recognizes the inherent      dignity and worth of all people. It states that all men are      created equal and that they are endowed by their Creator with      certain unalienable rights. The right to be free from slavery      and involuntary servitude is among those unalienable rights.      Acknowledging this fact, the United States outlawed slavery      and involuntary servitude in 1865, recognizing them as evil      institutions that must be abolished. Current practices of      sexual slavery and trafficking of women and children are      similarly abhorrent to the principles upon which our country      was founded.       (21) The Universal Declaration of Human Rights recognizes      the right to be free from slavery and involuntary servitude,      arbitrary detention, degrading or inhuman treatment, and      arbitrary interference with privacy or the family, as well as      the right to protection by law against these abuses.       (22) The United Nations General Assembly has passed three      resolutions during the last 3 years (50/167, 51/66, and 52/     98) recognizing that the international traffic in women and      girls, particularly for purposes of forced prostitution, is a      matter of pressing international concern involving numerous      violations of fundamental human rights. The resolutions call      upon governments of receiving countries as well as countries      of origin to strengthen their laws against such practices, to      intensify their efforts to enforce such laws, and to ensure      the full protection, treatment, and rehabilitation of women      and children who are victims of trafficking.       (23) The Final Report of the World Congress against Sexual      Exploitation of Children, held in Stockholm, Sweden, in      August 1996, recognized that international sex trafficking is      a principal cause of increased exploitation and degradation      of children.       (24) The Fourth World Conference on Women (Beijing      Conference) called on all governments to take measures,      including legislative measures, to provide better protection      of the rights of women and girls who are victims of      trafficking, to address the root factors that put women and      girls at risk to traffickers, and to take measures to      dismantle the national, regional, and international networks      on trafficking.       (25) In the 1991 Moscow Document of the Organization for      Security and Co-operation in Europe, participating states,      including the     United States, agreed to seek to eliminate all forms of      violence against women, and all forms of traffic in women and      exploitation of prostitution of women including by ensuring      adequate legal prohibitions against such acts and other      appropriate measures.       (26) Numerous treaties to which the United States is a      party address government obligations to combat trafficking,      including such treaties as the 1956 Supplementary Convention      on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade and Institutions      and Practices Similar to Slavery, which calls for the      complete abolition of debt bondage and servile forms of      marriage, and the 1957 Abolition of Forced Labor Convention,      which undertakes to suppress and requires signatories not to      make use of any forced or compulsory labor.       (27) Trafficking in persons is a transnational crime with      national implications. In order to deter international      trafficking and to bring its perpetrators to justice, nations      including the United States must recognize that trafficking      is a serious offense and must act on this recognition by      prescribing appropriate punishment, by giving the highest      priority to investigation and prosecution of trafficking      offenses, and by protecting rather than punishing the victims      of such offenses. The United States must work bilaterally and      multilaterally to abolish the trafficking industry and take      steps to promote and facilitate cooperation among countries      linked together by international trafficking routes. The      United States must also urge the international community to      take strong action in multilateral fora to engage      recalcitrant countries in serious and sustained efforts to      eliminate trafficking and protect trafficking victims.

Such officials,      in investigating and prosecuting persons engaging in such      trafficking, shall take into consideration the safety and      integrity of such victims, but the authority of the Attorney      General under the Immigration and Nationality Act to detain      aliens shall not be curtailed by any regulation promulgated      to implement this paragraph.       (5) Appropriate personnel of the Department of State and      the Department of Justice are trained in identifying victims      of severe forms of trafficking and providing for the      protection of such victims. Training under this paragraph      should include methods for achieving antitrafficking      objectives through the nondiscriminatory application of      immigration and other related laws.       (d) Construction.--Nothing in subsection (c) shall be      construed as creating any private cause of action against the      United States or its offices or employees.

(2) For the knowing commission of any act of sex      trafficking involving fraud, force, or coercion or in which      the victim of sex trafficking is a child incapable of giving      meaningful consent, or of trafficking which includes rape or      kidnapping or which causes a death, the country should      prescribe punishment commensurate with that for the most      serious crimes, such as forcible sexual assault.       (3) For the knowing commission of any act of a severe form      of trafficking in persons, the     country should prescribe punishment which is sufficiently      stringent to deter and which adequately reflects the heinous      nature of the offense.       (4) The country should make serious and sustained efforts      to eliminate severe forms of trafficking in persons.       (b) Criteria.--In determinations under subsection (a)(4)      the following factors should be considered:       (1) Whether the country vigorously investigates and      prosecutes acts of severe forms of trafficking in persons      that take place wholly or partly within the territory of the      country.       (2) Whether the country cooperates with other countries in      the investigation and prosecution of severe forms of      trafficking in persons.       (3) Whether the country extradites persons charged with      acts of severe forms of trafficking in persons on the same      terms and to the same extent as persons charged with other      serious crimes.       (4) Whether the country monitors immigration and emigration      patterns for evidence of severe forms of trafficking in      persons and whether law enforcement agencies of the country      respond to any such evidence in a manner which is consistent      with the vigorous investigation and prosecution of acts of      such trafficking, as well as with the protection of victims      and the internationally recognized human right to leave      countries and to return to one's own country.       (5) Whether the country protects victims of severe forms of      trafficking in persons and encourages their assistance in the      investigation and prosecution of such trafficking, including      provision for legal alternatives to their removal to      countries in which they would face retribution or other      hardship.       (6) Whether the country vigorously investigates and      prosecutes public officials who participate in or facilitate      severe forms of trafficking in persons, and takes all      appropriate measures against officials who condone such      trafficking.

(2) Interim reports.--The Secretary of State may submit to      the appropriate congressional committees in addition to the      annual report under subsection (b) one or more interim      reports with respect to the status of severe forms of      trafficking in persons, including information about countries      whose governments have come into or out of compliance with      the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking      since the transmission of the last annual report.       (c) Notification.--For fiscal year 2002 and each subsequent      fiscal year, for each foreign country to which the minimum      standards for the elimination of trafficking are applicable      and which has failed to meet such standards, as described in      an annual or interim report under subsection (b), not less      than 45 days and not more than 90 days after the submission      of such a report the President shall submit a notification to      the appropriate congressional committees of one of the      determinations described in subsection (d).       (d) Determinations.--The determinations referred to in      subsection (c) are as follows:       (1) Withholding of nonhumanitarian assistance.--The      President has determined that--       (A)(i) the United States will not provide nonhumanitarian      foreign assistance to the government of the country for the      subsequent fiscal year until such government complies with      the minimum standards; or       (ii) in the case of a country whose government received no      nonhumanitarian foreign assistance from the United States      during the previous fiscal year, the United States will not      provide funding for participation by officials or employees      of such governments in educational and cultural exchange      programs for the subsequent fiscal year until such government      complies with the minimum standards; and       (B) the President will instruct the United States Executive      Director of each multilateral development bank and of the      International Monetary Fund to vote against, and to use his      or her best efforts to deny, any loan or other utilization of      the funds of his or her institution to that country (other      than for humanitarian assistance, or for development      assistance which directly addresses basic human needs, is not      administered by the government of the sanctioned country, and      confers no benefit to that country) for the subsequent fiscal      year until such government complies with the minimum      standards.       (2) Subsequent compliance.--The Secretary of State has      determined that the country has come into compliance with the      minimum standards.       (3) Continuation of assistance in the national interest.--     Notwithstanding the failure of the country to comply with      minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking, the      President has determined that the provision of      nonhumanitarian foreign assistance to the country is in the      national interest of the United States.       (4) Exercise of waiver authority.--The President may      exercise the authority under paragraph (3) with respect to      all nonhumanitarian foreign assistance to a country or with      respect to one or more programs, projects, or activities.
