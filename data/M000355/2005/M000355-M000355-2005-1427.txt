 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a fellow Kentuckian who has done the important work of keeping a piece of the Commonwealth's history alive by chronicling the events of the county he is proud to call home, Union County.  Mr. Peyton Heady has written and published 25 books that cover some aspect of the county's history. He has a particular interest in how people from Union County were involved in the Civil War. One such story involves Tom Henry, a Union County native who managed to stop the notorious outlaws, Frank and Jesse James from robbing a bank in Morganfield. Mr. Henry convinced the James brothers that he had friends who had money in the bank and they wouldn't want to lose it. This story could have been lost in the annals of history, but it won't be because of Peyton Heady's thorough research and documentation.  Another piece of Union County history that Mr. Heady has taken an interest in is that of Camp Breckinridge. As a former clerk in the civil engineering division at the camp during World War II, Mr. Heady has first-hand experiences to share and draw from. Later this week he will be honored by the Earle C. Clements Job Corps Center, located on Camp Breckinridge property, for keeping a record of the history of Camp Breckinridge. The Center will name one of the camp administration buildings the Peyton Heady Building.  I urge my colleagues to join me in giving Mr. Heady the thanks of a grateful Commonwealth and a grateful Nation. Thanks to his dedication, the history of Kentucky shall be preserved. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article from The Henderson Gleaner ``Making History: Chronicler of Union County Events Honored for Keeping Memories Alive,'' about Mr. Heady's contributions to his community.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:              [From the Henderson Gleaner, Mar. 13, 2005] Making History: Chronicler of Union County Events Honored for Keeping                              Memories Alive                           (By Judy Jenkins)       Tom Henry was one of those bigger than life characters who      would, if he were alive today, be gracing the cover of      ``People'' magazine and artfully answering questions lobbed      at him by Larry King.       Tom was a handsome Union County native who served as a      captain in the Confederate army and, legend has it, managed      to earn the respect of those infamous outlaws Frank and Jesse      James. The James brothers spent a considerable amount of time      in Morganfield during the Civil War, and at one point Frank--     the story goes--was planning to rob a bank there.       Our hero Tom learned of those plans and convinced Frank to      forego the robbery by telling him that he had some good      friends who had money in that bank and he'd sure hate for      them to lose it.       On another, darker occasion, a Yankee colonel was captured      and tied to a tree. Apparently a couple of the captors were      planning a short future for the Northerner, but Tom informed      them they'd have to walk over his own dead body to harm the      colonel.       In a twist that Hollywood would love, Tom was captured and      after the war was taken to Louisville to stand trial for his      life. The Yankee colonel, by amazing coincidence, walked into      the courtroom, recognized Tom as the captain who saved his      life, and got the Union Countian released.       That's just one of the many accounts in Peyton Heady's 1985      ``Union County History in the Civil War.'' The 252-page book      makes what could be dry, dusty descriptions of past events      come alive for the reader.       Peyton, who wrote the history because he was concerned that      little had been written about Union County's involvement in      the Civil War, noted that about 60 percent of the county's      population supported the Confederate cause and families were      often divided.       There were, for instance, the Lambert brothers who fought      in opposing armies, survived the war and never again spoke to      each other--but are buried side by side in a Union County      cemetery.       The book is one of 25 written and published by Peyton over      the decades, and they all cover some aspect of Union County      history. Some are genealogical volumes and some record the      county's cemeteries, including obscure resting places. While      surveying those cemeteries, the retired U.S. Postal Service      employee found the graves of seven Revolutionary War soldiers      with monuments intact.       Peyton, who was a clerk in the civil engineering division      at Camp Breckinridge during World War II, also wrote the      history of the sprawling camp that contained 36,000 acres,      had housing for 30,000 troops and 10,000 additional      personnel, boasted its own utility systems and airstrip, had      12 dispensaries and hospitals, nearly seven miles of      railroad, a simulated ``Japanese training village,'' four      movie theaters and much, much more.       Four divisions from that Army post fought in the Battle of      the Bulge, and the camp contributed a number of major units      that played a significant role in breaking down the Nazi      fortress.       It was at the camp that Peyton watched a young African      American soldier named Jackie Robinson play baseball, and it      was there he supervised 150 German prisoners of war.       For the price of a box of Cuban cigars, one of those      prisoners painted Peyton's portrait. The painting hangs in      the Morganfield home of Peyton and Cecilia, his wife of 53      years and mother of their two children, James Heady and      Rebecca Heady Gough.       On April 28, Peyton no doubt will feel he's come full      circle in his life. On that day, one of the camp      administration facilities will be named the Peyton Heady      Building. The 11 a.m. dedication ceremony is part of the 40th      anniversary celebration of the Earle C. Clements Job Corps      Center, which is on the Camp Breckinridge property.       Peyton, 79, is being saluted largely for his determination      to keep the history of Camp Breckinridge from passing into      obscurity. He opted to undertake that history when he learned      that government archives contained a one- page description of      the giant complex that was last used as a military      installation in 1963.       He is touched by the upcoming honor, but he'll have you      know that the thousands of hours of patient research and      writing his books weren't for praise or glory. ``I just think      if you're going to live in a town and raise your children in      a town you should do something to make it better,'' he says.       Things he's done include working with Morganfield's Little      League program for more than two decades.       Peyton is on a walker now and doesn't often leave his home,      but he isn't complaining. ``I'm a happy man,'' he says. ``I'm      happy with my marriage (which naysayers said would never work      because Cecilia's Catholic and he's Methodist), happy with my      family and happy with my life.''       His histories have sold well and seven or eight have been      reprinted, but Peyton hasn't gotten rich from the sales.       ``I didn't write them for profit,'' he says. ``I wrote them      for history.''                          ____________________[Page S4252]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                      TRIBUTE TO MR.
