Speaker, the most constructive step Congress can take today to fortify our Nation's political ideals and economic foundation is to say ``no'' to renewing China's ``special'' trade status. There is nothing ``normal'' about China's trade relationship with the United States today. It is astoundingly abnormal, with gigantic and growing trade deficits.  This year it will amount to over $60 billion more of Chinese goods coming into this country than our exports allowed into their nation; over half a million lost jobs in the United States; China, now the second largest holder of U.S. dollar reserves and buying political influence around the world with that money, restructuring their markets and transshipping goods through Japan here to the United States.  All I can say is our ancestors in the Kaptur and Rogowski families came to this country for freedom. They were freedom lovers. They were opportunity lovers. I refuse to be a placeholder in this Congress for Chinese state monopolies or the Communist Party, and I am certainly not going to be a placeholder for some of the largest multinationals on the face of the globe who merely want to make profits off the backs of those who work as slaves.
