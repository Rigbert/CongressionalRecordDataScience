 She felt compelled to write following a lecture to her class by what was billed as a former drug addict. As she says, she expected to hear about the dangers of drug use. What she and the class got, however, was very different.  In this case, a very clean-cut looking young man, identified as a former addict, spoke. While the teacher was present, the speaker evidently did talk about the problems of his personal drug use. Once the teacher left the room, though, the message changed. Instead of an anti-message, the lecture became a mini-course on drugs, drug use, and how to make a killing selling drugs. Among the things the speaker passed on was a recipe for a stronger form of cocaine. The speaker extolled the virtues of being stoned. He ``raved'' about the incredible amounts of money to be made peddling drugs. He left the class with the advice that since no one could drug test for alcohol, that it was okay to drink.  The teacher in this particular class, based on negative feedback, has decided not to leave classes alone with future guest speakers. Unfortunately, as the young woman who wrote about this incident notes, the damage is done.  Mr. President, if you, or any of my colleagues, have not yet read this letter, I encourage you to do so. The story that it tells is very poignant, and very disturbing. We know that there is a growing acceptance of drug use among our children. We can see the reports and the story they tell. But what we don't always appreciate is why.  As this letter makes clear, the drugs-are-okay message is back. I would hope that this lecture by this individual was an accident and a one-time occurrence. But I am concerned that it is representative of a growing effort to influence the young. His talk apparentlyhad everything but free samples. As the author of this letter tells us, ``. . . the way in which he spoke of drugs made them seem appealing and beneficial.'' This type of message is not isolated.  From music to videos to movies and advertisement, we are seeing efforts once again to glamorize drugs. We have seen initiatives in several states to push drug legalization under various disguises. Just recently a micro-brewery in Maryland has begun to market a beer made with marijuana seeds under the title ``Hempen.''  Not too long ago some of our major fashion industry folks began to use models with the ``Heroin Chic'' look. We are seeing opinion leaders and members of our cultural elite portray drug use as simply a personal choice that is harmless and benign. Many of these individuals act as if the only issue is for responsible adults to decide for themselves. They speak as if it is only adults that we need to think about. This, however, is not in fact the case.  If you do not believe this, talk to parents. Talk to teachers. Talk to the health and law enforcement professionals who daily see the consequences. Visit the emergency room of your local hospital and talk to the doctors and nurses who see every day the effects of drug use.  Go to a treatment center and sit and talk to some of the patients, listen to their stories of how drug use has destroyed their lives, their families.  But most important, listen to what kids are telling us about what is happening in their schools. To their friends. Ask them where they get their information, and who they listen to. If this letter tells us anything, it is that we must listen to our kids, if for no other reason so we know whom they are listening to. Above all, we need to do a better job at delivering a clear, consistent, no-use message to our kids.  As we move into the appropriations cycle, we need to keep that need firmly in mind. We cannot repeat the mistake that we made in the 1960's and 1970's. Last time we had a drug epidemic we could claim ignorance. We don't have any excuses if we let it happen again.                               Exhibit 1                  Lessons You Didn't Mean To Teach Us       After a former drug abuser came to speak to four 10th-grade      health classes at a suburban New York City high school, 16-     year-old Victoria Slade sent this letter anonymously to her      teacher. The teacher subsequently told the classes that,      because of negative feedback, she would not leave guest      speakers alone with students. Slade has since told the      teacher that the letter was from her. It is being reprinted      with Slade's permission.       I am a student in one of your health classes this semester.      As a transfer student from a very small private school, I am      daily finding out shocking things about the various actions      and addictions of my peers. I am currently drug-free,      alcohol-free, pot-free, smoke-free, etc. The solid background      I received from my previous school ensures that I will remain      thus, but I am extremely concerned about my classmates, many      of whom I fear are already trying drugs and alcohol. For this      reason, I was glad when you announced that the surprise guest      speaker was someone who had been addicted to cocaine and      marijuana. I expected that seeing what happens to you when      you get into drugs would make many students reconsider what      they were doing. However, I was sadly mistaken in this      assumption.       The guest speaker entered as a well-dressed, good-looking      individual. He was relatively well-spoken and complemented      his serious discussion with occasional light humor. He was      described as a good student who got into trouble and was      saved by his loving teachers. In our eyes, he became the      victim of a corrupt police force and government. Soon      forgotten was the fact that he got himself into this trouble      through the sale and consumption of illegal substances. While      you were present in the room, the young man acted in      accordance with your wishes: we could relate to him, and so      we listened attentively to the important lesson he was      teaching us.       However, once you left the room, this tragic figure opened      with the line: ``So, do you guys have any questions? I can      tell you anything you want to know about drugs.'' He      continued in the same manner, describing the different      effects of different drugs: which were best, which made you      able to concentrate better, how cocaine kept him awake so he      could study. When asked if you could remember what you      studied the next day, he responded with an emphatic      affirmative. He mentioned that if you studied while under the      influence of marijuana, you wouldn't do well on the test      unless you were high again while taking it, in which case      you would perform to the best of your ability. His      explanation for this phenomenon was that you are on a      different level of consciousness while high. Furthermore,      he assured us that being high on marijuana has no effect      on your ability to drive, as your reaction time is not      altered by the drug. He described the various types of      Ecstasy, explaining that he took the 70-percent drug-     content one once and became very ill. However, he soon      canceled this out by describing the type with 30 percent      drug content as ``nice.'' Also, he gave us a recipe for a      different, stronger form of cocaine.       The pleasing physical effect of drugs was not the sole      topic of conversation. At one point, someone asked him why he      would get into drugs if he was doing well in school and      getting good grades. This question led him into a 10-minute      exaltation of selling drugs for a living. He raved about the      incredible amounts of money he made, mentioning more than      twice the fact that he had four nice cars. We were all      impressed when he said that he made over $500,000 in just      four years of selling drugs. I's sure that those of us who      work were thinking contendedly--of our five-dollar-an-hour      jobs cleaning the toilets and places like McDonald's and      Boston Market.       Our new role model summed up his report on the world of      drugs by telling us that he was still smoking weed until just      a few days before. He said he wanted to smoke as much as he      could before he had to be clean for the Navy drug test. Also,      he informed us that if he had not been caught, he would      definitely still be using and dealing drugs now. One of his      final bits of advice was that they couldn't screen you for      alcohol, so it is okay to drink.       There were many other appalling statements made by this      gentleman which quite disturbed me. As I mentioned earlier,      many students at this school are into drugs and alcohol. I      think that the idea behind this visit was good: We could live      vicariously through this young man, whose life is (or should      be) all but destroyed because of drugs. However, the way in      which he spoke of drugs made them seem appealing and      beneficial. It upsets me to think of how many classes of      impressionable youths were influenced by this man--how many      minds were made up by his wonderful tale. I hope that you do      not promote future visits with this particular guest speaker      and thank you for your attention.           Sincerely,     A Concerned Student.                          ____________________
