 President, the Strategic Concept does not rise to the level of a treaty amendment, and the Senator from Michigan has pointed that out. Therefore, it is a benign amendment, we are told, and in all probability it is. But it is unnecessary. It does mischief. It sends the wrong message. It is a bad idea, notwithstanding the fact that it has been cleaned up to the point that it is clear it does not rise to the level of a treaty requiring a treaty vote on the Strategic Concept.  But I agree with the Senator from Arizona. He painstakingly on this floor laid out in the Kyl amendment during the expansion of NATO debate exactly what we asked the President to consider in the Strategic Concept that was being negotiated with our allies. They did that. We voted 90 to 9.  This is a bad idea.
