Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this conference report. The chairman has outlined well the provisions of this conference report. I think all of the Members on my side of the aisle, as well as all of the Members on the chairman's side of the aisle, can be pleased with the fact that this bill addresses significant law enforcement problems: fighting drugs, fighting crime, providing funds to the ONDCP to make sure that our young people know of the dangers of drugs, and convince them to stay off and to just say no, as Mrs. Reagan so aptly suggested.  It also provides other funds for the IRS to make sure that we have a system that works. We have new people in place that are addressing the problems that the committee has seen and that the Congress has seen, and very frankly, I think this bill is a good bill that could be unanimously supported by the committee.  I want to make a point to the chairman. I do not see the major chairman on the floor. I understand there is a colloquy, and I will wait perhaps and hopefully the gentleman from Louisiana, Chairman Livingston, will be on the floor. I understand he is on his way. I understand the gentleman from Arizona [Mr. Kolbe] has a colloquy to enter into.  Mr. Speaker, let me simply say that I congratulate the gentleman for his work on this bill, I congratulate him on the bipartisan fashion in which he has worked toward fashioning a bill that I think is acceptable to all parties.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
