Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I will not take a long time on this motion.  The House has worked its will on H.R. 1104, and Members should be congratulated for their hard work. However, this is no time to pat ourselves on the back. There is still work to do with the other body, and I am prepared to get that job done.  The following procedural maneuvers are necessary to get us to conference with the Senate. Many have complained that H.R. 1104 would get bogged down with the other body. This procedure ensures that we are able to expeditiously convene a conference to resolve differences between the House and the Senate versions of this legislation. The Committee on Rules, in its wisdom, has crafted a rule that permits us to expeditiously get to conference so that the House and Senate Committees on the Judiciary can get to work. I am ready to roll up my sleeves to make sure this child protection legislation is on the President's desk soon.  Mr. Speaker, this motion permits the House to get to a stage of disagreement with the Senate so the House can consider the next motion I will offer requesting a conference with the other body. I encourage all Members to support this motion so we can resolve our differences with the other body and send to the President strong child protection legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
