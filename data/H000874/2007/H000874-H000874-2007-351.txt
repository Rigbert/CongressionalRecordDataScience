Rogers of Kentucky, Mr. Price and the chairman of the committee.  It will be our intention to roll all votes until tomorrow morning, so that there is no expectation that there will be any more votes tonight for Members. The debate will be concluded.  Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Burton).
