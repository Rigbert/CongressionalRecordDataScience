Speaker, Thomas Saam will long be remembered by local school children, union workers, Vietnam Veterans, family, friends and hundreds of children in Vietnam. Tom was a patriot who took great pride in America and his service in the U.S. Marine Corps. Always a strong voice for organized labor, Tom was a 26-year employee of General Motors Power Train in Toledo, OH. He was a proud United Auto Worker, UAW, and trustee who believed strongly in the quality of life for workers and their families who remained active as a member of the UAW Local No. 14 Retirees.  Seven years ago, in 1995, Tom Saam underwent a heart transplant. Following successful surgery, Tom became a spokesperson for transplants and a volunteer with the American Heart Association, receiving their prestigious Heart and Soul Award. He served with pride the American Red Cross, Life Connections of Ohio and the Mended Hearts Association. Upon his death on December 7, 2002, Tom Saam became a donor also. During the last 7 years as a proponent for organ and tissue donation, Tom Saam spent a great deal of time speaking to groups as an advocate for donation and educating children about the dangers of smoking. Tom's concern for our children and youth was always present in all that he did.  Tom Saam, a former U.S. Marine, served two tours in Vietnam. Tom Saam never forgot his veteran buddies as an active member of Veteran of Foreign Wars Post No. 3265, Toledo, OH, and VFW Department of Ohio P.O.W./M.I.A. Chairman 1992-1995. Tom served as Post No. 3265 Americanism Chairman from 1990-2002 and served as UAW Region 2B Veterans Representative 1995-2002.  On Veteran's Day in 1999, Tom Saam and several other Vietnam Veterans joined me in our District Congressional Office and placed a conference call to then U.S. Ambassador to Vietnam Pete Peterson. From that conversation and meeting, Tom Saam and his core group of veterans formed the D.O.V.E. Fund, a non-profit humanitarian organization dedicated to helping the children of Vietnam in the areas of health care, improving water quality and building schools. As a charter member and member of the D.O.V.E. Fund Board of Directors, Tom worked diligently to provide the extras such as writing tablets, pencils, toothbrushes, soap and other like items that the children of Vietnam need. Tom never hesitated to approach anyone he felt could provide assistance for a child. His dentist, his insurance agent, his union, his buddies and a variety of local veteran's groups were frequent donors of school supplies, ball caps, candy and anything else that kids needed to improve their quality of life.  In May of 2001 Tom traveled with other veterans on a return trip to Vietnam. Tom had arranged through a Vietnamese-American contact to obtain what was believed to be the remains of 2 American M.I.A.s' and return these remains to our government in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. As a result of his efforts, Tom was named the June 2001, Citizen of the Month by Toledo's Mayor and was awarded the UAW Walter P. Reuther Distinguished Service Award for his courageous efforts. The D.O.V.E. Board of Directors is planning to build a school in Quang Tri Province, Vietnam and dedicate it in Tom Saam's memory.  Tom is the father of Thomas, Jr., Jeremy, Laura and Jamie and the husband of Barbara. He will always be remembered as a loving husband and father, a veteran's advocate, a tough Marine and union member, a gentle spirit and mentor and a proud American. Mr. Oscar Bunch, President of Local No. 14 and long time friend of Tom said, ``Everyone who had anything to do with Tom just loved him.'' Many of us in Northwest Ohio share Oscar's sentiment. Tom Saam will be missed.                          ____________________
