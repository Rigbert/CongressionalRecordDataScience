  Mr. President, I will wrap this up. I commend my friend and colleague, the junior Senator from California, Senator Boxer, for her indefatigable effort and perseverance on the Weldon amendment. I want to say how strongly I agree with her. I will submit for the Record a letter I circulated, signed by Senators Boxer, Snowe, Clinton, Lincoln, Mikulski, Stabenow, Murray, Cantwell and Collins. I think if I could probably sum it up for everybody, this is just one more step in removing a woman's right to choose. It is a terrible step because it also subjects a woman without resources to a situation where she cannot find help, particularly in a rural area.  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                                Washington, DC, November 19, 2004.     Hon. Ted Stevens,     Chairman, Senate Committee on Appropriations,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Stevens: We are writing to oppose a provision      called the federal refusal clause from being included in the      FY 2005 Omnibus Appropriations bill. This provision was      included by Representative Dave Weldon in the FY 2005 House      Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations bill and it would allow a      broad range of health-care companies to refuse to comply with      federal, state, and local laws and regulations pertaining to      abortion services.       Should this provision become law, federal, state, or local      government may no longer require any institutional or      individual health-care provider to provide, pay for, or refer      for abortion services. This will mean that medical providers      in hospitals and clinics across the country will likely be      victims of demonstrations and intimidations as this provision      allows that they be forbidden from providing abortion care to      women who need it, and also to deny women referrals to      another provider. It will interfere with the authority of      Attorneys General to reject, approve or impose terms on the      sale or transfer of assets by nonprofit health entities as      under current law. For example, an Attorney General could no      longer reject a merger proposal on the grounds that the      result would be diminished community access to full      reproductive health services.       This provision has never been considered in the Senate.      There have been no hearings held and no debate about this      provision. Further, this provision puts all states' Labor-     HHS-Education funding at risk and will require them to change      existing laws.       The federal refusal clause is harmful to women and denies      women access to reproductive health services. We ask that you      oppose     its inclusion in the FY 2005 Omnibus Appropriations bill.           Sincerely, Thank you for your consideration.         Dianne Feinstein, Barbara Boxer, Olympia Snowe, Hillary            Rodham Clinton, Blanche L. Lincoln, Barbara A.            Milkuski, Debbie Stabenow, Patty Murray, Maria            Cantwell, Susan Collins.
