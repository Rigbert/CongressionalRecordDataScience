Speaker, I rise today to recognize the retirement of an extremely devoted public servant. Mr. Richard W. Boers, commissioner of Forestry and Open Space Planning for the city of Toledo, recently announced his retirement. I would like to recognize his numerous contributions to my district during his career.  Mr. Boers was the youngest commissioner in the city of Toledo when he was appointed in 1966. Since his appointment, I have witnessed the flourishing of the city of Toledo under his leadership. Mr. Boers has been responsible for several recreational parks in Toledo area, where residents have enjoyed the beautiful greenery while walking, biking, and picnicking. The arts community has also prospered with the annual Crosby Festival for the Arts at the Toledo Botanical Gardens. It is because of his involvement with the Arts Commission of Greater Toledo, that his festival has benefited the artists in the region, as well as those seeking the beauty and solitude offered by our encounters with nature. Mr. Boers has been instrumental in the Buckeye Basin project, the Urban Forestry Commission and Nature Education programs. In addition, Toledo has been classified as a Tree City USA for the past 15 years.  Because of the efforts put forth by Mr. Boers, Toledo's natural beauty has emerged for several generations to appreciate. I sincerely wish the best for Mr. Boers and his family, and wish to thank him for insight and dedication to the city of Toledo. I know my colleagues join me in wishing Mr. Boers well in his retirement and expressing my deepest gratitude on behalf of the citizens of Toledo for his exceptional efforts to bring out one of the best of Toledo's bounty of attributes.                          ____________________
