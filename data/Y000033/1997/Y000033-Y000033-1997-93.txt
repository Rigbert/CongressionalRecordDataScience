Mr. Chairman, I agreed to the amendments thatwere being offered by the gentleman from California, including the gentleman from California [Mr. Farr], a time limitation of 15 minutes on each side, in the sense of cooperation, but I do not believe there is much need to debate this legislation any further than it has been debated.  It has been debated by thousands of Americans because the American Land Sovereignty Protection Act asserts the power of this Congress that is under the Constitution over all the lands that belong to America. So that everyone understands, the concern here is the Congress, therefore the people, are left out of the domestic process to designate World Heritage sites and Biosphere reserves.  I want to stress that again. We are left out. They have never been consulted. They were never worked with. This was a U.N. effort on behalf of the State Department to make these grand decisions without even considering the local input.  All this bill requires is the participation of Congress, which really is the branch of the American people, in the designation process of Heritage sites and Biosphere reserves.                              {time}  1745  Many, many Americans, from all sections of our country, have called my office to say they are concerned about the lack of congressional oversight over UNESCO international land reserves in the U.S. and to express support for this bill.  Within the last 25 years, 67 sites in the United States have been designated as Biosphere Reserves or World Heritage sites, all with no congressional oversight and no congressional input or input from individual citizens. The public and local governments were not consulted.  The World Heritage Site Program is based on a treaty. H.R. 901 does not end U.S. participation in the World Heritage Site Program. We have a domestic law implementing this program, and H.R. 901 proposes to change that domestic law so that Congress must approve the sites.  The Biosphere Reserve Program is not authorized by even a single U.S. law or any international treaty. May I remind my colleagues when they raise their hand up here and say, ``I swear to uphold the Constitution,'' if they do not support this bill, they are against the Constitution of America.  This is an extended effort by the executive branch appointees, whatever their political party, cannot and should not do things the law does not authorize. What is unreasonable about Congress insisting that no land be designated for inclusion in these international land use programs without clear and direct approval of Congress? What is unreasonable about having local citizens and public officials participate in decisions on designating land near their homes for inclusion in an international zone?  We need to reemphasize our congressional duty to keep international commitments from abridging traditional constitutional constraints. Otherwise, the boundaries between one owner's land and another or even between the Government's land and private land are too easily ignored.  H.R. 901 will also prevent attempts by the executive branch to use international land designations to bypass the Congress to make land use decisions and protect our domestic land use decision-making process from unnecessary international interference.  We are going to hear a lot today that this is a fear tactic to worry about black helicopters, this is just what we call a good thing to do, this makes us all feel so well and good. But, for the life of me, what is wrong with this body, this Congress, from making these decisions is some U.N. body making decisions that affect everybody's lives, especially the local people; it decreases the value of their land.  By the way, most of the areas that did have proper notice rejected these definitions. But in my State, we were never notified, the Governor was never notified, legislative body was never notified, my villages were never notified. Yet, we have these Biosphere areas in my State. And that is wrong. Of the 67, we found out there was no input at all in those areas with the local people.  The amendments that are going to be offered today, the amendments I suggested and I agreed to be let offered, I am going to oppose all of them, and I hope we can defeat all of them, because they are not warranted. There is no necessity for them. This is a simple, clean bill that says, yes, we are still part of the program, but when you designate this, you are going to have to get the go-ahead from the Congress.  I urge a strong vote on H.R. 901 and urge its passage.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
