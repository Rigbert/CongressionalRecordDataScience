Speaker, the month of March is a time for us to officially recognize the essential role the American Red Cross plays in our communities. 2006 is a special year for the Red Cross, as we commemorate its 125th year of making our country safer, healthier and more secure. In honoring the national organization of the Red Cross, we must also recognize the local chapters that work tirelessly to achieve these goals, such as the Red Cross of Southern Maryland, now in its 80th year of service.  The Southern Maryland Red Cross, and the Nation, faced new challenges in 2005. The deadly tsunami in late 2004 tested the character and will of the international community, and Hurricanes Katrina and Rita uprooted families and communities. Throughout every trial we faced, the Red Cross was there to help ease suffering and aid recovery. These dedicated people were first in line to help families and individuals, friends and strangers.  The Southern Maryland Red Cross faced not only the national disasters of 2005, but ones that hit closer to home. The response they provided is a testament to the kindness of any American touched by tragedy. The citizens of Southern Maryland rolled up their sleeves to donate over 7,000 units of blood and gave donations to aid the victims of 200 house fires. They learned CPR, lifesaving skills, and first aid techniques. They volunteered their time, money and hearts to anyone who needed help. And they did not just aid their neighbors at home, but also those abroad, allowing over 200 military personnel to communicate with their families in Maryland.  Mr. Speaker, the people of the Southern Maryland Red Cross are no different from you or me. They have full time jobs, families, and responsibilities at home. What makes these Americans so extraordinary is that they have selflessly taken time out of their lives to help schools, workplaces, families, and any person who needs a hand. The Southern Maryland Chapter consists of 200 volunteers and donors, but it responds to the needs of a nation.  The Southern Maryland Red Cross brings aid and recovery, gives hope and comfort, and inspires Americans to reach out when help is needed. I feel assured knowing that the Southern Maryland Chapter is working every day to better the lives of my fellow Maryland residents. We must all do our part to recognize the vitality of the Red Cross and ensure that they are ready to help us respond to the challenges that lie ahead.  In honor of the Southern Maryland Chapter of the Red Cross, I would like to take this time to officially recognize March as American Red Cross Month. Whether it is a donation of time, money or courage, the American Red Cross is there for us. This March is a time to stand up and recognize their continued service.  I encourage all Americans to show their commitment to the Red Cross by donating money or volunteering their time at one of the many local chapters across the country.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Page E294]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                        AMERICAN RED CROSS MONTH                                 ______                                                           HON.
