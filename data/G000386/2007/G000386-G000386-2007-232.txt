 President, I yield myself the 1 minute I have left.  First of all, there is no $3 billion to corn farmers, when corn is $4 a bushel or $3.50 a bushel.  Second, as to the point made by Senator Kyl, as well as Senator Gregg, that consumers want lower prices and somehow ethanol is driving up that price, let me tell you that ethanol today, this very day, if you check the market, is cheaper in the Northeast and the east coast than gasoline is.
