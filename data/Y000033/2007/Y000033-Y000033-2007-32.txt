Mr. Speaker, I rise to clarify an ambiguity in a provision in the SAFETEA-LU Technical Corrections Act of 2007. Specifically, section 105(a)(99) of the bill refers to a project known as ``Dowling Road Extension/Reconstruction West,'' which goes in a west-east direction from Minnesota Drive to Old Seward Highway in Anchorage, AK. Unfortunately, the provision could be read to mean that the project goes in a westerly direction from Minnesota Drive to Old Seward Highway, which would create a result that would be completely incompatible with the project since it would put the road in the middle of a lake and a bog. The word ``west'' as used in section 105(a)(99) is part of the name of the project, and is not intended to indicate the direction in which the project should be built.
