I thank my friend for yielding.  I am so glad and pleased that you are raising the issue of trade agreements. It is an issue that Democrats and Republicans have a history--and a long and rich and gloried history--of working together, and we will work together.  I know that the Majority Leader, Mr. Hoyer, is very focused on the issue of trade, Panama FTA, and that he is working with the administration and with Members on your side of the aisle--including Mr. Kirk and your leadership--to get this trade agreement done in a timely manner. I promise you that. And I know if Mr. Hoyer was standing here, he would make the same promise.  Mr. McCARTHY of California. Reclaiming my time, I thank the gentleman. Because when I sit back and I think of the time of the President going to Peoria, going to Caterpillar, and I listened to those individuals that work there and I listened to their Representative, Congressman Aaron Schock, when he sat there and talked to them and they said the number of tractors they would sell, that the actual tariffs would be brought down automatically as soon as these trade agreements go forward.  But when you think of America, where we continue to lose jobs and we are thinking about job creation and small business, these trade agreements are nothing but a benefit to America, we want to work with you. And I just ask the gentleman, I appreciate his willingness to work with us, but could we do this by July 4? The President has signaled that he would like that done. Does the gentleman believe we can have it done by July 4?  I yield to the gentleman.
