 President, today I am proud to introduce the California Desert Conservation and Recreation Act.  In February of 2015, I, along with Sen. Boxer, introduced a bill under the same name. That bill from 2015 included a number of conservation and recreation provisions that the President could not include in his recent designation of three national monuments.  The President's designation this past month of those new national monuments--Mojave Trails, Sand to Snow, and Castle Mountain--was a major milestone in our efforts to protect the desert. But, due to limitations under the Antiquities Act, the President's executive action left out several key parts of our desert bill from 2015. These remaining provisions were vital to many of the groups and organizations that came together to support our bill in 2015.  I made a commitment to those groups to enact the entire bill, not just parts of the bill. And I intend to fulfill that promise. The remaining provisions included in today's legislation do the following: enhance recreational opportunities by establishing 142,000 acres of permanent Off-Highway Vehicle recreation areas; further expand wilderness areas in the desert, by designating five additional wilderness areas that cover 230,000 acres of land near Fort Irwin; ensure clean and free-flowing rivers, through the designation of 77 miles of rivers as Wild and Scenic Rivers; add to our national parks, by expanding Death Valley National Park Wilderness by 39,000 acres and Joshua Tree National Park by 4,500 acres; expand National Scenic Areas, by adding 18,610 acres to the Alabama Hills National Scenic Area in Inyo County; protect important cultural resources, by requiring the Department of the Interior to protect petroglyphs and other cultural resources in San Bernardino and Imperial County; and, facilitate renewable energy development in a way that protects delicate habitat.  I want to be very clear: I intend to continue to work with my colleagues in the Senate and House to advance this important bill and the wilderness protections, national park additions, recreation area designations and other renewable energy provisions that were not implemented through the Antiquities Act.  This legislation balances the many competing uses for public lands across the California desert: It protects fragile ecosystems and significant cultural resources, provides for increased recreational opportunities, and encourages sensible renewable energy development. This current bill includes all of the carefully negotiated provisions from the bill I introduced in February, minus the three monuments.  This bill reflects our attempt to achieve consensus among the competing uses of desert land and the many stakeholders involved, including environmental groups, State and local governments, the off-road community, cattle ranchers, mining interests, the Defense Department, energy companies, California's public utility companies, and many others.  As a result of the general public's robust participation, we have put together a bipartisan proposal that charts a commonsense path forward for the California desert. We made a commitment to these stakeholders to enact these commonsense solutions, and I intend to follow through on that promise.  I want to highlight some of the key provisions of this legislation:  By designating five new wilderness areas, this bill protects fragile desert ecosystems across 230,000 acres of wilderness near Fort Irwin. This includes 88,000 acres of Avawatz Mountains, 8,000-acre Great Falls Basin Wilderness, the 80,000-acre Soda Mountains Wilderness, and the 32,500-acre Death Valley Wilderness.  These proposed wilderness areas have something for everyone: Desert solitude; abundant hiking options and rock climbing routes; and horseback riding and hunting for those that wish to experience a truly remarkable backcountry experience.  This bill is more than just wilderness, however. It also designates four new wild and scenic rivers, totaling 77 miles in length. These rivers and creeks are important, and rare, riparian areas in the heart of the arid desert. This designation will ensure that those rivers and creeks remain clean and free-flowing and that their immediate environments are preserved. These beautiful waterways are Deep Creek and the Whitewater River in and near the San Bernardino National Forest, as well as the Amargosa River and Surprise Canyon Creek near Death Valley National Park.  Conserving pristine desert land such as this is most definitely in the interests of our country. The California desert is a very special place and it deserves to stay that way.  The legislation also provides permanent protection for five existing Off-Highway Vehicle Areas covering approximately 142,000 acres.  The bill also releases 126,000 acres of land from their existing wilderness study area designation in response to requests from local government and recreation users. This will allow the land to be made available for other purposes, including recreational off-highway vehicle use on designated routes. Although the President's recent executive action could not include these permanent protections, off-roaders are a vital part of the coalition we put together. They deserve certainty about their future enjoyment of the land, just as conservationists now have certainty as a result of the monument designations. With this bill introduction, I renew my pledge to work closely with the off-road community.  We must also take into account another use of the desert land: renewable energy. And I believe that we can accomplish the twin aims of honoring our commitment to conservation and fulfilling California's pledge to develop a clean energy portfolio. Balancing conservation, development and other uses is possible, we just need to come up with the right solutions. Thankfully, some of these compromises are already in place.  By April 2009, solar and wind companies had proposed 28 projects to be included in the Mojave Trails National Monument, including sites on former Catellus lands intended for permanent conservation. I visited some of those sites at the time, including one particularly beautiful area known as the Broadwell Valley, where thousands of acres of pristine lands were proposed for development. Seeing it first hand, I quickly came to the conclusion that those lands were simply not the right place for renewable energy development.  Since then, 26 of the 28 applications have been withdrawn. Let me explain why this happened. First, the Energy and Interior Departments developed new solar energy zones. These zones allow projects to be developed on lands least likely to harm plant and wildlife species, and allow projects to be completed faster and with fewer conflicts. This is a smart compromise. Second, California has worked closely with Federal agencies to develop the Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan. This blueprint will help identify pristine lands that warrant protection and direct energy projects elsewhere. This is a fair balancing of priorities, and I think it provides a clear path forward.  The bill I am introducing also takes additional action to help promote responsible renewable energy development through state land exchanges. There are currently about 370,000 acres of isolated parcels of state lands spread across the California desert. These state-owned lands are largely unusable, due to their location inside Federal national parks, wilderness, monuments, and conservation areas. The bill addresses this problem by requiring the Department of the Interior to develop and implement a plan with the state to exchange these state lands for other BLM or General Services Administration owned property in the next ten years. By swapping state land that is often surrounded by wilderness and national parks for other federal land, these exchanges will provide California with sites for renewable energy production, recreation or other uses.  I strongly urge my colleagues in both the House and the Senate to take a hard look at this legislation. We have made great strides in the past twenty years to strike the right balance between desert conservation, recreational uses, and the development of our natural resources. I believe this legislation continues in that fine tradition. Built on a foundation of consensus and compromise, this legislation fulfills our promise to the next generation that they will have the same opportunities to indulge in the best the California desert has to offer.  I am hopeful this Congress will take this legislation up and move it forward. It's the right thing to do.                          ____________________
