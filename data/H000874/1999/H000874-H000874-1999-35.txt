Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for yielding me this time.  The gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Hulshof) mentioned Harry Truman's remarks about the disabled community. I had the privilege of cosponsoring the Americans with Disabilities Act that President Bush signed in July of 1990. That bill said that we were going to give opportunity to 43 million Americans who were disabled.  What this bill does, as the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Hulshof) has pointed out and as the gentleman from California (Mr. Matsui) has pointed out so well, is to facilitate the entry into the workplace for those who, but for thisbill, may not be able to risk it or afford it.  The good news is that the bill for a portion of time made optional the payment of some of these expenses. I want to thank the committee and those who worked on this bill to reinstall the mandatory nature under Medicaid of the payments that have been provided for. That is essential not to discriminate against those who might be disabled and who do, as the gentleman has said, want to enter the workplace, want to be taxpayers, and want to enjoy the full opportunities that America has to offer.
