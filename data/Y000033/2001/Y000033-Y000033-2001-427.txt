Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this motion to recommit. Number one, the way the motion is written, it would send this bill back to the committee. The process would start all over again, and that process takes a long time to get back to the floor. In the meantime, the Army and the Navy and the Air Force and the Marine Corps and the United States Coast Guard are doing without money that they really need for operations today, that they need for fuel costs that have been increasing so dramatically, that they need to pay medical expenses that are $1.5 billion in arrears already. We do not want to see this problem being created with our military services. This would kill the bill. We do not want to kill this bill. We spent all day long here getting it ready to pass. I sure do not want to have to do it again.  Let us vote down this motion to recommit, come back here tomorrow, and let us do the Interior Appropriations and get out for the weekend so that we can all go home and see our constituents.
