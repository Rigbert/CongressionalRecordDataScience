Chairman, I rise in strong support of the gentlewoman's amendment. There is $10 million contained in her amendment. That is a significant sum of money. When compared, however, to current year level spending for the renewable accounts of $1.825 billion, and as the chairman rightfully pointed out, a reduction of $428 million from that account, the gentlewoman's amendment is as much a statement of Congress as it is a monetary initiative. That is, we need to make an investment in our energy future as well as our economic future.  Renewable energy must be a part of that future, and the vast majority of industries in our country throughout our history have received substantial support from the government to become established and to be part of this great Nation.  This amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Ohio takes a very small, but very positive, step towards making that investment, and I do urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the amendment; and I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur).  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it.
