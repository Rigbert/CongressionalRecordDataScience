President, I rise today to recognize the accomplishments of MG Reginald Centracchio, the Adjutant General of the State of Rhode Island and the commanding general of the Rhode Island National Guard. Major General Centracchio retired on September 1, 2005, after 48 years in the Rhode Island Army National Guard. He is the only adjutant general from Rhode Island to serve his entire career within the Rhode Island National Guard, rising from private to the position of adjutant general.  Major General Centracchio enlisted as a private in the National Guard in September 1957. He graduated from Officer Candidate School in 1962, and was commissioned a second lieutenant, Air Defense Artillery.  Over the past four decades, Major General Centracchio held a wide variety of important command and staff positions, including platoon leader and battery commander on various missile sites throughout Rhode Island; field artillery tactical intelligence staff officer and adjutant; recruiting and retention manager; plans, operations and military support officer; director of personnel and administration; and director of plans, operations and training, Rhode Island Army National Guard.  Major General Centracchio was appointed the Adjutant General, State of Rhode Island, and Commanding General, Rhode Island National Guard, by Gov. Lincoln Almond on August 1, 1995. On August 1, 2002, he achieved the State rank of lieutenant general. On July 1, 1996, he was appointed director of the Rhode Island Emergency Management Agency, RIEMA, merging the National Guard and Emergency Management Agency. On January 21, 2003, he was reappointed by Gov. Donald L. Carcieri as the Adjutant General of Rhode Island; he was then appointed Rhode Island Homeland Security Advisor. Major General Centracchio is the first adjutant general to hold all three positions simultaneously.  During his tenure as Adjutant General and Commanding General of the Rhode Island National Guard, Major General Centracchio's leadership and commitment were essential in ensuring the Rhode Island National Guard trained, equipped, and deployed soldiers and airmen in support of United States military missions at home and abroad. His experience and knowledge were constantly sought during numerous State emergencies in which Rhode Island National Guard troops were employed to ensure public safety. Under his direct supervision, the Rhode Island National Guard mobilized and deployed over 3,500 troops in support of Operations Noble Eagle, Enduring Freedom, and Iraqi Freedom. This represents the largest deployment of Rhode Island National Guard Troops since the First World War.  General Centracchio exemplifies what it means to be a ``soldier.'' He was utterly committed to accomplishing his mission and completely dedicated to the welfare of his troops. He led by example. His service and sacrifice sustained the men and women of the Rhode Island National Guard and will continue to inspire them in the years ahead.  I also want to commend his wife, Linda. She also served by his side to provide for the men and women of the Rhode Island National Guard. Together they made an extraordinary contribution to our Nation and to Rhode Island.  Major General Centracchio's superb sense of duty and responsibility provided the citizens of Rhode Island with solid evidence of the National Guard's commitment to the State and Nation. On behalf of the residents of Rhode Island, I thank Major General Centracchio for a lifetime of selfless service. I wish him well and salute him with the title that he has earned and honored. ``Sir, you are a soldier.''                          ____________________[Page S9982]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov] RECOGNITION OF THE RETIREMENT OF MAJOR GENERAL REGINALD CENTRACCHIO,                         U.S. ARMY NATIONAL GUARD
