President, before Senator King leaves the floor, let me just say, as one who ran the legal services for the elderly program in Oregon, that the Senator makes all of us in legal services proud tonight. Senator King has really put a face on what is at stake here in the way he has focused on the opioid scourge that is hammering areas from coast to coast. Rural health care--without rural health care, we can't have rural life. It is just that simple. Certainly when we get to the closing here in perhaps an hour and a half or so, we are going to get to the bottom line, as the Senator did. I think these changes take America back to the day where health care was for the healthy and wealthy.  So I thank the Senator for his passion and his commitment to his citizens, but also to the people of this country. Anybody in legal services tonight will be very proud, as I am, because what it is all about is standing up for people, and the Senator has said it very well.  Mr. President, we will be having our closing remarks here in perhaps an hour and a half or thereabouts. We have several Members of the Senate who are on their way for their remarks, and several Members of the Senate have discussed various elements of the serious and unanswered ethics questions surrounding Congressman Price's nomination. It is my view that these are issues that have set off loud ethical alarm bells.  I want to take a little bit more time to lay out the full story here.  The stock trades Congressman Price made while working on health care policy do, in fact, raise serious ethical and legal questions. None of Congressman Price's stock trades raise more questions than the hundreds of thousands of shares he bought in the obscure Australian biotech company known as Innate. His stock in this company is by far his largest of holdings, both in terms of the hundreds of thousands of shares he owns and the value of those shares, and that exceeds a quarter of a million dollars.  Congressman Price told the Finance Committee that he did not get a special deal. He told the Health, Education, Labor Committee that he did not get a special deal. But the fact is, Congressman Price paid bargain-basement prices for Innate stock in a private sale last August. The private stock sale was limited to a small group of well-connected American investors.  Congressman Price's participation has been described as a ``sweetheart deal'' by Kaiser Health News and a ``privileged, discounted offer'' by the Wall Street Journal.  As I said during his nomination hearing, Congressman Price's participation in the private stock sale showed bad judgment at best. At worst, it raised serious questions about whether he violated the STOCK Act or other security laws. I will take a minute to read section 3 of the STOCK Act. It says: ``Members of Congress . . . may not use nonpublic information derived from such person's position . . . or gained from the performance of such person's official responsibilities as a means for making a private profit.''  It is well known that Congressman Price learned about Innate from a House colleague, Congressman Chris Collins of New York. Collins is not just a casual reader of the Australian business pages; he is actually a member of the company's board and its largest shareholder.  This raises additional questions: Did Congressman Price have access to nonpublic information about Innate or its private stock because of his position as a Member of Congress? Did he get special access to the discounted private sale because of his position? Does he stand to profit because of the information or access he may have received?Finally, did Congressman Price tell the Finance Committee the truth about how he learned about the private stock sales and the ability of typical investors to participate?  Congressman Price would have us believe that he decided to make these investments based on his own research into the company. That is what he told the Finance Committee.  Let me quote from the Wall Street Journal's article published January 30:       Mr. Price wasn't in line to buy shares in the last private      placement because he hadn't previously participated in      private fundraising rounds. . . . Mr. Price first invested in      the company a year ago, buying shares through the open market      on the Australian exchange. He learned about the company from      Mr. Collins, who holds a 17 percent stake in it. Mr. Collins      said Mr. Price is ``one of my friends'' and that he sits      ``next to him'' on the House floor. . . . Mr. Price got it on      the discounted sale after Mr. Collins filled him in on the      company's drug trial, according to Mr. Collins.  The fact is, you don't just get in on a private stock offering by accident. As the Wall Street Journal explained, Congressman Price didn't originally even meet the criteria for participating in the 2016 private offering because he hadn't participated in any previous offerings. Yet he was able to buy over 400,000 shares of stock with Congressman Collins' help.  My view and the view of my Democratic colleagues is that Congressman Price failed to come clean with the Senate Finance Committee on the details of the special discounted deal. He has assured the committee he followed the law, but straightforward questions have been met with dodging, weaving, and obfuscation. Details of his purchase continue to emerge, and the public's understanding of his involvement continues to evolve.  Meanwhile, as scrutiny of the deal continues to mount, Innate's top executives are defending Congressman Price at the behest of his colleague Congressman Collins, who sits on the company's board of directors.  After the Wall Street Journal story was published, the company and Congressman Price went into spin control. The public knows this only because Congressman Collins made a mistake that everybody who uses email for work has seen made at least once: He mistakenly hit ``reply all'' when responding to an email from the company's CEO, Simon Wilkinson. Instead of a private note to Mr. Wilkinson, the note wound up going to a CNN reporter covering the story.  In the email, Congressman Collins, the company's top shareholder, said the Wall Street Journal was ``yellow journalism,'' and he thanked Innate's chief executive, Mr. Wilkinson, for defending Congressman Price and the company. According to CNN, Congressman Collins acknowledged the email to be authentic.  The Finance Committee's own experience with Innate only adds to the sense that there is a coverup as Republicans seek to race Congressman Price across the confirmation finish line.  The day after the Wall Street Journal story ran, I wrote my own letter to Innate's CEO, Mr. Wilkinson. I asked the company to respond to the article and the inconsistencies in Mr. Price's explanations and for documentation of details of the private stock sales. The company refused to answer my letter.  This looks to me like a coverup, and it ought to shake this body's confidence in Congressman Price's nomination. This situation, in my view, demands that further questions be asked and answered. Instead of taking time to explore these issues, Republicans took the unprecedented step of suspending the Finance Committee's rules to rush this nomination to the floor before any more questions could be asked, let alone answered.  In years past, as with the nominations of Senator Daschle, Secretary Geithner, and Ambassador Kirk, the Finance Committee left no stone unturned in the vetting process. Not this time. The majority party, in my view, is on its way to an ethical double standard to cut off the vetting process. That leaves me with a question for Congressman Price and my Republican colleagues in the Senate: What is there to hide?  Mr. President, before I continue, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter that I sent to Simon Wilkinson, chief executive of Innate, on January 31, 2017.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                             United States Senate,                                         Committee on Finance,                                 Washington, DC, January 31, 2017.     Mr. Simon Wilkinson,     Chief Executive Officer,     Innate Immunotherapeutics Limited,     Sydney, Australia.       Dear Mr. Wilkinson: As part of the U.S. Senate's      constitutional duty to confirm presidential appointments, I      have been reviewing the record of U.S. Representative Thomas      Edmunds Price, who has been nominated to be the Secretary of      the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.       To that end, I am writing to you seeking prompt assistance      in providing information and documents related to Congressman      Price's investment in Innate. Please provide the requested      information and documents:       1. The New York Times reported that ``Mr. Wilkinson and      Michael Quinn, Innate's chairman, said they had never heard      of many of the company's more prominent investors, and said      they first learned that Mr. Price had invested in the company      from an article in The Wall Street Journal [published online      December 22, 2016], which first reported his investment.''       In written response to questions from the Committee,      Congressman Price said ``I communicated with Representative      Collins, who is a director of Innate. As noted above, I      learned about Innate through a general conversation with him      in the fall of 2014. I also communicated with Simon Wilkinson      of Innate regarding my interest in participating in the 2016      private placement of company stock.'' In addition, the Wall      Street Journal reported that ``Mr. Collins said he told Mr.      Price of the additional private placement. He said Mr. Price      asked if he could participate in it. `Could you have someone      send me the documents?' Mr. Collins recalled Mr. Price asking      him.''       a. Please identify any meeting or communication between      you, the company, its officers, employees, directors,      consultants or affiliated personnel, and Congressman Price.      In so doing, please include the person or persons involved in      such communication or meeting, the date, method, location of      the communication, and the subject of the communication.       b. Please provide any e-mail or other written      communications between you, the company, its officers,      employees, directors, consultants or other affiliated      personnel, and Congressman Price. In addition, please provide      any documents transmitted by Innate to Congressman Price, and      any document Congressman Price transmitted to the company.       2.
