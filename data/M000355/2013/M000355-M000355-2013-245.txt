 REID. Yes. I just wanted to say I won't get into the politics of sports in Kentucky because I don't understand them, but I know how much Senator McConnell cares about the Louisville Cardinals.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would say to my good friend from Nevada that one of the things we enjoy talking about is sports, and he is a big UNLV fan as well. I would like to report to my friend through the Chair that it was a fun evening. It was absolutely exciting to be there. I was also grateful to the majority leader for coming down to the University of Louisville a few years ago. I was glad I had a chance to be there and to see it in person.  Basketball in a football facility is a little odd. There were 75,000 people there. I am not sure many people up at the top even saw the players. But we were a little closer to the floor, and it was a wonderful experience.  I thank the majority leader for his comments.                            Jerry Tarkanian
