 I would say, Mr. Leader, not as a question but as an observation, as you know, there has been a great deal of concern on both sides of the aisle with reference to the PATRIOT Act, the provisions in the PATRIOT Act and to the extension of the PATRIOT Act. Obviously, the majority of the PATRIOT Act is in permanent law, but there are some portions that needed to be reauthorized.  I do not ask you a question because I know that this is still up in the air, but we are hopeful that as soon as the majority may have a better view of the scheduling of the PATRIOT Act, the sooner you could inform us of that would be better.
