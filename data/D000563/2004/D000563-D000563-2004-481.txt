I hope the Senate will return to that. I hope we can find a way to choose people who are fair arbiters. There is a fear on the other side that something will be done to embarrass the administration before an election, especially a feeling we should let the chips fall where they may. Can't we find people in this country--I think we can--who will be honest, dispassionate, and nonpartisan?  At issue is not just a question of who comes out ahead on the political ledger sheet. The question before the Senate is one of the most important elements for America's national defense and security. If we had planes being flown in Iraq that were crashing, if we had tanks that could not shoot straight, if we had a lot of equipment over there that was failing, we would hear very quickly from the press, from the public, from the Pentagon, that we need an investigation.  Here we have a failure of something equally important, a failure of intelligence. We need to get to the bottom of it. If we are going to be successful in any war on terrorism, we need the very best intelligence in the world. Clearly, our intelligence failed us in the leadup to the invasion of Iraq.  We find ourselves today in a situation which is likely to be long term, costing American taxpayers $1 billion a week but, more importantly, continuing to cost American lives. That is a compelling reason to move on this with dispatch.  I sincerely hope Senator Corzine's suggestion is followed up on as quickly as possible.
