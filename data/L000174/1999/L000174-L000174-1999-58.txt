President, I rise today to introduce the Financial Information Privacy and Security Act of 1999. I am pleased that Senators Bryan, Harkin, Durbin, and Feingold are original cosponsors of this legislation to protect the financial privacy of all Americans.  The right of privacy is a personal and fundamental right protected by the Constitution of the United States. But today, the American people are growing more and more concerned over encroachments on their personal privacy.  New technologies, new communications media, and new business services created with the best of intentions and highest of expectations also pose a threat to our ability to keep our lives to ourselves, and to live, work and think without having personal information about us collected without our knowledge or consent.  This incremental invasion of our privacy has happened through the lack of safeguards on personal, financial and medical information, which can be stolen, sold or mishandled and find its way into the wrong hands with the push of a button or click of a mouse.  Our right of privacy has become one of the most vulnerable rights in the information age. The digitalization of information and the explosion in the growth of computing and electronic networking offer tremendous potential benefits to the way Americans live, work, conduct commerce, and interact with their government.  It makes it possible for me, sitting in my farmhouse in Vermont, to connect with any Member of Congress or friends around the world, to get information with the click of a mouse on my computer.  But the new technology also presents new threats to our individual privacy and security, in particular, our ability to control the terms under which our personal information is acquired, disclosed, and used.  Just last week, President Clinton signed into law the landmark Financial Modernization Act of 1999, which updates our financial laws and opens up the financial services industry to become more competitive, both at home and abroad. I supported this legislation because I believe it will benefit businesses and consumers. It will make it easier for banking, securities, and insurance firms to consolidate their services, cut expenses and offer more products at a lower cost to all. But it also raises new concerns about our financial privacy.  New conglomerates in the financial services industry may now offer a widening variety of services, each of which may require a customer to provide financial, medical or other personal information. Nothing in the new law prevents these new subsidiaries or affiliates of financial conglomerates from sharing this information for uses beyond those the customer thought he or she was providing it.  For example, the new law has no requirement for the consumer to consent before these new financial subsidiaries or affiliates sell, share, or publish information on savings account balances, certificates of deposit maturity dates and balances, stock and mutual fund purchases and sales, life insurance payouts or health insurance claims.  That is wrong. You shouldn't be able to have that information and go around to anybody who wants to use it to pitch you some new product or scare you into cashing in life savings or anything else.  As President Clinton recently warned:       Although consumers put a great value on privacy of their      financial records, our laws have not caught up to      technological developments that make it possible and      potentially profitable for companies to share financial data      in new ways. Consumers who undergo physical exams to obtain      insurance, for example, should not have to fear the      information will be used to lower their credit card limits or      deny them mortgages.  I strongly agree. If we had this information in a desk drawer at home, nobody could come in and just take it. Instead, it is in the electronic desk drawer of one of the companies we have given it to, and they can share it with anybody they want within their organization.  Mr. President, the Financial Information Privacy and Security Act of 1999 offers this Congress the historic opportunity to provide fundamental privacy of every American's personal financial information. This bill would protect the privacy of this financial information by directing the Federal Reserve Board, Office of Thrift Supervision, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Securities and Exchange Commission jointly to promulgate rules requiring the financialinstitutions they regulate to: (1) inform their customers about what information may be disclosed, and under what circumstances, including when, to whom and for what purposes; (2) allow customers to review the information for accuracy; (3) establish safeguards to protect the confidentiality of personally identifiable customer information and records to prevent unauthorized disclosure; and (4) for new customers, obtain the customers' consent to disclosure, and for existing customers, give the customers a reasonable opportunity to object to disclosure. These financial institutions could use confidential customer information from other entities only if the entities provides their customers with similar privacy protections.  In addition, this bill provides individuals the civil right of action to enforce their financial privacy rights and to recover punitive damages, reasonable attorneys fees, and other litigation costs. Privacy rights must be enforceable in a court of law to be truly effective.  To be sure, this legislation would not affect any state law which provides greater financial privacy protections to its citizens. Some states have already recognized the growing need for financial privacy protections. For example, I am proud to say that Vermont instituted cutting edge financial privacy laws five years ago. This bill is intended to provide the most basic rights of financial privacy to all American consumers. They deserve nothing less.  When President Clinton signed the financial modernization bill last week, he directed the National Economic Council to work with the Treasury Department and Office of Management and Budget to craft legislative proposals to forward to Congress next year to protect financial privacy in the new financial services marketplace. I believe the Financial Information Privacy and Security Act of 1999, which we are introducing today, should serve as the foundation for the Administration's financial privacy bill.  Americans ought to be able to enjoy the exciting innovations of this burgeoning information era without losing control over the use of their financial information.  The Financial Information Privacy and Security Act updates United States privacy laws to provide these fundamental protections of personal financial information in the evolving financial services industry.  I urge my colleagues to support it.  On privacy, in Vermont we care greatly about this. I have been in public life for a long time. During that time, I have only clipped and actually saved and framed a couple articles about me from the press.  My distinguished friend from Nevada, who is on the floor, like me lives in a rural area--he in Searchlight, I in Middlesex, VT. I live on this dirt road. I look down this valley, 35 miles down a valley, mountains on either side. I literally cannot see another house from my front yard. It is a beautiful spot, this place my parents got when I was a teenager just for a summer home. Marcelle and I have made a year-round place out of it. There is a neighboring farm family who, for 40 years, have hayed the fields and done work around there. They have known me since I was a teenager. The article I cut from the papers was from one of our largest newspapers. It was a sidebar. Here is almost verbatim the way it went.  The out-of-State reporter drives up to a farmer who is sitting on his porch along the dirt road. He says to the farmer, ``Does Senator Leahy live up this road?'' The farmer said, ``You a relative of his?'' He said, ``No, I am not.'' He says, ``You a friend of his?'' He said, ``Not really.'' He says, ``Is he expecting you?'' The reporter says, ``No.'' The farmer looks him right in the eye and says, ``Never heard of him.''  Now, we Vermonters like our privacy. This was a Saturday, and the farmer wasn't about to tell somebody where I lived and direct him down the dirt road to it. It is a humorous story, but I kept that over the years because it reminds me of other ways to protect our privacy. By the same token, I would not want--whether it is that reporter or somebody I never met--to go onto a computer and find my bank statements, my medical records, my children's medical records, or my spouse's, and find out whether we have applied for a mortgage or not, or find out whether we have bought life insurance or cashed in life insurance. So I think we have to ask ourselves as we go into the new millennium, one where information will flow quicker and in more detail than could have even been conceived a generation ago--it could not have been conceived at the time my parents purchased that beautiful spot in Vermont. Ten years from now, we will move faster and with more complexity than we could even think of today.  So I think the Congress, if it is going to fulfill its responsibility to the American people, has to do more and more to protect our privacy and allow technology to move as fast as it can, but not at the price of our individual privacy. We all know basically what we, our friends, neighbors, families, would want to give up of their personal privacy--not very much. Think to yourself, if this was something you had in the top drawer of your desk at home, knowing nobody could get it, they would need search warrants or they would break the law by coming in and taking it. That is all the more reason why on somebody's computer they should not be allowed to take it.                                 ______                                       By
