 President, let me say that the Senator from Nevada is certainly correct. A number of judges have been confirmed. But also this Senate and this Congress will be remembered, apparently--we will see at the end of the Congress--apparently be remembered as the first Senate since 1968 to kill a nomination through the use of the filibuster.  There have been occasional cloture motions over the years, but they have been used to advance the completion of a nomination--not to stop it--with the exception of Fortas in 1968, which was right before a Presidential election. We are not right before a Presidential election. I think this unfortunate precedent that has been set is one that we have had much discussion about on the floor and will be regretted by Senators on both sides of the aisle through the years.                          ____________________
