President, the National Endowment for the Arts has served this Nation well for many, many years. There are things that we can do to improve its performance, but the wholesale scuttling of the National Endowment would, I think, be a mistake. I believe that we can make improvements but we cannot give up the vision of a national agency which reaches into every corner of this country to encourage and inspire the artistic excellence of the American people. By supporting the NEA, we can accomplish that. I believe these amendments would disrupt that support, and, therefore, I oppose them and request that my colleagues oppose them.  I yield back my time.
