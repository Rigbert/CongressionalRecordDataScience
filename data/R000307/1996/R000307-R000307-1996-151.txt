Chairman, it is my pleasure to yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. Gunderson]. The gentleman from Wisconsin has worked harder and longer, with more criticism, and yet should have received more credit than any other member of the Committee on Agriculture. His service to the House as the designated expert, having more expertise in dairy, has been simply outstanding.
