 President, I am pleased to speak today to honor the career of Dr. Philip Royal Shipp, Jr., a devoted public servant who has served the Congress for nearly 30 years at the Congressional Research Service, CRS. During his tenure at the CRS, Dr. Shipp has served in several key management and leadership roles, demonstrating extraordinary levels of competence, intelligence, and intellectual creativity in each of these positions.  Most recently, Dr. Shipp has served as the Director of the Domestic Social Policy Division. The Domestic Social Policy Division offers the Congress research and analysis in many programs and policies that under the jurisdiction of the Senate Finance Committee, including the Medicare, Medicaid, and State Children's Health Insurance Programs, as well as Social Security, pensions, welfare, child welfare programs.  I have been honored to serve as chairman of the Finance Committee for 4 years and am pleased to continue my service as the ranking Republican on the committee. Analysts under Dr. Shipp's supervision have worked closely with my Finance Committee staff, briefing them on complex programs and policies, helping them in the drafting of legislation and participating in Senate Finance Committee hearings.  We Members of Congress simply could not do our work effectively without the support we recelve from organizations like the Congressional Research Service. There is simply no other organization with the reputation and the credibility of CRS. The work provided by CRS is always first rate, oftentimes quantitative and impeccably nonpartisan. Dr. Shipp, throughout his career, has embodied these characteristics.  Dr. Shipp began his Federal service in 1964 as an economist with the Federal Reserve. He was subsequently a progr analyst with the Office of Management and Budget and later the Acting Administrator of the Food and Nutrition Service. Dr. Shipp made significant contributions to the Food and Nutrition Service, including an expanded view of the public policy purposes of food assistance programs such as food stamps. He also was instrumental in establishing and expanding the agency's in-house capacity to analyze programs, study their effects, and estimate the impact of legislative and regulatory changes.  Dr. Shipp joined the Congressional Research Service in 1977 as a Senior Specialist in Social Legislation in the former Education and Public Welfare, EPW, Division. He spent a significant part of the next decade leading teams of CRS analysts in high-level, committee-requested, legislatively relevant research studies focused on health and income issues. Topics included health insurance for the uninsured, retirement income for an aging population, and work incentives in income support programs. Under Dr. Shipp's direction, CRS developed a framework and quantitative model to compare legislative options for a new retirement system for Federal workers; this model was used in the development of the Federal employee retirement system that is in place today. During this period, in 1984, Dr. Shipp also served as Executive Director of the Congressional Panel on Social Security Organization, which was charged with developing an organizational and management framework for an independent agency for Social Security. The panel's principal recommendations were reflected in the legislation that eventually created the independent Social Security Administration.  In 1989, Dr. Shipp became Associate Director of CRS for Research Planning and Coordination, where he guided efforts to evaluate and improve CRS services and operations and led several of tge agency's first strategic management reviews. He returned to EPW asDivision Chief in 1994 and became head of the expanded Domestic Social Policy Division in 1999. As Assistant Director for Domestic Social Policy, the largest research division within CRS, Dr. Shipp emphasized the building of analytic capacities, with a special focus on empirical analysis, as a way to enhance CRS' legislative support to Congress. He was instrumental in building CRS capacities in all areas of domestic social policy, in particular health policy analysis, Social Security and disability analysis, homeland and border secur, public health preparedness, and housing and welfare policy. He organized and staffed the division to respond to new challenges, in particular the heightened need for expertise in domestic intelligence and counterterrorism after the attacks of September 11, 2001. Dr. Shipp also conceived and implemented an initiative to enhance CRS' strong analytic work in issues associated with the aging of the population, by expanding the division's staff to include new analysts with expertise in specific relevant disciplines. Under Dr. Shipp's leadership, CRS also obtained and developed the capacity to use a micro-simulation model for analysis of the distributional impact of alternative policy options for Social Security reform.  I am informed that Dr. Shipp was an exceptional manager with a clear vision of how CRS should be of service to the Congress. He leaves a strong legacy that will have a profound effect on the Congress for years to come. I know that my colleagues join me in thanking him for his service and wishing him well as he embarks on new challenges ahead.                          ____________________
