President, I rise today to introduce legislation to extend an import duty suspension for the Central City Streetcar in the City of Portland, OR. The City of Portland purchases the streetcars from a manufacturer in the Czech Republic. Previous streetcar shipments were duty-free under legislation granting special status to the exporting nation, the Czech Republic. The City has ordered two new streetcars which will be shipped on May 1, 2002. However, that duty-free exemption has expired, adding $130,000 to the price of these streetcars. This legislation will provide duty-free entry for those two streetcars ordered by the City of Portland, thus saving the City of Portland $130,000.  I am pleased to be joined by my colleague from Oregon, Senator Smith, in introducing this bipartisan legislation to provide this duty suspension for the City of Portland's Central City Streetcar. I urge all my colleagues to support this legislation.                                 ______                                       By
