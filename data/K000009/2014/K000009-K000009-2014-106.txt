It is quite astounding that somebody from the State of California--a State that exists because of Federal investments through the entirety of its existence--would even come forward with an amendment like this. For someone from Ohio, it is very unusual to see this.  Let me just say that, in opposing this amendment, I wish to offer the perspective that America can't live in the past, that, in fact, when one looks at what we are enduring because of our dependence on energy that is imported, there is no greater imperative than for us to unhook from imports.  As I look at the gentleman's amendment, it is actually very destructive. You actually destroy our future. America is not innovating at the level that we should in renewables. We have a burgeoning solar industry, but China has captured it. She steals the patents. She steals the innovation, and we don't do much about it.  You take money from fossil programs. I don't have all of the scientific answers, but I know that a piece of our future relies on access that we have here in the ground.  The energy portfolio and the research portfolio of the Department of Energy is critical. The reason we have the horizontal drilling technologies--those weren't developed outside by some humanitarian group. They were developed by the American people's investment in drilling technologies, which have now given us a gas boom that will help us transition to a new energy future because the gas won't last forever, but at least we have the possibility of becoming independent here at home again.  I find the gentleman's amendment very backward-looking; and I would say, for someone from the State of California, if you look at the Bureau of Reclamation, if you look at all of the benefits that have accrued to the State of California and your own presence inside this 50-State Union, it is because of the investment in energy and water that you even exist.  So for you to come forward--and it may be a well-intentioned amendment, but to try to destroy the future of innovation through your amendment in the primary arena of imports--imported petroleum, which we have to unhook from and become energy independent--to me, is just astounding.                              {time}  1700  We live in very different universes--that is clear through your amendment--but there is no greater strategic imperative than for this country to become energy independent here at home. Our liberty depends on it. If you go back over the last 25 years and look at where our soldiers have died, it is very clear we are not independent.  I oppose the gentleman's amendment. I think it is backward looking. I think that it fails to move America into a new energy future. I oppose this amendment with full gusto.
