Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to thank the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur) for her remarks. She does credit to this Congress, credit to Ohio, credit to her district, and certainly credit to her gender. It is a privilege to be her colleague in the Congress of the United States.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Millender-McDonald), cochair of the Congressional Caucus for Womens' Issues, who herself does an extraordinary job.
