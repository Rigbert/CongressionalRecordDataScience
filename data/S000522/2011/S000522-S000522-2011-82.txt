I thank the gentlelady for her statement and for her leadership. This class, and I think the American public would really appreciate this, of 87 Members elected on this side of the aisle, they are overwhelmingly pro-life, and more pro-life women than ever now sit as Members of Congress. It is really very encouraging.  I would like to yield to my good friend and colleague from Illinois, Bob Schilling.
