 President, I rise in opposition to the amendment. Every Member of this Congress knows that we ought to do more about the alternative minimum tax than we do in this bill, or that is possible to do at all. It is a major problem that needs to be addressed. We have made good steps to address it by having the child credit be credited permanently against the AMT and, secondly, by increasing the AMT exemption to $2,000 for singles and $4,000 for joint returns.  These are good steps that will mean millions of Americans will not be subject to the AMT. These efforts in the bill go far to address the concerns raised in this amendment--specifically, that those making less than $100,000 should not be subject to the AMT. I think we have achieved a good balance in this bill on the AMT with other priorities, and this amendment would upset this balance and this bipartisan bill.
