 President, I rise today to introduce a resolution marking August 2008 as National Medicine Abuse Awareness Month. The intentional misuse of prescription and over-the-counter drugs remains a serious problem in this country. This resolution builds on the progress we have made in raising teens' and parents' awareness of the issue, and it seeks to expand our educational efforts even further.  While recent studies indicate that overall use of illegal drugs has remained relatively stable and use among teens has declined since 2002, the misuse of so-called ``legal'' medications is a serious and growing problem. The figures speak for themselves: 1 in 5 teens has misused a prescription drug, and more people age 12 or older have recently started abusing prescription pain relievers than started smoking marijuana.  Abuse of over-the-counter cough and cold medicines is also alarming. While over-the-counter and prescription medicines are extremely safe and effective when used properly, the abuse and recreational use of these medicines can be lethal. A study by the Partnership for a Drug-Free America indicates that 1 in 10 young people aged 12 through 17, or 2.4 million kids, have intentionally abused cough medicine to get high off its active ingredient, Dextromethorphan, or DXM. In March, I chaired a hearing in the Judiciary Crime and Drugs Subcommittee whereat Misty Fetko told the tragic story of her son Carl's overdose death from a combination of painkillers and over-the-counter cough and cold medicine. These tragedies continue and we have got to work to stop this abuse.  Educating teens and parents about the dangers of medicine abuse is an important component of solving this multifaceted problem. Too many teens think that prescription and over-the-counter medicines are safe anytime, in any dose, and even without a prescription or doctor supervision. They are gravely mistaken. Prescription drug abuse, without a valid prescription and close monitoring by a physician, can lead to dependency, overdose, and even death. Misuse of over-the-counter medicines can similarly cause harmful results.  Another reason driving this abuse is the fact that these drugs are cheap and easy to obtain. A bottle of cough syrup costs a few dollars at the local drug store and prescription drugs can often be found in unguarded medicine cabinets at home. A February 2007 report released by the office of National Drug Control Policy revealed that a shocking 47 percent of youth got their prescription drugs for free from a relative or friend. Parents are becoming their kids' drug dealers and don't even know it.  But we can turn these numbers around through robust education, awareness, and enforcement efforts--and that's just what National Medicine Abuse Awareness Month tries to accomplish by promoting the message that over-the-counter and prescription medicines must be taken only as labeled or prescribed, and that when used recreationally or in large doses they can have serious and life-threatening consequences. The resolution will help remind parents that access to drugs that are abused doesn't just happen in alleys and on the streets, but can often occur right in their medicine cabinets at home.  A number of groups have proactively worked to curb this abuse and I hope this resolution pushes their efforts even further. For example, the Consumer Health Care Products Association and the Community Anti-Drug Coalition of America have teamed up tocreate educational toolkits, such as ``A Dose of Prevention: Stopping Cough Medicine Abuse Before It Starts,'' which include guides to educate parents, teachers, law enforcement officials, doctors and healthcare professionals, and retailers about the potential harms of over-the-counter drug abuse. In addition, the Partnership for Drug-Free America and its community alliance and affiliate partners are undertaking a nationwide prevention campaign that uses research-based educational advertisements, public relations, news media and the Internet to inform parents about the prevalence of intentional abuse of medicines among teens. These campaigns empower parents to effectively communicate the facts of this dangerous trend to their children and to take necessary steps to safely store prescription and over-the-counter medicines in their homes.  I have long advocated robust prevention efforts as a key component to getting a handle on any substance abuse problem. As is the case with other substance abuse issues, prevention is just as important here and educating parents and teens about the realities of medicine abuse is critical. I hope this resolution encourages communities, companies, prevention organizations, parents and others to raise awareness about these dangers, talk to our kids, and keep advancing our efforts to prevent all types of substance abuse in this country.                          ____________________
