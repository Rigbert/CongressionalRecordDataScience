 President, I rise today to recognize Alex ``Ray'' Lackey for his recent appointment as the Eighth Command Sergeant Major of the Army Reserve.  Ray has been serving as supervisor of customer services at the Bowling Green post office for almost 20 years, and now embarks on a three-year tour of duty at the Pentagon. Ray has served in numerous capacities in the U.S. military for more than 28 years, with his most recent assignment as Command Sergeant Major for the 100th Division in Louisville. Ray's supervisors have commended him for his ability to maintain a professional balance between his demanding positions in both the U.S. Postal Service and the Department of the Army.  Ray's experience in military service is broad, including service as Squad Leader with the 82nd Airborne Division, Drill Sergeant at Fort Knox, Platoon Sergeant with the 2nd Infantry Division in Korea, Battalion Operations Sergeant, First Sergeant, and Commandant of the 100th Division Drill Sergeant School. In 1982, he received the distinction of U.S. Army Reserve Drill Sergeant of the year.  Ray has been decorated with an impressive number of awards and honors over the years, including being awarded the Meritorious Service Medal five times, the Army Commendation Medal two times, the Good Conduct Medal twice, the Army Reserve Component Achievement Medal five times, and the Army Achievement Medal, the National Defense Service Medal with Bronze Star, the Armed Forces Reserve Medal with ``M'' device, the Noncommissioned Officers Professional Development Ribbon with numeral four, the Army Service Ribbon and the Overseas Service Ribbon. He has also earned the Expert Infantryman Badge and the Parachutist Badge.  As is evidenced by the lengthy list of Ray's achievements and honors, he has served his State and his country well. It is also clear that the Department of the Army has great confidence in Ray's experience, and it seems only fitting that someone with his expertise and seasoned skills will be working in such a significant capacity at the Pentagon. My colleagues and I extend our gratitude for Ray's willingness to continue serving the country in this new post, and wish him the best in his next stage of service.                          ____________________
