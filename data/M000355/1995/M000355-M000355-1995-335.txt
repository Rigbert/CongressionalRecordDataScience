  I think he has adequately described the rationale for the amendment. Essentially, it is that we do not want the States to turn the interstate system into a way to raise revenue for themselves. That is not the basis upon which the Interstate Highway System was constructed.  This amendment would guarantee that could not happen. I am proud to be the principal cosponsor of this amendment.  Madam President, this amendment would strike section 117 of this bill. The provision I would like to remove is one that repeals the prohibition against States imposing tolls in Federal-aid highways, including the Interstate System.  To put it more simply, my amendment continues the ban on State tolling of federally built highways. Or to say it even more plainly, if you gave at the office, you should not have to give again on the road.  The Interstate System had helped to open up this vast country, removing all limitations on mobility. However, if section 117 is not removed from the bill, it could potentially turn our Interstate System into a heavily milked cash cow, where States squeeze additional dollars out of road that have already been paid for, through the excise tax on gasoline.  From sea to shinning sea, we could find our Federal highways transformed into elongated parking lots, bisected at regular intervals by toll plazas.  For the past 39 years, highway users have contributed to the highway trust fund, perhaps begrudgingly, but with the knowledge that these funds would be used for the construction and upkeep of the Nation's highway infrastructure. This national contract with highway users was establish in 1956, with the Federal-Aid Highway Act. As we all know, 90 percent of trust fund revenues comes from the ever-increasing excise tax on gasoline. But it is fed by other revenue sources as well, including a sales tax on tires, trucks, and buses, as well as taxes on truck usage.  In short, Madam President, if it moves on a highway, we have already taxed it--and we've taxed the gasoline it runs on. America's drivers are not exactly suffering from a dearth of taxes and user fees.  Since 1956, when the highway trust fund was first established, American motorists have contributed $278 billion in net revenue to the fund. In return, highway users have been afforded free access to the Interstate System, unencumbered by a gauntlet of toll plazas. Congress should honor the contract it made with motorists--and eliminate the loophole contained in section 117.  My amendment will ensure that our Interstate System remains free from the double taxation of tolls, which would disproportionately affect poorer Americans.  Aside from my strong opposition to the double taxation of highway users, I also believe this toll provision is bad economic policy. It could potentially ruin hundreds of small businesses that cater to highways users. Should States decide to exact their pound of flesh at every highway exit, communities and business will be severely harmed as they are cut off from their customers.  As someone who has personally traveled thousands of miles on Kentucky roads, I am all too familiar with the impact of highway tolls. In Kentucky, economic development adjacent to highways and parkways did not occur until these roads became toll-free. Only then did businesses blossom to meet the needs of tired, hungry, and road-weary motorists.  Not only would many small businesses be crippled, but motorists and truckers would no longer benefit from highly competitive roadside services. Instead, users would essentially be forced to accept the overpriced gasoline and food concerns which would be given virtual monopoly rights at tolling areas.  This provision will of course add to the cost of trucking, travel, and commerce--all of which would be reflected in bottom-line prices at the grocery store and elsewhere.  To suggest that tolls are paid only by highway users is a gross economic oversimplification. Toll roads add to the cost of any goods shipped cross-country. These same costs will hit the tourist industry of every State hard, as families are forced to stay closer to home or forego travel altogether.  I know that, in Kentucky, tourism would be substantially reduced by State tolling of Federal highways, for our State is a crossroads for interstate travel.  Ever since the 1950's, when the United States embarked on its mission of establishing the Dwight D. Eisenhower Interstate Highway System, these roads were meant to be toll-free. If toll booths were suddenly erected on Federal highways, traffic would snarl up, thereby adding to the cost and travel time. Anybody who has traveled a toll road can tell you that exists are not always located at every crossroad.  In fact, on many toll roads, it is not uncommon for exits to be separated by 20 miles or more. If tolls are permitted on Federal highways, the communities and businesses that have developed around highway access points could be cut off. The network of roads, exits, and intersections are a vital part of the national highway contract. It is unacceptable--and potentially disastrous, to change the terms of our Federal agreement.  Finally, tolls could result in an increase in air pollution. It is widely accepted that vehicles operate more efficiently at steady speeds. Long lines and stop-and-go traffic caused by toll plazas will needlessly pump greater amounts of pollution into the atmosphere.  We are told that proponents of toll roads are developing new, high-technology methods of collecting tolls--without the safety, congestion, and pollution problems caused by toll roads. I do not know whether such an idea should be met with admiration or alarm. The notion that the Government could stick huge barcodes on every vehicle, which then would be read by high-speed laser scanners at checkpoints, does not exactly elicit cheers of enthusiasm for the advances of modern technology.  Frankly, whether a toll is taken by a live human being or a high-technology scanner is a bit like making a distinction between holding up a bank in person or embezzling funds via computer. In either case, the loss of funds is felt just as acutely.  Madam President, I am not alone in this view. This proposal is also strongly opposed by motorists. In fact, a 1994 poll taken by Triple-A found that fully two-thirds of its members opposed this toll idea. I have letters from both the Louisville and Lexington chapters of Triple-A opposing this measure.  Madam President, I appreciate the arguments of toll proponents that there is a real need to insure funding for our infrastructure needs. I do not think there is a Member in the Senate who does not believe our transportation infrastructure is of the utmost importance to national commerce and competitiveness.  However, this toll provision is an underhanded money grab that breaks the contract with motorists established through the Intrastate System. This single provision will cripple our ability to transport goods in a timely and cost-effective fashion.  There are other ways to fund infrastructure development that will not require taxing motorists again for something they have already paid for. Congress needs to provide for the full funding of ISTEA and put an end to the gas tax diversion. The $9 billion in gas tax revenue that has been diverted elsewhere in the budget would go a long way toward improving the condition of our roads, bridges, and tunnels.  America has paid for these roads. Let Americans use them--without added, hidden costs. Let us strike section 117 out of the bill, and protect motorists from new and ingenious ways of extracting more revenue from our Federal Highway System.  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that several letters from various groups in support of the amendment that Senator Baucus and myself have offered be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                              American Automobile Association,                                    Washington, DC, June 15, 1995.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: On behalf of AAA's 37 million      members, I urge you to introduce an amendment to S. 440, The      National Highway System Designation Act of 1995, that would      repeal the provisions allowing tolling of existing highways.       ``The American Automobile Association is against toll roads      as a general principle . . . believing all highway facilities      should be toll-free. AAA particularly objects to the      imposition of tolls on any existing toll-free highway . . .      .'' (AAA Policies, April 1995-96)       Our opposition to tolls is longstanding:       We must have roads suitable and adequate for the movement      of modern motor traffic with safety. There must be multiple-     lane highways with opposing traffic streams divided. They      must be free and not toll roads. . . . (AAA ``Bill of      Rights,'' 1936).       The American Automobile Association reiterates its      opposition to transcontinental toll superhighways; also to      privately-owned toll roads . . . . (November, 1938).       The American Automobile Association reiterates its      opposition to toll highways. (November, 1939).       The American Automobile Association vigorously opposes the      levying of tolls on existing free highways. (November, 1940).       The Association believes that the National System of      Interstate Highways should be entirely free of tolls . . . .      (AAA Policies 1949, 1950, reprinted January, 1951).       Thank you for considering AAA's request. Say Yes to Just      NHS.           Sincerely,                                               Richard Hebert,                                            Acting Vice President,     Public and Government Relations.                                                                    ____                                      AAA Blue Grass/Kentucky,                                     Lexington, KY, June 15, 1995.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Russell Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: On behalf of the 118,000 AAA      members we serve in central and eastern Kentucky, AAA Blue      Grass/Kentucky supports S. 440 which would establish a      National Highway System. However, we strongly object to any      toll provision in the bill.       We oppose a toll provision for several reasons:       Excessive cost.--Historically, toll-free roads have cost      the motorist about one cent per mile; new toll roads will      cost about 10 cents per mile. Admittedly, all new road      construction is going to be more expensive, but toll roads      will probably cost 3 to 4 times as much as toll-free roads      because of bond interest charges and toll collection costs.       Double taxation.--If gas taxes are used to construct new      toll roads, motorists will pay twice--once at the pump, and      once at the toll booth.       Breach of Trust.--Highway users have paid literally      hundreds of billions of dollars to construct the nation's      highway system; they should not now be charged a toll to use      it.       Collection Inefficiency.--Currently 10-20% of toll revenues      are needed for the collection process while only one percent      of motor fuel taxes are devoted for that purpose.       Inconvenient Access.--Toll roads often provide few      entrances and exits in order to minimize the number and      therefore the costs of toll personnel. Users can't get off      the road at convenient places and people in small communities      cannot use toll roads built right next to them.       Motorist Irritation and Delay.--Congestion at toll plazas      often causes long lines of cars, much to the consternation of      the motoring public.       Closed System Economics.--Toll road users are locked into      higher-price gas stations, food establishments and other      services.       Toll facilities are self-perpetuating.--Agreements to make      facilities toll-free after debt service is paid seldom are      implemented. For instance, there are still 4,700 miles of      toll roads, bridges and tunnels on the interstate system,      with little likelihood that many of these facilities will      become toll-free.       Neglect of the toll-free system.--Inevitably, construction      of toll roads will lead to toll-free roads not being built in      the same transportation corridors. Maintenance of free roads      parallel to toll roads may also suffer.       Undermining the Federal Highway Trust Fund.--Increased      tolls would weaken pressure on Congress and the      administration to spend the money in the Highway Trust Fund.       We appreciate your consideration of our views.           Regards,                                                      Kathy Gross,     Manager, Marketing.                                                                    ____                                                 AAA Kentucky,                                                    June 15, 1995.     Hon. A.M. ``Mitch'' McConnell,     Russell Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: AAA Kentucky, serving over 300,000      members in our state, strongly supports an amendment removing      the toll provision in S. 440, ``The National Highway System      Designation Act of 1995''. Our opposition to allowing tolls      on federally financed highways is rooted in four basic      beliefs:       The motorists we serve do not want tolls;       Tolls are economically regressive;       Tolls hurt travel and tourism;       Tolls on federally financed highways are an unfair form of      double taxation                      motorists do not want tolls       According to AAA's 1994 National Legislative Survey, two-     thirds of AAA members oppose imposing tolls on existing      interstates/highways to fund highway maintenance or      improvements. Locally, we are tabulating our most recent      legislative state survey and the results are running sixty-     eight percent against tolls as a method to increase revenues.                   tolls are economically regressive       According to the Congressional Budget Office, new toll      roads would impose per-car charges of 8 to 10 cents per mile      on travelers. This translates into an effective tax rate of      an additional $1.60 to $2.00 per gallon of gasoline used. In      addition, tolls are an inefficient form of taxation. For      instance 15 percent of toll revenue is needed just for tax      collection compared to only 1 percent of motor fuel taxes      being used for collection. These factors combined to      illustrate the point that tolls should be the last place we      look for additional revenue.                           tolls hurt travel       As a simple tenant of economics, the more expensive an      action becomes, the fewer people will take that action. Toll      roads illustrate this axiom by discouraging travel over the      tolled section of highways. For example, here in Kentucky the      Western Parkway was a toll highway until nine years ago, when      tolls were removed. In a conversation with a Kentucky State      Trooper, he said he felt that traffic has increased on the      road over 25 percent since the tolls were lifted. Similarly,      during peak travel times, congestion and delays at toll      booths also breed frustration and further discourage travel,      increase costs and harm the environment.                  tolls are a form of double taxation       The promise the Federal government makes to motorists every      time they pay the gas tax at the pump would be broken with      the introduction of tolls. Literally, America's motorists      have paid hundreds of billions [[Page S 8782]] of dollars to      construct and maintain the nation's highway system. To change      the rules now and ask them to pay again as they use the      system is clearly a form of double taxation.       For these reasons, AAA Kentucky strongly supports the      removal of the toll provision from S. 440. It is vital to      pass the NHS Bill as the earliest opportunity. However, while      it contains such provisions, AAA finds it unacceptable.       Thank you for your efforts on behalf of Kentucky's, and the      nation's, motorists.           Sincerely,                                                       Roger Boyd.     Director, Public Affairs.                                                                    ____                                                        NATSO,                                                    June 20, 1995.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: On behalf of NATSO, Inc., the      professional and legislative representative of America's      travel plaza and truckstop industry, I am writing to express      grave concerns about a provision in S. 440 that would allow      states to establish tolls on the Interstate highway system. I      understand that you and Senator Baucus are offering an      amendment to delete this provision, and the 32 NATSO member      locations in Kentucky as well as the more than 1,070 member      locations nationwide strongly support your efforts.       NATSO opposes this provision for several reasons. First,      highway users have already paid for the Interstate system.      Every time fuel is purchased, motorists pay a tax into the      highway trust fund that goes to support the Interstate      system. Allowing the states the opportunity to collect tolls      from Interstate travelers is nothing more than a new tax on      the highway user. The Interstate traveler should not be      forced to pay again for something already purchased.       Also, this provision will undoubtedly shift traffic from      Interstate highways, proven to be the safest and most      efficient, to secondary roads that have not been designed to      handle large volumes of traffic. This proposal will increase      congestion and traffic accidents. It will also devastate the      truckstops, travel plazas and thousands of other roadside      businesses that provide goods and services to the Interstate      traveler.       Finally, if more transportation funds are needed, we      believe that Congress should spend down the $19.6 billion      languishing in the highway trust fund. Instead of being used      for its intended purpose, the highway trust fund is currently      held hostage to make the federal deficit appear smaller.      Asking the highway user to pay more--at a time when tax money      already collected is not being spent--is wrong.       Again, NATSO strongly supports your amendment to delete      this toll provision from S. 440. We will gladly provide      assistance to you in your efforts to pass this amendment.           Sincerely,                                                  W. Dewey Clower,     President.                                                                    ____                                         International Brotherhood                                                 of Teamsters,                                                    June 21, 1995.       Dear Senator: The International Brotherhood of Teamsters      urges you to support the effort by Senators Baucus and      McConnell to strike section 117 of the National Highway      System Bill (S. 440). Section 117 would allow states to      impose tolls on interstate highways.       Section 117 is an unnecessary tax increase on the trucking      industry and the motoring public. Highway users already pay      millions of dollars in taxes annually into the Highway Trust      Fund for the construction and repair of interstate highways.      Consequently, passage of Section 117 would put the Senate on      record as supporting the ``double taxation'' of highway      users. Passage of this additional highway tax will place an      economic burden on both the transportation and tourism      industries. We encourage you to vote to strike Section 117.       We also encourage you to vote for the amendment likely to      be offered by Senator Exon that would establish standards for      truck trailer lengths under the NAFTA. We support the      Senator's proposal to limit single trailer lengths to fifty      three feet. It is imperative that U.S. highway safety      standards are not compromised during negotiations to      establish common truck safety standards under the NAFTA.      Senator Exon's proposal is a critically important step in      ensuring that we preserve the highest highway safety      standards possible in North America.           Sincerely,                                         William W. Hamilton, Jr.,                                   Governmenal Affairs Department.  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I thank my friend from Virginia. I am pleased that this amendment is going to be accepted.
