Mr. Speaker, last night, after more than 14 months of deliberations, the Ethics Committee found Speaker Newt Gingrich guilty of violating House rules on three counts. The Ethics Committee has also taken the long overdue step of appointing an outside counsel or prosecutor to investigate Speaker Gingrich and untangle the web of nonprofit and political slush funds he directs.  In addition, the bipartisan committee rebuked the Speaker for accepting a $4.5 million book deal from media mogul Rupert Murdoch. In their words: ``the committee strongly questions the appropriateness of what some could describe as an attempt by you to capitalize on your office''.  Though long overdue, the ethics committee has begun the process of investigating the Speaker of the House. It is high time.  The committee found Speaker Gingrich guilty of violating House rules on three occasions. Could this be just the tip of the iceberg? The special counsel will find out for sure.                          ____________________
