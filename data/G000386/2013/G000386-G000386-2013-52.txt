 President, I would like to take time today to honor the life of a very brave man, and an exemplary Iowan, Col. George ``Bud'' Day, who passed away over the weekend.  Bud Day's brave and memorable military career started at the age of 17, when he volunteered for the Marine Corps during World War II in Sioux City, IA.  After this period of service, Bud returned home, and received a law degree from the University of South Dakota.  His military service to this country, however, would resume.  Bud Day joined the Air National Guard in 1950 and was called up for active duty a year later during the Korean War.  By 1955 he had become a captain with the Air Force.  With the same go-getter attitude he displayed throughout his service, then Captain Day went on to command a squadron of F-100s in Vietnam in 1967.  On August 26, Bud's plane was hit and took a steep dive. Upon ejection he sustained many injuries.  Shortly after the crash, Bud was taken prisoner and tortured.  Maintaining his unflagging spirit and fueled by his love for his country, Bud Day refused to cooperate and escaped his captors. Surviving treacherous conditions and life-threatening situations every minute, Bud spent 2 weeks trying to find U.S. troops.  His efforts left him exhausted and he was later recaptured and returned to the same camp he had escaped from.  He was then moved to the infamous ``Hanoi Hilton'' camp where torture was commonplace for the next 5 years of his life until his release in 1973.  Even after all of this, Bud Day resumed his service with the U.S. Air Force, and was appointed vice commander of the 33rd Tactical Fighter Wing at Eglin Air Force Base, FL.  Three years after his release from the Hanoi Hilton, Bud received the Medal of Honor from President Gerald Ford for not divulging information in the face of torture, thereby putting his own life in imminent risk to save others.  He has also received numerous other awards and recognitions such as the Air Force Cross for extraordinary heroism in military operations against an opposing armed force as a POW, making him one of America's most decorated servicemen.  Bud Day remained public spirited even after his military service, continuing to advocate for veterans and other causes that were important to him.  His life of service is a tremendous role model for future generations and he will be missed.  I am proud to have been able to call Bud Day an Iowan and a friend.                          ____________________
