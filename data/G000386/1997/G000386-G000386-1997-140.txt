 President, I hope my colleagues will take the time to make a side-by-side comparison of Mr. Bacon's first and second letter.  A side-by-side comparison of the two letters will help them to understand who is sticking to the facts and telling the truth, and who isn't.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
