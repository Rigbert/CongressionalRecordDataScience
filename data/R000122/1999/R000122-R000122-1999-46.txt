 Let me emphasize one additional point that bears repeating. The classroom today is very different from those in the 1950s or 1960s--different because of technology; different because families are in much more distressed conditions in many parts of the country; different because of the various cultural factors that go into the makeup of many classes, particularly in urban America. In fact, we are still teaching in too many colleges as if it were the class of 1950, as if it were the time of ``My Three Sons'' and ``Leave It To Beaver.''  That is not what American education is today. What we have to do today--and this amendment will help immensely--is refocus our teacher training to confront the issues of today, such as multiculturalism, children with disabilities in the classroom, and technology. This is absolutely critical. Unless we enhance our commitment to this type of education--partnerships between schools of education and elementary and secondary schools, drawing on the resources of the whole university, focusing these resources on new technology and the challenges that are particular to this time in our history--we are not going to succeed in educating all of our children to the world-class standards that we all know have to be met.  I urge passage of this very important amendment.
