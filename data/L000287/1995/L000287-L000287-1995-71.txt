Mr. Speaker, the Republicans won the elections last November and they promised no more business as usual, and were they ever right. The ethical standards that have been adopted by the Republicans in this House are at the lowest level I have ever seen.  Lobbyists writing legislation, Members letting outside groups send out partisan political mailings on their office stationary and, of course, at the center of it all, the Speaker of the House and his infamous book deal.  Now, in the latest chapter, the Speaker has ignored the ethics committee and signed his contract with Rupert Murdoch. He has even launched a nationwide book tour. This, despite saying he would wait for the ethics committee to approve the deal, which they have not.  They cut school lunches, they cut Medicare, they cut students' college loans, while the Speaker joins the club of millionaires.  For Republicans, it is no more business as usual, it is time for making money.                          ____________________
