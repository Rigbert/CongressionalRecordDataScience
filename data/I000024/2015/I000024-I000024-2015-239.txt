President, I am reminiscent, with the snow on the ground, of 5 years ago. The Presiding Officer was not here at that time. He does not have the advantage of knowing the story of what is behind this. The story that is behind this is that back when they started all the hysteria on global warming, there happened to be another snowstorm that was unprecedented. It set a record that year.  There is a charming family of six, I say to my friend in the chair, who built this. Their picture is here. That happens to be my daughter and her family of six. At that time it got a lot of attention. It actually got a lot of national attention.  In case we have forgotten, because we keep hearing that 2014 has been the warmest year on record, I ask the Chair: Do you know what this is? It is a snowball. That is just from outside here. So it is very cold out, very unseasonable. So, Mr. President, catch this.  We hear the perpetual headline that 2014 has been the warmest year on record. Now the script has flipped. I think it is important, since we hear it over and over and over again on the floor of this Senate. Some outlets are referring to the recent cold temperatures as the ``Siberian Express,'' as we can see with the snowball out there. This is today. This is reality.  Others are printing pictures of a frozen Niagara Falls. And 4,700 square miles of ice have formed on the Great Lakes in 1 night. That has never happened before.  Let's talk more about the warmest year claim. On January 16, NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, concluded that 2014 was the warmest year in modern record, which starts in 1880.  NASA relied on readings from over 3,000 measuring stations worldwide, and only found an increase of just two one-hundredths of a degree over the previous record. Now an important point that was left out of the NASA press release was that the margin of error, which on average is 0.1 degree Celsius, was several times greater than the amount of warming. So, in reality, it is so far within the margin of error that it is not really recordable. This discrepancy was questioned at a press conference, and NASA's GISS Director backtracked.  This is the Goddard Institute for Space Studies. He backtracked on the warmest year headline saying there was only a 38-percent chance that 2014 was the warmest year on the record. Another recent report issued by the Berkeley Earth surface temperature project, using data from more than 30,000 temperature stations, concluded that if 2014 was the warmest year on record, it was by less than 0.01 degrees Celsius--again, below the margin of error ultimately making it possible to conclude that 2014 was the warmest record on year.  Additional climate experts, including University of Oklahoma geophysicist David Deming, have stated that the warmest year on record statement is only as relevant as when the record actually began. Others state that record-setting conclusions issued in January require the use of incomplete data because the preponderance of the data arrives much later from underdeveloped and developing nations.  The media was quick to ditch the warmest year on record claim as cold weather has left most of the country experiencing record low temperatures.  Tuesday's Washington Post highlighted all of the longstanding records that were broken in the Northeast and Midwest.  My State is Oklahoma and that is not even included in this article. But we set 146 records--alltime records--in my State of Oklahoma just during that time.  According to the National Weather Service, 67 record lows were broken on Monday and Tuesday of this week.  Whether news cycles or climate cycles, variations in hot and cold are really nothing new. Recent climate change discussions like to focus on climate trends post-1880, but the reality is that climate change has been occurring since the beginning of time.  The chart behind me is very interesting because it shows two things that everyone agrees with. The first is that we had the medieval warm period. Thisis a period of time starting about 1000 A.D. and going to about 1400 A.D. This is a major warming period that led into what they call the little ice age, which was about 1500 A.D. to about 1900 A.D.  The interesting thing is that many of us in this room remember that when they first started talking about global warming, a scientist named Michael Mann developed what they call the hockey stick theory, and that had a hockey stick showing that for a long period of time we had temperatures that were level, and then all of a sudden they started going up like the blade of a hockey stick.  The problem was they neglected to note that the two periods were, in reality, in his sketch of a hockey stick. So in his opinion then, as portrayed by the hockey stick, there was no medieval warm period or little ice age.  By the way, this Michael Mann is the same one who was featured as the main person who was guilty of violations that created this term called the climate change, which was characterized as the most outrageous. I don't have it in my notes, but one of the publications in England talked about the worst scientific disgrace in national history.  Time magazine had a chart, and this is interesting because people who look at the weather and get concerned about all the warming periods and the cold, to them the world is coming to an end. This one shows that in 1974 another ice age was coming. That is the actual cover of the magazine. So everyone is concerned that the world is coming to an end, and at the same time they were talking about the fact that there is going to be another ice age.  In the past 2000 years there was the medieval warm period followed immediately by the little ice age. These two climate events are widely recognized in scientific literature. No one has refuted these. These are incontrovertible.  In 2006 the National Academy of Sciences released its study ``Surface Temperature Reconstructions for the Last 2000 Years,'' and that acknowledged that there were relatively warm conditions during that period of time.  So that is history, and that is behind us.  While that is still up, I will go on and fast forward. That same magazine, Time magazine, had as its cover a short time after that this poor, typical, polar bear that is standing on the last piece of ice--and we are all going to die because global warming is coming.  This is something that has been happening over long periods of time. Every time it does, everyone tries to say that the world is coming to an end and that somehow man is so important and so powerful that he can change that.  In 1975 Newsweek published an article titled ``The Cooling World,'' which argued that global temperatures were falling and terrible consequences for food production were on the horizon--and all of that. Well, we know about that.  This highlights that the climate is changing, and it always has been changing.  In fact, our recent vote during the Keystone XL Pipeline debate showed that 97 of us in this Chamber--Democrats and Republicans--agreed that climate has always been changing. I made a little talk on the floor at that time and I said: You know, I think this is something on which we can all agree. If we look at archaeological diggings, history, the Scriptures, climate has always been in changing.  Despite a long list of unsubstantiated global warming claims, climate activists and environmental groups will cling to any extreme weather-related headline to their case for global warming and to instill the fear of global warming in the American people. People sometimes ask me why. Why do you suppose they are doing this, spending all this time?  They tried it through legislation. We defeated it. Now it is through regulations that would cost between $300 billion and $400 billion a year. Yet it wouldn't have any effect on what they perceive to be global warming. So that is the question. Why is it?  There is a scientist by the name of Richard Lindzen. Richard Lindzen is with MIT. Some of us have argued he is the most knowledgeable of all the climate scientists. He answered that question. He said: You know, regulating carbon is like regulating life. If you regulate carbon, it is a bureaucrat's dream, because regulating carbon regulates life. So it is a power struggle.  I think that is probably the best answer. I am not a scientist. I don't claim to be. But I quote scientists, and they have the answers to these questions.                               Terrorism  Now, President Obama is using a similar tactic in order to scare Americans into supporting his extreme climate change agenda. In a recent interview, President Obama agreed that the media overstates the dangers of terrorism while downplaying the risks of climate change. His Press Secretary, Josh Earnest, later reiterated that President Obama believes climate change affects far more Americans than terrorists.  Now, that is the first time we heard that. But wait until we hear later what the President himself and his Secretary of State said. According to the President, the biggest challenge we face is not the spread of Islamic extremist terrorism in Syria, Iraq, Egypt, Algeria, Libya, Tunisia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia, Yemen or Nigeria. The greatest threat that we face is not Russian aggression in NATO and the United States, as well as its invasion of Georgia and Ukraine. It is not the expansion of Iranian influence and sponsorship of terrorism throughout the Middle East or its pursuit of a nuclear weapons system to deliver it and to be able to hit the United States of America. The greatest threat is not North Korea's continued development of its nuclear weapons stockpile and the improving of their delivery systems to include the January 23 launch of a sea-launched ballistic missile that was called the KN-11. I think we are all aware of that. And the greatest threat is not the continued capture and killing of reporters, missionaries, businessmen, Christians, and other non-Muslims in what has clearly been a religious confrontation being pursued. The President's position is that global warming is our greatest threat--greater than all the things I just mentioned. It is underscored by the fact that he won't even publicly state that the 21 Egyptians executed by ISIL in Libya were Christians. He won't recognize that, and he won't recognize that it has anything to do with radical Islam.  He goes out of his way to downplay the actions and dangers of ISIS even though the group continues to terrorize the world. Just this past weekend, ISIS abducted over 70 Syrian Christians, including women and children from villages in eastern Syria. To my knowledge, we don't know what they have done with them yet. But there are 70 of them, and the previous 21 were killed because of their Christianity.  According to the President, our biggest threat is not the continued threats made by extremists against the United States and its citizens. It is not the successful attacks carried out in the United States and other places such as New York, Boston, Fort Hood or potential attacks of lone wolves or sleeper cells against soft targets such as the Mall of America, which is the most recent subject of an ISIL threat. Even as these atrocities are taking place, President Obama is telling the world that climate change is a greater threat to our Nation than terrorists. This is just another illustration that this President and his administration are detached from the realities that we are facing today and into the future.  His repeated failure to understand the real threat to our national security and his inability to develop a coherent national security strategy has put this Nation at a level of risk that has been unknown for decades.  His failure of leadership and his gutting of our military have weakened our ability to influence and respond to crises. This all comes at a tremendous cost to our national security.  The President has accused the media of overstating the problem, heightening the fears of the population. As he downplays the threats, we see photos of young children standing in military-like formation, being brainwashed into ISIS or ISIL extremism. We shouldn't be surprised. It is a natural outgrowth of the President's failed leadership.  In 2012 and 2013 President Obama spoke of helping Libya and Yemen fight terrorism. Yet as he addressedthis Nation, both countries spiraled toward chaos, creating terrorist safe havens. Just days after his speech, Yemen's Prime Minister and his Cabinet resigned amidst a coup by the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels.  The administration aided instability in Afghanistan by releasing the most senior leaders of the Taliban, the Taliban dream team. We all remember that.  We had just passed a law saying that the President cannot release anyone from Gitmo--from Guantanamo Bay--without giving 30 days' notice to Congress. Yet he totally ignored that and let these people go. Some of the terrorists out of Gitmo--I carry this card with me because it is really not believable. Of the five that he turned loose, one was named Mohammed Fazil, and the Taliban commander said that Mohammed Fazil's release ``is like pouring 10,000 Taliban fighters into the battle on the side of jihad. Now the Taliban have the right lion to lead them in the final moment before victory against Afghanistan.''  Now, I don't know where these are. I suggest that all five have returned to the battle. The record is that of those who have been released, some 29 percent have gone back to the battle.  So that is taking place. Mullah Omar, the Taliban's leader, called the release a great victory.  This action allowed these men to rejoin the fight against our service men and women. This is a big deal.  The President quickly withdrew from Iraq, leaving a vacuum for ISIS to fill, which is now requiring our military to return. The President wants to repeat our errors with a speedy withdrawal from Afghanistan, and that is despite the advice of his commanders on the ground and the request by Afghanistan's newest President, Ashraf Ghani, to reexamine our withdrawal plan.  He has de-Reaganized Europe by drastically cutting our forces, acquiescing to Russian influences by cutting our ballistic missile defense site in Poland and our radar in the Czech Republic. I remember when that happened. I was so concerned about that because we put the radar site and the ballistic missile defense site in Poland and the Czech Republic because--that was for the protection of Western Europe and Eastern United States because we don't have the capacity to offer protection the American people should expect. But the President did that anyway. He failed to provide assistance--apart from the MREs and blankets. Instead of sending weapons to the Ukrainians, he sends blankets.  We had Poroshenko, the President of Ukraine, come in and give a speech to a joint session of Congress. In that speech he said we need to have some defense against what Putin and the Russians are doing with the separatists in his country of Ukraine.  I happened to be over there. I was over there during the parliamentary elections. Not many people in America realize that in the Ukraine--our very good friends in Ukraine had their parliamentary elections in October, and President Poroshenko looked me in the eyes and said very proudly how good the outcome was. This was the first time in 96 years that the Ukraine had parliamentary elections and didn't elect one Communist to a seat in the Parliament. That was the first time that had ever happened. Yet the President said in his State of the Union message:       We're upholding the principle that bigger nations can't      bully the small--by opposing Russian aggression, supporting      Ukraine's democracy, and reassuring our NATO allies.  That is what he said, standing in the House Chamber, in his State of the Union speech. Yet, under the President's failed leadership, we have seen two ceasefire failures in the Ukraine, thousands of civilians displaced, and approximately 5,000 people killed.  America's assistance is vital to denying Putin's attempts to destabilize the region. Yet it is not happening. It is not happening under the Obama administration. This administration is overwhelmed by world events and blind to the fact that terrorists are at war with America and our way of life. We now live in a world where our allies don't trust us and our enemies don't fear us. When will the President and his administration take the steps required to minimize the risk to Americans and our allies by providing this country with a national security strategy--one that addresses today's global security environment, grows back our military and its readiness, and deals with our enemies from a position of strength, not weakness and not appeasement?  These are the biggest threats facing our Nation today. It is decidedly not global warming. The threat of war, terrorism, and extremism has plagued the Earth for centuries. The United States is not immune. We must take all threats seriously and take every responsible action to secure our freedom. Threats to our national security are always the most serious threats we face. Issues such as global warming or global cooling 40 years ago are simply not what we need to be worrying about in the same breath when we are talking about national defense.  I say this because I have a deep concern. I was the ranking member on the Senate Armed Services Committee, and I am in a position to see what is happening around the world. The threats we are facing are unprecedented.  Just yesterday we had a hearing, and we had James Clapper, the Director of National Intelligence. This is one of the things he has been quoted as saying:       Looking back over my now more than half a century in      intelligence, I've not experienced a time when we've been      beset by more crises and threats around the globe.  In the hearing we held yesterday, the Director said:       When the final accounting is done, 2014 will have been the      most lethal year for global terrorism in the 45 years such      data has been compiled.  So this goes on and on. This is what the military says. This is the threat we face. Everyone understands it except the White House.  On February 25, just yesterday, Secretary of State Kerry said--and keep in mind he said this with all these threats we are facing:       Today is actually, despite ISIL, despite the visible      killings that you see and how horrific they are, we are      actually living in a period of less daily threat to Americans      and to people in the world than normally--less deaths, less      violent deaths today than through the last century.  We all know better than that. We know how threatened we are. Everyone knows it except the White House, and they are going to have to wake up to save our Nation.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
