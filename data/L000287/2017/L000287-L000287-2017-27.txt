I am not afraid of a fine. I have been fined before. Many of us have been fined before. During the 1960s, I was arrested and jailed 40 times, beaten, left bloody and unconscious on the march from Selma to Montgomery. But no Congress, nobody, no committee has the power to tell us that we cannot stand up, speak up, and speak truth to power. We have a right to dissent. We have a right to protest for what is right.  Regardless of rule or no rule, we cannot and will not be silenced. At the end of this debate, I will offer a motion to strike the section that silences the call for gun violence prevention.
