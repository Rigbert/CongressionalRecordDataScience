Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding to me, and I want to add my words of great compliment and appreciation to Tim Friedman, a true gentleman who has served this House with such distinction for over three decades of his life. His career here represents the highest level of public service, and members of his family, his children, his relatives, all of his friends here, all the Members of Congress that he has served and the American people should know this man because so many of the really top quality staff members who serve the Nation do not get the kind of recognition that they genuinely deserve.  I want to thank him for his gentlemanly demeanor, being a true man of the House, and for helping us build a better Nation and world. Your service has been exemplary. Thank you on behalf of the Nation and thank you on behalf of the people of Ohio as well, all of whom you have served with such distinction. Congratulations. God bless you and may the future be even brighter than the years that you spent here.  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from California for yielding to me on behalf of such a fine and good man.
