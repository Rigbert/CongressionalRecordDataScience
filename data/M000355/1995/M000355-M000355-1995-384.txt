 President, today I rise to mourn the death and celebrate the life of Ms. Ginger Adams, whose life was cut tragically short at 20 after an automobile accident in western Kentucky.  Ginger Adams of Murray, KY, was an inspiration to all those who knew her. An honor student at Murray State University, Ms. Adams was also a popular campus leader and accomplished athlete.  Her love of athletics led her to join the nationally recognized Murray State cheerleading squad. Late last month, the squad accompanied the school's basketball team to its appearance in the NCAA Tournament in Tallahassee, FL. Returning home from the game, the van carrying Ginger and 12 other cheerleaders overturned on the highway injuring all aboard and, tragically, taking Ginger's life after a 2-week struggle in a Nashville hospital.  In his touching eulogy, Murray State University President Kern Alexander said of Ginger, ``We know she was a grand achiever and student leader, cheerleader, superb athlete and outstanding student, but the supreme [[Page S5614]] measure is not in those accomplishments. The measure of her life is in the great wealth of love and affection that was engendered in all she touched.''  Mr. President, please join me in extending our heartfelt sympathy and prayers to Ginger's parents, Hank and Joanna Adams, and to all those whose lives she touched. She will be missed very, very much.  Mr. President, I ask that Dr. Alexander's eulogy be printed in the Record.  The eulogy follows:  Eulogy of Ginger Adams, Delivered by Dr. Kern Alexander, President,                         Murray State University       Ginger was given only 20 years, but her brief years were no      measure of the importance of her life. She accomplished more      in those few years than most persons achieve in 80. We know      she was a grand achiever, student leader, cheerleader, superb      athlete, outstanding student, but the supreme measure is not      in those accomplishments, but rather the measure of her life      is in the great wealth of love and affection that was      engendered in all she touched; fellow students, sorority      sisters, neighbors, her University, and her community.       Sir Christopher Wren, the architect who rebuilt London      after the great fire, died. In his remembrance it was said,      ``For his monuments look ye around.'' For Ginger's      accomplishments ``look ye around.'' Look at all those of you      here today who cherish and love her. This love and devotion      to Ginger are her monuments and these are the monuments that      are most enduring.       This outpouring here today of so many in this solemn      ceremony is the ultimate measure of one's achievements on      this earth. Here, they are Ginger's in abundance.       When death allies itself with youth and beauty it is the      most difficult for us to understand.       When the most beautiful and radiant among us dies, we are      all the more profoundly stricken with grief and wonderment as      to its reasons and purposes.       When beauty dies our own limitations and frailties as human      beings become more obvious and less comprehensible.       This week we lost the most beautiful and talented among us      and none of us can understand. Consolation can only come in      prayer to those who love Ginger, the prayer that:       ``The Lord God will wipe away the tears and will swallow up      death in final victory.''       It helps us in our own poverty of comprehension if we know      that life and death are not absolutes, but merely transition      of the human soul. This we know in our faith and trust in      God.       Prayer: Dear Heavenly Father, please help Ginger's mother      and father, JoAnna and Hafford, and her brothers, in this      time of great sorrow. Help them in this moment of      overpowering grief.       O God, we give back to you those whom You gave us. You did      not lose Ginger when You gave her to us, and we do not lose      her by her return to You. Your dear Son has taught us that      life is eternal and love cannot die. So death is only an      horizon, and an horizon is only the limit of our sight. Open      our eyes to see more clearly, and draw us closer to You that      we may know that we are nearer to our loved ones, who are      with You. You have told us that You are preparing a place for      us. Prepare us also for that happy place, that where You are      we may be always.       O Lord, You have made us very small, and we bring our years      to an end like a tale that is told. Help us to remember that      beyond our brief day is the eternity of Your Love. Amen.       God bless Ginger and her family.                                 ____________________
