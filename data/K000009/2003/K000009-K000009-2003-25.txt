Speaker, yesterday the special congressional panel looking into the September 11 attacks issued its report. It said the intelligence community could have done a much better job in protecting the American people. That truly is an understatement.  But what stands out is the fact that the Bush administration has taken secrecy to a new unacceptable level. The administration insists on keeping secret 28 pages of that report. It is widely believed that these 28 pages deal with the possible involvement of foreign governments in the 9/11 tragedy and specifically Saudi Arabia.  Mr. Speaker, the Bush administration clearly exaggerated the immediate threat to the United States posed by the regime of Saddam Hussein in order to justify the war in Iraq, and, indeed, I have supported the calls for an independent commission to get to the bottom of that deception.  The administration's credibility has been greatly damaged by the revelations about the manipulated statements in the President's State of the Union address. Now we have 28 pages of a report of a vitally important study that are being kept away from the American people.  Do the American people not deserve to know the truth, whole truth, the whole story about 9/11? Do the families of 9/11 not deserve to know? What is the Bush administration now hiding about Saudi Arabia's possible involvement? How can the Bush administration justify keeping this secret from the American people?  In an editorial entitled ``Deception and Denial,'' the London-based Financial Times this morning says the following about the Bush administration:  ``The scale of the Bush administration's official obstruction is clear.'' And the article goes on to say `` `The Bush administration has done everything they can do to make sure that's not the focus,' said William Wechsler, a former White House official who coauthored a recent report critical of the Saudi failure to cut off financing for terrorist troops.'' The Bush administration wants `` `to talk about tactical breakdown, but they do not want to talk about the elephant in the room,' '' i.e., specifically Saudi Arabia. According to the Financial Times, ``the tantalizing glimpses of the Saudi role that survived the censor's pencil are by far the report's most potentially explosive aspects.''  We know there were meetings between some of the hijackers and Omar al-Bayoumi, a Saudi citizen. What does that mean in the context of 9/11? There are reports that al-Bayoumi supplied at least some of the hijackers with cash. Is that true? Unless the Bush administration drops its insistence on secrecy, the American people and families of the victims of 9/11 might never know the truth.  The Bush administration says it cannot tell the American people the whole truth because of national security concerns. One should ask, is it national security that the Bush administration cares about or is it political security? Or could it be access to Saudi oil? As the Financial Times said this morning, ``It is hard to avoid suspicion that some of the coyness may have political origins.'' The decision to keep this information secret adds ``a new layer of haze over its credibility,'' says the Financial Times.  It is time for the Bush administration to tell the families and to tell the American people what it knows about the possible involvement of foreign governments or foreign nationals in the events of September 11, and no one should be exempt from that scrutiny. No country, no person. It is time for an end to the Bush administration's secrecy.               [From the Financial Times, July 25, 2003]       Report Raises New Questions on Saudi Role in 9/11 Attacks               (By Marianne Brun-Rovet and Edward Alden)       Washington.--The September 11 hijackers received foreign-     government support while they were in the US plotting the      attacks on New York and Washington, the leader of a      congressional inquiry charged.       The conclusion, which is strongly hinted at in the      declassified parts of the inquiry's 900-page report released      yesterday, will raise new questions about the role of Saudi      Arabia in particular. The Bush administration insisted on      deleting a 28-page section of the report that focused on the      link to foreign governments.       Senator Bob Graham, the former Democratic intelligence      committee chairman who led the investigation, said the      hijackers ``received, during most of this time [in the US],      significant assistance from a foreign government which      further facilitated their ability to be so lethal''. He would      not identify the government.       But he charged the Bush administration with refusing to      release the information ``to protect the country or countries      . . . that were providing direct assistance to some of the      hijackers''.       The report also contains new evidence that US intelligence      agencies and the Federal Bureau of Investigation knew far      more about some of the hijackers activities than has been      revealed.       While the administration has insisted that the plot could      not have been unraveled from the information available, a      congressional official said: ``There was no smoking gun in      the sense of all the details and the specifics in one piece      of intelligence . . . But that is not the same as saying that      this attack could not have been prevented.''       Despite the deletions demanded by the administration, which      held up the report's release for nearly seven months, it      contains new evidence that indicates the Saudis may     have had ties to supporters of the September 11 hijackers.       It focuses on the activities of Omar al-Bayoumi, who some      in the FBI believed to be a Saudi intelligence agent, though      the Saudi government has denied the allegation.       Mr. Bayoumi played a vital role in establishing Nawaf al-     Hazmi and Khalid al-Mihdhar, two of the hijackers, when they      arrived in the U.S. before the attacks. U.S. intelligence      agencies knew as early as 1999 that the two were linked with      al-Qaeda and that they had attended a CIA-monitored high-     level meeting of the terror network's operatives in Malaysia      in January 2000.       Mr. Bayoumi met the pair in Los Angeles shortly after he      was observed entering and leaving a meeting at the Saudi      consulate.       Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the Saudi ambassador to the U.S.,      said yesterday that the country was facing ``false      accusations . . . made by some for political purposes''      despite its widespread co-operation with the U.S. in the war      on terrorism. ``It is disappointing that despite everything      we are doing, outrageous charges continue.''       The report also revealed another serious U.S. intelligence      failure before the attacks, which represented ``perhaps the      intelligence community's best chance to unravel the September      11 plot''. The FBI had recruited an informant in San Diego      who met repeatedly with Mr. Hazmi and Mr. Mihdhar. However,      the FBI did not act on his information because the CIA had      not told the FBI of the pair's suspected links to al-Qaeda.      The FBI agent handling the informant said ``we would have      done everything'' had the CIA revealed what it knew.               [From the Financial Times, July 25, 2003]    Deception and Denial (Part Two)--The White House's Intelligence                           Problems Get Bigger       It is often the case with lengthy inquiries into government      failures that what gets left out of the final report is more      interesting than what goes in it. Politicians are not unduly      burdened by a capacity for self-criticism and if they can      hide behind spurious claims of national security to avoid      providing potentially damning evidence to hungry      investigators, you can generally guarantee that they will.       The publication yesterday of the results of the      congressional investigation into the performance of the US      intelligence services in the run-up to the September 11 2001      terrorist attacks is a case in point.       We knew already that the White House had been most      unhelpful in its dealings with the congressional      investigators, failing to make available critical material      such as presidential briefings on the scale of the al-Qaeda      threat. Now, in the form of dozens of blank pages in the 900-     page volume, the scale of official obstruction becomes clear.       Though the report still reaches some valid conclusions      about the failures of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and      the Central Intelligence Agency in acting on what they knew      about the hijackers, the overall effect of the      administration's behaviour is to produce more questions. Most      disturbing is the White House's unwillingness to disclose      important new information on Saudi Arabia's role in the      terrorist plot.       The long list of errors by the FBI and the CIA remains the      central finding. The fact that officials had opportunities to      track the movements of at least two of the hijackers in the      months before the attacks represents the largest single      failing and highlights flaws in intelligence co-ordination      that still need to be put right. In addition the lack of      reliable intelligence overseas prevented either the Clinton      or the Bush administration from taking preemptive action      against al-Qaeda that might have scuppered the plot.       But the tantalising glimpses of the Saudi role that      survived the censor's pencil are by far the report's most      potentially explosive aspects. Meetings between some of the      hijackers and Omar al-Bayoumi, a Saudi citizen, are well      documented, as are indications that he supplied them with      cash. But instead of detailed investigation of Mr. al-Bayoumi      and his alleged links to the Saudi government, there are only      blank spaces. The administration says it could not agree to      publication of this and other material for national security      reasons. That may be true. But it is hard to avoid suspicion      that some of the coyness may have political origins. The Bush      administration is already under fire for its dubious      disclosures about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. Now the      White House has added a new layer of haze over its      credibility.       In the end the congressional report is not so much an      indictment of the intelligence agencies, though it clearly      highlights their faults. It is an indictment of the needless      obfuscation surrounding too much of this administration's      national security policy.               [From the Financial Times, July 25, 2002]          September 11 Investigation Undermines Bush's Claims               (By Edward Alden and Marianne Brun-Rovet)       For the past 18 months the administration of President      George W. Bush has clung firmly to the argument that, while      there were certainly intelligence failings, the September 11,      2001 attacks could not have been prevented.       The release yesterday of the declassified final report of      the congressional investigation will make that argument much      harder to sustain, and could ignite fresh controversy for an      administration already under scrutiny for manipulating      intelligence information before the war on Iraq.       The report contains few entirely new revelations about the      missed opportunities to unravel the plot of the 19 hijackers.      But the detailed evidence of how much the U.S. knew of their      movements before the attacks belies the assertion made to the      investigators last year by Robert Mueller, the Federal Bureau      of Investigation's director, that ``as far as we know, they      contacted no known terrorist sympathizers in the U.S.''.       The report points out that five of the hijackers had met a      total of 14 people who had come to the FBI's attention as      part of counter-terrorism investigations.       Four of those 14 were under active FBI investigation when      the hijackers were in the U.S.       The hijackers who led the attacks were not isolated but      instead were backed by what U.S. intelligence knew to be ``a      radical Islamic network in the U.S. that could support al-     Qaeda and other terrorist operatives.''       As early as June 2001 the CIA had learned that senior al-     Qaeda planner Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was recruiting people      for operations in the U.S.       The report also revealed that an informant for the FBI had      numerous meetings with two of the hijackers, Nawaf al-Hazmi      and Khalid al-Mihdhar, when they were living in San Diego.      But the San Diego FBI was unaware that the Central      Intelligence Agency had in 2000 identified the two men as al-     Qaeda operatives, so never acted on the information.       The FBI had also opened in 1998 a counter-terrorism      investigation of Omar al-Bayoumi, a Saudi who co-signed the      lease on an apartment in San Diego rented by the two      hijackers, paid the first month's rent and organised a party      to welcome them into the community.       Mr. Bayoumi became the subject of attention late last year      after it was revealed that the wife of Prince Bandar, the      Saudi ambassador to the U.S., had indirectly deposited tens      of thousands of dollars into an account held by Mr. Bayoumi's      wife. The Saudis have said they had no knowledge that the      money, which was part of a charitable contribution, had ended      up in her accounts.       The report says that although Mr. Bayoumi was a student, he      ``had access to seemingly unlimited funding from Saudi      Arabia'', and at one time made a $400,000 donation to a      Kurdish mosque in San Diego. It adds: ``One of the FBI's best      sources in San Diego informed the FBI that he thought that      Mr. Bayoumi must be an intelligence officer for Saudi Arabia      or another foreign power.''       The Saudi government denies the charge, saying he has no      connection to the Saudi government.       The most controversial element of the report will be what      it does not contain. At the insistence of the Bush      administration, 28 pages discussing evidence of foreign      government support for the hijackers was deleted from the      declassified version.       ``The Bush administration has done everything they can do      to make sure that's not the focus,'' said William Wechsler, a      former White House official who co-authored a recent report      critical of the Saudi failure to cut off financing for      terrorist groups.       ``They want to talk about tactical breakdown but they don't      want to talk about the elephant in the room.''       U.S. officials note that Saudi co-operation in counter-     terrorism investigations has improved markedly, particularly      following al-Qaeda attack's in Riyadh in May that left more      than 30 people dead. The Saudis responded angrily yesterday      that ``we cannot respond to blank pages''.       But the investigation showed that even well after the      September 11 attacks, Saudi Arabia continued to impede U.S.      efforts in areas such as shutting down financing for      terrorism.       While the congressional investigation was a      bipartisan undertaking, its conclusions will fuel a      partisan battle over whether the Bush administration has      responded fully to the lessons of September 11.       Democrats have homed in on intelligence failures, both in      the war on terrorism and before the war on Iraq, as the      vulnerable spot for an administration that has been widely      trusted by Americans on national security since the attacks.       The report challenges whether the administration has yet      made sufficient efforts to improve intelligence gathering and      sharing in response to the serious breakdowns uncovered by      the investigation.       On foreign support for terrorists, the report says ``only      recently'', and in part due to the pressure from the      congressional inquiry, had the agencies tried to determine      the extent of the problem. ``This gap in US intelligence      coverage is unacceptable, given the magnitude and immediacy      of the potential risk to US national security,'' it says.       Democratic hopefuls for the next presidential election,      including Senator Bob Graham, the former intelligence      committee chairman, are already seizing on the problems      identified by the inquiry to criticise the administration's      actions since September 11.       The controversy over what is missing in the report will      only deepen those charges. Senator Joseph Lieberman, another      Democratic candidate, said yesterday that the administration      ``has, even today, failed to demand a full accounting of      intelligence failures, in order to ensure that they have been      corrected''.                          ____________________
