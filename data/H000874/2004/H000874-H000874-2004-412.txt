Leader, the Foreign Sales Corporation Act, as the gentleman knows, we have not modified that, and the European Union has said on March 1, a few days from now, Monday, they have the ability to start imposing sanctions on U.S. goods. When do you think or is there any information as to when we may consider on the floor a bill dealing with foreign sales corporations to respond to the problem that exists that will motivate the EU to impose such sanctions?  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, as the gentleman knows, the Committee on Ways and Means has reported a bill to address the repeal of the foreign sales credit last year. We understand the problem. While there have been a couple of deadlines for European retaliation which have come and gone, we understand the threat that now exists beginning March 1. Clearly we need to find a way to address this issue. We are coordinating with the Committee on Ways and Means, the Senate leadership and the White House to resolve the issue in a way that not only ensures our compliance with the World Trade Organization, but also increases the competitive position of all American companies in the global economy.
