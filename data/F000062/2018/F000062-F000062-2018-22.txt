 President, today the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced the awarding of the Nobel Prize in chemistry to three outstanding scientists, Frances H. Arnold, George P. Smith, and Gregory P. Winter, for using evolutionary principles to create new enzymes. Their work marks a remarkable leap forward in human knowledge and technology, and I salute these scientists on their honor.  The use of evolutionary techniques to create enzymes has led to new developments in numerous fields, from health to biofuel technology. Through the use of directed evolution, scientists and researchers have been able to speed up the processes of nature and to tackle some of our most challenging problems. These achievements would not have been possible without the leadership of Dr. Arnold, Dr. Smith, and Sir Gregory Winter.  Dr. Arnold hails from my home State of California and has worked as a professor at the California Institute of Technology. I am proud of the role that Caltech played in making this discovery possible. Dr. Arnold receivedher Ph.D. from the University California, Berkeley, and I thank her for her contributions to the study of bioengineering and biochemistry.  On behalf of all Californians, I commend these three recipients on a well-deserved honor and for all that they have done to advance human knowledge of the power of evolutionary technology and bioengineering. Let us hope that this discovery will continue to expand the horizon of human knowledge and lead to new efforts in humanity's never-ending quest for enlightenment.  Again, I congratulate these three distinguished scientists and their families on this remarkable discovery and prestigious award.                          ____________________
