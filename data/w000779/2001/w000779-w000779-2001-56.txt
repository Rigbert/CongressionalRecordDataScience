President, today I am introducing the Medicare Hospice Improvement Program Act, which is supported by the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization. The purpose of this bill is to provide for at least three demonstration projects within Medicare to improve the delivery of the hospice benefit to seniors. This legislation would allow us to find new ways to: (1) Allow people to enroll in hospice even though they may want to continue trying curative treatment for a limited time; (2) modify the requirements to decrease the strain on rural hospice providers; and (3) revise reimbursement rates to more adequately cover comfort care. In addition this bill would provide a grant program to help defray the costs of providing education of the public, the medical community and patients about hospice care.  The Medicare hospice benefit has not been revised since it was first created nearly two decades ago. Too often patients and their families are unaware of the Medicare hospice benefit or they seek hospice care too late to get the full benefit of hospice services. This legislation is important because it would help us find ways to assure that the Medicare hospice benefit is better integrated into medical care, as well as improve patient access to the pain and symptom management, counseling, and other comfort care services provided by hospice.                          ____________________
