Speaker, the other side can say it over and over and over again, but the facts are correct that this is not about jobs here because if it was about jobs here, we could have passed the Manzullo-Rangel bill 6 months ago. We did not. We did not because we wanted to pass a partisan bill.  The Heritage Foundation says, ``There is always a certain amount of grease that is part of getting any tax policy changes through the process,'' but with this bill the Heritage Foundation says that ``the actual policy seems to be secondary to the grease.''  This is a sad day in this House. I have served here for 23 years. This is the worst tax bill that I have seen on the floor of this House. It is the most irresponsible bill. I challenge the Members on that side of the aisle to bring me one editorial, Members will not find it in the Wall Street Journal, Members will not find it out of the Heritage Foundation, one editorial that says this bill is worth passing.  We have been involved in an orgy of self-indulgence. That is how great empires fail, so focused on self and corporate and individual embellishment that they forget about the community, they forget about their country, they forget about investing in their people. They forget about investing in jobs in America.  The gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Manzullo) is not on the floor, he was just a few minutes ago. He and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Rangel) and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Crane) had a bill that spoke to jobs in America. This bill does not. Defeat this bill. Be responsible, stand up for America, send this bill back to committee.
