Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I think the gentleman from California (Mr. George Miller) has raised some very interesting questions. I have been in the district of the gentleman from New York (Mr. Sweeney) and part of the district of the gentleman from New York (Mr. McHugh) and it is a gorgeous area. Not nearly as gorgeous as Alaska, but it is gorgeous.  But I cannot quite yet figure out, if I am a city under the amendment of my colleague and I want to build a skating rink or a park, under the amendment, the borough could disallow that. Is that correct?  Mr. McHUGH. Mr. Chairman, if the gentleman would yield, it is in the State of Alaska. First of all, I do not believe the funds under this could be used for construction of skating rinks, but I will defer to the gentleman.
