 The theory of unitary executive states that since the Constitution inherently gives the President the power to do all kinds of things--especially within the military and defense context beyond what is detailed in article II, then the President essentially can make up whatever he wants to justify for this or that action. In other words, he can say: We are threatened by international terrorism and I, as the President of the United States, can do anything I want to fight international terrorism. I don't have to worry about separation of powers. I don't have to worry about the laws of the land. I don't have to worry about the Constitution. I am the President. In my judgment, I can do what I want. I think the Senator from West Virginia would agree with me, that that is not what the Constitution of this country is about.
