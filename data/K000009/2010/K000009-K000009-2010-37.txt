And that disaster prematurely took the lives of six people. We are talking about Wood County, Fulton County, Ottawa County, across Sandusky County, and adjacent counties.  Madison Walters has been tragically orphaned while her family, Mary and Ryan Walters and their 4-year-old son, Hayden, were all killed. We also remember Ted Kranz, Kathy Hammitt, and Bailey Bowman. Over $100 million of estimated damage occurred. Lake High School was leveled. So many businesses, homes, farms affected.  While this is a story of pain, it is also a story of hope and human goodness, as waves of thousands of volunteers have come to try to help and assist those facing such destruction. I would like to submit two articles for the record that detail examples of this compassion. And it shows to us again the signs of a great Nation that binds together, and neighbor helping neighbor.  I urge the administration, in the strongest manner possible, to declare our region a Federal disaster area so necessary aid can flow to those whose lives have been so dramatically affected in a region already suffering from economic recession.                 [From toledoblade.com, June 11, 2010]Help, Hope From Volunteers Lift Spirits in Tornado-Wrecked Towns; More                Than 1,600 People Turn Out To Lend a Hand                       (By Claudia Boyd-Barrett)       Millbury resident Tim Miller has lost his house, and he      wants to say thank you.       Not to the tornado which left him and his family homeless      last weekend, but to the hundreds of people--most of whom he      doesn't know--who have come to help pick up the pieces.       Thursday, on what remained of his back deck and next to a      hole in the ground that was once his house, Mr. Miller      perched a handwritten sign addressed to the volunteers. It      read ``Thank You Everyone.''       ``I have to,'' Mr. Miller said. ``All these people come out      and help you out, you've gotta thank them somehow.''       With volunteers and emergency crews continuing to pour into      Wood, Fulton, and Ottawa counties Thursday, recovery and      cleanup efforts were moving full-speed.       In Lake Township, site of some of the worst devastation,      Police Chief Mark Hummer said he expected the bulk of the      cleanup to be done by Saturday. After that, there will be      small debris to pick up and rebuilding efforts will begin, he      said.       Volunteers included schoolchildren, adults taking time off      work, retirees, nonprofit groups, and businesspeople.       Among them, a dozen employees from the Shelly Co. in      Findlay and children from a little league baseball team      ferried hundreds of hamburgers, hotdogs, and refreshments to      residents and other volunteers in the Lake Township area.       Nine-year-old Ryan Kerr was one of the volunteers. He said      he wanted to help ``because I feel really bad about all the      people losing their homes.'' And, he added, ``it's fun.''      Recruitment of volunteers has been so successful that the      United Way announced it would close two of its volunteer      reception centers today. With so much of the general cleanup      work done, there is only need for specialized volunteers, the      agency said.       ``The community's response has been absolutely      tremendous,'' Bill Kitson, United Way of Greater Toledo      president and chief executive officer, said in a statement.      ``In the past three days, we have deployed more than 1,600      volunteers to help with clean-up efforts. I'm truly at a loss      for words.''       The closed centers were at Grace United Methodist Church at      601 East Boundary St. in Perrysburg and at the Mainstreet      Church at 705 North Main St. in Walbridge.       United Way officials said that if people still wish to      volunteer and think their specialized skills can be used in      restoration efforts, they should call 2-1-1 and give their      personal information for reference.       General volunteers are needed in Ottawa and Fulton      counties, however. In Fulton County, volunteers can go to      Shiloh Christian Union Church, 2100 County Road 5, between 9      a.m. and 6 p.m. today while the location will change to the      Swancreek Township Hall, 5565 County Road D for the weekend.      Ottawa County has a volunteer reception center at Genoa High      School.       Bill Walker, the emergency management director for Erie      County who has been helping out in Ottawa County, said the      cleanup there would likely continue into next week.       ``There's still a lot of work to do,'' he said. ``But it's      way better than what it was.''       Amid the cleanup efforts, emergency officials also worked      to ensure the area is prepared for future storms. They tested      sirens yesterday across Wood County and one siren in Lake      Township failed to sound. The siren, outside the fire station      on Ayers Road, was fixed within a few hours.       Police Chief Mark Hummer said the siren had electrical      problems and may have been struck by lightning.       It was not known whether any other sirens failed to work      during the testing that lasted about three minutes and      started at noon.       The Lake Township site where the siren wasn't working is      the closest location to an area of Millbury that was among      the hardest hit in the township.       Lake Township fire Chief Todd Walters said the siren was      tested a week ago and was working when the tornado hit on      Saturday night. Other sirens that were activated Thursday in      Lake Township were at the Municipal Building in Millbury,      Walbridge behind the police department, and on East Broadway      in news conference yesterday morning, the township's police      and fire chiefs encouraged people to prepare for future      storms by having a battery-operated radio, as well as food      and water in a safe area of the house, on hand at all times.       According to the National Weather Service, there is a      chance of showers and thunderstorms today and through the      weekend, but severe weather conditions have not been      predicted.       Also yesterday, Ohio Department of Transportation Director      Jolene Molitoris toured the storm-ravaged areas and spoke      with officials involved in the recovery efforts. She pledged      continued help by ODOT crews in clearing roads and making      them safe for emergency personnel and the public.       Ms. Molitoris said she was inspired to see the progress      made by the various government agencies on the ground and by      volunteers.       ``Everybody is a team and there's a power in working      together,'' Ms. Molitoris said. ``It reminds us of what it      means to be Ohioans.''       In another sign that things are slowly recovering, the Lake      Township Police Department moved to a former Ohio Highway      Patrol substation on Lemoyne Road. Emergency dispatchers for      the Lake Township Fire Department and EMS will continue to      work out of the Northwood police dispatch center, however.       Meanwhile, others were recovering on a more personal level.      After losing the house they had moved into just three weeks      ago to     the tornado, Melody Kisseberth and her fiancee, Steve Avers,      said they are gradually coming to terms with their ordeal.       ``I was devastated for days, but now I'm trying to see the      bright side,'' Ms. Kisseberth said, as she picked up the      debris along with dozens of volunteers. ``I realized we need      to be thankful because there's a lot of people worse off than      us.''                                  ____                 [From toledoblade.com, June 15, 2010]        Relatives Pull Together for Girl Orphaned After Tornado                          (By the Blade staff)       The extended family of a 7-year-old left orphaned and      homeless by the June 5 tornadoes said Monday they are      ``pulling together'' to protect the little girl.       Madison Walters' mother, Mary Walters, 36, and her 4-year-     old brother, Hayden, were killed shortly after a powerful      tornado struck the family home in Millbury, Ohio, ripping off      the second story.       Her father, Ryan Walters, 37, who was critically injured,      died Sunday at Mercy St. Vincent Medical Center in Toledo.       Madison was released Sunday from the same hospital after      days of treatment for broken bones. Her aunt, Amy Sigler,      said the child is being cared for by family members.       ``She is doing well and is surrounded by her loving      family,'' Mrs. Sigler said.       Barbara Walters, Mr. Walters' mother, said she was not      surprised at her son's passing, but the family had hoped for      a better outcome. She said the couple left a will ``with      specific instructions'' for Madison.       The family declined to give specifics about which family      members she will live with, citing a desire for privacy.       Mr. Walters will be buried Friday with his wife and son in      Lake Township cemetery, Barbara Walters said.       Mrs. Sigler described her brother-in-law, a long-distance      runner, as an ``exemplary'' father and husband who dedicated      many volunteer hours to help manage the computer systems at      Mainstreet Church in Walbridge.       She said faith in God is helping the family cope with their      grief.       ``God's grace is amazing,'' she said. ``We know we're going      to see him again.''       Mr. and Mrs. Walters apparently were asleep in an upstairs      bedroom of their Main Street house when the tornado struck.      Their children were asleep in the same part of the house,      family members said.       The house appears to have been in the direct path of at      least one tornado, and was flattened to the foundation.       Mrs. Sigler, who lives in nearby Northwood, said she tried      to call her sister to warn her about the approaching storm.      She had watched news reports of violent thunderstorms moving      across northwest Ohio, and knew the family was asleep. ``The      phone just rang and rang,'' she said the day after the storm      hit. ``I knew as soon as it hit and she didn't call that      something was wrong.''       The storm was one of northwest Ohio's worst.       The others killed include Ted Kranz, 46, who died after      part of his Case Road home fell on him after he left his      basement to check on a generator; Wauseon resident Kathy      Hammitt, 56, who was en route for home along State Rt. 795      after visiting her husband at a nearby hospital, and Bailey      Bowman, a 20-year-old mother of a 2-year-old boy, who was      killed as she tried to seek shelter at the Lake Township      police building.                          ____________________
