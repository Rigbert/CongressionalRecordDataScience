President, today I am submitting a resolution to designate May 21, 2016, as Kids to Parks Day.  From the Painted Hills to Crater Lake and from Mt. Hood to the Oregon Caves, nature has given Oregon many wondrous treasures in every corner of my State. As a whole, Oregon boasts some of the most beautiful landscapes, varied ecosystems, and unrivaled outdoor recreation opportunities in the nation. Given Oregon's unmatched scenery, enjoying the outdoors is imbedded in the DNA of Oregonians, and opportunities to get outside and enjoy our treasures brings in visitors from all over the world.  Kids to Parks Day builds on Oregon's outdoor culture, inspiring children and families to spend time together, enjoy nature and parks, and recreate on public lands across the country. Over 70,000 people have pledged to participate in this year's Kids to Parks Day, and over 200 cities have proclaimed May 21 as the day in which to celebrate Those who choose to celebrate Kids to Parks Day will find that communities all across the country offer a variety of natural resources and public lands--often with free access--that promote healthy outdoor recreation and empower young people to become stewards of the environment.  I am pleased to be joined on this resolution by my colleague from Utah, Senator Orrin Hatch, who has worked with me over the years to promote healthy recreation.  This resolution promotes the values of healthy outdoor recreation and environmental stewardship, for kids of all ages, by encouraging them to get outside and visit local parks and public lands. Research shows that outdoor recreation has positive impacts on children's performance in school and their overall health. In addition, when kids have a connection to nature, they are more likely to get involved in efforts to preserve public lands for future generations of young conservationists.  This resolution--designating Kids to Parks Day--is about more than just one day of recreation. It is about promoting the year-round use of parks and public lands by kids and their families. While National Parks are the crown jewels of this country's parks system, State and neighborhood parks serve as important year-round conduits to the outdoors, attracting the everyday dog walker, jogger, and birdwatcher. Neighborhood parks are easily accessible, and can broaden the appreciation for nature and the outdoors in young people, while fostering a safe setting for healthy adventure. Local parks and the miles of trails on Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management land, not to mention the widely-used reservoirs managed by the Army Corps of Engineers, are the backbone that supports recreation and access to public lands all across the country.  Kids to Parks Day recognizes the significance of all open spaces and the need to preserve these areas for the health and education of young people. Today, I am pleased to celebrate the importance of our public lands and the importance of recreation. I want to take this time to encourage children and their families to spend time in the outdoors and celebrate Kids to Parks Day on Saturday, May 21, 2016.                          ____________________
