Speaker, Women's History Month is celebrated during the month of March in the United States and around the world. Last week Members of Congress participated in Domestic Violence Awareness Week on Capitol Hill in partnership with Lifetime Television to raise awareness of the issues surrounding domestic violence, and address possible solutions.  Domestic Violence is one of the most critical public health issues facing women and children today, and its impact is felt by every member of our society. Domestic Violence is not just a women's issue. Domestic Violence touches the lives of men, women and children--affecting the entire family structure in our country.  I would like to take the time this month to honor the domestic violence shelters in my district--the 9th District of Ohio for the services they provide daily to individuals coping with domestic violence. The YWCA Battered Women's Shelter in Toledo, OH, the Family House in Toledo, OH, the Safe Harbour Domestic Violence Shelter in Sandusky, OH, and Ottawa County Transitional Housing in Port Clinton, OH. All four of the mentioned organizations serve women and children on the front lines. The staff members of the shelters are the individuals that hear the stories, and provide services to people in need. The statistics are real, and the issue of domestic violence must be kept at the forefront of domestic policy debates locally and nationally.  The YWCA Battered Women's Shelter in Toledo serves the area of Lucas County and offers emergency short-term housing and counseling for battered women and their children. The Family House in Toledo serves Lucas County and is a short-term emergency shelter for homeless families, offering supportive services through a family case manager. Ottawa County Transitional Housing in Port Clinton is a long term homeless shelter for women and children. The shelter serves people in Erie and Ottawa counties offering supportive services to families.  I sincerely thank all of the individuals that work for these important organizations, serving our community, and the people of the 9th District of Ohio daily. Onward.                          ____________________
