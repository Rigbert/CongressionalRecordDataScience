Speaker, I yield myself 10 minutes.  Mr. Speaker, on September 11, 2001, a war was started on United States soil. It was not a war we voluntarily entered. It was not a war we started. We were not given a choice. We were dragged into a war that day, a war on terrorism.  Every day since September 11, we are reminded of these violent acts. The media reminds us daily with pictures of the missing, interviews with survivors, films of the many memorial services, and images of the massive destruction. We are constantly reminded that this is a war that is far from over. The rules of this war are vastly different from the wars that we have fought as a country in the past. We are uncertain who the enemy is. We are uncertain where the enemy is. We are more uncertain than ever before when and what the next move of the enemy will be.  Because of this uncertainty, we have had to change the way that we think about the safety and security of our country and its people. We must develop new weapons for protection against this new kind of war.  It is this new approach to safety and security that has required us to take action today. This bipartisan legislation will give law enforcement new weapons to fight this new kind of war. Terrorists have weapons that law enforcement cannot protect against right now. Technology has made extraordinary advances; but with these advances in the wrong hands, we are more vulnerable to attacks.  Indeed, it cannot be denied that law enforcement tools created decades ago were crafted for rotary telephones, not e-mail, the Internet, mobile communications, and voice mail. Thus, this legislation, like the previous Committee on the Judiciary version and Senate 1510, modernizes surveillance capabilities by ensuring that pen register and trap and trace court orders apply to new technologies, such as the Internet, and can be executed in multiple jurisdictions anywhere in the United States.  Criminal provisions dealing with stored electronic communications will be updated to allow law enforcement to seize stored voice-mail messages the same way they can seize a taped answering machine message. Additionally, under this bill, a court may authorize a pen register or trap/trace order that follows the person from cell phone to cell phone rather than requiring law enforcement to return to court every time the person switches cell phones. The bill, consistent with our constitutional system of government, still requires a judge to approve wiretaps, search warrants, pen registers, and trap/trace devices.  Like the Committee on the Judiciary reported bill, this new bill continues to provide for nationwide service of warrants for electronic evidence, such as content of e-mails, and search warrants for terrorism. Current rules require that a search warrant be issued from the judicial district in which the property to be searched is located. The bill would change this to permit the prosecutor to go to the judge in the district overseeing the investigation to issue the warrant, and in the case for search warrants for terrorism offenses, in any district in which activities related to terrorism occurred. This will save valuable time.  It is clearly within the public interest and the Federal Government's mandate to keep out of the United States persons who are intent on inciting or engaging in terrorist activities. This bill furthers that goal by expanding the definitions related to terrorist organizations. Under current law, unless otherwise specified, an alien is inadmissible and deportable for engaging in terrorist activities only when the alien has used explosives or firearms. This act eliminates that limitation so that any terrorist who has used any object, including a knife, a box-cutter, or an airplane, would be inadmissable and deportable.  Under the current regulatory regime, the INS can detain an alien for 48 hours before making a decision as to charging the alien with a crime or removable offense. The INS uses this time to establish an alien's true identity, to check foreign and domestic databases for information about the alien, and to liaise with law enforcement agencies.  This act extends that time period to 7 days so that the INS is not forced to release a terrorist simply because it has not had adequate time to do a thorough investigation.  The substantive criminal law statutes are also toughened in order to treat crimes of terrorism with the same level of importance as the most serious crimes in our country. Some of these new provisions include no statutes of limitations for the most serious crimes of terrorism, allowing a judge to sentence a terrorist to prison for any number of years up to life for any offense that is defined as a ``Federal terrorism offense,'' and subjecting persons convicted of conspiracy to commit terrorism to the same penalties as those who actually commit the offense. Any person convicted of a terrorism offense will now be under supervision for as long as the court determines is necessary, including up to life.  The act also expands the definition of support for terrorism for which a person can be prosecuted to include providing expert advice to terrorists and harboring or concealing a suspected terrorist.  This new bill also continues the compromise language between current law and the administration's initial proposal for the showing needed for FISA, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, investigations using wiretaps. Current FISA law requires that in order to obtain a FISA wiretap, the Attorney General must certify that the gathering of foreign intelligence is the purpose or a primary purpose of the investigation.  The administration draft wanted to change this to only require a certification that it was a purpose. This bill requires the Attorney General must certify that it is a significant purpose.  Furthermore, this bill, like the Committee on the Judiciary reported bill, provides for roving wiretaps for FISA investigations. Currently under FISA, the government must identify and get a separate order for each phone to be tapped. This provision allows the government to make a showing to a court that the target is changing phones to thwart the tap, and to allow the court to authorize taps of any phones which the target may use. This provision is consistent with current criminal law.  Importantly, the bill does not do anything to take away the freedoms of innocent citizens. Of course we all recognize that the fourth amendment to the Constitution prevents the government from conducting unreasonable searches and seizures, and that is why this legislation does not change the United States Constitution or the rights guaranteed to citizens of this country under the Bill of Rights.  We should keep in mind that the Preamble to the Constitution states that it was ordained to establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and to secure the blessings of liberty.  Well, let me say, on September 11, our common defense was penetrated, and America's tranquility, welfare, and liberty were ruthlessly attacked. I urge the Members of this body to stand united together in recognition of the important purpose we must serve in preventing terrorist attacks in the future and prosecuting those who have already attacked us.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to say a little bit about the road this legislation has traveled on the way to the floor today. The road was relatively short, but certainly not without its twists and turns. Along the way, the legislation has been the subject of intense negotiation between House Republicans and Democrats, the administration, Members from the other body, and our leaders here in the House. After a 36 to nothing markup in the House Committee on the Judiciary last week and the introduction of a bipartisan antiterrorism bill in the other body, we were faced with trying to reconcile two different bipartisan bills, one of which garnered stronger support by the administration.  However, our goal remains clear, to quickly come to agreement on legislation that will provide our law enforcement and intelligence officials with new tools necessary to more effectively battle terrorism and other crimes.                              {time}  1430  The bill before us now makes several changes to the bill passed by the other body last night, although most core provisions are very similar or are identical to the bill reported by the Committee on the Judiciary last week. Indeed, S. 1510 incorporated many of our committee's provisions. Most importantly, this bill preserves a sunset over many provisions of the bill. It is longer than the 2-year sunset contained in the bill passed by the Committee on the Judiciary; but, nonetheless, I believe it does the trick. It should keep the Department of Justice in line while providing Congress the opportunity to conduct effective oversight over the implementation and use of these new law enforcement authorities.  Mr. Speaker, this has not been the ideal process, and the legislation before us now does not represent a perfect compromise. However, the work of the House Committee on the Judiciary over the past 3 weeks has greatly improved upon the original Justice Department proposal. I believe it now responsibly addresses many of the shortcomings of the current law and improves law enforcement's ability to prevent future terrorism activities and the preliminary crimes which further such activities while preserving the civil rights of our citizens.  I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan effort.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
