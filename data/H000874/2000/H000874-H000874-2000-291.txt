Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell), whose bill will be heard on April 12, which is a major fire service bill. He has worked very closely with the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Weldon) and I and others on this and we have worked very closely with him on the major piece of legislation which we hope it see move forward as well.
