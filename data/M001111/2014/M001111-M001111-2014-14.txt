 President, I previously revised the allocations, aggregates, and levels pursuant to sections 114(d) and 116(c) of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 for S. 2244, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2014. The Senate passed S. 2244 on July 17th. Since there has been no further action on this legislation, I am reversing the adjustments I made in July. For the information of my colleagues, I will refile these adjustments should the Senate again consider legislation that fulfills the conditions of the deficit-neutral reserve fund.  I ask unanimous consent that the following tables detailing the revisions be printed in the Record.
