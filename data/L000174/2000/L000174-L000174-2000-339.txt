President, I, again, urge the Senate to take the responsible action necessary to fill the 80 judicial vacancies around the country. The Senate has confirmed only seven judges all year. We are in our fifth month and have only confirmed seven judges. We have 80 vacancies. There are six nominations on the Senate Executive Calendar, including Tim Dyk, who has twice been reported by the Judiciary Committee. Mr. Dyk's nomination has been pending over 2 years. Does this all sound familiar? It is because the Senate continues to fail in its responsibility to the American people and the Federal courts to take action on judicial nominations.  The stall has been going on since 1996, with a few brief burst of activity when the editorial writers and public attention has focused attention of these shortcomings. When there is scrutiny, then the majority puts through a few more.  The Judiciary Committee is not doing any better. It has held the equivalent of two hearings all year. In 5 months, it has held the equivalent of just two hearings on judicial nominations. We heard from only two nominees to the courts of appeal and only nine to the district courts. The committee has reported only six nominees all year, just six.  I know the Senate has built in to the schedule a lot of vacation and a number of recesses. Maybe we ought to take a day or two out of one of those vacations and have some hearings and some votes on the confirmations of the scores of judges that are needed.  We have seen the majority announce with great fanfare that the Senate would have more hearings in the Judiciary Committee on Elian Gonzalez this year. The American public responded so loudly and correctly to that proposal for senatorial child abuse that the majority quickly backed off, trying to find some face-saving way to cancel the hearings. Well, without those hearings we had a whole day this week available. Instead of senatorial child abuse, why not have hearings on judges? We could have done that.  The committee markup scheduled for this morning was canceled. We could have used that time for a Judiciary hearing or proceeded and reported a few judicial nominees.  Most afternoons are free around here this year. We could have hearings a few afternoons a week and start to catch up on our responsibilities.  Over the last weekend, the President again called upon us to do our job and complete consideration of these nominations without additional delay. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, a Republican, has scolded the Senate in this regard.  I have urged the Senate time and time again to fulfill our responsibilities. I wish we would do this, take a couple days less vacation time, work a few afternoons, and confirm the judges that we need around the country.  A couple of years ago, I compared the Senate pace of confirming judges withthe home run pace of such players as Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa, and Ken Griffey, Jr. Over the past couple of years when I have used this example of how much better they do hitting home runs than we do at confirming judges, my friend from Utah and I have gone back and forth with regard to this kind of comparison. He has said I should not be comparing the Senate to some of the greatest home run hitters of all time. I understand his reluctance since this Senate certainly has not been a home run hitter as far as confirming judges.  But when I looked at the sports pages today I was struck by how poorly we are doing. Keep in mind, that the Senate has been in session a couple of months longer than the baseball season, that we had a 2-month head start. Nonetheless, as of today, there are 27 baseball players who have hit more home runs than the Senate has confirmed judges. These are not just the stars. The Senate does not fail in comparison to just McGwire and Sosa, but in comparison to--I know these are names you will not all recognize and I see the pages coming to attention and see how many they know--the White Sox' Paul Konerko; the Cubs' Shane Andrews; the Rockies' Todd Helton; the Brewers' Geoff Jenkins; the Angels' Troy Glaus; the Royals' Mike Sweeney. Not legends yet, but fine people and players who have all hit more home runs than the Senate--even with a 2-month head start.  In fact, I may be doing a disservice to these major-leaguers by comparing them to the Senate. Why? Because these ballplayers are acting professionally and doing what they are paid to do. We are not acting professionally. We are not fulfilling our constitutional responsibilities. We are not doing what we are paid to do. We are refusing to vote yes or no on these judges.  The vacancies on the courts of appeals around the country are particularly acute. Vacancies on the courts of appeals are continuing to rob these courts of approximately 12.3 percent of their authorized active strength, as they have for the last several years. The Ninth Circuit continues to be plagued by multiple vacancies. We should be making progress on the nominations of Barry Goode, Judge Johnnie B. Rawlinson and James E. Duffy, Jr., as well as that of Richard Tallman.  I am acutely aware that there is no one on the Ninth Circuit from the State of Hawaii. I know that federal law requires that ``there be at least one circuit judge in regular active service appointed from the residents of each state in that circuit,'' 28 U.S.C. 44(c), and I would like to see us proceed to comply with the law and confirm Mr. Duffy, as well as the other well-qualified nominees to that Court of Appeals without further delay.  The Fifth Circuit continues to labor under a circuit emergency declared last year by its Chief Judge Carolyn Dineen King. We should be moving the nominations of Alston Johnson and Enrique Moreno to that Circuit to help it meet its responsibilities.  Earlier this year I received a copy of a letter from Judge Gilbert Merritt, formerly Chief Judge of the Sixth Circuit, concerning the multiple vacancies plaguing that Circuit. Judge Merritt was disturbed by a report that the Judiciary Committee would not be moving any nominees for the Sixth Circuit this year. We should be moving on the nominations of Kathleen McCree Lewis, Kent Markus, and Helene White. Judge Merritt wrote to us two months ago, stating:       The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals now has four vacancies.      Twenty-five per cent of the seats on the Sixth Circuit are      vacant. The Court is hurting badly and will not be able to      keep up with its work load due to the fact that the Senate      Judiciary Committee has acted on none of the nominations to      our Court. One of the vacancies is five years old and no vote      has ever been taken. One is two years old. We have lost many      years of judge time because of the vacancies.       By the time the next President is inaugurated, there will      be six vacancies on the Court of Appeals. Almost half of the      Court will be vacant and will remain so for most of 2001 due      to the exigencies of the nomination process. Although the      President has nominated candidates, the Senate has refused to      take a vote on any of them.       Our Court should not be treated in this fashion. The      public's business should not be treated this way. The      litigants in the federal courts should not be treated this      way. The remaining judges on a court should not be treated      this way. The situation in our Court is rapidly deteriorating      due to the fact that 25% of the judgeships are vacant.      Each active judge of our Court is now participating in      deciding more than 550 cases a year--a case load that is      excessive by any standard.       In addition, we have almost 200 death penalty cases that      will be facing us before the end of next year. I presently      have six pending before me right now and many more in the      pipeline. Although the death cases are very time consuming      (the records often run to 5000 pages), we are under very      short deadlines imposed by Congress for acting on these      cases. Under present circumstances, we will be unable to meet      these deadlines. Unlike the Supreme Court, we have no      discretionary jurisdiction and must hear every case.       The Founding Fathers certainly intended that the Senate      ``advise'' as to judicial nomination, i.e., consider, debate      and vote up or down. They surely did not intend that the      Senate, for partisan or factional reasons, would remain      silent and simply refuse to give any advice or consider and      vote at all, thereby leaving the courts in limbo,      understaffed and unable properly to carry out their      responsibilities for years.  Likewise, the Fourth Circuit, the Tenth Circuit and the District of Columbia Circuit continue to have multiple vacancies. Shame on the Senate for perpetuating these crises in so many Courts of Appeals around the country.  By this time in 1992, the Senate had confirmed 25 judges and the Committee had held 6 confirmation hearings for judicial nominees. By this date in 1988, the Senate had confirmed 21 judges and the Committee had held 7 hearings. By this time in 1998, the Senate had confirmed 17 judges and the Committee had held 5 hearings. This year we remain leagues behind any responsible pace.  Unfortunately, the Senate has not built upon the progress we had made filling judicial vacancies following Chief Justice Rehnquist's remarks in his 1997 report on the state of the federal judiciary. Last year, faced with 100 federal judicial vacancies, the Senate confirmed only 34 new judges. This year we will again be facing 100 vacancies. Already we have seen 87 vacancies and have so far responded with the confirmation of only 7 judges.  I have challenged the Judiciary Committee and the full Senate to return to the pace it met in 1998 when we held 13 confirmation hearings and confirmed 65 judges. That approximates the pace in 1992, when a Democratic majority in the Senate acted to confirm 66 judges during President Bush's final year in office.  There is a myth that judges are not traditionally confirmed in Presidential election years. That is not true. Recall that 64 judges were confirmed in 1980, 44 in 1984, 42 in 1988 when a Democratic majority in the Senate confirmed Reagan nominees and, as I have noted, 66 in 1992 when a Democratic majority in the Senate confirmed 66 Bush nominees.  Our federal judiciary cannot afford another unproductive election-year session like 1996 when a Republican majority in the Senate confirmed only 17 judges. These 17 confirmations in 1996 were an anomaly that should not be repeated. Since then we have had years of slower and lower confirmations and heavy backlogs in many federal courts.  Working together the Senate can join with the President to confirm well-qualified, diverse and fair-minded judges to fulfill the needs of the federal courts across the country. I urge the Republican leadership to join us in making the federal administration of justice a top priority for the Senate for the rest of the year.                          ____________________
