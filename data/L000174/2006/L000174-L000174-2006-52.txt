President, this morning, our Nation took an important step toward honoring one of our most preeminent leaders. The National Mall in Washington, DC, is graced with memorials to America's greatest presidents. Today we broke ground on a memorial to honor the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Although never elected to national office, Dr. King courageously led the Nation through a crucial chapter of American history and became the voice of the entire civil rights movement.  In his famous ``I Have A Dream'' speech on the National Mall, Dr. King noted that ``[w]hen the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir.''  This past summer we reaffirmed and reauthorized one of the most important methods of enforcing this promise and upholding the Constitution--the Voting Rights Act. Over the course of dozens of Judiciary Committee hearings and markups, we recalled the great historic struggle for civil rights led by American heroes of vision and strength, including Martin Luther King, Jr., and his widow, Coretta Scott King.  The pervasive discriminatory tactics that led to the original Voting Rights Act were deeply rooted. As a Nation, this effort to ensure equal protection dates back more than 135 years to the ratification of the 15th amendment in 1870, the last of the post-Civil War Reconstruction amendments. It took the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 for people of all races in many parts of our country to effectively begin exercising the rights granted 95 years earlier by the 15th amendment. Despite the additional gains we have made in enabling racial minorities to participate fully in the political life of our country, the work of the Voting Rights Act is not yet complete, and the dream of Dr. King has not yet been fully realized. But his dream lives on, as vital and as inspirational as the day it was delivered.  Just last week, we had an historic national election. Men and women of every color and creed came to polling places around the country to have their voices heard. Nonetheless, some citizens experienced problems casting their votes. The Senate Judiciary Committee will hold a long-overdue oversight hearing this week to examine shortcomings in the enforcement of our civil rights laws and the guarantees of political equality enshrined in the 14th and 15th amendments. In doing so, we continue to honor the promissory note written to all Americans.  I look forward to bringing my children and grandchildren to the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial when it is completed in 2008. I trust it will be a moving tribute befitting one of our Nation's greatest leaders.                          ____________________[Page S10865]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                      A MALL MEMORIAL FOR DR.
