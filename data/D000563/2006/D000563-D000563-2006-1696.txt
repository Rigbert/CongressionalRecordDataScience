I concede this bill is a clash of special-interest titans on both sides. I think proponents of the bill have invested a lot more in its passage than those who oppose it. Maybe we will never know the true figures, but the interesting thing is that the first bill of this Senate session is not a bill to address the Medicare prescription drug crisis, it is not a bill to provide affordable, accessible health care to Americans, it is not a bill to deal with the energy crisis and the heating bills that are killing us in the Midwest and the Northeast, it is not a bill to deal with pension security for workers who are losing a lifetime of pension investment to a merger or a bankruptcy or corporate sleight of hand. It is a bill that is brought by lobby groups and special interests that have invested tens of millions of dollars trying to force this issue and bring this matter before us on the Senate floor.
