  That is exactly what the founders of this country envisioned. And so what the amendment before us seeks to do is to take a big hunk out of the first amendment, which when it was passed over 200 years ago was almost entirely about political speech, and say that the Government now has the power to control how much not only we get to speak in our own campaigns but the Senator from Alabama knows, because he was referring to this amendment, not just the campaign that we are conducting against our opponent but this says in addition Congress may set reasonable limits on those in support of us or in opposition to us.  Given all the discussion that we have observed here in the last few months about the expressions of outside groups, whether it was through legislative activity or independent expenditures, I would just ask my friend from Alabama, does he not think it is conceivable that Congress might decide that kind of speech is unreasonable and eliminate it entirely in this environment?
