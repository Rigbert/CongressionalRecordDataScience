President, I am pleased to be introducing the Influenza Vaccine Security Act with Senator Clinton today because I believe this legislation is critical to strengthening our public health preparedness here in the U.S. The experiences of the flu vaccine shortage last year made us all aware that our system needs improvement. This legislation takes a comprehensive approach to addressing the root causes of seasonal flu vaccine shortages by creating stability in the U.S. vaccine market.  Our legislation requires the Department of Health and Human Services to set annual production targets for the flu vaccine, to stockpile up to 10 percent of the vaccine each year in the event of a shortage, and to create a vaccine buyback program to provide market guarantees for our vaccine manufacturers. This legislation also provides a much-needed framework for public health officials to track vaccines and provides increased education and outreach about getting an annual flu vaccine.  I now want to turn to some of the provisions in this legislation that deal with an issue I believe deserves our utmost attention: pandemic influenza. I think we can agree that we all learned a good lesson from Hurricane Katrina: government at all levels must be prepared to deal with a large-scale public health emergency. Unfortunately, our government is not currently not prepared to deal with pandemic influenza. Our legislation seeks to address this by strengthening the underlying public health infrastructure to heighten our ability to respond to both seasonal and pandemic flu.  As Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and a member of both the Senate Agriculture Committee and Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP), I take the threat of an influenza pandemic very seriously. I view it as not only a public health concern, but a national security concern. The timing for a large-scale worldwide influenza outbreak is ripe. Many experts believe the next flu pandemic will come in the form of avian flu.  Unlike the seasonal flu, humans have no natural immunity to avian flu. A routine flu shot for more common influenza viruses won't protect against the deadly avian flu. The Department of Health and Human Services is working with vaccine manufacturers to develop a vaccine, but it is unclear when and how many doses will be ready.  Other than a vaccine, the only defense against a new flu strain such as avian flu is an antiviral medication such as Tamiflu. Currently, the United States currently only has enough pills to treat less than one percent, or about 2.3 million people.  This is why experts believe the effects of avian flu in the U.S. and around the world could be devastating. Some have predicted the loss of life could reach as high as 160-200 million. A pandemic might infect a third of the U.S. population and cost more than $100 billion alone in medical treatments. A pandemic of this sort could also have catastrophic economic or social effects.  It is for these reasons I am pleased our legislation addresses some of the underlying public health infrastructure concerns that can help us effectively respond to pandemic flu. Our vaccine industry here in the U.S. is extremely fragile and our manufacturers need the necessary tools to effectively produce and deliver vaccines in the event of either seasonal or pandemic flu. First and foremost, our legislation ensures vaccine manufacturers and health care providers are not held liable in the event of a public health emergency involving pandemic influenza. Without this necessary liability protection, the ability to develop or deliver a vaccine during an outbreak could be significantly hampered.  Our legislation also encourages improved technologies for influenza vaccine development by providing additional funding for NIH research into alternative methods of vaccine development, such as cell-based cultures and a permanent flu vaccine. Currently, flu vaccine production is a strenuous process and takes several months, leaving us extremely vulnerable in the event of a large-scale outbreak and a subsequent need for a mass production of vaccines.  Our legislation encourages more companies to enter the U.S. market with domestic-based production facilities and to improve the ability of the current manufacturers to remain in the market. Manufacturers currently do not have the capacity to simultaneously produce enough flu vaccine for seasonal flu and an avian flu vaccine in the event of an outbreak. We must assist our manufacturers in increasing production capacity.  Aside from vaccines, our legislation also requires the government to purchase and store additional antiviral medications, such as Tamiflu, to protect against an influenza epidemic.  Finally, our legislation provides a framework to identify public health professionals that can provide services in the event of a public health emergency through the use of a medical personnel registry linked at the Federal, State and local levels.  I am pleased to introduce the Influenza Vaccine Security Act with Senator Clinton today. We need to fix our seasonal flu vaccine production and distribution problems not only to prevent future shortages, but also to strengthen our public health infrastructure in case of pandemic.  As Senator Clinton knows, the HELP Committee will soon be considering legislation to develop countermeasures to protect the U.S. from deliberate and natural public health threats. This legislation, known as Bioshield II, will present a great opportunity to build on the first steps we take in this legislation to protect against pandemic flu. I look forward to working with Senator Clinton and my other colleagues on the committee to deliver a comprehensive package to ensure we are prepared and can respond to all types of public health threats.                                 ______                                       By
