Speaker, I rise today to recognize the career and contributions to Maryland's Fifth District of estuarine ecologist Dr. Walter R. Boynton of St. Leonard, Maryland, on the occasion of his retirement.  A native of Massachusetts, Dr. Boynton first came to Maryland and encountered the majestic waters of the Chesapeake Bay, something which would become the focus of his scientific studies for the remainder of his career, in 1969 as a summer student at the Chesapeake Biological Laboratory (CBL) in Solomons, Maryland. Following the receipt of his Ph.D. in ecology from the University of Florida, Dr. Boynton returned to CBL in 1975 as a young professor. At that time his research focused on the decline of submerged aquatic vegetation. He recognized that these declines were related to increases in nutrients flowing into the Chesapeake that caused an over-abundance of single-celled algae, which reduced the clarity of the water and ultimately led to deeper portions of the Bay becoming devoid of oxygen. Dr. Boynton was part of a team of CBL researchers, including Chris D'Elia, Jim Sanderson, and Don Heinle, that redefined what we know about nutrient dynamics and how they bring about eutrophication--or the overabundance of plant life at the expense of animal life in bodies of water.  A long-standing relationship, forged on the softball diamond, between CBL researchers and the local community led to a close working partnership and deep personal friendship between Dr. Boynton and then-State Senator Bernie Fowler, who remains a close friend of mine. It was Senator Fowler who led efforts in federal court to force regional jurisdictions to adhere to the Clean Water Act. Former Senator Fowler credits Dr. Boynton with deepening his own understanding of the ecology of the Bay and the Patuxent River, allowing him to become an effective advocate and well-respected citizen-scientist, bringing attention to the restoration of the Chesapeake Bay. On June 11, I joined former Senator Fowler for his annual ``wade-in'' to check the clarity of the Patuxent River and learned of Dr. Boynton's upcoming retirement.  In addition to an internationally respected research career, Dr. Boynton has been a highly effective educator, teaching generations ofgraduate students. CBL Director Thomas Miller credits Dr. Boynton's success to his contagious enthusiasm for his work. He called him ``a gifted, passionate, and supportive educator'' and ``an amazing teacher and advisor.'' Director Miller further noted that his ``largest and most long lasting impact will be the generation of young minds that he has touched and impacted over his career.''  Dr. Boynton is a two-time recipient of the Distinguished Service Award from the Coastal & Estuarine Research Federation. He received its Odum Award for lifetime achievement (with UMCES colleague W. M. Kemp), and served as its President. In 2015, Dr. Boynton was named an Admiral of the Chesapeake for his work toward greater understanding of the Chesapeake Bay and its restoration by then-Governor Martin O'Malley. In the following year, he received the Mathias Medal from the Maryland Sea Grant College, the Virginia Sea Grant, and the Chesapeake Research Consortium-the highest regional recognition in environmental sciences. This year Dr. Boynton was awarded the Ruth Patrick Award from the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography.  Dr. Boynton's legacy spans areas beyond academia. He has worked closely with the Maryland/DC Chapter of the Nature Conservancy and served as a member of the Calvert County Planning and Zoning Committee for many years. He and his wife Mary-Ellen also host a shelter for Calvert County's homeless each spring.  I join Dr. Boynton's colleagues at CBL and with members of the community in Maryland's Fifth District to congratulate him on his impactful and distinguished career. I thank him for his service to our state, to our country, and all those who live by and rely on the Chesapeake Bay and its watershed, and I wish him all the best in his retirement.                          ____________________
