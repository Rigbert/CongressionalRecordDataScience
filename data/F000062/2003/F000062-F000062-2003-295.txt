 That modified amendment contains an additional cosponsor, Senator Kennedy. The modified amendment makes two changes to the amendment which I submitted before. The first change is to be absolutely crystal clear that this does not affect financial derivatives. I said that in my comments yesterday. I say it again today. To make it crystal clear, because some are concerned, and say, ``Oh, well, this will upset the financial derivatives marketplace,'' this is not the intent. It would only apply to finite commodities.  Right upfront, we are clearly saying that this title shall not apply to financial derivatives trading.  The other change to this amendment simply takes Senator Reid's amendment to exclude metals and adds this to this bill.  If I may, I send that amendment, as a modified, to the desk at this time.
