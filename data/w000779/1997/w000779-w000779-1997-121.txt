President, as this Congress moves forward to strengthen and secure the Medicare Program for future generations, three issues are crystal clear.  First, we must have the political will to modernize Medicare to reflect both the quality and the efficiency of private health care plans now serving most working Americans, and in particular the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program which many Members of Congress, their staff and families, and other Federal employees enjoy.  Second, we must maintain our commitment to current and future Medicare beneficiaries by preserving a basic, high-quality portfolio of health services for all enrollees, irrespective of their income, where they live, or their particular health circumstances.  Third, we must begin the transformation of Medicare financial foundations in a way that is first fair to all beneficiaries, and second insures that Medicare will be there for our children and their children, and that it will not bust the Federal budget in the bargain.  I believe that the legislation I introduce, today, The Medicare Modernization and Patient Protection Act of 1997, meets all three of these primary goals. While fully preserving traditional, fee-for-service Medicare, this legislation also will create an array of new, high-quality, cost-efficient health plans for Medicare beneficiaries, and offer those enrollees positive incentives to try them. It will provide new protections and consumer rights to Medicare beneficiaries in capitated health plans. It will mandate new penalties and enforcement mechanisms to eradicate fraud and abuse now stripping billions of dollars per year from the program. And it will create new support systems for some of Medicare's most desperately ill and poor beneficiaries, and their families.  Finally, through new cost-conscious management systems and a firm fiscal control mechanism, this plan will reduce Medicare cost growth by approximately $100 billion over the next 5 years, and with financial constraints that will continue to control runaway spending growth after fiscal year 2002.  The Medicare Modernization and Patient Protection Act will offer seniors more health plan choices by eliminating the huge variability in capitated payments to health plans in counties around the nation. At the same time, it will raise the minimum payment to 80 percent of the national average payment, leveraging higher reimbursements and I believe more plan offerings in up to 20 percent of our counties.  This proposal also establishes an outlier fund, an account fueled by withholding up to five percent of payments to Medicare health maintenance organizations. Medicare managers would have discretion to withhold those payments from plans which are being over-compensated by the HMO payment formula, and disburse those funds in the form of extra payments to plans which have avoided risk selection in their beneficiary recruitment and as a result are providing services to sicker enrollees with above-average health care costs. Compared to the meat-cleaver approach of reducing all plan payments from the current 95 percent of local average health care costs, to 90 percent, this is a surgical solution to two significant Medicare managed care plan problems: (a) plan overpayments and (b) plans which avoid enrolling older, frailer beneficiaries because they cut profit margins.  At the end of the year, any funds remaining in this account would be rolled back into the Medicare hospital insurance budget.  At the same time, this bill reforms current rules for Medicare supplemental insurance, or Medigap policies, requiring that such policies must be issued to any eligible beneficiary at any time. This change will encourage more seniors to try capitated plans, because they know the Medigap safety net always will be available to them.  Seniors would be protected from unfair denial of service decision and other health plan abuses through a strengthened and streamlined appeals process. Also, seniors would receive more informative and easily comparable information on health plans in their communities, and through the mail on a regular basis through annual enrollment fairs.  The legislation also would require the collection of customer service and satisfaction data, and performance information to be used in qualitative analysis by Medicare to produce published report cards on plan performance, and help consumers make kitchen-table assessments of their plan options.  By Federal statute, plans also would be barred from muzzling doctors and other health care practitioners in their conversations with patients about their medical condition and all treatments appropriate to their case.  New criminal and civil penalties are created for practitioners and plans who rip off the system.  Programs for hospice care, Alzheimer's respite care, and prospective payment for both home care and skilled nursing care are added to Medicare. The legislation requires Medicare to study and make recommendations on the more extensive and appropriate use of community pharmacy, telemedicine and so-called social health maintenance organization plans for dual eligibles in its portfolio of services to beneficiaries.  The fiscal integrity portion of this bill would set overall part A and part B spending limits for each of the next 5 years. These overall spending limits would include target spending allotments for each of the several major areas of Medicare activity: doctors, hospitals, diagnostic services, nursing homes, and the like.  Typically, Medicare has sought to control costs in these areas in the past by rolling back reimbursement rates for goods and services. Providers, however, have watered down Medicare's attempts at thrift by increasing volume in the face of lower per-service payments. Too often this has led to waste and inefficiency, with providers ordering procedures and services that beneficiaries really don't need, crippling Medicare with unnecessarily high costs.  With $100 billion in cumulative savings expected in 5 years, my proposal would require that Medicare practitioners live within the budget's ceiling by mandating reduced reimbursements if cumulative billings otherwise would bust an individual service sector's annual spending plan.  Despite these restraints, Medicare fee-for-service providers will enjoy generally healthy annual increases under this proposal. Beneficiaries should see no change in the level or quality of care they receive. Expensive, unnecessary care, however, could be sharply curtailed.  Mr. President, I believe that this Congress should not as a first step relinquish Medicare restructuring to a special commission. I think most of us have an acute awareness of what is needed to fix the program for the long term. Some steps will be harder than others. But as the old Chinese proverb reminds us, a trip of a thousand miles begins with the first step.  I hope my colleagues will agree with me that the Medicare Modernization and Patient Protection Act is that good first step, and join with me in co-sponsoring this legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be printed in the Record.The Medicare Modernization and Patient Protection Act of 1997--Section-                          by-Section Analysis  title i: promoting competition, quality, and beneficiary choice in                                 medicare     Section 1: Short title; table of contents, definitions.     Section 2: Findings     Section 101: Establishment of Plan Inprovement and          Competition Office       Subsection (a), establishes an office within Health Care      Financing Administration to carry out several of the pro-     quality, pro-consumer mandates of the legislation.       Subsection (b), defines duties.     Subsection 102: HMO and Competitive Pricing Demonstration          Projects       Subsection (a), directs the Secretary to conduct      demonstration projects for competitive bidding between HMO      contractors in counties in which the AAPCC rate is 120      percent of the national average AAPCC rate, or higher.       Subsection (b), directs reports to Congress.       Subsection (c), waives certain requirements under the      Social Security Act.       Subsection (d), requires that the projects be conducted      within existing department funding.     Subsection 103: Medigap amendments       Subsection (a), guarantees issues of Medicare supplemental      insurance regardless of preexisting health conditions.       Subsection also requires community rating of Medigap      policies. Further, this subsection guarantees offer of      Medigap coverage to persons who leave Medicare risk plans for      any one of several reasons, including voluntary disenrollment      at any time during the first 12 months of enrollment in a      risk plan (and had not been in a risk plan, earlier).       Subsection (b), limits exclusion from coverage due to pre-     existing health conditions.       Subsection (c), clarifies non-discrimination requirements      during initial enrollment periods.       Subsection (d), extends the six-month initial enrollment      period to non-elderly Medicare beneficiaries.       Subsection (e), sets effective dates.       Subsection (f), defines transition rules including a      directive that the National Association of Insurance      Commissioners amend its Model Regulation to reflect Medicare      supplemental insurance policy changes required by the      section.             title ii: increasing medicare coverage options                   Subtitle A: Risk Plan Improvements     Section 201: Changes in medicare managed care program       Subsection (a), HMO payments, amends the current formula      for determining local HCFA annual reimbursement rate      increases for persons insured by risk-sharing plans providing      both Part A and Part B benefits (Medicare Risk plans). The      reformulation would, beginning in 1998, set a new minimum      payment ``floor'' requiring that HCFA pay no plan less than      80 percent of the national average for payments to all plans      in 1997. For each community, payment increases in subsequent      years would be determined by selecting the highest figure      from three alternative formulas; (1) 102 percent of the      previous year's rate, (2) in 1999, 80 percent of the 1998      national average, and in 2000 and in subsequent years      increasing the rate by the previous year's national average      growth rate for Medicare managed care plan reimbursements, or      (3) an increase determined by a ``melded'' rate of local and      national managed care average reimbursements, according to      the following formula:       1998: area specific percentage of increase is determined by      the sum of 80 percent of the local average increase in the      average adjusted per capita cost (AAPCC) in previous year,      and 20 percent of the national AAPCC increase.       1999: area specific percentage determined by the sum of 75      percent of the local AAPCC increase in the previous year, and      25 percent of the national AAPCC increase.       2000: area specific percentage determined by the sum of 70      percent of local AAPCC increase in previous year, and 30      percent of the national AAPCC increase.       2001: area specific percentage determined by the sum of 65      percent of the local AAPCC increase in previous year, and 35      percent of the national AAPCC increase.       2002: area specific percentage determined by the sum of 60      percent of the local AAPCC increase in previous year, and 40      percent of the national AAPCC increase.       2003, and in each subsequent year: area specific percentage      determined by the sum of 60 percent of the local AAPCC      increase in previous year, and 40 percent of the national      AAPCC increase.       This section also contains certain budgetary protections      for beneficiaries receiving treatment for end-stage renal      disease, and for high-cost-growth metropolitan counties.       Subsection (b) creates additional quality standards for      section 1876(c)(6) of the Act, requiring Medicare managed      care plans to meet new standards established by the Secretary      of HHS in consultation with private accreditation      organizations, and addressing such issues as ongoing quality      assurance programs stressing (1) health outcomes, and (2)      providing review by physicians and other certified health      professionals.       Plans meeting these additional standards may waive the      requirement of at least 50 percent non-Medicare beneficiary      enrollment for participation as a Medicare Risk contractor.       Subsection (c) requires coordinated enrollment and      disenrollment periods for Medicare managed care plans,      similar to so-called ``open season'' periods for Federal      Employee Health Benefit Program plans.       Subsection (d) sets service area requirements for      participating plans, including requirements that plans      provide enrollment within all of a metropolitan statistical      area if such organization provides enrollment in any part of      the metropolitan area. Some limited exclusions may be      allowed.       Subsection (e) provides other enhanced enrollee protections      involving provision of emergency room care and services,      renal dialysis, and reimbursement of services outside the      plan's services area (specific to renal disease).       Subsection (f) allows the Secretary in certain instances to      make additional payments to plans insuring certain      individuals, for reasonable costs related to anomalies in      specific service areas.       Subsection (g) provides for intermediate sanctions against      plans for program violations, short of termination. These      intermediate sanctions may include civil penalties of not      more than $25,000 per offense, and suspension of new      enrollment. The section also provides for reasonable notice      to the organization and a right of appeal.       Subsection (h) requires that Medicare managed care plans      must submit to standardized quality review through      independent organizations to determine and demonstrate that      they have maintained the new, higher quality performance      levels required under this legislation. The section also      requires a review of plans' quality performance by the U.S.      General Accounting Office, no later than July 1998.       Subsection (i) sets an effective date for Section 101 as      the contract years beginning with 1998.     Section 202: Quality report cards and comparative reports       Subsection (a) requires that beginning in calendar year      1998, the Secretary will begin distribution of quality report      cards to beneficiaries on eligible managed care plans and on      Medicare supplemental policies, including a comparison of      benefits, costs and quality indicators developed under this      section.       Subsection (b) directs the Secretary to develop quality      indicators on (1) disenrollents statistics, (2) care      outcomes, (3) population health status, (4) appropriateness      of care, (5) consumer satisfaction, (6) access to care,      including waiting time for scheduled appointments and access      to emergency room care, and (7) preventative care programs.       Subsection (c) directs the Secretary to develop      standardized reports comparing plans on the basis of (1)      monthly premiums, (2) choice of doctors, (3) choice of      hospitals, (4) service area, (5) emergency room care      coverage, (6) hospital charges, (7) physician charges, (8)      prescription drug coverage, (9) ambulance coverage, (10)      coverage of routine eye exams and eyeglasses, (11) coverage      of skilled nursing facilities and home health care, (12)      coverage of hearing exams and hearing aids, (13) coverage of      mental health therapy, (14) the number of beneficiaries in      the plan, and several other indicators of plan coverage.       Subsection (d) requires that plans divulge to the Secretary      information required to complete this comparative analysis.      The Secretary also is empowered to collect, on a pro rata      basis, costs from plans to carry out the requirements of this      section.       Subsection (e), definitions.     Section 203: Preemption of state laws restricting managed          care       Subsection (a) preempts states from establishing care      mandates for health insurance coverage in Medicare.       Subsection (b) preempts state laws restricting managed care      arrangements. This preemption would lift state laws which (1)      prohibit or limit carriers from offering incentives to      enrollees to use services of participating providers, (2)      prohibit or limit carriers from limiting services to      participating providers, and other state restrictions on      managed care plans.       This subsection also includes a number of definitions.       Subsection (c) preempts state laws restricting utilization      review programs. However, the section specifies that this      preemption exempts laws preventing denial of lifesaving      medical treatment pending transfer of enrollees to another      health care provider.       Subsection (d), effective date, January 1, 1998.     Section 204: Appeals       Subsection (a) requires all Medicare Risk contractors to      designate an independent ombudsman to assist enrollees in      exercising rights to dispute plan decisions, and in other      grievances.       This section also directs the Secretary to establish no      later than January 1, 1998, an office for the collection of      data one each plan pertaining to decisions on the      disallowance of services to beneficiaries, in full or in      part.       Subsection (b) requires that plans provide enrollees with      clear and understandable description of grievance and appeal      procedures.       Subsection (c) creates an expedited HCFA grievance and      appeals procedure.     Section 205: Medicare HMO Enrollment Fair       Subsection (a), mandates that the Secretary require and      coordinate annual enrollment fairs in each Medicare payment      area to inform beneficiaries of plans offered by health care      organizations.            Subtitle B: Maintaining Fee-for-Service Program     Section 211: Failsafe budget mechanism       Subsection (a) requires payment adjustments to achieve      specified Medicare targets. Sets annualized, five-year      spending targets for Medicare, Parts A and B, according to      budget estimated under Clinton Administration plan.       Includes a ``fail-safe'' budget mechanism allowing the      Secretary to undertake proportional reductions in provider      reimbursements if spending targets otherwise would be      exceeded by billing volume.     Section 212: Maintenance of part B premium at current          percentage of part B program costs       Subsection (a) maintains monthly premium setting formula at      the current percentage of actual Part B program costs.       Subsection (b) sets effective date, applying to premiums      paid for months beginning with January 1997.title iii--promotion of programs of all-inclusive care for the elderly      (pace) and of social health maintenance organizations (shmos)     Section 301: Definitions     Section 302: Expanding the availability of qualified          organizations for frail elderly community projects          (program of all-inclusive care for the elderly (pace))       Subsection (a) directs the Secretary to establish PACE      provider status for public or nonprofit organizations to      provide comprehensive health care services, on a capitated      basis, to frail elderly patients who are at risk of      institutionalization in skilled nursing facilities, and who      would qualify for benefits under both Medicare and Medicaid.      Such organizations would qualify for three-year periods, with      re-qualification procedures. Requirements for assuming      financial risk are specified.       The subsection, the Secretary would be required to act on      applications within 90 days.       Subsection (b) provides for terms and conditions of      approval, equivalent to those contained in conditions of      approval for an On Lok waiver, section 603C of the Social      Security Amendments of 1983, as extended by OBRA 1985. The      section also defines other entry requirements, and certain      responsibilities of the Secretary to assure quality and      feasibility of the plan.       Subsection (c) defines eligibility for participation by      PACE plans.       Subsection (d) sets reimbursement to the organization      through a capitation basis.       Subsection (e) applies Section 302 statutes to plans      currently operating under an On Lok waiver.       Subsection (f) applies current Social Security Act statutes      relating to income and resources of institutionalized spouses      to any individual receiving services from an organization      operating as a PACE provider.       Subsection (g) allows participating plans to also offer      services to frail populations other than the elderly, except      where the Secretary finds provision of such services may      impair the ability of the organization's performance as a      SHMO.     Section 303: Application of spousal impoverishment rules       Applies protections against spousal impoverishment to      couples receiving services through PACE organizations.     Section 304: Permitting expansion and making permanent SHMO          waivers       The section lifts limitations on how many SHMOs may be      approved by the Secretary, as well as limitations on how many      individuals may be enrolled in any such project.     Section 305: Repeals; effective date; and application to          existing waivers       Subsection (a) repeals certain federal statues which are      non-conforming to the intent and purpose of this legislation.       Subsection (b) requires that the Secretary within nine      months of enactment make effective interim final regulations      on the provisions of this title. Until then, all existing      PACE providers and OnLok waivers will remain in effect. After      implementation of new regulations, SHMOs which at that point      have completed three years of activity will attain PACE      provider status without need for reapplication.       Demonstration sites operating less than three years will be      accorded PACE provider status, but will be required to      undergo annual review for three years.                    title IV--Other Medicare Changes     Section 401: Application of competitive acquisition process          for part B Items and services       Subsection (a) authorizes the Secretary to describe      appropriate competitive acquisition procedures for awarding      contracts for items or services. Selected areas of      acquisition to be governed by competitive bidding will be      left to the Secretary's discretion. The section applies to      the acquisition of durable medical equipment, clinical lab      services, prosthetic devices, diagnostic tests, surgical      dressings, and other items and services which may be      identified by the Secretary.       Section 401 sets a number of requirements to assure the      health and safety of Medicare beneficiaries.       Subsection (b) sets limitations and requirements with      respect to exclusive and non-exclusive competitions.       Subsection (c) sets an effective date of January 1, 1997.     Section 402: Simpler procedure for inherent reasonableness          determinations       Subsection (a) and Subsection (b) revise, strike or extend      existing status to reform Medicare acquisitions procedures      for both goods and services, and improve efficiency within      those activities.       Subsection (c) makes those changes effective on January 1,      1997.     Section 403: Promoting advanced directives       Subsection (a) requires that persons who have executed      advanced directives are ensured that such documents are      included in hospital medical charts.       Subsection (b) would require development and dissemination      of standard national forms by the Secretary.       Subsection (c) encourages health plans in Medicare to      encourage use of advanced directive forms through education      and dissemination of promotional material.       Subsection(d) directs the Secretary to develop and      implement a promotional campaign with respect to advanced      directives.     Section 404: Antifraud efforts       Subsection (a) increases penalties for Medicare fraud, and      includes definitions.       Subsection (b) establishes new definitions of punishable      offenses.       Subsection (c) requires a study on standardization of      claims administration focused on determining the feasibility      and desirability of establishing a standardized Medicare      claims administration process, implementing other measures to      improve record keeping, and taking other appropriate steps to      reduce waste, fraud and abuse in making payments in the      Medicare program.       Subsection (d) directs the Commission on Reinventing      Government to report to Congress on the effectiveness of      current efforts to combat waste, fraud and abuse in Medicare,      and whether these efforts would be enhanced by establishing a      coordinated, all-payer, multijurisdiction antifraud program.     Section 405: Hospice benefits       Subsection (a) restrucutes the benefit period for hospice      care, extending such benefits to an unlimited number of 60-     day periods. This section includes a number of conforming      amendments.       Subsection (b) provides new language for reimbursement of      related services including ambulance, diagnostic tests,      chemotherapy and radiation therapy within the hospice      environment.       Subsection (c) allows for contracting with independent      physicians and physician groups for hospice care services.       Subsection (d) waives certain staffing requirements.       Subsection (e) limits liability of beneficiaries and      providers with regard to certain hospice coverage denials.       Subsection (f) extends the period for a physician to      medically certify an individual's terminal illness.       Subsection (g) sets effective date.     Section 406: Study providing pharmacy services to medicare          beneficiaries       Subsection (a), directs the Secretary to identify cost      savings which may be achieved through expanding the role of      pharmacy services under the program.       Subsection (b) describes services which should be analyzed      in the study.       Subsection (c) and (d), require development of      recommendations and a report to Congress.     Section 407: Respite Benefit       Subsection (a) describes entitlement structure for service      not exceeding 32 each year.       Subsection (b) further describes conditions and limitations      on payment.       Subsection (c) definitions.       Subsection (d) defines payments from supplementary      insurance trust fund for individuals with only hospital      insurance coverage.       Subsection (e) effective date.         Title v--prospective payment for home health services     Section 501. Payment for home health services       Subsection (a) amends the Social Security Act to mandate      that home health services be reimbursed through a prospective      payment system. This provision describes discrete areas of      services.       (b) directs establishment of a per visit rate for home care      services.       (c) sets aggregate limits for services and for patients.       (d) sets a medical review process for the system of      payments described in the act, and supervision to insure that      individuals receive appropriate care.       (e) provides for adjustments to payments and for the      tracking of patients who may switch home health agencies.      This section also provides for monitoring features that      determine changes in the quality and level of health care.      The provision also requires that the Secretary report      annually to Congress regarding recommendations for ensuring      access to appropriate home health services.       (f) provides for payment to Christian Science providers.       (g) requires an annual report to Congress during the first      three years of this payment plan by the Medicare Prospective      Payment Review Commission on the effectiveness of the payment      methodology.       (h) mandates development of an ``episodic'' prospective      payment system for home health care.       (i) requires the Secretary to develop a data base upon      which managers may develop a fair and accurate case mix      adjustor as required elsewhere in this act for the      determination of prospective payment.       Subsection (b) appeals process.       Subsection (c) sunsets reasonable cost limitation.       Subsection (d) effective date.     Section 502. Review by peer review organization of home          health services       Subsection (a) requires utilization and quality review of      home health services by an appropriate peer review      organization. These reviews would occur under conditions      including a health agency's determination that a patient did      not meet conditions for care, that the patient no longer      requires care, that the patient's level of care is      inconsistent with the prescription of the attending      physician.       This provision also requires written notification to the      patient by the agency and the peer review organization.       Subsection (b) describes hearing rights.     Section 503. Retroactive reinstatement of presumptive waiver          of liability.       Reconciles OBRA 1986 and other statutes to allow      implementation of prospective payment for home health      services.      title vi: prospective payment system for nursing facilities       Section 601: Definitions for acuity payment, aggregated      resident invoice, allowable costs, case mix weight and other      items to be cited in the determination of prospective      payment.       Section 602: Sets payment objectives, including maintaining      a fair and equitable balance between cost containment and      quality of care.       Section 603: Defines powers and duties of the Secretary.       Section 604: Reconciles provisions of this title with the      Social Security Act.       Section 605: Establishes a resident classification system      to be used to adjust payment rates to practical care      requirements.       Section 606: Establishes a ``cost-center'' system for      establishing appropriate reimbursement to facilities based on      overhead expenses and general operating costs.
