 Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Olver) for his strong support, but just say while my name is on the amendment, the truth of the matter is that all of the Members throughout New England in a bipartisan way have come forward to get the bill authorized in New York and elsewhere, in the Northeast and elsewhere in the country.  So this really has been a joint bipartisan effort, and I thank the gentleman, and I look forward to seeing this amendment pass.
