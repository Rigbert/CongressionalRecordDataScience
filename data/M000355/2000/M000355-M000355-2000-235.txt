 President, the amendment that I sent to the desk is on behalf of myself, Senator Bennett, Senator Conrad, Senator Dorgan, Senator Dodd, Senator Torricelli, Senator Bingaman, Senator Byrd, and Senator Lieberman.  I am glad we are having this debate today. The American flag is our most precious national symbol, and we should be concerned about the desecration of that symbol.  This debate is also about the Constitution which is our most revered national document. Both the flag and the Constitution represent the ideas, values, and traditions that define our Nation. Brave Americans have fought and given their lives defending the truths these both represent. We should be concerned with defending both of them.  Today I am proud to offer, along with the colleagues I previously listed--Senator Bennett, Senator Conrad, Senator Dorgan, Senator Dodd, Senator Torricelli, Senator Bingaman, Senator Byrd, and Senator Lieberman--the Flag Protection Act as an amendment in the form of a substitute to the bill before us.  This amendment would ensure that acts of deliberately confrontational flag-burning are punished with stiff fines and even jail time. My amendment will help prevent desecration of the flag, and at the same time, protect the Constitution.  As all of us do, I revere the flag. Among my most prized possessions is the American flag which honored, as he was laid to rest, my father's service in World War II. That flag rests proudly on the marble mantle in my Senate office. Further, one of my first acts as chairman of the Rules Committee last year was to offer, along with the senior Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Smith, an amendment to the Standing Rules of the Senate to provide that we begin each day's business in the Senate Chamber with the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag.  I want to be perfectly clear, I have no sympathy for those who desecrate the flag. These malcontents are simply grabbing attention for themselves by inflaming the passions of patriotic Americans. There is no reason we should respect them or what they are saying.  Speech that incites lawlessness or is intended to do so merits no first amendment protection, as the Supreme Court has made abundantly clear. From Chaplinsky's ``fighting words'' doctrine in 1942 to Brandenburg's ``incitement'' test in 1969 to Wisconsin v. Mitchell's ``physical assault'' standard in 1993, the Supreme Court has never protected speech which causes or intends to cause physical harm to others.  That is the basis for this legislation. My amendment outlaws three types of illegal flag desecration. First, anyone who destroys or damages a U.S. flag with a clear intent to incite imminent violence or a breach of the peace may be punished by a fine of up to $100,000, or up to 1 year in jail, or both.  Second, anyone who steals a flag that belongs to the United States and destroys or damages that flag may be fined up to $250,000 or imprisoned up to 2 years, or both.  And third, anyone who steals a flag from another and destroys or damages that flag on U.S. property may also be fined up to $250,000 or imprisoned up to 2 years, or both.  Some of my colleagues will argue that we have been down the statutory road before and the Supreme Court has rejected that road. However, those arguments are not valid with respect to this amendment I am now discussing. The Senate's previous statutory effort to address this issue wasn't tied to the explicit teachings and principles of the U.S. Supreme Court.  Put simply, my statutory approach for addressing flag desecration is completely compatible with the first amendment and in no way conflicts with the Supreme Court's relevant rulings in the two leading cases: Texas v. Johnson, (1989) and U.S. v. Eichman, (1990).  In the Eichman case, the court clearly left the door open for outlawing flag burning that incites lawlessness.  As is made clear by these distinctions in cases and the direction pondered by the Supreme Court in Eichman, my amendment will pass constitutional muster. But you don't have to take my word on it. The Congressional Research Service has offered legal opinions concluding that this initiative will withstand constitutional scrutiny. CRS said:       The judicial precedents establish that the [Flag Protection      Act], if enacted, while not reversing Johnson and Eichman,      should survive constitutional attack on First Amendment      grounds.  In addition, Bruce Fein, a former official in the Reagan administration and respected constitutional scholar, concurs. He said:       [The Flag Protection Act] falls well within the protective      constitutional umbrella of Brandenburg and Chaplinsky . . .      [and it] also avoids content-based discrimination which is      generally frowned on by the First Amendment.  Several other constitutional specialists also agree that this initiative respects the first amendment and will withstand constitutional challenge. A memo by Robert Peck, formerly of the ACLU, and Professors Robert O'Neil and Erwin Chemerinsky concludes that this legislation ``conforms to constitutional requirements in both its purpose and its provisions.''  And, these same three respected men have looked at the few State court cases which have been decided since we had this debate a few years ago and have reiterated their original finding of constitutionality.  As I am sure you will hear later today, opponents of my amendment have asked a number of constitutional scholars to find constitutional concerns with my bill. One of the most revealing responses was from Professor William Van Alstyne, a professor at Duke Law School and a dean of constitutional law. Professor Van Alstyne wrote that although he is not in favor of any law or constitutional amendment punishing those who abuse the flag, he did not find any constitutional infirmity with my legislation.  In closing, I would like to share some thoughts recently conveyed by General Colin Powell, a great American. In a recent letter he so eloquently expressed his sentiments which explain my own. He wrote:       I understand how strongly so many . . . veterans and      citizens feel about the flag and I understand the powerful      sentiment in state legislatures for such an [constitutional]      amendment. I feel the same sense of outrage. But I step back      from amending the Constitution to relieve that outrage. The      First Amendment exists to insure that freedom of speech and      expression applies not just to that with which we agree or      disagree, but also that which we find outrageous.       I would not amend that great shield of democracy to hammer      a few miscreants. The flag will still be flying proudly long      after they have slunk away.  There is nothing wrong with the Bill of Rights or the first amendment. Ithas stood the test of time for 200 years. It would be unfortunate if we began tampering with the important and fundamental protections of the first amendment because of a tiny handful of malcontents. This is especially true when we have this viable, constitutional statutory alternative, which I have just offered, for dealing with those malcontents who would desecrate one of our Nation's most cherished symbols.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the various memos and letters I have referred to be printed in the Record. I note that some of the memos refer to S. 982 in the 105th Congress and some refer to S. 1335 in the 104th Congress. These bills were introduced in different sessions of Congress but they are, in fact, the same amendment.  I would also like to refer Senators and other interested parties to the Congressional Record for April 30, 1999, pages 54488-54489 and the following supporting memos and letters: statement of Bruce Fein, Esq. and statements of Robert S. Peck, Esq. et al.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                          Fairfax Station, VA,                                                     May 11, 1999.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: Recently, Senator Hatch sent an      inquiry to a number of constitutional scholars raising      questions about the constitutionality of your bill, S. 931,      the Flag Protection Act of 1999. One of those scholars,      Professor William Van Alstyne, one of the deans of First      Amendment law, wrote back that he found no constitutional      infirmity in the legislation. In reaching that sound      conclusion, Professor Van Alstyne allied himself with the      Congressional Research Service and with Professor Robert      O'Neil of the University of Virginia, who also serves as the      Founding Director of an important First Amendment study      center, the Thomas Jefferson Center for Free Expression,      Professor Erwin Chemerinsky of the University of Southern      California, former Associate Attorney General Bruce Fein and      myself, a constitutional lawyer and law professor.       One letter received by Senator Hatch did raise several      questions about the legislation. It was jointly signed by      Professors Richard Parker and Laurence Tribe of Harvard. As      you know, Professor Parker is an advisor to the Citizens Flag      Alliance (CFA) and a supporter of the flag desecration      constitutional amendment that is the CFA's entire reason for      existence. In his advisory role, he has repeatedly staked out      a position, inconsistent with the explicit teachings of the      U.S. Supreme Court, that nothing short of a constitutional      amendment is valid or appropriate. Professor Tribe, however,      is an opponent of the constitutional amendment. His position,      as articulated in this May 5 joint letter, is similarly at      odds with existing precedent, as well as with testimony that      Professor Tribe himself has previously given in Congress. See      Hate Crimes Sentencing Enhancement Act of 1992: Hearings on      H.R. 4797 Before the Subcomm. on Crime and Criminal Justice      of the House Comm. on the Judiciary, 102d Cong., 2d Sess. 7      et seq. (1992) (statement and testimony of Professor Laurence      Tribe). As this letter details, the concerns raised by      Professors Parker and Tribe should not give any pause to you      or to the bill's other supporters; S. 931 remains compatible      with the First Amendment and does not conflict with the U.S.      Supreme Court's relevant rulings.       I will answer the issues raised by Professors Parker and      Tribe one at a time.       Lack of Congressional Authority--Relying on the Supreme      Court's decision in Lopez, which struck down the Gun-Free      School Zones Act of 1990, Professors Parker and Tribe assert      that Congress ``probably lacks affirmative authority'' to      pass laws prohibiting use of the flag to incite violence. Not      only is their statement couched in uncertainty      (``probably''), but seems to suggest that Congress could      neither pass a law prohibiting violent crimes, as it has done      in a number of instances already, nor any laws relating to      the flag. If the latter were true, then Congress could not      have passed the statute that designates the familiar      scheme of stars and stripes as the flag of the United      States. If the federal government has no legal interest in      the flag that symbolizes our Nation, then it is difficult      to imagine what legal interest it has at all.       In discussing this issue, it is important to note that the      professors' reliance on Lopez is misplaced. Lopez was a      Commerce Clause decision. In that case, the Supreme Court      held that the problem of guns in schools did not have a      sufficient nexus to interstate commerce to allow Congress to      invoke federal authority; the guns-and-schools issue, it said      remains a state matter, as it has traditionally. Unlike the      law struck down in Lopez, your bill does not rest on the      commerce power, but instead relies on the unique nature of      the flag and the inherent federal interest in it. Only the      federal government has the authority to define what      constitutes a flag of the United States. And it retains the      primary interest in defining what constitutes proper use of      the flag. No one could plausibly contend that the asserted      interests more properly and traditionally reside within state      authority.       Moreover, nothing in the Supreme Court's Flag Burning Cases      suggest that the federal government may not assert such an      interest in the flag. In fact, the Court implicitly      recognized what it thought unnecessary to articulate: that      government has a real interest in the uses to which the flag      might be put. It indicated, in words that have real meaning      for the proposed statute, that the First Amendment would not      be violated by a law that prosecuted a person who drags ``a      flag through the mud, knowing that this conduct is likely to      offend others, and yet have no thought of expressing any      idea.'' Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397, 403 n.3 (1989). Note      that this articulation of a constitutional approach to      regulating flag-related conduct is extremely similar to S.      931's treatment of flag-related conduct that is intended and      likely to result in imminent violence.       The Johnson Court went on to say that it would not have      struck down the Texas flag desecration law if the government      had been able to assert truthfully that it was motivated in      its prosecution by a realistic concern for preventing      violence. Id. at 399. This statement, by itself, should be      viewed as definitive authority in favor of the      constitutionality of S. 931. As Ohio's Supreme Court held,      relying on Johnson, punishing use of the flag to incite      violence poses no constitutional problem. Ohio v. Lessin, 620      N.E.2d 72 (Ohio 1993), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 11194 (1994).      The U.S. Supreme Court was given an opportunity to correct      the Ohio decision, if correction was needed, but chose not to      take the case. Maryland has also enacted a flag statute aimed      at dealing with violence without any adverse court ruling as      to its constitutionality. Md. Ann. Code art. 27, Sec. 83      (1990). If states can enact such a law, there is certainly no      bar on congressional enactment, where the federal authorizing      interest is significantly greater and such a statute would be      a valid exercise of the police power.       Section 3(b).--Professors Parker and Tribe also claim that      the bill's punishment for use of the flag to incite violence      draws an impermissible content-based line because it      effectively suppresses, through threat of punishment, those      forms of expressive use of the flag that are intended and      likely to incite violence. This is a remarkable assertion      because, if correct it would render all incitement and      conspiracy statutes that rely on criminal communications      invalid. Yet, as demonstrated by the Johnson Court's      language quoted above, the Supreme Court anticipated a      statute along the lines of S. 931 and found it valid.       Contrary to the implication made by the professors that      line-drawing by Congress is unconstitutional, all laws draw      lines. In the First Amendment area, the Supreme Court has      both recognized this reality and mandated that such lines be      drawn with utmost precision so that it is limited to those      evils that legislation may properly address. See, e.g., NAACP      v. Button, 371 U.S. 415, 433 (1963). In fact, the courts have      long experience upholding laws that punish certain types of      conduct that contains aspects of expression. In Cox v.      Louisiana, 379 U.S. 559 (1965), for example, the Supreme      Court upheld a statute that criminalized picketing or      parading near a state courthouse ``with the intent of      interfering with, obstructing, or impeding the administration      of justice.'' Picketing and parading are indisputably forms      of expressive conduct that are accorded full First Amendment      protection, yet could be made criminal when the governmental      interest is overriding, as it is when that interest is the      prevention of violence as it is in S. 931. Even earlier, the      Court had upheld a prohibition on picketing intended to      further unlawful objectives. International Brotherhood of      Electrical Workers v. NLRB, 341 U.S. 674 (1951). S. 931 is      indistinguishable from the laws upheld by these quite solid      precedents.       Similarly, anti-discrimination laws are not invalid just      because the discriminating party wishes to express racial or      sexual opinions. See Hishon v. King & Spaulding, 467 U.S. 69,      78 (1984), See also United States v. J.H.H., 22 F.3d 821, 826      (8th Cir. 1994) (upholding civil rights laws prohibiting      conduct intended to deprive victims of their legal rights).       By relying on R.A.V. v. St. Paul, 505 U.S. 377 (1992), for      a broad proposition that government has no power to      criminalize conduct that contains elements of expression, the      two professors make the same error that was made by the      Wisconsin Supreme Court and corrected by the U.S. Supreme      Court. In striking down a hate-crime sentencing enhancement      law on First Amendment grounds, the Wisconsin court asserted      that the U.S. Supreme Court's R.A.V. decision preordained the      result. The U.S. Supreme Court then unanimously reversed the      Wisconsin court. It recognized, as Professors Parker and      Tribe assert about S. 931, that the ``Wisconsin statute      singles out for enhancement bias-inspired conduct,'' but      found that this singling out posed no First Amendment issue      because such ``conduct is thought to inflict greater      individual and societal harm, Wisconsin v. Mitchell, 508 U.S.      476 487-88 (1993). Among those legitimate concerns for harm      that validated the law which the Supreme Court enumerated      were: a concern for inspiring retaliatory crimes, the      distinct emotional harms visited upon victims, and the      likelihood that community unrest would be engendered. Id. at      488. The Court further     found that the ``desire to redress these perceived harms      provides an adequate explanation for its penalty-enhancement      provision over and above mere disagreement with offenders'      beliefs or biases.'' Id.       S. 931 similarly focuses on conduct (incitement to violence      through the instrumentality of a flag) with substantial      potential harms that include the ones listed by the Mitchell      Court. In his congressional testimony on hate crimes      sentencing enhancement, Professor Tribe saw no constitutional      dilemma with a law that punished those who target their      victims by race or gender with longer sentences even if the      criminal act might be interpreted as an expression of racial      hatred. Hate Crimes Sentencing Enhancement Act of 1992.      Hearings on H.R. 4797 Before the Subcomm. on Crime and      Criminal Justice of the House Comm. on the Judiciary, 102d      Cong., 2d Sess. 7-30 (1992) (statement and testimony of      Professor Laurence Tribe). In taking his position in defense      of the use of bias motivation as a sentencing factor and      calling it properly narrow even though it singled out a      particular form of opinion, he anticipated the Mitchell      Court's finding of greater societal harm. Somehow, this time      around with respect to S. 931, Professor Tribe seems blinded      to the greater societal harm that is inherent in the use of a      symbol of freedom and national unity to provoke violence and      unrest. I cannot imagine the Court turning a blind eye to the      distinctive harms involved in using the national flag to      incite violence. As the Mitchell Court recognized, there is a      considerable difference between laws that control conduct and      those directed at controlling speech. Mitchell, 508 U.S. at      486-90.       Section 3(c).--The two professors part company, however, on      whether the government may especially punish the destruction      of certain kinds of government property, in this instance,      government-owned flags. Professor Tribe, consistent with his      hate-crime testimony and the Court's holding in Mitchell,      recognizes that a special form of emotional harm might be at      issue and that this translation of the government's interest      into law could be constitutional.\1\ Professor Parker takes      the opposite view because he finds the same flaw throughout      the bill: the singling out of the flag as something of      especial interest to the federal government. For the same      reasons stated in defense of Section 3(b), this argument      fails.---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \1\ He hesitates in his opinion, in part because he      mistakenly distinguishes the federal government (which has no      emotions) from the people that constitute that government      (who do have emotions). The assertion of an interest on      behalf of the people, as the Mitchell Court made evident, is      a valid one by the government.---------------------------------------------------------------------------       Section 3(d).--Perhaps most remarkable of all is the two      professors' assertion that S. 931 cannot constitutionally      punish theft and destruction of another's U.S. flag on      federal property. Certainly, the theft and destruction of      property on federal land is well within the police power of      the federal government to punish. In their constitutional      analysis of this section, the professors wonder what especial      federal interest there is in protecting U.S. flags from theft      and destruction on federal land over, to use one of their      examples, ``great-grandmothers' wedding dresses.'' To pose      the question, though, is to answer it. There is, as the      Johnson and Eichman Courts conceded, a definite and unique      interest on the part of government in the flag of the United      States. For people to be invited onto government property,      perhaps, for example, to celebrate Armed Forces Day when they      are likely to engage in flag-waving, and be subjected to      theft and destruction of property produces a special and      distinctive harm that it is well within the government's      authority to punish. It is difficult to imagine the argument      that might be made to justify a similar federal interest in a      treasured family heirloom, such as a wedding dress, that      somehow made it onto federal property, was stolen and then      destroyed there.       Contrary to the letter drafted by the two distinguished      professors, the constitutionality of S. 931 should not give      any Member of Congress pause. The Supreme Court has virtually      invited Congress to pass such an Act and indicated its      validity. Because wise constitutional counsel and the lessons      of history indicate that amending our Constitution should not      be undertaken when a statutory resolution is available, it is      imperative that Congress give serious consideration to S. 931      rather than embark on a constitutional journey that holds      implications for our freedoms that even the most foresighted      cannot anticipate.           Sincerely,     Robert S. Peck, Esq.                                  ____                                                  Duke University,                                                School of Law,                                       Durham, NC, March 31, 1999.     Senator Orrin G. Hatch,     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee,                      Dirksen Senate Office Bldg., Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Hatch: I have reviewed S. 1335 styled ``The      Flag Protection and Free Speech Act of 1995.'' I have also      reviewed the November 8, 1995 Memorandum of the Congressional      Research Service, and the recent letters you received from      Professors Stephen Presser and Paul Cassell offering comments      and observations on the proposed act. My observations, such      as they are, are these--       I. If the principal provisions of this proposed bill are      narrowly construed--as I believe they might well be \1\--then      I am inclined to agree more nearly with the analysis provided      by the Memorandum of the Congressional Research Service than      with that provided by my able colleagues at Northwestern      (Steve Presser) and Utah (Paul Cassell). In brief, as      narrowly construed and rigorously applied, the principal      section of the act (Sec. 3(a)) may not be inconsistent with      the First Amendment and may withstand judicial scrutiny when      reviewed in the courts. I say this because as thus narrowly      construed and applied, Sec. 3(a) may apply only in      circumstances in which it would meet the requirements the      Supreme Court itself has laid down in the principal case      applicable to more general laws of this same sort.\2\ Herein      is how that analysis is likely to proceed:---------------------------------------------------------------------------     Footnontes at end of letter.---------------------------------------------------------------------------       A. Specifically, Sec. 3(a) proposes to amend Sec. 700 of      title 18 (the Criminal Code of the United States). It does      so, however, by subjecting to criminal prosecution only such      person who--destroys or damages a flag of the United States      with the primary purpose and intent to incite or produce      imminent violence or a breach of the peace, and in      circumstances where the person knows it is reasonably likely      to produce imminent violence or a breach of the peace.       Fairly (albeit strictly) read, the statute thus may require      both of the following matters to be proved in any case      brought pursuant to this section--and both of these matters      must, as in any other criminal case, be proved beyond      reasonable doubt:       1. That ``the primary purpose'' (i.e., the principal      objective \3\) sought by the defendant was to incite      ``violence or a breach of the peace'' and, indeed, that it      was his specific intent to do just that;       2. That when he acted primarily to bring about that result      (and only secondarily, if at all, to achieve some other aim),      moreover, the circumstances were such that it was at least      ``reasonably likely'' in fact his actions would have      precisely that consequence (as he fully intended) even as he      himself fully understood.       3. Likewise, however, according to the plain implication of      its own terms as thus understood, nothing in this section \4\      is meant otherwise to subject one to prosecution merely for      destroying or damaging a flag of the United States--no matter      how offensive or objectionable others may find any such act      to be. And, specifically, to make this latter matter quite      clear in a relevant fashion, Sec. 2(a)(4) (which immediately      precedes Sec. 3(a))--expressly distinguishes any and all      cases where one destroys or damages a flag when one does so      to ``make a political statement,'' rather then merely ``to      incite a violent response.'' \5\       4. Subsection (a)(3) of Sec. 2, separately declares that      ``abuse of the flag . . . may amount to fighting words,''      which doubtless is true (i.e., it may, just as the provision      thus also equally acknowledges, however, that it may not.) To      avoid constitutional difficulties--difficulties that would      arise from any broader understanding of this provision--it      would be appropriate to interpret this provision merely to      declare that abuse of the flag may be a means chosen      deliberately to provoke a violent reaction and if undertaken      just for that purpose then--as in the instance of ``fighting      words'' (e.g., when ``fighting words'' are themselves used      not as a form of political statement but, rather, in order to      provoke a violent reaction)--it is the author's understanding      that such conduct when intended to incite a violent response      rather than to make a political statement is outside the      protections afforded by the first amendment. Again, taken      this was, the observation may be substantially correct--but      in being correct, it also covers very little ground.\6\       B. Necessarily, all of this should mean \7\ that even if      the circumstances were such that violence (or a breach of      peace) could reasonably be expected to result as a      consequence of the defendant's actions, so long as it was not      his primary purpose or intent to induce or incite it--when he      burned or destroyed a flag \8\--he is not to be subject to      any penalty under this law. Specifically, if this is correct,      all merely ``reactive'' violence--violence not sought as the      immediate object by the defendant (who burns a flag as a      political statement or as a public, politically demonstrative      act of protest) but violence by those who, say, are but      observors or passersby made angry or indignant by what they      regard as outrageous behavior by him, for example, is thus      not to be utilized as sufficient reason to seek his      imprisonment rather than theirs.--Or so, at least, I believe      the statute can be interpreted to provide. And if (and      probably only if) it is so interpreted as I believe it thus      can be understood, I think it will survive in the courts.\9\       II. The vast majority of all instances when the American      flag has been used in some fashion others find offensive (and      some may be inclined to react to it in ways involving      violence or a breach of the peace) have been so      overwhelmingly merely an inseparable part of some kind of      obvious political statement, however, that a criminal statute      reaching such a use of the flag (including defacing or      burning a flag) only when ``primarily . . . intended to      incite a violent response rather than [to] make a political      statement,'' will cover very little. For example, so far as I      can determine, it will cover no instance of public flag      ``desecration'' of any of the many (allegedly) offensive      kinds of ``flag abuse'' that have been a fairly commonplace      feature of our political landscape during the past fifty      years in point of fact. And unless these past practices      suddenly take a different turn, therefore, whatever     the pretensions of the sponsors of the bill might be, there      will be little or no real work for this proposed act to      do.\10\       But permit me to get quite specific about this last      observation, since it may seem counterintuitive. Still, there      is frankly no question that this observation is fully      applicable, by way of example, both to the events involved in      Texas v. Johnson \11\ and to those also involved in United      States v Eichman,\12\ which events and cases previous bills      (and now this bill) were evidently meant to respond to in      some fashion, but that this bill could by its own terms not      affect at all.\13\ And I press this observation, because      precisely to the extent the bill has been drafted--and can be      construed--to avoid the constitutional infirmities of prior,      failed, ``flag protection'' acts--by being very narrowly      drawn as the sponsors have striven to do, it merely indicates      limitations in no way reflecting on its drafters, but merely      what the First Amendment itself protects--and will continue      to protect unless itself altered, amended, or abridged.       A. So, for example, in Texas v. Johnson, Justice Brennan      begins the Opinion for the Court by expressly noting that      Johnson was convicted for publicly burning an American      flag,\14\ but strictly as an expressive part and feature of a      public and political demonstration, neither more nor less, as      Justice Brennan expressly observed in the opening sentence of      the Court's Opinion in the case.\15\ Indeed, it was this      fact--that the particular acts of the defendant were so      entwined--that brought the first amendment to bear, and it      was also this fact that served as the basis of the Court's      decision reversing his conviction--nor would the proposed      bill apparently affect the case in any way at all.\16\ As      Justice Brennan also noted in the case,\17\ while      ``several witnesses testified they were seriously offended      by the flag-burning,'' it was also clear that ``[n]o one      was physically injured or threatened with injury'' by      anything Johnson said or did, including (among the things      he did) burning a flag.       B. Next, when this Congress nevertheless reacted to the      furor created by the Supreme Court's decision in Texas v.      Johnson, by enacting the Flag Protection Act of 1989 (as I      and others urged it at the time not to do and testified would      not withstand constitutional scrutiny consistent with the      Court's decision in Johnson), that act in turn was at once      tested by individuals who protested the act's enactment by      very publicly burning flags in demonstrative opposition to      the act itself.\18\ In reviewing the several convictions      obtained in the lower courts (under the new act of Congress)      in both these cases, the Supreme Court at once did all of the      following: (a) It expressly affirmed its decision in Johnson;      (b) applied it to these cases (which had been brought to it      for prompt review of those convicted under the new act of      Congress); (c) reversed both convictions; and (d) held the      act unconstitutional as applied.\19\       Nor--and here's the immediate point to which these      observations are meant to be pertinent--do I read or      understand the provisions of the proposed bill, S. 1335, as      presuming to try to dictate a different result in any case      involving similar facts and acts as were all present in these      cases--for, indeed, if it did, presumably the outcome would      once again be the same--the act as thus applied (were it      thought to apply) would be unconstitutional as applied unless      the Court itself is prepared simply to overrule itself as      there is no reason to think it would or should.       C. And again, in still a different case, in Spence v.      Washington,\20\ the alleged criminalized misuse of a flag      consisted of defendant's effrontery in having presumed to      tape a peace symbol onto the face of a flag--thus      ``defacing'' it--which flag he then displayed (as a political      demonstration of his views) outward from the window of his      apartment for public view. Here, again, the Supreme Court      reversed the conviction (a conviction obtained under a state      law forbidding such defacing and public display of a flag).      It reversed that conviction ``on the ground that as applied      to appellant's activity the Washington statute impermissibly      infringed protected expression.'' \21\       In brief, here, too, the facts involved a politically      expressive use of a physical flag, not burned, but      nevertheless altered in a manner the state statute forbade,      and then publicly displayed, as Spence saw fit to do.      Moreover, that Spence's use of his flag in this way may have      offended others (as indeed it did), or may have motivated      some even to want to act against him in some way, was neither      here nor there. As the Court itself observed in Spence: \22\      ``We are unable to affirm the judgment below on the ground      that the State may have desired to protect the sensibilities      of passersby. `It is firmly settled that under our      Constitution the public expression of ideas may not be      prohibited merely because the ideas are themselves offensive      to some of their hearers.' '' \23\       D. The just-quoted portion of Spence, moreover, was itself      taken from a still earlier ``flag-abuse'' case, itself once      again, however, also involving a political demonstrative      destruction (burning) of a flag on the public street, with      the defendant's conviction once again reversed on First      Amendment grounds. In Street v. New York,\24\ as in each of      these other real cases, it was plain on the facts that the      incident was one involving the public expression of political      feelings (nor was there any evidence that Street presumed to      burn a flag when and as he did to incite lawless action      either against himself or anyone else). Indeed, however, I      have found no case at all where it was plain that the      ``destruction of the flag of the United States'' was in fact      ``intended to incite a violent response rather than make a      political statement,'' \25\ so to lift it out from First      Amendment protection, much less any that appear to meet the      full requirements of the act.       IV. Briefly Then To Sum Up: Unless the critical provision      of the act is applied more broadly than a tightly constrained      construction would approve \26\--       (a) If thus construed (as it can be construed) to apply      only in circumstances consistent with the requirements of      Brandenburg v. Ohio, within that restricted field of      application, it may well be sustained in the Supreme Court;       (b) However, as thus very tightly constrained, it will not      reach many--possibly not any--of the various kinds of ``flag      burning'' cases, or other ``flag desecration'' or ``flag      abuse'' cases involving varieties of political expression and      political demonstrations previously held by the Supreme Court      to be protected by the First Amendment.       (c) Moreover, the cases it--the act--may clearly reach      without substantial risk of being held unconstitutional as      applied, are cases involving acts already so subject to such      criminal penalties (e.g., for incitement to violence or riot)      as state and federal criminal law already cover, as to raise      as a fair question respecting the need for or propriety of      this legislation at all. And in brief, if this is so, one      must finally ask, just what is there, if anything, of a      constitutionally proper concern, that is honestly sought to      be served by the act?       V. I am frankly unable to answer this last question I have      just posed, and may be forgiven a reluctance to speculate.      Yet, whatever it is, it will be most unseemly, I cannot help      but believe, that Congress may exhibit no equal interest in      bringing to bear the full impact of harsh national criminal      sanctions against anyone mistreating the flags of other      nations in demonstrations of protest as may occur in this      country, as Congress appears so willing to provide for our      own. But evidently this is what some in Congress appear eager      and willing to do. Again, however, I cannot imagine why.       Yet, if so, is this, then, finally to be the example of      ``liberty'' and of ``freedom'' we now mean to broadcast to      the world?--That Americans are free to burn the English Union      Jack, or despoil the French Tricolor, or trample the flag of      Canada, South Africa, Iraq, Pakistan, India, or Mexico, as      they like, in messages and demonstrations of discontent or      protest as they may freely occur in this country, but      assuredly not (or not so far as this Congress will be given      license by the Supreme Court to prevent it) as to make any      equivalent use of our own? And indeed that this is how we now      want to present ourselves to the world?       But I would hope, Senator Hatch, that you and your      colleagues would think otherwise, and that you will conclude      that to ``wrap the flag'' in the plaster casts of criminal      statutes in this way--as this and virtually every similar      bill \27\ seeks to do--would be a signal mistake. Its      occasional burning, utterly unattended by arrest, by      prosecution, by sanctions of jail and imprisonment, is surely      a far better tribute to freedom than that it is never      burned--but where the explanation is not that no one is ever      so moved to do (we know some are) but are stayed from doing      so by fear of being imprisoned, as some would seek to have      done. That kind of inhibiting fear is merely the example even      now, half-way around the world. It is furnished in a place      called Tianamen Square. It is a quiet, well-ordered      place.\28\ But Tianamen Square is not what ought to appeal to      us--it is but a quietude of repression, it has a desuetude of      fear, it is a place occupied by the harsh regime of criminal      law. It furnishes no example whatever of a sort we should      desire to emulate or pursue.\29\       So, I hope in the end that you and your colleagues may come      to believe the flag of the United States is not honored by      putting those who ``abuse'' it, whether in some egregious or      in some petty incendiary fashion, in prison or in jail.      Rather, let us regard them even as Jefferson spoke more      generally to such matters in his first Inaugural Address,\30\      leaving them ``undisturbed as monuments of the safety with      which error of opinion may be tolerated where reason is left      free to combat it,'' as surely is true.           Sincerely,                                              William Van Alstyne.                               footnotes     \1\ It is the firm practice of the Supreme Court to construe      acts of Congress very stringently (i.e., narrowly) when any      broader construction would at once draw it into serious first      amendment question. (For useful and pertinent examples, see      National Endowment for the Arts v. Karen Finley et al., 118      S.Ct. 2168 (1998); Watts v. United States, 394 U.S. 705      (1969); Yates v. United States, 354 U.S. 198 (1957).)     \2\ That controlling case is almost certain to be Brandenburg      v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444 (1969) (discussed infra, in footnote      9).     \3\ not a secondary or even related, co-equal, objective. . .      .     \4\ To be sure, other sections do reach some other acts      (e.g., ``damaging a flag belonging to the United States''      (Sec. 700(b)) or stealing or knowingly converting and      destroying a third person's flag (Sec. 700(c)), but these      provisions are doubtless secondary in significance and so I      defer consideration for such slight discussion of these      provisions as they are worth. (Briefly, however, there is no      likely problem with the provision re ``a flag belonging to      the United States.'' (See e.g., Spence v. Washington, 418      U.S. 405, 409 (1974) (dictum) (``We have no doubt that the      State or National Governments constitutionally may forbid      anyone from mishandling in any manner a flag that is public      property.'') As to a flag merely     owned by a third party, that one ``steal[s], knowingly      convert[s], and destroy[s],'' there may be--as the other      commentators have noted--a federalism problem (the act in      this regard would not appear to meet any of the requirements      under United States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549 (1996), nor does      the act appear to be connected to any other enumerated power      provided in Article I Sec. 8 of the Constitution (e.g., the      spending power, tax power, etc.). It remains arguable,      however, that the same (merely implied) power providing      Congress with legislative authority to establish incidental      insignia of nationhood (e.g., a flag, motto, seal, etc.)      could conceivably permit it to draw on the ``necessary and      proper clause'' to protect personal flag ownership from      interference (including interference by theft or conversion),      so the ultimate answer to this question is a bit unclear. I      agree with the other commentators, however, that without      doubt state criminal (and tort) laws already reach all      instances that would come within this provision--so it is at      best redundant and may inadvertently?) represent still one      more instance of gratuitously piling federal criminal      sanctions on top of pre-existing state sanctions (a practice      the American Bar Association, as well as the Chief Justice of      the United States, has recently asked Congress to use more      sparingly if at all). In brief, neither need for, nor any      special utility of, these provisions has been shown.)     \5\ Subsection (a)(4) of Sec. 2, (``Findings and Purposes'')      declares (with emphasis and bracketed material added) that      ``destruction of the flag . . . can [but need not] be      intended to incite a violate response rather than make a      political statement and such conduct [presumably meaning by      `such conduct' only such conduct as is indeed intended to      incite a violent response and not intended to make a      political statement] is outside the protections afforded by      the first amendment. . . .'' As thus understood (i.e.,      understood as aided by the words I have placed in brackets),      the subsection is not necessarily inaccurate as a strict      first amendment matter.     \6\ (See discussion infra in text at II.).     \7\ And to avoid first amendment objections, must probably be      construed to mean. . . .     \8\ Whether as ``a political statement'' or for any other      purpose. . . .     \9\ As thus construed and applied, it may meet the test      provided in Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444, 447 (1969)      (``[Our decisions] have fashioned the principle that the      guarantee of free speech . . . do not permit a State to      forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or of law      violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting      or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite      or produce such action.''). If such ``advocacy'' (i.e., such      ``speech act'' as one engages in) is directed to ``inciting      or producing'' imminent lawless action (and is ``likely to      incite or produce such action''), on the other hand, the      Court plainly implies that ``the guarantees of free speech''      do not immunize one from arrest or from prosecution under a      suitably framed, properly applied law.     \10\ Moreover, to the extent there is any such useful work,      such as it might be thought to be, it would be largely merely      redundant of what is already subject to a multitude of state      and local criminal laws--laws that already reach incitement      to riot, violence, or breach of the peace, whether or not it      involves torching a flag. Nor is there any reason at all to      believe that any of the states--all of which already have      such laws--are either unable or unwilling to bring the full      force of any such merely standard criminal statutes to bear      when any actual case would arise of a kind any of these      criminal statutes can validly reach. In brief, this is simply      not a subject where state or local law enforcement      authorities lack encouragement or means to apply the regular      force of applicable state criminal law, nor do I think the      sponsors of the bill could readily provide examples of such      local or state prosecutorial laxity. Far from this being the      case, quite the opposite tends to be the rule--prosecutorial      zeal in this area is surely the more usual response. The      ``need'' for some overlapping, largely duplicative, criminal      statute by Congress in this area, in short, is thus fare from      clear.     \11\ 491 U.S. 397 (1989).     \12\ 486 U.S. 310 (1990).     \13\ Indeed, however, the observation is fully applicable as      well to virtually every other case the Supreme Court and      indeed the lower courts have had occasion to consider during      the past fifty years, involving politically controversial      uses of the flag. Some of these are discussed infra in the      text.     \14\ (--For which he was promptly prosecuted under the      relevant Texas statute punishing acts of physical desecration      of venerated objects including the American flag as one such      object, ultimately and successfully appealing that conviction      to the Supreme Court.).     \15\ 491 U.S. 397, 399 (1989).     \16\ Johnson was not arrested or prosecuted for ``inciting,      or attempting to incite, a riot or violence,'' nor is there      any reason to think he would not have been charged with that      offense had the arresting officers believed there were      suitable grounds (rather there was simply no evidence that      this was his intent--to incite or to provoke a riot--in      burning the flag in a public plaza--as an incident of      expressing bitter feelings for ongoing proceedings in the      Republican Convention then in progress, in Dallas).     \17\ 491 U.S. at 399.     \18\ In one instance the defiance of Congress' handiwork was      demonstrated very publicly indeed, specifically, as noted in      the Court's subsequent Opinion, by several persons who      ``knowingly set[] fire to several United States flags on the      steps of the United States Capital while protesting various      aspects of the Government's domestic and foreign policy'' and      virtually simultaneously by others, ``by knowingly setting      fire to a United States flag in Seattle while protesting the      Act's passage.'' (See United States v. Eichman, 496 U.S. 310      at 312 (1990).     \19\ United States v. Eichman, 496 U.S. 310 (1990).     \20\ 418 U.S. 405 (1974).     \21\ Id at 406.     \22\ Id at 412.     \23\ And in Spence, note, too, that the Court had also      declared: ``Nor may appellant be punished for failing to show      proper respect for our national emblem [citing still previous      decisions of the Court].'' There was no novelty in any of      this. The Court has for decades made it perfectly plain that      the first amendment protected uses of flags (e.g., incidental      to political demonstrations) were not to be made subject to      any offended person's veto; nor may the state use the      disturbance of the peace, much less the threat of riot, by      persons affronted or made angry over one's provocative use of      first amendment rights (including flag uses) as a      justification to arrest the person exercising those rights.      See e.g., R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, 112 S. Ct. 2538 (1992);      American Booksellers v. Hudnut, 771 F.2d 323 (7th Cir. 1985),      summarily aff'd, 475 U.S. 1001 (1986); Houston v. Hill, 482      U.S. 451 (1987); People v. Cohen, 403 U.S. 15 (1971) (``[T]he      issue is whether California can excise, as `offensive      conduct' one particular scurrilous epithet from public      discourse, either upon the theory . . . that it's use is      inherently likely to causes violent reaction or upon a more      general assertion that the State, acting as guardian of      public morality, may properly remove this offensive word from      the public vocabulary. * * * The argument amounts to little      more than the self-defeating proposition that to avoid      physical censorship of one who has not sought to provoke such      a response by a hypothetical coterie of the violent and      lawless, the State may more appropriately effectuate that      censorship [itself].''); Rosenfield v.

Colin L. Powell, USA (Ret),                                     Alexandria, VA, May 18, 1999.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: Thank you for your recent letter asking      my views on the proposed flag protection amendment.       I love our flag, our Constitution and our country with a      love that has no bounds. I defended all three for 35 years as      a soldier and was willing to give my life in their defense.       Americans revere their flag as a symbol of the Nation.      Indeed, it is because of that reverence that the amendment is      under consideration. Few countries in the world would think      of amending their Constitution for the purpose of protecting      such a symbol.       We are rightfully outraged when anyone attacks or      desecrates our flag. Few Americans do such things and when      they do they are subject to the rightful condemnation of      their fellow citizens. They may be destroying a piece of      cloth, but they do no damage to our system of freedom which      tolerates such desecration.       If they are destroying a flag that belongs to someone else,      that's a prosecutable crime. If it is a flag they own, I      really don't want to amend the Constitution to prosecute      someone for foolishly desecrating their own property. We      should condemn them and pity them instead.       I understand how strongly so many of my fellow veterans and      citizens feel about the flag and I understand the powerful      sentiment in state legislatures for such an amendment. I feel      the same sense of outrage. But I step back from amending the      Constitution to relieve that outrage. The First Amendment      exists to insure that freedom of speech and expression      applies not just to that with which we agree or disagree, but      also that which we find outrageous.       I would not amend that great shield of democracy to hammer      a few miscreants. The flag will still be flying proudly long      after they have slunk away.       Finally, I shudder to think of the legal morass we will      create trying to implement the body of law that will emerge      from such an amendment.       If I were a member of Congress, I would not vote for the      proposed amendment and would fully understand and respect the      views of those who would. For or against, we all love our      flag with equal devotion.           Sincerely,                                                  Colin L. Powell.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I yield the floor.
