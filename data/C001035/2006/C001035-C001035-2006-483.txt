President, I thank my colleagues for their cooperation. I realize I need to talk very rapidly.  I understand that the Senator from Oklahoma listed earmarks that the Senator from Maine and I have jointly sponsored. I want to tell my colleagues that I am very proud of those projects, and I will stand here and defend every single one of them. But the fact is, that is irrelevant to the debate before us right now.  I think it is so unfortunate to see this breakdown as certain States in certain parts of the country oppose what is a program that is absolutely essential to those of us who live in colder States.  I supported all of the aid for Hurricane Katrina's victims in the gulf region. I routinely support programs that benefit other regions of the country. I think it is unfortunate and unfair and very disappointing for colleagues to oppose a program simply because it doesn't benefit their region as much as others.  This is a program that is a matter of literally life and death to those of usrepresenting low-income and elderly constituents.  I realize my time has expired. I urge my colleagues to support the motion to invoke cloture.
