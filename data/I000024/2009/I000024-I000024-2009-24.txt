I think Hamilton is, without question, a liberal activist judge. He believes judges do not simply interpret the Constitution of the United States but that judges have the power to actually change the Constitution when deciding cases, stating that--this is his quote, Mr. President--``part of our job here as judges is towrite a series of footnotes to the Constitution.'' This is exactly what our Founding Fathers did not want us to do. Judges are supposed to interpret what we do in this Chamber.  When he was nominated to the district court in 1994, the American Bar Association rated him as not qualified. I voted against him for a number of reasons back in 1994. I don't very often agree with Vice President Biden, but I have to say this. Vice President Biden made a statement some time ago with which I do agree. That is, if you are in the Senate and you have a judge who is coming up for confirmation by the Senate, and if you oppose that judge when he comes up to be a Federal judge, then later on when he wants to become a circuit judge or even a Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, if you opposed him at a lower position, you have to oppose him at the next position because the bar necessarily goes up. For that reason and many other reasons, I will be opposing him.  I think it is important that in 2003, in A Woman's Choice v. Newman, Hamilton issued an injunction against an Indiana law that required abortion clinics to give women information about alternatives to abortions in the presence of a physician, nurse, or somebody else--just to have that information. This is inconceivable to me this could happen.  Let's keep in mind also this is the same judge who had a ruling--perhaps the most infamous because of his 2005 decision while presiding over the case of Hinrichs v. Bosma in which he enjoined the Speaker of Indiana's House of Representatives from permitting sectarian prayers to be offered as a part of that body's official proceedings, meaning that the chaplain or whoever opened the proceedings with a prayer could not invoke the name of Jesus Christ in his prayer.  In his conclusion, Hamilton wrote:       If the Speaker chooses to continue any form of legislative      prayer, he should advise persons offering such a prayer (a)      that it must be nonsectarian and must not be used to      proselytize or advance any one faith over another. This is      the first time and only time I believe this has happened in a      nomination. This will be coming up for confirmation. I hope      all of America will be aware of the fact this is happening.                          ____________________
