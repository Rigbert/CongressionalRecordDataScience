Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds to respond briefly that nothing in my amendment or the amendment offered by the gentleman Illinois [Mr. Hyde] and the gentleman from Michigan [Mr. Barcia] and the gentleman from Minnesota [Mr. Oberstar] cuts family planning. It holds harmless the amount of money.  This policy, known as the Mexico City Policy, first announced at a U.N. conference in 1984, separates abortion from family planning. So you can have it both ways. You can say you are pro-life and also pro-family planning, because the money will flow to those organizations that divest themselves of killing unborn children with suction machines or with injections of high concentrated salt or any of the other hideous methods that are used to kill and abuse and destroy unborn babies.
