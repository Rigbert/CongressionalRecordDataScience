Speaker, on October 19, 2003, Roman Catholics, humanitarians, and social justice advocates the world over celebrated the beatification of Mother Teresa of Calcutta by Pope John Paul II in Rome. Beatification is one of the steps toward sainthood in the Roman Catholic Church.  It is impossible to encapsulate the life and work of Mother Teresa into one entry. Many know the basics of her story: born in Albania in 1910, she turned from a comfortable existence when she decided to become a Catholic nun in 1928. Assigned to a convent school in Calcutta, she taught geography and history. Feeling the need to serve God and her fellow human beings in another way, Mother Teresa founded a religious order, the Missionaries of Charity, in, 1948. The order was based on reaching out to the poor, the suffering, and the dying wherever they were: streets and alleys, shacks and hovels. From that first mission there are now more than 400. The work has expanded to hospices for AIDS patients so that these sufferers, along with the least among us, enjoy comfort and some measure of peace in their final days. Though 5,000 sisters are now members of the order, thousands more volunteer for periods of their lives in the Missionaries of Charity. So many of these are inspired by the diminutive foundress herself. ``My vocation is love'' she said. ``There is joy in transcending self to serve others.''  Celebrated throughout the world for her works, honored with many awards including 1979's Nobel Peace prize, Mother Teresa is already considered a saint by many of those whose lives she touched. No one who met her, who shook her strong hands, who looked at the deeply wrinkled face, who spoke to the dark eyes which penetrated into one's soul, who listened to the deep and powerful voice, came away from the encounter the same person. Even people who saw her only casually were moved by her graceful strength and quiet dignity. I am reminded of a leader in our own country recalling a story of a time on an airplane when people saw her and took out their checkbooks. She never said a word, simply her presence called them to help. In more dramatic ways, meetings with Mother Teresa changed the course of people's lives. Still, she eschewed such trappings of notoriety, gaining her greatest sustenance from her love of God and her work to alleviate the suffering in the world. More than anyone else in our time, Mother Teresa lived Christ's admonition ``Whatsoever you do to the least among you, that you do also to me.'' She ignored the accouterments of affluence by admonishing, ``God does not ask me to be successful, he only asks me to be faithful.''  She wrestled within herself and struggled through daily hardships, yet she somehow transcended the difficulties and was cherished as a living embodiment of God's love for every human being. I close this recognition of Mother Teresa's beautification with her own summation of her life's work: ``My community is the poor. Their security is my own. Their heart is my own. My house is the house of the poor--not just the poor, but the poorest of the poor: those who are so dirty and full of germs that no one goes near them; those who do not go to pray because they are naked; those who do not eat because they do not have the strength; those who collapse on the sidewalks knowing they are about to die while the living walk by without even looking back; those who do not cry because they have no more tears left.''  In one's own lifetime, rarely does a person observe a living saint. Mother Teresa will remain for all time such a living legend. May her selflessness inspire a world beleaguered by war, affluence, and ancient hatreds.                          ____________________
