President, I thank my colleague from Florida for his leadership on this issue. I am happy to join him as a cosponsor. I would like at this time to offer another amendment which I would like to describe.                            Amendment No. 38  I ask the pending amendment be set aside, and I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coburn). Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will report.  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:       The Senator from Illinois (Mr. Durbin), proposes an      amendment numbered 38.
