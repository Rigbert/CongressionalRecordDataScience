Mr. Speaker, yesterday we voted on a number of critical pieces of legislation. One of these, which I supported, was H.R. 3030, the Elie Wiesel Genocide and Atrocities Prevention Act of 2017, sponsored by my friend Ann Wagner.  This bill will strengthen our efforts to anticipate, prevent, and mitigate genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes.  Our Foreign Service officers are often on the front lines where there is a risk or reality of atrocity crimes. H.R. 3030 will ensure they have the right training to recognize and respond to early warning signs of such crimes. This legislation will also strengthen Congressional oversight by requiring the President to annually report on what is happening on the ground, how the United States has responded, and recommendations for strengthening U.S. response. I was proud to cosponsor this bill and I commend my colleagues for supporting it.  I commend my colleague for naming this bill after the late, iconic Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel. He spoke so powerfully about the unique, persistent evil of anti-Semitism that generated the Holocaust, warning that ``the antisemite is by definition ideologically fanatic and pathologically racist . . . an antisemite is someone who has never met me, never heard of me, yet he hates me.''  Mr. Wiesel and I worked together at the historic 2004 Berlin conference of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. There 55 participating governments committed to specific, significant actions to combat anti-Semitism. They were following the parliamentary movement to get the OSCE to fully and forcefully fight anti-Semitism. That movement originated in a Helsinki Commission hearing I chaired in May 2002 and I was proud to lead this movement together with parliamentarians from Germany, the UK, and France.  In his Berlin keynote address, Mr. Wiesel said, ``We know . . . that anti-Semitism is dangerous not only to Jews but to countries too, where it is allowed to flourish . . . When a Jew is slapped in the face, humankind itself falls to ground . . . Antisemitism is rooted in hatred; its language is a language of hatred, it doctrine is filled with hatred--and hatred by its nature, always runs overboard, crossing geographical boundaries and ethnic affiliations. It is a contagious disease.''  Mr. Speaker, Mr. Wiesel also dedicated his life to the prevention of other genocides, calling for action to prevent genocides in Bosnia,Rwanda, and Sudan. Yet another genocide was committed after Sudan, this one against Christians, Yazidis, and other religious and ethnic minorities in Iraq and Syria by ISIS. The survival of these ancient communities depends on humanitarian, stabilization, and recovery assistance from the United States and other countries.  Last June this house unanimously passed H.R. 390, the Iraq and Syria Genocide Emergency Relief and Accountability Act, so that our aid reaches the genocide survivors and perpetrators are held accountable. The Senate has still not been given the opportunity to vote on this urgently needed legislation. I again call for the Senate to pass H.R. 390 now and send it to the President for his signature. This legislation will significantly strengthen the ongoing efforts of his Administration to directly help Christian and Yazidi genocide survivors at risk of extinction.  Another critical piece of legislation for which I voted in support was the Women's Entrepreneurship and Economic Empowerment Act, H.R. 5480.  Chairman Royce's Women's Entrepreneurship and Economic Empowerment Act expands, and improves upon, our previous microenterprise legislation. By way of background, the Committee on Foreign Affairs has a long history in this field, dating back at least to former chairman Ben Gilman's Microenterprise for Self-Reliance and International Anti-Corruption Act of 2000. I myself introduced the Microenterprise Results and Accountability Act of 2004, and a bill that amended the 2000 legislation, both of which became law.  In keeping with a deeper understanding of how to combat poverty and maintaining a needed focus on women, Chairman Royce's bill broadens the scope from microenterprise to include small and medium enterprises. While it is important to make sure that the very poor are not being neglected, small and medium enterprises help power development and thereby empower the poor. Thus I encouraged all to support H.R. 5480 and the House voted to pass the legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I also supported H.R. 5105, the BUILD Act.  I thank my friend and colleague, Mr. Ted Yoho of Florida, for offering this critical and visionary legislation. This legislation will modernize development finance to benefit the developing world, consistent with U.S. policy objectives.  To cite one critical component, the BUILD Act serves to counteract China's strategy in Africa, which uses development finance as a means to serve China's ends, even if that means propping up brutal dictators.  I thank Chairman Ed Royce for his leadership in guiding this legislation through the Foreign Affairs Committee, and for his responsiveness to concerns I had relayed, relating to China.  In particular, I appreciate changes made to the initial draft of this bill concerning the denominating of future loans in foreign currencies.  While the International Development Finance Corporation that this legislation would create needs to have flexibility, including issuing loans in foreign currencies, we must remember it is also the long-term geostrategic goal of China, Russia, and certain other countries to replace the dollar as the world's reserve currency.  I therefore appreciate Chairman Royce's amended text, which adds, ``Foreign currency denominated loans and guaranties should only be provided if the Board determines there is a substantive policy rationale for such loans and guaranties.''  Beyond this, however, there should be a clear policy statement on the importance and overall strategic interest in retaining the dollar as the world's reserve currency. Indeed, earlier this year, China met with central bankers from 14 African nations to discuss the viability of using China's yuan as the reserve currency for the region.  This nonetheless underscores the urgency for creating an International Development Finance Corporation, which the BUILD Act accomplishes, while underscoring the need for policy guidance that loans in foreign currencies not be used to undermine reserve dollar dominance.  I further voiced support of H.R. 4819, the DELTA Act, introduced by my friend and colleague Mr. Jeff Fortenberry of Nebraska, of which I was a cosponsor.  There is much in this bill to recommend it--from prioritizing anti-poaching and wildlife trafficking efforts in the greater Okavango River Basin, to helping preserve the majestic elephant and other endangered species, to providing sustainable livelihoods for local communities.  One other aspect of this bill which I highlighted was that it enables us to partner with, and coordinate efforts with, the countries of Botswana, Namibia and Angola.  Botswana and Namibia in particular are two countries which are often overlooked, but which have made great strides in recent years towards becoming responsible partners. Both are, in the context of Africa, good places in which to do business, and should be commended for their efforts in improving governance. Their partnership in the greater Okavango initiative underscores this trend.  Angola is a nation which, after decades of civil war followed by strongman rule, is beginning to tackle corruption under new President Joao Lourenco. While it remains to be seen how far and how quickly Angola can go toward becoming a reliable partner and a country in which to do business, its inclusion as a DELTA Act partner country is a sign of confidence in the future.  I urged my colleagues to support the DELTA Act, and it also passed the House yesterday.                          ____________________
