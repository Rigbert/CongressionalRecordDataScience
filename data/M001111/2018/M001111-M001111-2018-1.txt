 President, I ask unanimous consent that the HELP Committee be discharged from further consideration of PN 1318 and the Senate proceed to the en bloc consideration of the following nominations: PN 1318, Executive Calendar Nos. 379 and 381; and that the Senate vote on the nominations en bloc with no intervening action or debate.
