Chairman, I wish to engage the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. McDade] in colloquy.  Mr. Chairman, the first sentence of section 301 of H.R. 2203 states, ``None of the funds appropriated by this act or any prior appropriations act may be used to award a management and operating contract unless such contract is awarded using the competitive procedures.''  First, I want to congratulate the chairman of the subcommittee for the strong endorsement of awarding such contracts on a competitive basis. For far too long the Department of Energy has awarded far too many M contracts on a sole-source basis.  However, I have a concern about the second sentence of section 301, which states, ``The preceding sentence does not apply to a management and operating contract for research and development activities at a federally funded research and development center.'' My concern is that this language may send an unintended signal to the DOE that Congress is encouraging sole-source awards of M contracts for research and development activities at federally funded research and development centers rather than encouraging more competition.  While I understand that in some cases sole-source awards of such M contracts may be justified, I would like the gentleman's assurance that this language does not prohibit nor discourage the competitive awards of M contracts for R  Further, I would like to ask the gentleman from Pennsylvania if he would be willing to work with the Committee on Science to craft language that could be submitted to the conference committee that would address these concerns.  Mr. McDADE. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield?
