 President, I am pleased today to commend Mr. William N. Guertin for his election as President of the American Association of Medical Society Executives and for his 30 years of service to the medical doctors of Alameda-Contra Costa counties and his many achievements.  Mr. Guertin has been a member of the Alameda-Contra Costa Medical Association, ACCMA, since 1971, and has held two executive offices, Assistant Executive Director and Executive Director. The ACCMA serves over 3,100 doctors and is the second largest medical association in California.  Mr. Guertin's leadership supported many California doctors' efforts to help, cure, and care for people in need of support and medical help. He has worked to create programs that promote public health, quality access to care, and professional standards in California. Mr. Guertin has worked to protect physicians from impositions that would interfere with their ability to interact successfully with their patients. Mr. Guertin created the first doctor-owned professional liability insurance carrier in California, at a time when doctors were not able to obtain the insurance necessary to practice quality medicine.  The practice of medicine has long been a profession of people who devote their time and effort to helping others. Mr. Guertin has worked tirelessly for the past 30 years to facilitate the work of physicians and to enhance the quality of care for the people of Alameda-Contra Costa counties.  For these reasons, I congratulate Mr. Guertin on his new position as President of the American Association of Medical Society Executives. I am confident that Mr. Guertin will succeed in his new position and work to augment the lives of patients and physicians throughout the Nation.                          ____________________
