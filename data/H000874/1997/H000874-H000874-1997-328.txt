Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to rise today and recognize the Laurel Volunteer Rescue Squad as they prepare to celebrate their 45th anniversary on March 15 1997. The history of this rescue squad dates back to 1952 and is filled with many significant and historic accomplishments which makes Laurel home to one of the most successful and decorated rescue squads in the Nation.  Since the first ambulance service and rescue squad was formed in 1952, the citizens of Laurel have always supported the men and women who are on the front lines of public safety every day. Additionally, the rescue squad has been at the forefront of teaching and developing heavy rescue techniques for the Maryland Fire and Rescue Institute and the Prince Georges County Fire Department. However, the hard work and dedication of the rescue squad has been felt well beyond the town limits of Laurel. They have provided emergency care for five Presidents at their inaugural ceremonies and administered emergency care to Alabama Governor George Wallace after the attempted assassination in Laurel in 1972. They were also first on the scene when my good friend, Congresswoman Gladys Noon Spellman, fell ill.  Mr. Speaker, one of the greatest legacies of the Laurel Volunteer Rescue Squad has been its accomplishments in the international first aid competition arena. Dating back to 1965, both the men and women's teams have captured the world championship in first aid and rescue competition on several occasions. Last year, they surpassed all expectations, winning an unprecedented first and second place in the emergency medical technician competition.  Mr. Speaker, from the beginning, this rescue squad has excelled. They have seen a steady increase in membership, responsibility, and expertise and it is my honor to be able to recognize their many accomplishments as they celebrate their 45th anniversary. I commend the over 250 members of the Laurel Rescue Squad who embody the dedication and commitment that defines volunteer service.  John F. Kennedy once described the essence of public service as the following: ``The energy, the faith, the devotion which we bring to this endeavor will light our country and all who serve it, and the glow from that fire can truly light the world.'' I can think of no organization which embodies the values of public service and volunteerism, and which lights our country every day, more than the Laurel Volunteer Rescue Squad.  Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to rise today to congratulate the Laurel Rescue Squad on this great achievement and to wish them continued success as they serve our community and our State for many years to come.                          ____________________
