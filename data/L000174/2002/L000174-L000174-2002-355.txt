President, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this resolution to honor our Federal, State, and local law enforcement officers who gave the ultimate sacrifice for our public safety. I commend Senator Campbell for his leadership in submitting Senate Resolution 221, which recognizes May 15, 2002, as Peace Officers Memorial Day, in honor of Federal, State, and local officers killed or disabled in the line of duty.  I want to recognize the other cosponsors of this resolution: Senators Hatch, Biden, DeWine, Cantwell, Allard, Allen, Bingaman, Bunning, Cochran, Gregg, Hutchinson, Rockefeller, and Thomas.  Since my time as a State prosecutor, I have always taken a keen interest in law enforcement in Vermont and around the country. Vermont has the reputation of being one of the safest States in which to live, work and visit,and rightly so. In no small part, this is due to the hard work of those who have sworn to serve and protect us, and we should do what we can to honor them and their families.  Our Nation's law enforcement officers numbering more than 700,000 men and women--put their lives at risk in the line of duty everyday. No one knows when danger will appear and what form it will take. Unfortunately, in today's violent world, even pulling over a driver for speeding may not necessarily be ``routine.'' The events of the past year and the ensuing relentless vigilance on the part of our peace officers in guarding against further such attacks have proven this.  Guardians of the peace face more risks than ever in these times. All law enforcement officers across the Nation deserve our heartfelt respect and appreciation on Peace Officers Memorial Day.
