 3718, as modified, which the chairman said is at the desk. I will not have to ask for the amendment to be modified. This amendment has been previously debated. I have spoken on the floor twice about it. It was set aside at my request.  The amendment clarifies the relationship of the FBI to the new national intelligence director. It ensures that national intelligence programs include the FBI's intelligence activities. I had hoped that the amendment could be disposed of yesterday, but apparently that could not happen and, thus, the amendment is before us today.  I thank Senators Lieberman, Collins, Roberts, and Gregg, all of whose staff worked hard to improve the original amendment. The result is, in essence, a compromise that accomplishes our fundamental goal, which is to ensure that the intelligence functions of the Federal Bureau of Investigation are both reorganized and, secondly, effective and coordinated in the intelligence community.  The original amendment has been modified to that effect. It is my understanding that the amendment, as modified, is acceptable to both sides.
