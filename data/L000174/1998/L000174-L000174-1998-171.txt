President, I ask unanimous consent that we now recess for our policy lunches.  There being no objection, at 12:27 p.m., the Senate recessed until 2:16 p.m.; whereupon, the Senate reassembled when called to order by the Presiding Officer (Mr. Frist).  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
