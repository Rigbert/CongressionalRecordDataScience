 2087. It is pretty simple what this amendment would do, and I present it on behalf of Senator Portman and myself. It assures that homeless children have access to HUD housing.  Today, we have 1.3 million children homeless in this country. In my State, we have 310,000. The problem is getting a clear definition of an individual who is homeless. This bill would allow the appropriate authorities in a school to certify that a youngster is homeless, so we don't have a conflict between the HUD certification and the school certification. It is long overdue. I believe it will be helpful. I am very hopeful this amendment will pass with a very big vote.  I thank the Chair, and I thank Senator Portman.
