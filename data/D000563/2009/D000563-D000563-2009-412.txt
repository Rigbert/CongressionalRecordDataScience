COBURN. What I would tell my colleague is you do it routinely on the appropriations bill. So why is this any different?  My question to my colleague is: If in fact this is so important to get done today, knowing there is no money in this bill for this--my colleague would agree with that, would he not, that there is no money in this appropriations bill for this act? Is that a correct statement?
