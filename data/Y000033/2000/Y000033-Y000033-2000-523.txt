Mr. Speaker, I submit for the benefit of the Members, copies of letters between the Committee on Resources, and Tom Bliley, Chairman, Committee on Commerce, regarding the jurisdiction of S. 964.                                         House of Representatives,                                        Committee on Commerce,                                 Washington, DC, October 17, 2000.     Hon. Don Young,     Chairman, Committee on Resources,     Washington, DC.       Dear Don: I am writing with regard to S. 964, the Cheyenne      River Sioux Tribe Equitable Compensation Act. I understand      that this legislation, as considered by the House, includes      the text of S. 2439, a bill to authorize the appropriation of      funds for the construction of the Southeastern Alaska      Intertie system, and for other purposes. As you know, S. 2439      falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Committee on      Commerce pursuant to Rule X of the Rules of the House of      Representatives.       Because of the importance of this legislation, I recognize      your desire to bring it before the House in an expeditious      manner. By agreeing to waive its consideration of the bill,      however, the Committee on Commerce does not waive its      jurisdiction over S. 964. In addition, the Commerce Committee      reserves its authority to seek conferees on any provisions of      the bill that are within its jurisdiction during any House-     Senate conference that may be convened on this legislation. I      ask for your commitment to support any request by the      Commerce Committee for conferees on S. 964 or similar      legislation.       I request that you include this letter and your response as      part of the Record during consideration of the legislation on      the House floor.       Thank you for your attention to these matters.           Sincerely,                                                       Tom Bliley,                                                         Chairman.                                 ______                                                                          House of Representatives,                                       Committee on Resources,                                 Washington, DC, October 18, 2000.     Hon. Tom Bliley,     Chairman, Committee on Commerce,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter regarding the      amendments to S. 964, the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe      Equitable Compensation Act. You are correct that the      amendment to that bill includes the text of S. 2439, a bill      to authorize the appropriation of funds for the construction      of the Southeastern Alaska Intertie system, and for other      purposes. S. 2439 was referred to the Committee on Commerce.       The Alaska Intertie system is critically important to my      constituents, so I appreciate your willingness not to insist      on a referral of S. 964 so that it can be voted on by the      House of Representatives today. I agree that your forbearance      does not affect any jurisdictional interest that you would      have in S. 964 as amended, and if a conference on the bill      becomes necessary, I would support your request to have the      Committee on Commerce be represented on the conference      committee.       Thank you again for your cooperation on this matter and on      many others during my service as Chairman of the Committee on      Resources. It has been a privilege and a pleasure working      with you and your staff these last six years.           Sincerely,                                                        Don Young,                                                         Chairman.                               ____________________
