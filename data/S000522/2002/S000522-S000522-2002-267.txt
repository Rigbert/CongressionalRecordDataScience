Mr. Speaker, as Chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, today I am introducing on behalf of Mr. Evans, Mr. Simpson, Mr. Reyes, Mr. Filner, Mr. Baker, Mr. Pickering, Mr. Shows, Mr. King, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Baldacci, Ms. Carson, Mr. Reynolds, and Mr. Moore, a bill to increase funding, for State Approving Agencies (SAAs).  Some of my colleagues are familiar with the work of SAAS, but for those who are not, these vital institutions review and evaluate for approval in each state, programs of education that are offered by educational institutions under the Montgomery GI Bill and three other VA veterans' educational assistance programs. SAAs usually operate through state departments of education or postsecondary education commissions. SAAs also approve employer sponsored on-job training and apprenticeship programs, some through state departments of labor.  The need to increase funding for SAAs primarily reflects the new SAA duties in occupational licensing and credentialing and veteran, servicemember and employer outreach in each state.  In recent years, Congress has increased SAA responsibilities, most recently through enactment of Public Law 107-103, the Veterans Education and Benefits Expansion Act of 2001. This landmark legislation increased the basic MGIB benefit by 19 percent in January 2002 to $800 per month from $672. It will also increase 30 percent in October 2003 and 39 percent in October 2004 when the benefit again increases to $900 and $985, respectively.  But as important as these enacted increases for the MGIB benefits are, our veterans will not be able to take full advantage of the improved educational opportunities unless the SAAs are given the resources necessary to certify high-quality educational programs.  From fiscal years 1995 to 2000, SAA funding was ``capped''--without an annual increase--at $13 million. In Public Law 106-419, enacted on November 1, 2000, Congress increased SAA funding to $14 million, but only for fiscal years 2001 and 2002. If Congress does not act, in fiscal year 2003 the SAA budget reverts back to the $13 million level. In effect, our inaction would return SAAs to the FY 1995 funding level, and they would be unable to guarantee our nation's veterans that their hard-earned MGIB benefits will be safeguarded against scam-artists and flimsy programs that seek to exploit veterans.  Indeed, since World War II Congress has relied on SAAs to ensure the quality of the education and training offered to our Nation's veterans and to protect the integrity of VA education programs popularly known as the ``GI Bill.'' My proposal simply increases SAA annual funding from $14 million to $18 million, with a three percent increase the following two years, in order to provide SAAs with the resources necessary to fulfill their responsibilities.  I strongly urge my colleagues to support this legislation.                          ____________________
