 Durbin, the Senator from Illinois, for his good work in this area. He has recognized this as a very important issue and has done something about it. Whether it is Sallie Mae or anybody else, what we are interested in is all the reporting we can get that would affect someone's credit. I again commend Senator Durbin for the work he has done. I am sure he will follow up and make sure this is part of the law.
