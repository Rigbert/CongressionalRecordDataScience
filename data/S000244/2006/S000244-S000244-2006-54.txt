Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1458, a bill to require any Federal or State court to recognize any notarization made by a notary public licensed by a State other than the State where the court is located.  A notary public administers oaths and serves as an impartial witness when certain documents are signed. Many States require these documents, such as affidavits, deeds, and powers of attorney, be notarized before they can become legally binding on parties. Since the point of legal notarization is to deter fraud, a notary must positively identify the signatory to a document and ensure that he or she signs the document knowingly and willingly.  Notaries are currently licensed by individual States. However, legal disputes are not always confined to the geographic and judicial domain of a single State. The bill ensures that lawfully notarized documents from one State are also acknowledged by sister States in interstate commerce. The bill also clarifies standards by which electronic seals are to be recognized. This is especially important as more lawyers and business people notarize documents electronically.  I emphasize that H.R. 1458 does not conflict with the 10th amendment's defense of States' rights. In fact, the bill promotes States' rights through its compatibility with the full faith and credit clause of article IV of the Constitution.  The bill address an obscure but important subject in the legal and business realms, and I urge my colleagues to support it.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
