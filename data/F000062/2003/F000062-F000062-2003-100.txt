 President, I rise today to give the Senate an update on the wildfires sweeping across Southern California--as the Senate continues to debate legislation to change our Nation's forest policy.  The situation in my State is at a critical juncture. If the weather continues to improve--as it is expected--then firefighters may be able to get a handle on the fires which continue to burn. This would be good news indeed.  I would also like to report that FEMA will shortly be announcing 6permanent field sites where victims of the fire can go for assistance and 4 additional mobile sites.  It is critical that the FEMA centers get opened as soon as possible--so that the help gets where it is needed most.  There are nine large fires currently raging in the State--all of which have caused considerable damage.  In total, these fires have burned over 650,000 acres--about the size of Rhode Island. Twenty people have been killed. This includes a firefighter from Marin County who was killed by a fast moving wall of fire associated with the Cedar fire. Twenty-four hundred homes have been lost in five counties, and thousands more structures have been burned.  There are some 13,000 firefighters waging a battle against the fires. True to form, these firefighters have given everything they have to put out the fires and are exhausted.  Our thoughts and our prayers go out to these men and women--and to the family of the firefighter who died--we know that these firefighters are doing everything possible to save lives, homes, and private property.  Let me now go through some of the fires to let you know what is happening.  The Cedar Fire in San Diego has become the largest wildfire in California history. It has burned 250,000 acres--and 6 days old, it is only 15 percent contained. Thus far, 22 injuries have been reported as a result of this fire, and 7 civilian fatalities confirmed by the San Diego Sheriff's Department. Additionally, 1,300 Structures have been destroyed.  The fire has destroyed 90 percent of the town of Cuyamaca, and today, it threatens the communities of Pine Hills, Mt. Laguna, Ramona and Julian. Plans to aggressively protect the historic town of Julian are in place. Overnight, 300 structures were destroyed in Cuyamaca and Harrison.  The Old Fire in San Bernardino is also burning out of control and continues to pose a major threat to Lake Arrowhead, Big Bear, and other mountain communities. This fire also began 6 days ago. It has consumed 60,000 acres thus far and is only 10 percent contained.  Massive resources have been expended to fight this fire, including 2,175 firefighters, 10 helicopters, 40 fire crews, 280 engines, and 7 air tankers.  There have been three injuries to date and two civilian deaths. Conservative estimates suggest that 550 residential structures and 10 commercial structures have been destroyed. But this is just the tip of the iceberg.  There are 50,000-60,000 homes and 2,000 commercial properties in the area threatened by this fire. More than 50,000 people have been evacuated from communities like Lake Arrowhead and Big Bear. Firefighters are doing what they can to protect these communities from going up in flames, but this is difficult because of the thousands of trees killed by the Bark Beetle, which have become kindling in this fire.  The Grand Prix fires also continues to rage in San Bernardino, near the community of Fontana. This fire has consumed 70,000 acres, destroyed 60 residences and 60 other structures, and has resulted in 27 injuries. This fire began 10 days ago, and is 40 percent contained. Today, 1,600 firefighters, 12 helicopters, 42 fire crews, 159 engines, and 30 bull dozers are committed to this fire.  It is hoped that weather conditions will allow firefighters to get better control of this fire today.  Moving North, the Simi fire threatens the community of Stevenson Ranch. The good news with this fire is that it did not move into the canyons and cut a path toward Malibu. But when the wind shifted, the fire turned toward a sub-development on the northern end of Los Angeles County.  This fire has consumed 105,560 acres and destroyed 16 structures and 64 other buildings. Thus far, there have been 5 injuries as a result of this fire, and the fire is only 35 percent contained.  Now, firefighters are trying to keep this fire away from homes and have thus far been successful. Today is a critical day for this fire. Cooler temperatures may allow a fire line to be completed along Potero Canyon, and this would go a long way toward bringing this fire under control.  Like the other fires, massive resources have been deployed to fight this fire, including: 1,389 firefighters, 9 helicopters, 236 engines, 6 air tankers, and 27 bulldozers.  The Piru fire continues to burn in Ventura county, near the community of Fillmore.  Thus far, 62,000 acres have been consumed, and the fire is only 30 percent contained.  The fire began a week ago, has caused 20 injures and destoyed 8 structures.  But this fire remains dangerous. The fire is moving towards fuel-laden areas in the Los Padres National Forest, and we have to watch this one closely.  The Padua fire--near Claremont, CA--is smaller than the other ones, but it has caused considerable damage nonetheless.  Latest reports show that it has burned almost 10,000 acres, and the good news is that it is 50 percent contained.  This fire has caused 15 injuries, destroyed 59 structures, and threatens 500 homes in the community of Mt. Baldy.  The resources directed at this fire include 691 firefighters, 17 fire crews, 80 engines, and 4 bulldozers.  Some good news from the Whitmore fire, near Shasta, CA.  This fire which has burned approximately 1,000 acres is 80 percent contained. There have been no injuries as a result of this fire, and it is expected to be contained today.  It is my great hope that this happens.  Good news also with the Tuk Fire, 10 miles east of Orick, CA, south of Crescent City.  This fire has burned only 315 acres and is 80 percent contained. Officals are hoping that this fire will be fully contained today as well.  The mountain fire, which burned just under 10,000 acres in Riverside, CA, has been 100 percent contained.  Fire officials will continue to complete burnout operation in near the fire edge, and pending favorable weather, should be completed soon.  This fire was serious--it caused 6 injuries and 61 structures.  Fire crews and equipment are coming in from other States. The governor of New Mexico has offered equipment, and I understand that other States have offered help as well.  As crews become weary and fatigued, it will be increasingly important to get reinforcements from other States--and I will do what I can to make sure this happens.  In terms of victim assistance, help is on its way. As I mentioned, FEMA will be establishing four permanent centers in affected communities, and four mobile centers.  Additionally, if any Californian needs help, they can call my San Diego or Los Angeles office, and we will do anything we can to ensure that they get the appropriate assistance.  This is a terrible time for Californians, but in times of crisis, people pull together and do what they can to help one another.  It is my hope that these fires can be quickly contained--with limited casualties and loss of property.  This event has truly been a wake up call, and I hope that we learn how critical it is to manage our lands, to ensure that catastrophic fires like these can be prevented.                          ____________________
