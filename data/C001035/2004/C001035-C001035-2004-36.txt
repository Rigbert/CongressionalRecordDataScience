President, I also want to list the conferees on this bill. Contrary, perhaps, to the implications of what we have just heard, this was an extraordinarily open conference, where Democrats and Republicans negotiated side by side in every single meeting. It was a bipartisan effort.  Senators Lott, Roberts, Voinovich, Coleman, Sununu, DeWine, Levin, Rockefeller, Durbin, Graham of Florida, and Senator Lautenberg were the Senate conferees on this important bill. I thank each of them personally for how hard they worked. Each of them contributed greatly to the final product, and I am very grateful for their support.  I wish to also respond to the concept that somehow this issue was rushed.
