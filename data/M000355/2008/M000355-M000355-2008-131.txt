 President, the majority leader just made a very strong argument for why this issue he is talking about should not be put off until next year. But the issue before us now is what to do immediately. We have been on the issue of energy for a week. It is time to stay on it and finish the job.  The majority leader, not the minority, determines what the schedule is. If the so-called Coburn bill is so important, I am sure the majority leader will turn back to it soon. But the issue is staying on the No. 1 concern in the country now and finishing the job. The majority leader, who controls the schedule, has it perfectly within his power not to delay this bill until later. In fact, this bill could have been done sooner than now--sooner than now. The issue today is whether we stay on the No. 1 issue in the country and finish the job. I recommend that we do that.
