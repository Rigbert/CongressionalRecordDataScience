President, first of all, let me just say that on February 2, I was in Guantanamo Bay. It was one of several trips I have made down there. I wish to suggest that one of the trips I made was right after 9/11. At that time, I did quite a bit of research to try to understand why people have this obsession about closing Guantanamo. I looked at the resources down there, and I couldn't figure it out. That was several years ago. Now, as recently as 2 months ago, I still have a hard time figuring that out.  I wish to suggest to my colleagues--and I have been listening to some of those who are objecting to the action we are about to take today--there cannot be a case at all that there are human rights abuses in Guantanamo Bay.  Eric Holder, the new Attorney General, went down there just a short while ago. He came back, and he witnessed the same thing I did--he was down there about the same time--that during the recent visit, the military detention facilities at Gitmo meet the highest international standards and are in conformity with article 3 of the Geneva Convention.
