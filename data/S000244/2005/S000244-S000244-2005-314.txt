Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I offer this manager's amendment to clarify that offenders who attempt to murder or conspire to murder a Federal judge, Federal law enforcement officer, or a federally funded public safety officer are subject to a penalty of life imprisonment. If death results, the death penalty can be applied to offenders who are principals.  In addition, the amendment adds Indian tribes as eligible entities for court security grants in section 18 of the bill.  Finally, the amendment clarifies the language as to the coordination between the Marshals Service and the Administrative Office on security issues. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment to this important bill.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
