Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Someone watching this debate and they hear the nice words between the two of us, they are, for sure, very genuine. We had many hand-holding scenes and meetings over the last number of months.  I am a cosponsor of H.R. 3919, and I want to thank the gentleman from Massachusetts for allowing our thoughtful and constructive input into this process because clearly I think we ended up with a good piece of legislation. And I commend the gentleman's patience on our side as we were able to work out a consensus that, in fact, has brought us to the floor this afternoon.  I also want to thank Chairman Dingell and Mr. Barton for working with all of us to ensure that the bill was able to move forward in a bipartisan way. And Mr. Whitfield, who I remember at our first hearing on this as he talked about Connect Kentucky and the positive impact that it had there. He obviously added some good things as well to legislation. And I would urge all of my colleagues to support the legislation as it moves through this process.  I view the thrust of this legislation as an effort to get a better idea of the U.S. broadband penetration, not as a window to increased regulation of the already competitive broadband marketplace.  We were quite fortunate to learn from the successful statewide broadband mapping plan in Kentucky called Connect Kentucky. And it isn't often that we have the advantage of looking at a successful model such as this one, which could implement in a bipartisan way again there on a national level what we're able to do on this legislation in H.R. 3919.  Connect Kentucky demonstrated perfectly how a public/private partnership can work with industry in a nonregulatory manner that benefits not only consumers, but also provides a catalyst to greater broadband investments.  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
