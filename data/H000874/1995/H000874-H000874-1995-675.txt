Speaker, I rise today to express my concern about the proposed cuts in the commerce, state, justice, and related agencies appropriations bill for fiscal year 1996 as it relates to educational and cultural exchange programs within the United States Information Agency.   As a member of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, I have witnessed first-hand the importance of people-to-people exchanges. They are instrumental in promoting our country and the democratic ideals that make our country great.  In addition, like many Members of this House, both Republican and Democrat alike, I, too, have been a part of a citizens exchange program. The American council of young political leaders, one of the recipients of USIA funding, was formed nearly 30 years ago as a non-profit bi-partisan educational exchange organization to enhance foreign policy understanding and exposure among rising young American political leaders and their counterparts around the world.  Since its establishment, Mr. Speaker, more than 3,000 political leaders from the United States and 2,000 foreign delegates have participated in some 500 governmental and business exchanges with their counterparts in more than 70 countries. The ACYPL's efforts are a key component of not only our exchange programs but in fostering better relations and understandings between nations. I am only sorry that programs such as ACYPL's may be at risk as a result of these proposed cuts in educational and exchange programs.                          ____________________
