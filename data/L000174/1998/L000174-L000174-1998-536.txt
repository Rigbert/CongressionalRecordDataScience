President, it has been almost twenty years since the overthrow of the Shah of Iran and the year-long ordeal of the American hostages in Tehran. The U.S. swiftly responded to those incidents by isolating Iran diplomatically, militarily, and economically. Today our policy of isolation continues.  The U.S. has legitimate, serious concerns about the Iranian Government's support for international terrorism, its efforts to undermine the Arab-Israeli peace process, and its acquisition of weapons of mass destruction. We must continue to vigorously pressure Iran to modify its conduct in each of these areas.  However, rather than adhere blindly to all aspects of a policy that was conceived in response to events in 1979, it is time to reevaluate our relationship with Iran and its people and consider the advantages that might result from a more open dialogue.  Too often our antagonism toward Iran obscures the fact that many Iranian citizens desire better relations with the United States. On January 7, 1998 Iranian President Mohammad Khatemi said in an interview with CNN that he wanted people-to-people exchanges to ``crack the wall of mistrust'' between the United States and Iran. A December 10, 1997 article in the ``International Herald Tribune'' by Ms. Catherine O'Neill, who recently visited Iran on behalf of UNICEF, entitled, ``Tough, Smart Women, Working to Better Iran,'' illustrates that there are many similarities between us and the Iranian people and that citizens of both countries could benefit from the regular sharing of ideas and academic and professional advances if only the opportunity were there.  Mr. President, I ask that excerpts from Ms. O'Neill's article be printed in the Record.  The excerpts follow:                [From the Herald Tribune, Dec. 10, 1997]               Tough, Smart Women, Working to Better Iran                         (By Catherine O'Neill)       Tehran.--Somehow I had always felt that women who adopted      the chador had shut me out. That black cloak seemed a way of      saying: ``Don't approach! My values are different.''       A recent visit to Iran has proved how wrong I was. It also      has taught me something about not imposing my values on      tough, smart women who are working to make changes in their      country.       At the invitation of Unicef, I went to Tehran to attend a      conference on the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.      The conference was organized by a group of Iranian women who      want to change some of Iran's laws affecting children and      women.       Almost no non-Iranians were present in the hotel ballroom      as several hundred chador-clad women, and some men,      discussed, debated and criticized aspects of Iran's laws.       One speaker criticized Iranian companies that profit from      cheap child labor.       Another talked about the illogic of a 30-year-old woman      professor's being unable to choose a spouse without the      approval of a father or grandfather--while a 15-year-old boy      needs no approval to get married.       Speakers noted Iran's effective village health care      programs, universal immunization for children and the high      percentage of girls and boys attending school.       But the speakers wanted more for Iran's children and women.       During breaks, women approached me to talk. They were      doctors, lawyers, teachers, psychologists, professors, child      education experts and mothers. We cared about the same      things: drug abuse among young people, child custody issues,      child abuse, juvenile delinquency, homeless children, foster      care and child labor.       My experiences in Iran should not be so rare for Americans.      A new generation has arrived and almost two decades have      passed since the hostage crisis of 1979-80. The United States      is the only major power with no contact with Iran. But the      Iranian people have given a signal: They voted in a new      president against the recommendations of their religious      leaders.       It's time for us in the United States to reach out to the      70 million children, men and women in Iran, who, I've found,      have much in common with us.                          ____________________
