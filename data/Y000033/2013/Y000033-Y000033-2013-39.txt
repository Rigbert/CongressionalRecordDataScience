I thank the gentleman for yielding. I rise to thank my good friend and chairman of the House Armed Services Committee for including my amendment on section 811 of the fiscal year 2010 National Defense Authorization Act in one of today's en bloc packages and to ask if he is concerned, as I am, that implementation by Federal agencies of section 811 of the FY10 National Defense Authorization Act has been inconsistent and contrary to the congressional intent.  Mr. McKEON. Will the gentleman yield?
