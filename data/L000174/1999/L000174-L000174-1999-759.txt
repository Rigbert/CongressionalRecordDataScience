President, I am proud to join Senator Moynihan as an original cosponsor of the Fairness for Legal Immigrants Act of 1999. This bill takes the next, important step toward restoring benefits to legal immigrants.  Legal immigrants are people in our communities who are in this country legally. They pay taxes and they contribute to our economy and society. Many of our parents, or grandparents, were legal immigrants themselves. The 1996 welfare reform law forced this group to lose their eligibility for various programs, including food stamps, Medicaid and SSI. More than 900,000 legal immigrants--including hundreds of thousands of children and elderly individuals--were cut from the Food Stamp Program alone, with nothing to abate their hunger.  In the years since the passage of the welfare reform act, Congress has correctly realized that many of the cuts went too far, and slowly benefits are being restored. For instance, the 1997 Balanced Budget Act restored SSI and Medicaid benefits to a narrow class of immigrants, refugees and asylees.  Last Congress, I worked hard to include $818 million in the Agricultural Research, Extension, and Education Reauthorization Act to restore food stamp benefits for thousands of legal immigrants. This legislation restored food stamps to legal immigrants who are disabled or elderly, or who later become disabled, and who resided in the United States prior to August 22, 1996. That law also increased food stamp eligibility time limits--from 5 years to 7 years--for refugees and asylees who came to this country to avoid persecution. Hmong refugees who aided U.S. military efforts in Southeast Asia were also covered, as were children residing in the United States prior to August 22, 1996.  Though the Agriculture Research Act restored food stamp eligibility to children of legal immigrants, many of these children are not receiving food stamps and are experiencing alarming instances of hunger. In its recent report entitled ``Who is Leaving the Food Stamp Program? An Analysis of Caseload Changes from 1994 to 1997,'' the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported that participation among children living with parents who are legal immigrants fell significantly faster than children living with native-born parents. It appears that restrictions on adult legal immigrants deterred the participation of their children. That is a disturbing development that must be rectified, and the legislation we are introducing today would go a long way toward making the situation right by restoring food stamp eligibility to all legal immigrants.  The Fairness for Legal Immigrants Act of 1999 would also address the medical needs of legal immigrants. This bill will permit states to offer Medicaid coverage to all eligible legal immigrant pregnant women and children, as well as certain ``medically needy'' disabled legal immigrants. This legislation would also restore SSI eligibility to elderly and poor legal immigrants who were in this country prior to passage of the welfare reform law.  Under current law, legal immigrants who suffer from domestic or elder abuse must wait 5 years to receive Medicaid, TANF, SSI and food stamp benefits if they entered the United States after August 1996. The Fairness for Legal Immigrants Act of 1999 would amend this law so that these victims would not have to wait to receive assistance.  I am proud to cosponsor the Fairness for Legal Immigrants Act of 1999. It is a needed bill that will help fill some of the continuing gaps left by the welfare reform law. I look forward to working with Senator Moynihan and all members of the Senate to restore Medicaid, SSI, and food stamp benefits to legal immigrants in need.                                 ______                                       By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Frist, Mr. Burns,         and Mr. Breaux):  S. 795. A bill to amend the Fastener Quality Act to strengthen the protection against the sale of mismarked, misrepresented, and counterfeit fasteners and eliminate unnecessary requirements, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.            the fastener quality act amendments act of 1999  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Fastener Quality Act Amendments Act of 1999. This bill represents major revisions to the original Fastener Quality Act as passed in 1990.  Every year billions of special high-strength bolts, screws, and other fasteners are sold in the United States which carry grade identification markings. The markings indicate that the fasteners conform to specifications set by consensus standards organizations. These grade-marked fasteners are used in critical applications like aircraft, automobiles, and highway bridges where failure of a fastener could jeopardize public safety.  In 1998, the Congress passed legislation (P.L. 105-234) delaying implementation of the Fastener Quality Act to allow the Secretary of Commerce to conduct a review of changes in fastener manufacturing processes and the existence of other regulatory programs covering fasteners. The review was submitted to the Congress on February 24, 1999, in coordination with several other Federal agencies which have public safety responsibilities including the Defense Industrial Supply Center, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration, and National Aeronautics and Space Administration.  This bill reflects the findings and recommendations of that report. The bill's content further represents discussions between both the Senate Commerce Committee and the House Science Committee, the Department of Commerce, and private industry representatives. Mr. President, let me note that if these revisions to the Fastener Quality Act are not implemented into law by June 24 of this year, the Secretary of Commerce will have no other choice but to implement the Act as originally passed in 1990. Therefore, several of the nation's key industries may be brought to a halt due to lack of certified fasteners. The impact of such a slow down would be disastrous both economically and in terms of continuous flow of products and services to maintain our current way of life.  The bill defines fasteners as ``a metallic screw, nut, bolt, or stud having internal or external threads, with a nominal diameter of one-fourth inch or greater, or a load-indicating washer, that is through-hardened or represented as meeting through-hardening, and that is grade identification marked or represented as meeting a consensus standard that requires grade identification marking.'' This definition substantially reduces the scope of covered fasteners under the Act.  The bill also establishes a hotline in which the public may notify the Department of Commerce of alleged violations of the Fastener Quality Act. It requires record keeping for a period of five years, instead of the previous ten years, via both traditional and electronic means.  To address current inventory concerns, the Act will be applicable only to fasteners fabricated 180 days after the enactment of this bill.  Furthermore, in cases of fasteners manufactured to a consensus standard or standards that require end-of-line testing, the testing is to be performed by an accredited laboratory. This accredited laboratory requirement shall not take effect until two years after enactment of this Act.  Therefore, I, along with my co-sponsors, urge the members of this body to support this bill and to provide the needed legislation which will allow several key industries in this country continuous operation in a safe and responsible manner.                                 ______                                       By
