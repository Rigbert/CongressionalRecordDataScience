President, I want to invite all Members to cosponsor legislation with me which will eliminate illegal trafficking in food stamp coupons by converting to electronic benefit transfer, often called EBT, systems. I may offer this bill as an amendment to welfare reform or as an amendment to the farm bill or the Reconciliation Act.  Under President Bush, USDA noted that ``the potential savings are enormous'' if EBT is used in the Food Stamp Program.  The bill is designed to save the States money. Issuing coupons is expensive to States. Some States mail coupons monthly and pay postage for which they receive only a partial Federal reimbursement. When coupons are lost or stolen in the mail, States are liable for some losses.  It also saves State money by requiring that USDA pay for purchasing EBT card readers to be put in stores. Under current law, States pay half those costs.  Some States issue coupons at State offices, which involves labor costs. Under the bill, USDA pays for the costs of the cards and recipients are responsible for replacements and much of the losses. The bill does not allow the Secretary of Agriculture to impose liability on States except for their own negligence or fraud, as under current law. Other welfare reform proposals allow the Secretary to impose liability on States consistent with this administration's views on regulation E. I disagree with that policy.  The Federal EBT task force estimates that the bill will also save Federal taxpayers around $400 million over the next 10 years.  Under current law, States are required to use coupons, with some exceptions. About 2.5 billion coupons per year are printed, mailed, shipped, issued to participants, counted, canceled, redeemed through the banking system by Treasury, shipped again, stored, and then destroyed. That cost can reach $60 million per year in Federal and State costs. Printing coupons alone costs USDA $35 million a year.  EBT does not just cut State and Federal costs. The inspector general of USDA testified that EBT ``can be a powerful weapon to improve detection of trafficking and provide evidence leading to the prosecution of traffickers.''  The special agent in charge of the financial crimes division of the U.S. Secret Service testified that ``the EBT system is a great advancement generally because it puts an audit trail relative to the user and the retail merchant.''  Another Bush administration report determined that EBT promises ``a variety of Food Stamp Program improvements * * *. Program vulnerabilities to certain kinds of benefit loss and diversion can be reduced directly by EBT system features * * * [EBT] should facilitate investigation and prosecution of food stamp fraud.''  A more recent Office of Technology Assessment [OTA] report determined that a national EBT system might reduce food stamp fraud losses and benefit diversion by as much as 80 percent.  The bill is based on meetings with the U.S. Secret Service, the inspector general of USDA, the National Governors Association, the American Public Welfare Association, Consumers Union, the OTA, the Federal EBT task force, and the affected industries, and a full committee hearing last session of the Senate Agriculture Committee.  Perhaps nothing is totally fraud-proof, but EBT is clearly much better than the current system of paper coupons, and EBT under my bill will cut State costs. Let us be bold.  Under current law, 2.5 billion coupons are used once and then canceled--except for $1 coupons which may be used to make change. Would we consider it cost-efficient if all $5 bills, for example, could only be used once, then stored and destroyed?  EBT has an added benefit--it eliminates cash change. Under current law, food stamp recipients get cash change in food stamp transactions if the cash does not exceed $1 per purchase. That cash can be used for anything.  In conclusion, I am convinced that the single most important thing we can do to reduce fraud and State costs is to eliminate the use of coupons. I hope you will join with me in this effort.  The following is the summary of my EBT bill.  The bill alters the Food Stamp Act and requires that the Secretary of Agriculture no longer provide food stamp coupons to States within 3 years of enactment. In general, under current law States are required to use a coupon system.  Any Governor may grant his or her State an additional 2-year extension, and the Secretary can add another 6-month extension for a maximum of 5\1/2\ years.  At the end of that time period, coupons will no longer be provided to the State. Food benefits instead will be provided through electronic benefits transfer [EBT] or in the form of cash if authorized by the Food Stamp Act--for example, under a bill reported out the Senate Agriculture Committee by Senator Lugar on June 14, 1995, States can cash out food stamp benefits as part of a wage supplementation program.  The bill is designed to piggy-back onto the current expansion of point-of-sale terminals found in many stores. The bill requires that stores, financial institutions and States take the lead in the conversion to EBT.  Under current law, States must pay for half the costs of the point-of-sale equipment put in stores, but USDA pays for 100 percent of the costs of printing coupons. Under Senator Leahy's bill, USDA will pay for 100 percent of those equipment costs, and USDA will pay for 100 percent of the costs of the EBT cards.  My bill provides that regulation E will not apply to food stamp EBT transactions. Generally speaking, regulation E provides that credit card or debit card users are liable only up to the first $50 in unauthorized uses of lost or stolen debit cards--as long as such a loss is reported in a timely manner.  Under current law the State is considered the card issuer for food stamp EBT purposes. Regulation E has been a major impediment to implementation of EBT by States because States are liable for household fraud and nonhousehold member fraud.  While the risks are much lower for the Food Stamp Program than for debit cards--since EBT food cards only contain the balance of the unused food benefits rather than access to a bank account or a credit line, States are still worried about liability and oppose the application of regulation E rules.  Under my bill, USDA and the Federal Reserve Board are precluded from making States liable for losses associated with lost or stolen EBT cards--unless due to State fraud or negligence as under current law for coupons.  Under other welfare reform bills in the House and Senate, the Secretary of Agriculture would be allowed to impose additional liabilities on States for errors that should be charged to the recipient. For example, the Secretary could impose regulation E-type liabilities on States--although under these bills the Federal Reserve Board would be barred from imposing those liabilities.  The bill specifically makes households liable for most EBT losses: however, they are not liable for losses after they report the loss or theft of the EBT card.  As under current law, States are liable for their own fraud and negligence losses.  The bill also provides that each recipient will be given a personal code number [PIN] to help prevent unauthorized use of the card.  Most of the liability provisions, unlike those in other welfare reform proposals, are based on the May 11, 1992, EBT steering committee report under the Bush administration which represents an outstanding analysis of the liability issue.  Under the bill, food stamp families will have to pay for replacement cards. However, once reported as lost or stolen, the old card will be voided, and a new card will be issued with the balance remaining.  The card holder will be responsible for any unauthorized purchases made between the time of loss and the household's reporting of the lost or stolen card. The card cannot be used without the PIN number. Households will be able to obtain transaction records, upon request, from the benefit issuer and that issuer will have to establish error resolution procedures as recommended by the 1992 EBT steering committee report.  Under the bill, USDA will no longer have to pay for the costs of printing, issuing, distributing, mailing and redeeming paper coupons--this costs between $50 million and $60 million a year.  Under the bill, in an effort to reduce the costs of implementing a nationwide EBT system, States and stores will look at the best way to maximize the use of existing point-of-sale terminals. They will follow technology, rather than lead technology.  The Federal EBT task force estimated that Federal costs could be reduced by $400 million under the proposed bill. I do not have an official CBO estimate yet.  Many stores now use or in the process of adding point-of-sale terminals which allow them to accept debit and credit cards. These systems can also be used for EBT.  Stores which choose not to invest in their own systems will receive reimbursements for point-of-sale card readers. USDA will pay for those costs.  If the store decides at a later date that it needs a commercial--debit or credit card--reader, the store will have to bear all the costs. In very rural areas, or in other situations such as house-to-house trade routes or farmers' markets, manual systems will be used and USDA will pay 100 percent of the costs of the equipment.  It is planned that this restriction--only Federal and State program readers paid for, with the upgrade at store expense--will encourage the largest possible number of stores to invest in their own point-of-sale equipment.  To the extent needed to cover costs of conversion to EBT, the Secretary is authorized to charge a transaction fee of up to 2 cents per EBT transaction--taken out of benefits. This provision is temporary. Households receiving the maximum benefit level--for that household size--may be charged a lower per transaction fee than other households.  While it is unfortunate that recipients have to be charged this fee they are much, much better off under an EBT system. In studies conducted regarding EBT projects participants have strongly supported its application.  In implementing the bill, the Secretary is required to consult with States, retail stores, the financial industry, the Federal EBT task force, the inspector general of USDA, the U.S. Secret Service, the National Governors Association, the Food Marketing Institute, and others.  In designing the bill we met with the Director of the Maryland EBT System, they have Statewide food stamp EBT, the National Governors Association, American Public Welfare Association, the Federal EBT task force, USDA Food and Consumer Services, Office of the inspector general of USDA, Food Marketing Institute, U.S. Secret Service, OMB, Treasury, Consumers Union, Public Voice for Food and Health Policy, the American Bankers Association, and representatives of retail stores.  I want to again invite each of you to cosponsor this legislation.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1114       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; REFERENCES.       (a) In General.--This Act may be cited as the ``Food Stamp      Fraud Reduction Act of 1995''.       (b) References.--Except as otherwise expressly provided,      wherever in this title an amendment or repeal is expressed in      terms of an amendment to, or repeal of, a section or other      provision, the reference shall be considered to be made to a      section or other provision of the Food Stamp Act of 1977 (7      U.S.C. 2011 et seq.).     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds that--       (1) Roger Viadero, Inspector General of the United States      Department of Agriculture (USDA), testified before Congress      on February 1, 1995, that: ``For many years we have supported      the implementation of the Electronic Benefits Transfer,      commonly called EBT, of food stamp benefits as an alternative      to paper coupons....EBT also provides a useful tool in      identifying potential retail store violators. EBT-generated      records have enabled us to better monitor and analyze sales      and benefit activity at authorized retailers....[I]t can be a      powerful weapon to improve detection of trafficking and      provide evidence leading to the prosecution of      traffickers.'';       (2) Robert Rasor, United States Secret Service, Special      Agent in Charge of Financial Crimes Division, testified      before Congress on February 1, 1995, that: ``The EBT system      is a great advancement generally because it puts an audit      trail relative to the user and the retail merchant.'';       (3) Allan Greenspan, Chairman of the Board of Governors,      Federal Reserve System, has noted the ``importance of EBT for      the food stamp program, and the potential advantages offered      by EBT to government benefit program agencies, benefit      recipients, and food retailers. (Indeed, EBT also would help      reduce costs in the food stamp processing operations of the      Federal Reserve System.)'';       (4) the Bush Administration strongly supported EBT for the      food stamp program, including 1 report that noted ``The      potential savings are enormous.'';       (5) in February 1991, a USDA publication noted that      Secretary Yeutter proposed EBT as an element of the      ``Department's strategy to reduce food stamp loss, theft, and      trafficking.'';       (6) in March 1992, USDA noted: ``EBT reduces program      vulnerability to some kinds of benefit diversion and provides      an audit trail that facilitates efficient investigation and      successful prosecution of fraudulent activity....Benefit      diversions estimated for an EBT system are almost 80 percent      less.'';       (7) in tests of EBT systems, USDA reported during the Bush      Administration that: ``EBT also introduces new security      features that reduce the chance for unauthorized use of one's      benefits as a result of loss or theft....[R]etailer response      to actual EBT operations is very positive in all operational      EBT projects.'';       (8) retail stores, the financial services industry, and the      States should take the lead in converting from food stamp      coupons to an electronic benefits transfer system;       (9) in the findings of the report entitled ``Making      Government Work'' regarding the electronic benefits transfer      of food stamps and other government benefits, the Office of      Technology Assessment found that--       (A) by eliminating cash change and more readily identifying      those who illegally traffic in benefits, a nationwide      electronic benefits transfer system might reduce levels of      food stamp benefit diversion by as much as 80 percent;       (B) with use of proper security protections, electronic      benefits transfer is likely to reduce theft and fraud, as      well as reduce errors, paperwork, delays, and the stigma      attached to food stamp coupons;       (C) electronic benefits transfer can yield significant cost      savings to retailers, recipients, financial institutions, and      government agencies; and       (D) recipients, retailers, financial institutions, and      local program administrators who have tried electronic      benefits transfer prefer electronic benefits transfer to      coupons;       (10) the food stamp program prints more than 375,000,000      food stamp booklets per year, including 2,500,000,000 paper      coupons;       (11) food stamp coupons (except for $1 coupons) are used      once, and each 1 of the over 2,500,000,000 coupons per year      is then counted, canceled, shipped, redeemed through the      banking system by 10,000 commercial banks, 32 local Federal      reserve banks, and the Secretary of the Treasury, stored, and      destroyed;       (12) food stamp recipients can receive cash change in food      stamp transactions if the cash does not exceed $1 per      purchase; and       (13) the printing, distribution, handling, and redemption      of coupons costs at least $60,000,000 per year.     SEC. 3. ELIMINATION OF FOOD STAMP COUPONS.       Section 4 (7 U.S.C. 2013) is amended by adding at the end      the following:       ``(d) Elimination of Food Stamp Coupons.--       ``(1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2) and      notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, effective      beginning on the date that is 3 years after the date of      enactment of this subsection, the Secretary shall not provide      any food stamp coupons to a State.       ``(2) Exceptions.--       ``(A) Extension.--Paragraph (1) shall not apply to the      extent that the chief executive officer of a State determines      that an extension is necessary and so notifies the Secretary      in writing, except that the extension shall not extend beyond      5 years after the date of enactment of this subsection.       ``(B) Waiver.--In addition to any extension under      subparagraph (A), the Secretary may grant a waiver to a State      to phase-in or delay implementation of electronic benefits      transfer for good cause shown by the State, except that the      waiver shall not extend for more than 6 months.       ``(C) Disaster relief.--The Secretary may provide food      stamp coupons for disaster relief under section 5(h).       ``(3) Expiration of food stamp coupons.--Any food stamp      coupon issued under this Act shall expire 6 years after the      date of enactment of this Act.''.
