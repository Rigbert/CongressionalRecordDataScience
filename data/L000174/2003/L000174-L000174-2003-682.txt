President, today we have proceeded with the President's nominations to the U.S. Parole Commission, among others. These individuals were the selections of the White House without consultation with the Democratic leader or with me or other Democratic Senators interested in these matters. We have proceeded on the President's nominees expeditiously and in good faith trusting that the White House will follow through expeditiously to nominate those members to the U.S. Parole Commission that the Democratic leader is recommending to fill the seats allocated to Democrats on what should be a bipartisan commission.  This President has too often in the past proceeded unilaterally on what have traditionally been bipartisan boards and commissions. Last year the White House caused significant problems for all nominations when it failed to follow through in a timely way on a commitment made to Senator McCain. That led to objections and cloture votes being required on a series of the President's judicial nominations and unnecessary delays with respect to both judicial and executive nominations because of objections from the Republican side.  With respect to all nominations, I urge the President to begin to work with us. Just as this White House has failed to work with Senate Democrats on judicial nominees, it has often failed to work with us on nominations to bipartisan boards and commissions. We would appreciate this White House beginning to work with us rather than dictate to us.  Just this week Thomas E. Mann, a distinguished scholar and senior fellow in governance studies at The Brookings Institution, wrote a column about the deteriorating relations between the White House and the Congress with respect to the nomination and confirmation process. While I do not agree with all of his observations, I note that he correctly observed that after the President's campaign as a uniter not a divider, we did expect more cooperation. And after the attack of September 11, when Democrats sought to close ranks and forego partisanship, we were disappointed by the continuing partisanship of the White House. Mr. Mann wrote: ``After the 2000 election and then again after Sept. 11, 2001, Democrats expected something akin to a government of national unity. Instead, they encountered a president who seemed determined to wage institutional, ideological and partisan war.''  Mr. Mann concluded by suggesting: ``The only way to break this cycle of escalation is for Bush to take pre-emptive action by submitting a more balanced ticket of judicial nominees and engaging in genuine negotiations and compromise with both parties in Congress.'' I agree, that would be a useful development. I add that it would be long overdue.  Today, on the day the Senate has moved off the Estrada nomination because of the lack of cooperation by the administration, the Senate is with the consent of every Democratic Senators agreeing to the confirmation of another judicial nominee, the 104th for this President, and several executive branch nominees.  I ask consent to print Thomas E. Mann's column in the Record.       There being no objection, the material was ordered to be      printed in the Record, as follows:                   [From the RollCall, Mar. 5, 2003]                             Guest Observer                          (by Thomas E. Mann)         Estrada Caught in ``Poisonous War'' Based on Ideology       The extended Senate debate on the nomination of Miguel      Estrada to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit has      generated pitched battles between party activists around the      country and increasingly shrill commentary from pundits. Some      claim we are on the verge of a constitutional coup that      effectively nullifies a president's power over judicial      appointments. Others respond that we are witnessing a      legitimate effort by the Senate minority to prevent the      packing of the federal judiciary with right-wing jurists.       How unprecedented is the tactic embraced by Senate      Democrats? What accounts for the partisan struggle now      playing out on the Senate floor? Is there any way out?       Filibusters have been a prominent feature of the Senate      since the early 19th century. While the constitutional      framers built no supermajority requirements for the passage      of legislation or the confirmation of appointees, the early      Senate, unlike the House, did away with its motion on the      previous question that would have allowed a majority to cut      off debate and proceed with a vote. As a consequence, for      virtually all of their chamber's history Senators have been      able to postpone or prevent floor action by talking at      length.       Under pressure from President Woodrow Wilson, the Senate      adopted a cloture provision in its rules that allowed a      supermajority to cut off debate. For much of the 20th century      the filibuster was mostly reserved for issues of great      national moment. In the past several decades, the Senate has      seen the routinization of the filibuster, to the point where      it is commonly accepted by both parties that with limited      exceptions, 60 votes are needed to pass controversial      matters. Some exceptions are built into the rules. The budget      process provides for limited debate on budget resolutions and      reconciliation bills, thereby empowering a majority of      Senators. Other exceptions flow from informal understandings      or norms. One of those norms is that the minority party does      not use extended debate to kill judicial nominations favored      by a majority of Senators.       During periods of divided party government, the Senate      majority fan frustrate the president's ability to fill      judicial vacancies simply by refusing to schedule committee      hearings or votes on nominees. Between 1995 and 2000, roughly      a third of President Bill Clinton's circuit court appointees      were killed in this manner by the Republican majority,      holding open judgeships that President Bush now seeks to      fill. The Democrats responded in kind to a number of      President Bush's nominees during their brief time in the      majority.       The crunch comes when one party controls both the White      House and Senate. Minority Members can try to delay action on      judicial nominees with holds and procedural moves in      committee. But their doomsday weapon is     the filibuster. The norms of the Senate mitigate against      firing that weapon as part of an explicit party strategy.      Nonetheless, groups of Senators have engaged in extended      floor debate to try to defeat judicial nominations. More      than a dozen cloture motions were filed to end filibusters      on judicial nominations between 1980 and 2000. But only      one judicial nominee was successfully blocked by a      filibuster. In 1968 Republicans and Southern Democrats      used a filibuster to defeat President Lyndon Johnson's      effort to elevate Justice Abe Fortas to chief justice.       So the Senate Democrats' resort to a filibuster on the      Estrada nomination is not unprecedented but it is highly      unusual and extreme by Senate conventions. It is the latest      escalation in what has been an intensifying ``War of the      Roses'' between the parties in Washington. Earlier episodes      included divisive battles over the Supreme Court nominations      of Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas; the winter 1995-96 budget      fights that led to government shutdowns; and the long-running      independent counsel investigations of Clinton, leading to his      impeachment by the Republican House.       That war is partly a consequence of razor-thin majorities      in the Congress, the increasing ideological polarization      between the parties, and the extension of the permanent      campaign to the Congress. It has intensified as a result of      the circumstances and leadership style of George W. Bush's      presidency.       Bush was elected in 2000 in the closest and arguably most      controversial presidential election in U.S. history. He lost      the popular vote but won a bare majority of the electoral      vote but won a bare majority of the electoral vote thanks to      flawed ballot designs in two Florida counties and to an      audacious 5-4 Supreme Court decision to halt a statewide      recount.       Yet he has governed with great ambition and confidence,      asserting presidential prerogatives and advancing a bold      conservative agenda through policy proposals and nominations.      He has played hardball with Democrats, in D.C. and on the      2002 campaign trail, while providing regular sustenance to      his conservative base. After the 2000 election and then again      after Sept. 11, 2001, Democrats expected something akin to a      government of national unity. Instead, they encountered a      president who seemed determined to wage institutional,      ideological and partisan war. They have decided to      reciprocate. The atmosphere is poisonous. Miguel Estrada is      now a part of that war.       The only way to break this cycle of escalation is for Bush      to take pre-emptive action by submitting a more balanced      ticket of judicial nominees and engaging in genuine      negotiation and compromise with both parties in Congress.      That seems most unlikely.                          ____________________
