I do appreciate his generosity. I have to say, I don't agree with what he said, but that comes as no surprise to my friend from New York. I will only make one comment. One statement I heard him say toward the end of his remarks was that every other country in the world would do it this way. That is the whole crux of it right there. I often wonder if you look at the other countries, they are all trying to get to our system. They all envy America for its system of freedom, of health delivery. We wonder sometimes if government-run health care is bad--and that is what this is; that is what the Obama administration is trying to do--if it is better, then why doesn't it work anywhere? I have often looked at this. It doesn't work in Canada, Denmark, the UK. It doesn't work in any of the other places. Yet they always say: It will work here. A lot of my liberal friends say: If I were running it, it would work. We have a great system.  I guess a little class warfare is healthy now and then, and we had a little bit of that in the last few minutes.                          ____________________
