 This year, the Croatian Fraternal Union will hold this gala at the Croatian Center in Merrillville, Indiana. Traditionally, the anniversary celebration entails a formal recognition of the Union's Golden Members, those who have achieved fifty years of membership. This year's honorees who have attained fifty years of membership include: Franklin N. Boskovich, Diana L. Budzielek, Jerry John Cogelja, Mark C. Corey, Anne Marie Glivar, William M. Glivar, Carl A. Helsing, Patrick Joseph Kane, William R. Kaurich, William M. Maluvac, Robert Petrusha, Filomena Schmidt, Judith Surowiec, and Georgene S. Trippel.  These loyal and dedicated individuals share this prestigious honor with approximately 489 additional Lodge members who have previously attained this important designation.  This memorable day will begin with a mass at Saint Joseph the Worker Croatian Catholic Church in Gary, Indiana, with the Reverend Father Stephen Loncar officiating. The banquet will begin at 12:00 p.m.  Madam Speaker, I urge you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in commending Lodge President John Miksich and all members of the Croatian Fraternal Union Lodge Number 170 for their loyalty and radiant display of passion for their ethnicity. The Croatian community has played a key role in enriching the quality of life and culture of Northwest Indiana. It is my hope that this year will bring renewed hope and prosperity for all members of the Croatian community and their families.                          ____________________
