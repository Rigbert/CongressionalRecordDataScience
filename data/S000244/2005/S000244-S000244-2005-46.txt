Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment.  International traffickers and smugglers of human beings are the most barbaric of immigration violators. They force women and children into sexual slavery and aliens into indentured servitude. They place their human cargo in extremely dangerous circumstances and often abandon them and leave them to die in the rugged terrain along much of our southwestern border.  This amendment ensures that Federal authorities can use all the powerful tools of our money laundering statutes against the money laundering activities that these persons engage in as part of their criminal enterprises.  If we can make it more difficult for them to launder their profits, and we can more easily seize their profits, we will be much better able to combat this scourge. Just as money laundering by drug dealers and organized crime demands a powerful response by law enforcement, so does money laundering by human traffickers and smugglers.  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.
