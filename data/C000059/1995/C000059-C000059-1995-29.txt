Speaker, December 19, 1995, is a truly historical date. On this day Fender Musical Instruments will host the grand opening of a new facility in Corona, CA. This 90,000 square foot manufacturing operation, will produce high quality speakers and amplifiers, creating 250 new jobs for the Corona community.  A short 9 years ago this company almost became a historical statistic as a result of competition from Japan. The great name of Fender was close to being wiped out by cheap foreign imitations. Using economic advantages that did not exist in this country, the foreign product dominated the musical instrument business.  Led by its president, Bill Schultz, Fender Musical Instruments became the comeback story for the past decade. Moving to the city of Corona in 1986 with only 15 employees, this once great company was manufacturing just two dozen guitars per day. Faced with what many considered an uncertain future at best, the success story of quality and tradition began to unfold in my hometown of Corona.  Today, Fender Musical Instruments builds 350 high-end guitars per day and employs over 600 people. With the opening of this new facility and the addition of 250 people to its staff, total Fender Music's employment in Corona, CA, will be 850 people.  Fender is the choice for some of the most popular entertainers in the world, such as Eric Clapton, Bruce Springsteen, and many more. Fender was also chosen to custom make just over 100 guitars to celebrate the anniversary of Harley Davidson. These particular guitars are valued at over $40,000 each. In the music business the name Fender means quality, which means reliability, which also means the best sound possible from a musical instrument.  This tremendous comeback was accomplished through the leadership of Bill Schultz, president of Fender Musical Instruments. Mr. Schultz has worked closely with Federal, State, and local leaders. He has provided valued input on business issues to help ensure continued economic growth in this country.  It is a great pleasure for me, on behalf of the citizens of California's 43d Congressional District, to congratulate the leadership of Fender Musical Instruments and the city of Corona for making this dynamic growth a reality. We can all be proud of the private and public sector working together to keep valuable jobs in America.                          ____________________
