Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 312) urging the Government of the Russian Federation to withdraw or modify proposed legislation that would have the effect of severely restricting the establishment, operations, and activities of domestic and foreign nongovernmental organizations in the Russian Federation, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:                            H. Con. Res. 312       Whereas Russian Federation President Putin has stated that      ``modern Russia's greatest achievement is the democratic      process (and) the achievements of our civil society'';       Whereas the unobstructed establishment and free and      autonomous operations and activities of nongovernmental      organizations and a robust civil society free from excessive      government control are central and indispensable elements of      a democratic society;       Whereas the free and autonomous operations of      nongovernmental organizations in any society necessarily      encompass activities, including political activities, that      may be contrary to government policies;       Whereas domestic, international, and foreign      nongovernmental organizations are crucial in assisting the      Russian Federation and the Russian people in tackling the      many challenges they face, including in such areas as      education, infectious diseases, and the establishment of a      flourishing democracy;       Whereas the Government of the Russian Federation has      proposed legislation that would have the effect of severely      restricting the establishment, operations, and activities of      domestic, international, and foreign nongovernmental      organizations in the Russian Federation, including erecting      unprecedented barriers to foreign assistance;       Whereas the State Duma of the Russian Federation is      considering the first draft of such legislation;       Whereas the restrictions in the first draft of this      legislation would impose disabling restraints on the      establishment, operations, and activities of nongovernmental      organizations and on civil society throughout the Russian      Federation, regardless of the stated intent of the Government      of the Russian Federation;       Whereas the stated concerns of the Government of the      Russian Federation regarding the use of nongovernmental      organizations by foreign interests and intelligence agencies      to undermine the Government of the Russian Federation and the      security of the Russian Federation as a whole can be fully      addressed without imposing disabling restraints on      nongovernmental organizations and on civil society;       Whereas there is active debate underway in the Russian      Federation over concerns regarding such restrictions on      nongovernmental organizations;       Whereas the State Duma and the Federation Council of the      Federal Assembly play a central role in the system of checks      and balances that are prerequisites for a democracy;       Whereas the first draft of the proposed legislation has      already passed its first reading in the State Duma;       Whereas President Putin has indicated his desire for      changes in the first draft that would ``correspond more      closely to the principles according to which civil society      functions''; and       Whereas Russia's destiny and the interests of her people      lie in her assumption of her rightful place as a full and      equal member of the international community of democracies:      Now, therefore, be it       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate      concurring), That Congress--       (1) urges the Government of the Russian Federation to      withdraw the first draft of the proposed legislation that      would have the effect of severely restricting the      establishment, operations, and activities of domestic,      international, and foreign nongovernmental organizations in      the Russian Federation, or to modify the proposed legislation      to entirely remove these restrictions; and       (2) in the event that the first draft of the proposed      legislation is not withdrawn, urges the State Duma and the      Federation Council of the Federal Assembly to modify the      legislation to ensure the unobstructed establishment and free      and autonomous operations and activities of such      nongovernmental organizations in accordance with the      practices universally adopted by democracies, including the      provisions regarding foreign assistance.
