 Evidence keeps piling up that good things happen when the government takes its foot off the brake and gets out of the way of American workers and job creators.  Last week, UPS, the largest private employer in my hometown of Louisville, KY, announced that tax reform will enable them to invest $12 billion in expanding their smart logistics network, funding employee pensions, and other capital improvements.  Their chairman and CEO had this to say:       We applaud President Trump and Congress for their bold      action. . . . Tax reform is a tremendous catalyst.  On Thursday, another major American employer, Lowe's, announced that it will give bonuses of up to $1,000 to more than a quarter of a million hourly employees and expand family friendly employment benefits, like adoption assistance and paid parental leave.  The very same day, the major pharmaceutical company Amgen, which houses a distribution facility in Louisville, announced that tax reform is causing them to shift more of their planned investments here to the United States, including the construction of a new ``next-generation manufacturing plant'' right here at home.  Already, our historic tax reform law is giving employers the flexibility to invest more, expand more, hire more American workers, and give bonuses, pay raises, and new benefits to their employees, and, already, middle-class families across the country are seeing the benefits.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
