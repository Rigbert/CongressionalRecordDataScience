 President, I congratulate our colleague from Arkansas on his first speech and remark at how fortunate the people of Arkansas are to have him here representing them. I was particularly interested in the history lesson he taught us about various individuals who served the State of Arkansas both in the seat he now holds and other positions of responsibility. Again, on behalf of all Senators, I congratulate the junior Senator from Arkansas for his initial speech.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
