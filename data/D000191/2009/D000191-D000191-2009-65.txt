  Mr. DeFAZIO. Well, we just heard from the Republican side of the aisle that they are ready to make the tough fiscal choices. Unfortunately, they are about 8 years and $5 trillion short with their newfound fiscal conservatism.  Remember, George Bush inherited a surplus. What was the answer to the surplus? Tax cuts. Then we had the attacks of 9/11. What was the answer to that? Tax cuts. Then we had the misbegotten war in Iraq. What was the answer to that? Tax cuts. A war fought on borrowed money and tax cuts. And then we had the bank collapse and the recession growing into a depression. And what was the answer of George Bush? Tax cuts. And what is the answer of the Republicans today? Tax cuts.  For them to say they are for fiscal responsibility and honest budgeting after those 8 years is laughable. The Obama administration is going to give it straight to the American people tonight. They have made a hash out of it, and we are going to try to fix it, but it is going to take some time.                          ____________________
