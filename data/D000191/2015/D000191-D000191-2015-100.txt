Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 minutes.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Actually, Mr. Chairman, most of the statutes that the gentleman is talking about already specifically have waivers and exceptions for natural disasters for emergency reconstruction under the Clean Water Act, under the Endangered Species Act, under NEPA just enacted 3 years ago in MAP-21, so this seems perhaps to be broader. I don't fully understand the implications. But if you look at the Minnesota bridge collapse, you look at the reconstruction of Vermont after the catastrophic hurricane flooding a few years ago, if you look at work in Louisiana, all these waivers were put into effect, and the projects were not unnecessarily delayed.  This seems to be a broader and more general grant, and I don't fully understand the implications and feel it could potentially usurp necessary review, so I would oppose the amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
