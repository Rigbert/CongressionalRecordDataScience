 Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  The previous speaker said real money and real people, so let me tell my colleagues about real money and real people. While we outspent our so-called enemies 20-to-1, 22 percent of the children in this country live in poverty.  We have the highest rate of poverty in the industrialized world, and yet we spend the money on B-2 bombers and star wars and other exotic weapons systems that are not needed today. Real money, real people.  Millions of families in America cannot afford to send their kids to college. The gentleman said $300 million on education; he forgot to say that was at the local level. Local property taxes, State taxes, $30 billion at the Federal level, 8 times more on the military than we spend on education. That is absurd.  Real money, real people. Tens of millions of Americans have no health insurance. They do not know what to do when they get sick, and they are saying, yes, let us take care of the people back home, rather than spending $100 billion a year defending Europe and Asia. Real money, real people.  Real money, real people. Why did my colleagues on the other side cut veterans' programs? They are the people who defended this country. Now they are 70 and 80 and they are dying at VA hospitals. We have cut back on health care for veterans, and yet we have money for exotic weapons systems that we do not need.  Bottom line, Mr. Chairman, we want the strongest military in the world, we have the strongest military in the world, but let us get our priorities straight. Let us talk about health care, education, protect our seniors, protect our veterans, and let us do the right thing and pass, pass, pass this amendment.
