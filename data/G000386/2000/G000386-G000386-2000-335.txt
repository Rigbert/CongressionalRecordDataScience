  In 1997, Tunisia and the United States celebrated the bicentennial of the ``Treaty of Peace and Friendship.'' This celebration marked the longest unbroken friendship treaty in the history of the two countries. Throughout our long relationship, the United States and Tunisia have experienced cooperation based upon respect and mutual commitment to freedom, democracy, and the peaceful resolution of conflict.  Tunisia has been a leader in promoting stability and peace in Africa and the Middle East. It was the first Arab state to host an Israeli delegation and hold a multilateral meeting promoting peace. In 1996, Tunisia and Israel opened interest sections in each country and established full diplomatic relations.  In addition to supporting peace in the Middle East, Tunisia has made impressive economic strides. The people of Tunisia enjoy a high standard of living, and the country has successfully graduated from development assistanceto self-sufficiency. These improvements have come about through the devotion of vital resources to the promotion of its people, education, and economic reform. Tunisia's market-oriented economy has flourished under increasingly privatized companies. And, Tunisia's membership in the World Trade Organization is indicative of its willingness to engage the world and maintain involvement with other nations.  Tunisia has been a friend and ally to the United States for many years. I look forward to continued cooperation and friendship in the years to come. As Tunisia celebrates its 44th Anniversary of Independence, I offer my sincere congratulations on their many successful accomplishments.                          ____________________
