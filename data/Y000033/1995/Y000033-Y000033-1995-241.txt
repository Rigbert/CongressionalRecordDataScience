Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to the amendment.  Mr. Chairman, this is a very mischievous amendment. Just think of the term ``terminate.'' Terminator I, Terminator II. This is exactly what this does to the bill. Let us not kid ourselves.  The bill is very self-explanatory. It says exports will be only on U.S.-crewed, U.S.-flagged vessels. That is in the bill. If it is not on U.S.-crewed or U.S.-flagged vessels, in fact there would be no oil export.  What happens? Let us say that all the vessels for some strange reason became totally occupied, absolutely occupied, and we had to move the oil because the storage was not available, and we put it on one ship that was not, then the whole thing is terminated. We might as well go home. That is really what it does. Look at that word ``terminate,'' very smartly put in there.  I want to suggest this amendment, as I say, is very mischievous and, by the way, not supported by any of the maritime unions. We worked closely with the maritime unions, closely with the Shipbuilding League, very closely with everybody involved in this issue, asking for their input, asking for their suggestions, and we have suggested very nearly everything they have suggested within the realities of other laws, such as GATT, international trade, et cetera, et cetera. We have done that.  To have this amendment offered at this time, very frankly, with all due respect to my good friend from Connecticut, it causes me great, great anguish to have this presented as one that says well, this is just another fail-safe part of this bill. As a backup to what you say, it says it in the bill. The bill is very clear. It is there.  By the word ``termination,'' it is absolutely a killer amendment, and I urge that it be defeated.
