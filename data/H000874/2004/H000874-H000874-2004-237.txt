 Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's yielding to me.  I think it is way too early in the process on this particular bill to be talking about even process or amendments or substitutes or even trying to speculate what the Committee on Rules would do. We do not even know what form the bill would come out of the Committee on Rules at this particular time. There is a lot of work that is being done on the bill. But I can assure the gentleman that we would give his side of the aisle every consideration for amendments and/or substitutes to this very important bill.
