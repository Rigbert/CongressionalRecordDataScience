 President, I commend my friend and colleague from Kentucky, Senator Bunning, for his excellent amendment.  What we are hearing from the other side of the aisle is that they do not want the dividend exclusion, and they want to finally address an issue they created 10 years ago, which is this additional tax on Social Security recipients. But they are saying, you can't have both. And, as the Senator from Kentucky, Mr. Bunning, has pointed out, most seniors can benefit from both. Obviously, they all benefit from Social Security, and they would like to not have this Clinton tax on Social Security continued any longer; second, seniors account for only 15 percent of the total income in America, but they get 50 percent of the dividend income.  So I gather what Senator Dorgan is saying is, we are going to take away the dividend exclusion from seniors in order to finally reduce the Social Security tax which we put on 10 years ago.  What the Senator from Kentucky is saying is: We want to do both. And we ought to do both. We should never have levied this Social Security tax in the first place, 10 years ago, for which neither of us voted. And we ought to now do the dividend exclusion as close to the President's suggested manner of doing that as possible.  June could be a pretty good month for seniors around here. If we could get the dividend exclusion through, get rid of the Social Security tax, and begin to address prescription drugs, which is on the agenda of the majority leader for June, I say to my friend and colleague from Kentucky, we would have a pretty good month around here for seniors, pretty soon, wouldn't we?
