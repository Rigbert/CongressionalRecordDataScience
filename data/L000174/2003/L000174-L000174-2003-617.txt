President, the cold-blooded assassination of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic is a tragedy not only for Serbia, but for the other former Yugoslav republics whose futures are so closely linked. I knew and admired Prime Minister Djindjic from our meetings in Washington, and I want to express my deepest sympathy to his family and to the Serbian people.  Zoran Djindjic was a charismatic and courageous leader who recognized that Serbia's best hope, after years of nationalist-inspired ethnic hatred and war destroyed Yugoslavia and caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands of innocent people, was to follow the path of democracy and the rule of law. This was not an easy choice, as it required confronting the forces of corruption and evil which, despite the overthrow of Slobodan Milosevic, have sought to preserve the status quo.  It was Prime Minister Djindjic who, at considerable personal risk, obtained Milosevic's arrest, after President Kostunica refused to cooperate with the Hague tribunal. Turning over Milosevic was a key step, but Mr. Djindjic understood that it was only the first step toward a formal break with the failed policies of the past.  For the past 3 years, the Congress has provided substantial aid to support economic and political reform in Serbia. However, we have also made clear in legislation and in discussions with Serb officials, that continued cooperation with the Hague prosecutor is essential for continued United States aid to Serbia. There were times in our discussions when Serb officials complained bitterly that the United States and the Hague prosecutor were pressuring them too hard to apprehend and transfer suspected war criminals. In fact, they did so even before the arrest of Milosevic. We responded that while we did not expect them to apprehend all the indictees in Serbia overnight, the United States cannot provide millions of dollars in aid unconditionally to a government that harbors indicted war criminals.  Since the arrest of Milosevic, the Serb Government's cooperation with the Hague tribunal has been sporadic. Mr. Djindjic wanted to move faster, while Mr. Kostunica stood in the way. While some indictees have been turned over, 18 remain at liberty and access to witnesses and documents necessary to the prosecution of these cases has been unsatisfactory. Moreover, there has often been no cooperation until just weeks or days before the deadline in U.S. law for the cutoff of aid.  I mention this because immediately after Prime Minister Djindjic was gunned down some Serb officials blamed his assassination on the pressure exerted on Serbia by the United States and the war crimes prosecutor. I understand that reaction. It is convenient to blame others rather than to acknowledge the difficult but essential task at hand--to remove from the security forces those Milosevic loyalists involved with and protecting organized crime figures and war crimes suspects. But I believe that had the Serb Government moved faster, and more aggressively--as Prime Minister Djindjic urged for the benefit of the Serbian people and the survival of democracy--to arrest those who made no secret of their efforts to thwart reform, this tragedy might have been avoided.  Zoran Djindjic's death has kindled an outpouring of sympathy. Millions of Serbs have taken to the streets to express their support for the policies he fought for. Let us hope that just as millions of Serbs joined together three years ago to oust Milosevic from power, Zoran Djindjic's death will be the catalyst for a renewed and unrelenting effort to destroy the remaining vestiges of the Milosevic era. The United States stands ready to strongly support that effort. There is no alternative, if Serbia is to take its place in today's democratic Europe.                          ____________________
