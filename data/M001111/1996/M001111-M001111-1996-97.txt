 President, the Senator from Massachusetts is absolutely correct. With the language as it is currently written in the DOD bill, without my amendment, this will force women in the military overseas--in Bosnia, in Turkey, or in many other places--to go to their supervisor and request a leave. Most likely, they would be asked to tell them why, which would be a very difficult situation for many. They would be subject to their supervisor's decision about whether or not they would be granted leave. That would put women in a very awkward and unfair position.  I should add that, if the abortion is delayed, the woman's life becomes more in danger. In many circumstances, that would be delayed if she requested leave. It could be delayed if she traveled to this country. If she is granted leave and traveled to this country, as the Senator has stated, if the complications arise, as they can, she would then be subject to having to go back to that supervisor again and ask for additional leave.  This is an extremely unfair situation. It can be rectified very easily by this amendment that would allow a woman to use her own private money. We are not asking for taxpayer dollars. We are saying that a woman can use her own money to go into the military facility where we have excellent personnel overseas to perform a safe medical procedure.
