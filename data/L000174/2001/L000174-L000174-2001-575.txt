President, a little over one year ago, I came to this floor to draw attention to the growing crisis in the administration of capital punishment. I noted the startling number of cases, 85, in which death row inmates had been exonerated after long stays in prison. In some of those cases, the inmate had come within days of being executed.  A lot has happened in a year. For one thing, a lot more death row inmates have been exonerated. The number jumped in a single year from 85 all the way to 95. There are now 95 people in 22 States who have been cleared of the crime that sent them to death row, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. The appalling number of exonerations, and the fact that they span so many States, a substantial majority of the States that have the death penalty, makes it clearer than ever that the crisis I spoke of last year is real, and that it is national in its scope. This is not an ``Illinois problem'' or a ``Texas problem.'' Nor, with Earl Washington's release last month from prison, is it a ``Virginia problem.'' There are death penalty problems across the nation, and as a nation we need to pay attention to what is happening.  It seems like every time you pick up a paper these days, there is another story about another person who was sentenced to death for a crime that he did not commit. The most horrifying miscarriages of justice are becoming commonplace: ``Yet Another Innocent Person Cleared By DNA, Walks Off Death Row,'' story on page 10. We should never forget that behind each of these headlines is a person whose life was completely shattered and nearly extinguished by a wrongful conviction.  And those were the ``lucky'' ones. We simply do not know how many innocent people remain on death row, and how many may already have been executed.  People of good conscience can and will disagree on the morality of the death penalty. I have always opposed it. I did when I was a prosecutor, and I do today. But no matter what you believe about the death penalty, no one wants to see innocent people sentenced to death. It is completely unacceptable.  A year ago, along with several of my colleagues, I introduced the Innocence Protection Act of 2000. I hoped this bill would stimulate a national debate and begin work on national reforms on what is, as I said, a national problem. A year later, the national debate is well under way, but the need for real, concrete reforms is more urgent than ever.  Today, my friend Gordon Smith and I are introducing the Innocence Protection Act of 2001. We are joined by Senators from both sides of the aisle, by some who support capital punishment and by others who oppose it. On the Republican side, I want to thank Senators Susan Collins and Lincoln Chafee, and my fellow Vermonter Jim Jeffords. On the Democratic side, my thanks to Senators Levin, Feingold, Kennedy, Akaka, Mikulski, Dodd, Lieberman, Torricelli, Wellstone, Boxer and Corzine. I also want to thank our House sponsors William Delahunt, and Ray LaHood, along with their 117 additional cosponsors, both Democratic and Republican.  Over the last year we have turned the corner in showing that the death process is broken. Now we will push forward to our goal of acting on reforms that address these problems.  Here on Capitol Hill it is our job to represent the public. The scores of legislators who have sponsored this legislation clearly do represent the American public, both in their diversity and in their readiness to work together in a bipartisan manner for common-sense solutions.  Too often in this chamber, we find ourselves dividing along party or ideological lines. The Innocence Protection Act is not about that, and it is not about whether, in the abstract, you favor or disfavor the death penalty. It is about what kind of society we want America to be in the 21st Century.  The goal of our bill is simple, but profoundly important: to reduce the risk of mistaken executions. The Innocence Protection Act proposes basic, common-sense reforms to our criminal justice system that are designed to protect the innocent and to ensure that if the death penalty is imposed, it is the result of informed and reasoned deliberation, not politics, luck, bias, or guesswork. We have listened to a lot of good advice and made some refinements to the bill since the last Congress, but it is still structured aroundtwo principal reforms: improving the availability of DNA testing, and ensuring reasonable minimum standards and funding for court-appointed counsel.  The need to make DNA testing more available is obvious. DNA is the fingerpint of the 21st Century. Prosecutors across the country use it, and rightly so, to prove guilt. By the same token, it should be used to do what it is equally scientifically reliable to do, prove innocence. Our bill would provide broader access to DNA testing by convicted offenders. It would also prevent the premature destruction of biological evidence that could hold the key to clearing an innocent person or identifying the real culprit.  I am gratified that our bill has served as a catalyst for reforms in the States with respect to post-conviction DNA testing. In just one year, several States have passed some form of DNA legislation. Others have DNA bills under consideration. Much of this legislation is modeled on the DNA provisions proposed in the Innocence Protection Act, and we can be proud about this.  But there are still many States that have not moved on this issue, even though it has been more than six years since New York passed the Nation's first post-conviction DNA statute. And some of the States that have acted have done so in ways that will leave the vast majority of prisoners without access to DNA testing. Moreover, none of these new laws addresses the larger and more urgent problem of ensuring that people facing the death penalty have adequate legal representation. The Innocence Protection Act does address this problem.  In our adversarial system of justice, effective assistance of counsel is essential to the fair administration of justice. Unfortunately, the manner in which defense lawyers are selected and compensated in death penalty cases too often results in fundamental unfairness and unreliable verdicts. More than two-thirds of all death sentences are overturned on appeal or after post-conviction review because of errors in the trial; such errors are minimized when the defendant has a competent counsel.  It is a sobering fact that in some areas of the Nation it is often better to be rich and guilty than poor and innocent. All too often, lawyers defending people whose lives are at stake are inexperienced, inept, or just plain incompetent. All too often, they fail to take the time to review the evidence and understand the basic facts of the case before the trial is under way.  The reasons for this inadequacy of representation are well know: lack of standards for choosing defense counsel, and lack of funding for this type of legal service. The Innocence Protection Act addresses these problems head on. It calls for the creation of a temporary Commission on Capital Representation, which would consist of distinguished American legal experts who have experienced the criminal justice system first hand, prosecutors, defense lawyers, and judges. The Commission would be tasked with formulating standards that specify the elements of an effective system for providing adequate representation in capital cases. The bill also authorizes more than $50,000,000 in grants to help put the new standards into effect.  We have consulted a great many legal experts in the course of formulating these provisions. They have all provided valuable insights, but as a former prosecutor myself, I have been particularly pleased with the encouragement and assistance we have received from prosecutors across the nation.  Good prosecutors have two things in common. First, good prosecutors want to convict the person, not to get a conviction that may be a mistake, and that may leave the real culprit in the clear. Second, good prosecutors want defendants to be represented by good defense lawyers. Lawyers who investigate their client's cases thoroughly before trial, and represent their clients vigorously in court, are essential in getting at the truth in our adversarial system.  Given some leadership from the people's representatives in Congress, some fair and objective standards, and some funding, America's prosecutors will be ready, willing and able to help fix the system. We owe them, and the American people, that leadership.  On August 3, 1995, more than five years ago, the Conference of Chief Justices urged the judicial leadership in each State in which the death penalty is authorized by law to ``establish standards and a process that will assure the timely appointment of competent counsel, with adequate resources, to represent defendants in capital cases at each stage of such proceedings.'' The States' top jurists, the people who run our justice system, called for reform. But not much came of their initiative. Although a few States have established effective standards and sound administrative systems for the appointment and compensation of counsel in capital cases, most have not. The do-nothing politics of gridlock got in the way of sensible, consensus-based reform.  We have made a commitment to the American people to do better than that. At the end of the last Congress, members on both sides of the aisle joined together to pass the Paul Coverdell National Forensic Sciences Improvement Act and the DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act. I strongly supported both bills, which will give States the help they desperately need to reduce the backlogs of untested DNA evidence in their crime labs, and to improve the quality and capacity of these facilities. Both bills passed unanimously in both houses. And in both bills, all of us here in Congress committed ourselves to working with the States to ensure access to post-conviction DNA testing in appropriate cases, and to improve the quality of legal representation in capital cases through the establishment of counsel standards. Congress has already gone on record in recognizing what has to be done. Now it is time to actually do it.  If we had a series of close calls in airline traffic, we would be rushing to fix the problem. These close calls on death row should concentrate our minds, and focus our will, to act.  This new Congress is, as our new President has said, a time for leadership. It is a time for fulfilling the commitments we have made to the American people. And it is a time for action. The Innocence Protection Act is a bipartisan effort to move beyond the politics of gridlock. By passing it, we can work cooperatively with the States to ensure that defendants who are put on trial for their lives have competent legal representation at every stage of their cases. By passing it, we can send a message about the values of fundamental justice that unite all Americans. And by passing it, we can substantially reduce the risk of executing innocent people. We have had a constructive debate, and we have made a noble commitment. It is now time to act.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a summary of the bill be included in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 486       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

TITLE I--EXONERATING THE INNOCENT THROUGH DNA TESTING     SEC. 101. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Over the past decade, deoxyribonucleic acid testing      (referred to in this section as ``DNA testing'') has emerged      as the most reliable forensic technique for identifying      criminals when biological material is left at a crime scene.       (2) Because of its scientific precision, DNA testing can,      in some cases, conclusively establish the guilt or innocence      of a criminal defendant. In other cases, DNA testing may not      conclusively establish guilt or innocence, but may have      significant probative value to a finder of fact.       (3) While DNA testing is increasingly commonplace in      pretrial investigations today, it was not widely available in      cases tried prior to 1994. Moreover, new forensic DNA testing      procedures have made it possible to get results from minute      samples that could not previously be tested, and to obtain      more informative and accurate results than earlier forms of      forensic DNA testing could produce. Consequently, in some      cases convicted inmates have been exonerated by new DNA tests      after earlier tests had failed to produce definitive results.       (4) Since DNA testing is often feasible on relevant      biological material that is decades old, it can, in some      circumstances, prove that a conviction that predated the      development of DNA testing was based upon incorrect factual      findings. Uniquely, DNA evidence showing innocence, produced      decades after a conviction, provides a more reliable basis      for establishing a correct verdict than any evidence      proffered at the original trial. DNA testing, therefore, can      and has resulted in the post-conviction exoneration of      innocent men and women.       (5) In more than 80 cases in the United States, DNA      evidence has led to the exoneration of innocent men and women      who were wrongfully convicted. This number includes at least      10 individuals sentenced to death, some of whom came within      days of being executed.       (6) In more than a dozen cases, post-conviction DNA testing      that has exonerated an innocent person has also enhanced      public safety by providing evidence that led to the      identification of the actual perpetrator.       (7) Experience has shown that it is not unduly burdensome      to make DNA testing available to inmates. The cost of that      testing is relatively modest and has decreased in recent      years. Moreover, the number of cases in which post-conviction      DNA testing is appropriate is small, and will decrease as      pretrial testing becomes more common.       (8) Under current Federal and State law, it is difficult to      obtain post-conviction DNA testing because of time limits on      introducing newly discovered evidence. Under Federal law,      motions for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence      must be made within 3 years after conviction. In most States,      those motions must be made not later than 2 years after      conviction, and sometimes much sooner. The result is that      laws intended to prevent the use of evidence that has become      less reliable over time have been used to preclude the use of      DNA evidence that remains highly reliable even decades after      trial.       (9) The National Commission on the Future of DNA Evidence,      a Federal panel established by the Department of Justice and      comprised of law enforcement, judicial, and scientific      experts, has urged that post-conviction DNA testing be      permitted in the relatively small number of cases in which it      is appropriate, notwithstanding procedural rules that could      be invoked to preclude that testing, and notwithstanding the      inability of an inmate to pay for the testing.       (10) Since New York passed the Nation's first post-     conviction DNA statute in 1994, only a few States have      adopted post-conviction DNA testing procedures, and some of      these procedures are unduly restrictive. Moreover, only a      handful of States have passed legislation requiring that      biological evidence be adequately preserved.       (11) In 1994, Congress passed the DNA Identification Act,      which authorized the construction of the Combined DNA Index      System, a national database to facilitate law enforcement      exchange of DNA identification information, and authorized      funding to improve the quality and availability of DNA      testing for law enforcement identification purposes. In 2000,      Congress passed the DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act and      the Paul Coverdell Forensic Sciences Improvement Act, which      together authorized an additional $908,000,000 over 6 years      in DNA-related grants.       (12) Congress should continue to provide financial      assistance to the States to increase the capacity of State      and local laboratories to carry out DNA testing for law      enforcement identification purposes. At the same time,      Congress should insist that States which accept financial      assistance make DNA testing available to both sides of the      adversarial system in order to enhance the reliability and      integrity of that system.       (13) In Herrera v. Collins, 506 U.S. 390 (1993), a majority      of the members of the Court suggested that a persuasive      showing of innocence made after trial would render the      execution of an inmate unconstitutional.       (14) It shocks the conscience and offends social standards      of fairness and decency to execute innocent persons or to      deny inmates the opportunity to present persuasive evidence      of their innocence.       (15) If biological material is not subjected to DNA testing      in appropriate cases, there is a significant risk that      persuasive evidence of innocence will not be detected and,      accordingly, that innocent persons will be unconstitutionally      executed.       (16) Given the irremediable constitutional harm that would      result from the execution of an innocent person and the      failure of many States to ensure that innocent persons are      not sentenced to death, a Federal statute assuring the      availability of DNA testing and a chance to present the      results of testing in court is a congruent and proportional      prophylactic measure to prevent constitutional injuries from      occurring.       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are to--       (1) substantially implement the Recommendations of the      National Commission on the Future of DNA Evidence in the      Federal criminal justice system, by authorizing DNA testing      in appropriate cases;       (2) prevent the imposition of unconstitutional punishments      through the exercise of power granted by clause 1 of section      8 and clause 2 of section 9 of article I of the Constitution      of the United States and section 5 of the 14th amendment to      the Constitution of the United States; and       (3) ensure that wrongfully convicted persons have an      opportunity to establish their innocence through DNA testing,      by requiring the preservation of DNA evidence for a limited      period.

Section 20105(b)(1) of the Violent Crime Control and Law      Enforcement Act of 1994 (42 U.S.C. 13705(b)(1)), as amended      by section 302 of this Act, is amended by--       (1) striking ``and'' at the end of subparagraph (B);       (2) striking the period at the end of subparagraph (C) and      inserting ``; and''; and       (3) adding at the end the following:       ``(D) provide assurances to the Attorney General that in      any capital sentencing proceeding occurring after the date of      enactment of the Innocence Protection Act of 2001 in which      the jury has a role in determining the sentence imposed on      the defendant, the court, at the request of the defendant,      shall inform the jury of all statutorily authorized      sentencing options in the particular case, including      applicable parole eligibility rules and terms.''.

(b) Report Elements.--The report required under subsection      (a) shall include substantially the same categories of      information as are included in the Bureau of Justice      Statistics Bulletin entitled ``Capital Punishment 1999''      (December 2000, NCJ 184795), and shall also include the      following additional categories of information, if such      information can practicably be obtained:       (1) The percentage of death-eligible cases in which a death      sentence is sought, and the percentage in which it is      imposed.

(5) The percentage of capital cases in which life without      parole is not available as an alternative to a death      sentence, and the sentences imposed in such cases.       (6) The frequency with which various statutory aggravating      factors are invoked by the prosecution.       (7) The percentage of cases in which a death sentence or a      conviction underlying a death sentence is vacated, reversed,      or set aside, and a short statement of the reasons therefore.       (c) Request for Assistance.--In compiling the information      referred to in subsection (b),     the Attorney General shall, when necessary, request      assistance from State and local prosecutors, defense      attorneys, and courts, as appropriate.

(d) Public Disclosure.--The Attorney General or the      Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance, as appropriate,      shall ensure that the reports referred to in subsection (a)      are--       (1) distributed to national print and broadcast media; and       (2) posted on an Internet website maintained by the      Department of Justice.     SEC. 307. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE EXECUTION OF                    JUVENILE OFFENDERS AND THE MENTALLY RETARDED.       It is the sense of Congress that the death penalty is      disproportionate and offends contemporary standards of      decency when applied to a person who is mentally retarded or      who had not attained the age of 18 years at the time of the      offense.                                  ____      Innocence Protection Act of 2001--Section-by-Section Summary                                overview       The Innocence Protection Act of 2001 is a carefully crafted      package of criminal justice reforms aimed at reducing the      risk that innocent persons may be executed. Most urgently the      bill would afford greater access to DNA testing by convicted      offenders; and help States improve the quality of legal      representation in capital cases.         title I--exonerating the innocent through dna testing       Sec. 101. Findings and purposes. Legislative findings and      purposes in support of this title.       Sec. 102. DNA testing in Federal criminal justice system.      Establishes rules and procedures governing applications for      DNA testing by inmates in the Federal system. Courts shall      order DNA testing if it has the scientific potential to      produce new exculpatory evidence material to the inmate's      claim of innocence. When the test results are exculpatory,      courts shall order a hearing and make such further orders as      may be appropriate under existing law. Prohibits the      destruction of biological evidence in a criminal case while a      defendant remains incarcerated, absent prior notification to      such defendant of the government's intent to destroy the      evidence.       Sec. 103. DNA testing in State criminal justice system.      Conditions receipt of Federal grants for DNA-related programs      on an assurance that the State will adopt adequate procedures      for preserving biological material and making DNA testing      available to inmates.       Sec. 104. Prohibition pursuant to section 5 of the 14th      Amendment. Prohibits States from denying applications for DNA      testing by death row inmates, if the proposed testing has the      scientific potential to produce new exculpatory evidence      material to the inmate's claim of innocence. Also prohibits      States from denying inmates a meaningful opportunity to prove      their innocence using the results of DNA testing. Inmates may      sue for declaratory or injunctive relief to enforce these      prohibitions.       Sec. 105. Grants to prosecutors for DNA testing programs.      Permits States to use grants under the Edward Byrne Memorial      State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance Programs to fund      the growing number of prosecutor-initiated programs that      review convictions to identify cases in which DNA testing is      appropriate and that offer DNA testing to inmates in such      cases.      title ii--ensuring competent legal services in capital cases       Sec. 201. National Commission on Capital Representation.      Establishes a National Commission on Capital Representation      to develop standards for providing adequate legal      representation for indigents facing a death sentence. The      Commission would be composed of nine members and would      include experienced prosecutors, defense attorneys, and      judges, and would complete its work within on year. Total      authorization $1,000,000.       Sec. 202. Capital defense incentive grants. Establishes a      grant program, to be administered by the State Justice      Institute, to help States implement the Commission's      standards and otherwise improve the quality of representation      in capital cases. Authorization is $50,000,000 for the first      year, and such sums as may be necessary for the two years      that follow.       Sec. 203. Amendments to prison grant programs. Directs the      Attorney General to withhold a portion of the funds awarded      under the prison grant programs from death penalty States      that have not established or do not maintain a system for      providing legal representation in capital cases that      satisfies the Commission's standards. The Attorney General      may waive the withholding requirement for one year under      certain circumstances.       Sec. 204. Effect on procedural default rules. Provides that      certain procedural barriers to Federal habeas corpus review      shall not apply if the State did not provide legal      representation to the habeas petitioner under a State system      for providing representation that satisfied the Commission's      standards. This section does not apply in any case in which      the relevant State court proceeding occurred more than 1 year      before the formulation of such standards.       Sec. 205. Capital defense resource grants. Amends the      Criminal Justice Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3006A, to make more      Federal funding available for purposes of enhancing the      availability, competence, and prompt assignment of counsel in      capital cases, encouraging the continuity of representation      in such cases, and increasing the efficiency with which      capital cases are resolved.                  title iii--miscellaneous provisions       Sec. 301. Increased compensation in federal cases. Raises      the total amount of damages that may be awarded against the      United States in cases of unjust imprisonment from $5,000 to      $50,000 a year in a non-death penalty case, or $100,000 a      year in a death penalty case.       Sec. 302. Compensation in state death cases. Encourages      states to maintain effective procedures for reasonably      compensating persons who were unjustly convicted and      sentenced to death, and investigating the causes of such      unjust convictions in order to prevent such errors from      recurring.       Sec. 303. Certification requirement in federal death      penalty prosecutions. Increases accountability by requiring      the Attorney General, when seeking the death penalty in any      case, to certify that the federal interest in the prosecution      is more substantial than the interests of the state or local      authorities. Modeled on the certification requirements in the      federal civil rights and juvenile delinquency laws, this      section codifies existing practice as reflected in section 9-     10.070 of the U.S. Attorney's Manual. This section does not      create any rights enforceable at law by any party in any      matter civil or criminal.       Sec. 304. Alternative of life imprisonment without      possibility of release. Clarifies that juries in death      penalty prosecutions brought under the drug kingpin statute,      21 U.S.C. Sec. 848(l), have the option of recommending life      imprisonment without possibility of release. This amendment      incorporates into the drug kingpin statute a procedural      protection that federal law already expressly provides to the      vast majority of capital defendants.       Sec. 305. Right to an informed jury. Encourages states to      allow defendants in capital cases to have the jury instructed      on all statutorily-authorized sentencing options, including      applicable parole eligibility rules and terms.       Sec. 306. Annual reports. Directs the Justice Department to      prepare an annual report regarding the administration of the      nation's capital punishment laws. The report must be      submitted to Congress, distributed to the press and posted on      the Internet.       Sec. 307. Sense of the Congress regarding the execution of      juvenile offenders and the mentally retarded. Expresses the      sense of the Congress that the death penalty is      disproportionate and offends contemporary standards of      decency when applied to juvenile offenders and the mentally      retarded.
