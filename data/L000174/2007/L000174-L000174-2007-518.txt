President, I thank the Senator from California for her statement and her leadership. She has been so forthright in her comments right from the beginning of this scandal, and I appreciate it. I will have more to say about her efforts at the end of my statement.  In a few minutes, the Senate will have an opportunity to begin restoring accountability and checks and balances to what is our Government, the Government that belongs to all Americans. We should pass the Preserving U.S. Attorneys Independence Act. We have to close a loophole that has been exploited by the Department of Justice and the White House--a loophole that led to the mass firings of U.S. attorneys.  When we roll back this excessive authority given the Attorney General by the PATRIOT Act reauthorization, we can restore--or at least take a step toward restoring--the independence of our Federal law enforcement system. We will be acting to reverse one more incident of overstepping by an earlier ``rubberstamp'' Congress, which was all too often willing to dance to the tune of a power-hungry White House.
