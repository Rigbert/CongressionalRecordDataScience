At one point he said, ``Anxiety impedes investment.'' Certainly we know that anxiety breeds pessimism. So what we are trying to do in the economic stimulus package, from the Democratic side, as has been described by the Senator from North Dakota, is to provide tax cuts and tax rebates to the people who can use them, who will spend them for the things they need to survive, as opposed to the Republican approach in the House, which is to give tax cuts to corporations with no strings attached, over a billion dollars that might not result in a single new job, perhaps more dividends for the shareholders but no guarantee of a single new job.  So the tax cuts we are for are focused on the people who will spend them effectively to get the economy moving, and then the spending part of our proposal is focusing on homeland security, issues that genuinely concern people, whether we are talking about bioterrorism and making certain we have a response to it or improving and enhancing law enforcement so wherever we might go there will be an adequate response.  Yesterday I was in New York City when the plane crashed. At that point, they closed everything. They closed down the airports. Many of us changed our plans and rushed over to Penn Station to get the Amtrak train back to Washington. Trains were so crowded many of us had to stand the whole way. It was an indication people were concerned, and they responded to that anxiety by changing their habits. Instead of taking the airplane, they came to Amtrak. That sort of thing is happening across America in ways large and small.  Is it the belief of the Senator from North Dakota that in putting investments in this homeland security we are not only stimulating the economy by putting people to work to do the things to improve aviation security but we are also trying to build confidence back in this economy which has been shaken not only by bad economic news but by the news since September 11?
