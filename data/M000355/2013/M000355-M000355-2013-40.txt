 President, by now I am sure every Member in this Chamber has received literally countless letters, emails, and phone calls from the millions of Americans who have been hurt by ObamaCare.  I recently saw a press release from the senior Senator from California saying that she has heard from more than 30,000 constituents who are facing skyrocketing costs or canceled plans.  Each story is unique. Each story is important. That is why this morning Senate Republicans will share some of those stories to put a human face to those who have suffered as a result of the Democrats' decision to force this law on our country.  I will start off with James Dodson, who is a constituent of mine from Owensboro. James has type 2 diabetes. He recently got a letter informing him that his high-risk pool coverage would expire next month. He says a replacement plan on the ObamaCare exchange will cause his premiums to spike from $676 to more than $1,000 a month.  Here is the question he asked me: ``Where [are] the savings the Democrats . . . promised 3 years ago?''  James' story is another reminder of why it is time for Democrats to work with us to repeal this law and start over with bipartisan reform. My constituent James is counting on them, and so are millions of others across the country who are suffering under this law.  I understand my friend from Texas has something he would like to share.
