President, I appreciate the remarks made by the chairman of the committee, Senator Boxer. I do agree. It is very unusual that we agree so much on one bill, and we do on this one. It is important that everyone understands, this bill is actually less than the House bill is. This bill is less than the bill when I was chairman of the committee a year ago. But the most important part is, it offers discipline. When you say you need a chief's report, you are saying a project has to be economically justified, environmentally sound, and technically feasible. Without this bill, there is no discipline. That is what I keep saying to my conservative friends.  One of the Members who has been very helpful was the chairman of the subcommittee--and I was ranking member--out of which this bill emerged, the Senator from Georgia, Mr. Isakson. So we can lock in the next two speakers, if there is no objection, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Isakson be recognized for up to 8 minutes, followed by Senator Grassley from Iowa for up to 20 minutes.
