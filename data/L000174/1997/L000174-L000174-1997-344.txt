Broder speaks far more eloquently than I could of what Senator Moynihan has done and continues to do as he climbs new heights every year.  Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that an article from The Hill of Wednesday, March 19, entitled ``The Senate's Renaissance Man Turns 70,'' be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                     [From the Hill, Mar. 19, 1997]     Daniel Patrick Moynihan--The Senate's Renaissance Man Turns 70       In a public career spanning three decades in the groves of      academe and the halls of government, Sen. Daniel Patrick      Moynihan (D-N.Y.) has helped shape public policy on a wide      range of issues that bear on almost every major aspect of      American life.       Thus, when he turned 70 on St. Patrick's Day, a group of      Moynihan's friends, aides, colleagues and supporters used the      occasion to highlight his accomplishments at a day-long      celebration at The Woodrow Wilson Center.       The four-term senator, former U.S. ambassador to India,      former Harvard professor and aide to three presidents was the      guest of honor at a dinner culminating the tribute to ``The      Intellectual as Public Servant,'' excerpts of which follow.                                                                    ____       (By Michael Barone, Senior Staff Editor, Reader's Digest)       Harry McPherson, writing about the Senate of the 1950s,      described a Senate dominated by ``whales'' and populated      otherwise by `minnows.' But the Senate in which Daniel      Patrick Moynihan took his place was quite another place. The      senators after whom the three Senate office buildings were      named had all died--Richard Russell in 1971, Everett Dirksen      in 1969, Philip Hart in 1976. Sam Ervin had retired in 1974      and William Fulbright was beaten that year. Hubert Humphrey      was battling the cancer that killed him in 1978 and his old      adversary James Eastland would retire that year. Lyndon      Johnson and Robert Taft were long gone. Mike Mansfield had      retired and the new majority leader, Robert Byrd, was      regarded as a technician, in an office that carries none of      the great powers appertaining to the Speaker of the House.      Fully 18 of the 100 senators in January 1977 had been elected      for the first time. CBS News had to rent the large room in      the Sheraton Carlton Hotel and repaint it for their ``Meet      the Senators'' program. This was a heavily Democratic Senate,      but a Senate without driving Democratic leaders, and a Senate      which knew little or nothing about its new Democratic      president. It was a Senate in which political and policy      entrepreneurs could articulate their ideas and advance their      causes: not a bad place for a Renaissance man. ``In this      Senate, you do your work in committees, not on the floor,''      Moynihan has said. And so Moynihan's first and perhaps most      important decisions were what committees to serve on. He had      confronted the question in a debate in the 1976 primary,      unsure at first how to answer. His opponents gave predictable      answers--Labor, said one, because that is where the great      urban aid programs are drawn up; Foreign Relations, said      another, the forum for the great debates on the Vietnam War;      another said Judiciary, which handled civil rights.      Moynihan's answer: ``Finance. Because that's where the money      is.''                                                                    ____   (By Nicholas N. Eberstadt, Visiting Scholar, American Enterprise                                Institute)       Anyone even vaguely familiar with his long and      distinguished career will already know that Daniel Patrick      Moynihan is a polymath. For over four decades, this sometime      speechwriter, political adviser, domestic affairs counselor,      diplomat and senator has also occupied himself, with seeming      effortlessness, as an established expert--in fact, a pre-     eminent authority--in an unnerving multiplicity of      intellectual disciplines and academic fields: among them,      American history, architectural criticism, arms control,      educational policy, ethnology, income policy, international      law, public finance, public policy research and evaluation,      the sociology of the family, and urban planning. As a      habitual and evidently incorrigible trespasser in the      sometimes jealously guarded fields of specialized learning,      it should come as no surprise that Moynihan's intellectual      ambit has taken him into many other areas not enumerated      above.                                                                    ____ (By Suzanne Garment, Resident Scholar, American Enterprise Institute)       The foreign service will never be composed of Moynihans--     and a good thing, too. The international political system      would collapse under the pressure. Still, every so often the      debate resumes about whether the foreign service is      professionalized enough and whether too many ambassadorial      appointments are going to outsiders who do not have      ``ambassadorial temperament.'' When we hear this argument, we      should remember that making reasonable room for outsiders is      necessary if we are to have room for the Moynihans, and that      having one Moynihan around at a crucial foreign policymaking      juncture makes it worthwhile to put up with entire troops of      lesser professionals in the ambassadorial ranks.  (By Robert A. Katzmann, Walsh Professor, Georgetown University, The                          Brooking Institution)       But for the 20th Amendment, March 4, 1997, would have been      the day the nation inaugurated its president. Instead, it may      come to be remembered as the day when the nation began to      change its mindset about secrecy in government. For that is      when the Commission on Protecting and Reducing Government      Secrecy issued its report.       Most commissions receive scant attention. Rare is the      commission report which has a life beyond its issuance; most      are consigned to the microfiche collection in the basement of      some federal depository library. But this report on secrecy      would be different because of its chair, Sen. Daniel Patrick      Moynihan.       If the typical commission is concerned with moving      organizational units from one place to another, this would      seek to change the way we think about a problem so as to      better address it. It is vintage Moynihan--using an      instrument of government, in this case a commission, to shape      the very definition of policy and its debate.                                                                    ____      (By Stephen Hess, Senior Fellow, The Brookings Institution)       Sen. Moynihan is the political man of ideas. Some are his      own, some he borrows,     some are cosmic, others more modest: Our generation greatest      spotter of ideas that might make our society somehow better.      This is a remarkable talent. But what turns it into a      national treasure is a finely attuned antenna for knowing      when an idea is ready for the public arena, the skill to be      in positions to make his ideas matter, and the flair to make      others notice. It is a harnessing of intellectual energy and      political smarts that is so rare that when such a person is      also blessed with long life, we must create opportunities to      celebrate.                                                                    ____  (By Seymour Martin Lipset, Hazel Professor of Public Policy, George                            Mason University)       Why was Moynihan so prescient? I would say because he has      known from the start that there is no first cause, not in      politics, not in social science.       What Pat teaches is that not only are there no utopias,      there are no solutions, not in the state or in the completely      uncontrolled market. There are only approximations, only the      continuing struggle for decency, for morality, for equality      of opportunity and respect.                                                                    ____      (By Robert A. Peck, Commissioner, Public Buildings Service)       What did he know and when did he know it? Ask this about      Pat Moynihan in the matter of public works and, as in so many      other fields of public policy, the answers are: more than      everyone else and long before, as well. In public works, as      in other arenas, he has transformed the debate. Public      architecture he single-handedly disinterred from the grave      and resurrected on the political agenda. If you would see his      monuments in this field, look about you literally.       On public buildings, urban design, highways, transit,      waterways, water supply and even sewers, he has brought to      bear his trademark qualities; an eclectic historical memory,      a rapier tongue and typewriter, a nose for demography and      geography, an inner ear for the data that matter and in      immunity to ideological blinkering. In this field in      particular Moynihan the political vote-counter and Moynihan      the passionate New Yorker rival Moynihan the political      scientist. Moynihan's achievements are worthy of the great      public builders, from Hadrian to Hausmann to Robert Moses,      only Moynihan's are humane.
