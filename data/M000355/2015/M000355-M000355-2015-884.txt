 President, on an entirely different matter, the ongoing revelations about Planned Parenthood are more than just disturbing. They literally shock the conscience. A Democratic colleague called them ``very troubling,'' ``extremely troubling,'' and ``highly troubling.''  Next week, every Member of his party will have a chance to join us in reaffirming the Senate's commitment to genuine compassion and to women's health. We introduced legislation last night that would ensure taxpayer dollars for women's health are spent on women's health, not a scandal-plagued political lobbying giant.  It is a simple choice: Senators can either vote to protect women's health or they can vote to protect subsidies for a political group mired in scandal.  I know Planned Parenthood's entrenched lobbyists have been close allies of Democrats in recent years, but this moment calls for Senators to rise higher and to think bigger.  Let's not filibuster women's health in order to protect special subsidies for one scandal-plagued political organization. Why don't we join together instead to bring something positive to the American people from a terrible situation.                          ____________________
