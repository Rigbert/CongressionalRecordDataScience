I have spent a lot of time in Africa and have built close relationships with many African leaders. As you know, our country's official diplomacy is conducted by the State Department. However, public diplomacy involving people-to-people interaction is equally important for promoting a positive image of America to the world. The United States is admired as a beacon of freedom for oppressed people everywhere. The attacks on the U.S. of 9/11 demonstrate the new challenge we face by the forces of ignorance and intolerance that seek the destruction of our country.  Today I include in the record an insightful essay that I will share with the members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee about the critical role of public diplomacy in building bridges of good will for the United States. The author is Richard Soudriette, the president of the Center for Diplomacy and Democracy in Colorado Springs, CO. Mr. Soudriette is the founding president of the International Foundation for Electoral Systems, IFES, which has promoted free and fair elections in over 120 countries.  I have a long and personal history with Richard as he was my chief of staff in my office as mayor of Tulsa. Since then, he went on to be the founding president of the International Foundation for Electoral System, IFES, which has promoted free and fair elections in over 120 countries. Richard and I share the same heart for Africa and the same vision for developing countries around the world; that they continue to move towards self-sufficiency and become thriving economic nations.  His essay discusses public diplomacy at the local level and mentions my home town of Tulsa, OK, as an example of a community that has developed innovative international visitor programs. Public diplomacy is vital to keeping our country safe. The best way to defeat the forces of extremism is to educate people around the globe about America and our values, culture, and people.  I strongly support Richard's work around the world and I ask unanimous consent that the statement by Richard Soudriette be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:          Public Diplomacy: Building Bridges of Understanding[By Richard W. Soudriette, Center for Diplomacy and Democracy, December                                 8, 2010]       Ever since the proclamation of the Declaration of      Independence in Philadelphia over 200 years ago, America has      championed the power of the human spirit. Across the globe,      America is a beacon of freedom that gives hope to people      living under oppression.       Our country faces many challenges never envisioned by the      Founding Fathers in 1776. The deadly attacks on America that      occurred on September 11, 2001 revealed that extremist      elements seek to destroy America and all that it symbolizes.      Al-Qaeda and their cohorts are dedicated to the eradication      of human rights and democracy. Islamic extremists do a great      injustice to Muslims who reject the extremist philosophy of      hatred, ignorance, and intolerance.       Defeating the forces of extremism will require more than      military power. It also will require tenacious public      diplomacy to educate people from Muslim countries, as well as      elsewhere, about America.       Public diplomacy is a term that was coined by respected      career U.S. diplomat, Edmund Gullion, who also served as dean      of the Fletcher School at Tufts University. Ambassador      Gullion described public diplomacy as the way sovereign      nations openly and transparently communicate their ideas,      culture, and values to people of other countries.       Public diplomacy has become an essential component of U.S.      foreign policy. The Obama Administration has sought increases      in public diplomacy funding. The current Under Secretary of      State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs, Judith McHale,      recently unveiled ``The Strategic Plan for Public Diplomacy      for America in the 21st Century.''       Despite bipartisan support for public diplomacy, the image      of the U.S. continues to lose ground in many parts of the      globe. Our image problem in many countries is documented by      the work of the Pew Charitable Trusts Global Image Project.      Some respected organizations such as the Council on Foreign      Relations have focused on the failings of our public      diplomacy apparatus. The morphing of the United States      Information Agency into the State Department during the      Clinton Administration is identified as a major cause for      deficiencies in our public diplomacy efforts. The Council on      Foreign Relations has offered recommendations to the State      Department to fix our public diplomacy, but these will      require time and funding to implement.       The State Department already has the means to improve our      public diplomacy outreach to the world. For example, the      State Department should make certain that ambassadors and      foreign service officers are fully briefed on the State      Department's public diplomacy strategic plan before they are     posted abroad. Also, it should be made clear that a major      part of their duties will be to assist the Secretary of State      in implementing the plan.       Foreign service officers provide an immediate opportunity      for the U.S. to engage in effective public diplomacy. In      2008, the United States Advisory Commission on Public      Diplomacy issued a report entitled ``Getting the People Part      Right: A Report on the Human Resources Dimension of Public      Diplomacy.'' This report highlights the public diplomacy void      that has existed since 1999 when the United States      Information Agency was eliminated and its functions were      merged into the State Department. The report states that most      foreign service officers fail to grasp the importance of      public diplomacy, and at best, they merely pay lip service to      it. The report also discusses the lack of recruitment of U.S.      diplomats with the appropriate people skills for public      diplomacy. The report cites the need for more training for      our diplomats so that they might have the knowledge and the      skills to effectively interact with people from other      countries.       Newly hired foreign service officers frequently work at      U.S. Consulates processing visa applications for persons      wishing to travel to the U.S. This is a high stress job and      it demands that they possess strong interpersonal skills.      While serving as the director of the Peace Corps program in      the Dominican Republic, I frequently heard anecdotes from      Dominicans who had received rude treatment when seeking visas      at the U.S. Consulate. While the visa application process      requires extensive screening, all visa applicants should      receive prompt and courteous service. U.S. diplomats who      engage in arrogant behavior towards visa applicants create      ill will and plant seeds of hatred towards America.       Another aspect of public diplomacy that needs attention is      the manner in which officers of the Bureau of Customs and      Border Protection receive and process arriving international      visitors. Since the events of 2001, the work of Customs and      Border Protection officers has become more stressful and      challenging. While most officers perform well, there are some      who do not receive international visitors with courtesy.      Customs and Border Protection officers play a huge public      diplomacy role. When officers are surly, they offend      international visitors to the United States.       The Bureau of Customs and Border Protection should      incorporate customer service training into its curriculum for      all personnel. When developing this training, it would be      wise to tap the experience of companies like the Disney      Corporation which has a track record of receiving throngs of      people with respect and courtesy. Courteous treatment upon      arrival in our Nation can pay dividends by promoting a      positive image of the United States.       The State Department and the U.S. Agency for International      Development (USAID) can achieve immediate impact in public      diplomacy by requiring all contractors and grantees to      incorporate public diplomacy aspects into their work. USAID      utilizes many for-profit and not-for-profit organizations to      provide services in areas such as democracy, economic      development, governance, health, public works, and rule of      law. All organizations that undertake work abroad on behalf      of USAID have an important public diplomacy responsibility.       USAID should require grantees and contractors, whenever      feasible, to hire project managers who speak the language of      the country where they are working. Personnel working abroad      on USAID funded projects should undergo orientation training      about local culture and customs.       International visitor programs play a key role in      successful public diplomacy. For nearly sixty years, the      State Department has funded visits by thousands of      international visitors to acquaint them with our country.      Often, these visitors eventually become leaders in their      countries. The President of France, Nicolas Sarkozy, traveled      to the U.S. in 1985 on a State Department sponsored trip.      Today he is regarded as one of the most pro-U.S. leaders in      France.       The State Department's Bureau of Educational and Cultural      Affairs funds most of the government sponsored international      visitor and scholarship programs. The bureau has rules in      place stipulating that prime contractors and grantees for      State Department funds must be in existence for a minimum of      four years. These rules stifle innovative programming by new      organizations and inhibit the ability of community based      groups beyond the Capital Beltway to access funding.       For most international visitor programs, the State      Department contracts with the same large East Coast      organizations. These organizations rely on a patchwork of      community based groups across the U.S. to organize meaningful      professional, educational, and cultural programs for      international visitors. Unfortunately, these East Coast      organizations pass on very little, if any, funding to      communities that have agreed to receive international      visitors. Hosting of international visitors relies on local      volunteers and in-kind support. The lack of financial      resources at the local level results in a huge disparity in      the quality of programming that international visitors      receive.       Some communities like Tulsa, Oklahoma do a superb job in      organizing and managing international visitor programs. Since      1995, the Tulsa Global Alliance has provided excellent      programs in this area. Tulsa has developed an organizational      model that relies on a mix of professional and volunteer      support. The Tulsa program has been successful in developing      a broad funding base that provides more than $400,000 per      year for international visitor activities. Funding comes from      corporations, individual donors, foundations, program fees,      and limited grants from the State Department.       It is recommended that the State Department modify its      rules for funding international visitor programs. Contracts      for large organizations should require that they provide      grants of at least 25 percent of their total project budgets      to be passed on to international visitor committees at the      local level. This funding will help provide needed resources      to ensure that high quality programs are offered to      international visitors. The public diplomacy implications of      these international visitor programs are too important not to      have sufficient funding.       The Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs of the State      Department should give priority to funding small and newly      established organizations engaged in international visitor      programs. The Bureau should be encouraged to make available      up to 25 percent of its budget for international visitor      programs to small and newly established organizations. This      new approach would open the door for communities across      America to develop their own capacity to implement high      quality international visitor programs. The end goal would be      that each international visitor would have a fulfilling      experience in the U.S.       The security of America and the future of our democracy      demand more commitment to public diplomacy. To keep America      safe and to protect our values, ideals, and principles, we      must build bridges of understanding with people across the      globe.                          ____________________
