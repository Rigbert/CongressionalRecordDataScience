 President, today I am introducing a private relief bill on behalf of Shing Ma ``Steve'' Li. Steve is a Peruvian national who lives in San Francisco, California. He was brought to the United States as a child and is now a student at City College of San Francisco hoping to become a nurse.  I decided to introduce a private bill on Steve's behalf because I believe that Steve would suffer undue hardship if he were removed to Peru. Without this legislation, Steve would be separated from his family and his community, and returned to a country he does not know.  Steve was only 12 years old when his parents brought him to the United States. Steve's parents are Chinese nationals who originally fled China to escape economic oppression and the Chinese government's policies on reproductive rights. From China, his parents went to Peru, where Steve was born.  The family then sought asylum in the United States, which was denied. Steve was ordered removed to Peru, where he was born, while his parents were ordered removed to China, the country of their nationality. Steve's parents would not be able to accompany their son to Peru.  Steve's parents never told him about the asylum denial or the removal orders. Steve did not know that he was in the United States illegally, and he went through all of his teenage years in the United States believing he was legally allowed to be here. He did not learn about his deportation order until one morning this past September when Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrived at his home and took him into custody.  All too often, youngsters like Steve are put in the position of being returned to a country they do not know. These young people did not make the choice to come to the United States but were brought to this country by their parents. Many of these young people grew up in America and have little or no memory of the countries they came from. They are hard working young people dedicated to their education. They have stayed out of trouble. Some are valedictorians and honor roll students. Many are community leaders and have an unwavering commitment to serving the United States.  I hoped that the Senate would pass the DREAM Act last year to provide qualified young people the opportunity to contribute to this country and their communities. Unfortunately, the bill fell short of the 60 votes it needed to move forward. I hope the Senate will one day pass the DREAM Act. The legislation I am introducing today will provide one of these youngsters the opportunity give back to the country he calls home.  Steve attended George Washington High School in San Francisco, California. While there, he was enrolled in the Honor's Program and became very involved in his high school community. Steve was an athlete on the cross country and track team. He worked for the school newspaper as a reporter, editor, and cameraman. Demonstrating his desire to educate his community on health issues, Steve also provided presentations to other students through his high school's wellness program on the risks of drinking and driving and sexually transmitted diseases.  Steve graduated high school in 2008 and enrolled at City College of San Francisco to pursue a career in nursing. City College of San Francisco awarded Steve the Goldman Scholarship to cover the cost of his tuition. Steve has continued his active involvement in his community, joining the Asian American Student Success Center, as well as the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Program, which is a 2-year outreach and educational support program.  Steve continued his commitment to academic achievement when he attended the San Francisco State University Summer Science Institute, which provided a year-long internship to prepare him for a career in health care upon his graduation from college.  Educators working with Steve highlight his potential for giving back to the United States, while Steve's friends and other community members have contacted me about the impact his compassion and helpfulness has had on the community. Steve's teachers call him a ``great student,'' ``hard working,'' ``an exceptional student,'' and ``goal directed.''  This private bill is an opportunity for Steve to finish his education and remain in the country he considers his only home. If he were forced to relocate to Peru, his education would be cut short, and Steve would be sent to a place where he knows no one. I believe that, by staying in California, Steve will only continue to serve his community and serve this country as a health care professional.  I ask my colleagues to support this private bill.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 448       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
