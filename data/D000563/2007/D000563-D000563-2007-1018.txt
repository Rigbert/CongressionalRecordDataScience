President, I have an amendment which I filed last week with Senator Bingaman on conflict-of-interest issues before the advisory committees of the Food and Drug Administration. I understand there may be an objection--I hope there is not--to setting aside the pending amendment and calling this one up for consideration. I don't want to catch anyone off guard with my request. I hope the Senator from Wyoming will note what I am about to request. If it is not consistent with his current wishes, I am asking unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside and that we move to amendment No. 1034 which I have filed at the desk.
