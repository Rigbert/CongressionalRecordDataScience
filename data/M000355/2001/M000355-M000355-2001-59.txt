S. Attorneys, there are a number before the committee--I don't have the number before me--that have not been acted upon.  The concern of the Republican conference, I assure my friend from Nevada and Members of the Senate, is not about U.S. Attorneys and about U.S. marshals. As we all know, those offices have a number of professional civil servants. In the U.S. Marshal Service and the Assistant U.S. Attorneys, typically when there is a U.S. Attorney vacancy, there is an acting U.S. Attorney. They are able to function. But a judge who isn't there can't rule. When you have a judicial vacancy, you have a vacancy. There isn't such a thing as an assistant judge, a civil servant who can sit in cases and make rulings. The U.S. Attorneys offices are functioning. The U.S. Marshal Service is functioning. Absent judicial seats do not function.  With regard to whether or not all the paperwork is in, I say to my friend from Nevada, I do now recall that the chairman has prepared a new questionnaire that he has sent out, I am told, over the last couple of weeks. Since there is a brandnew questionnaire that just went out in the last couple of weeks, it could be some of those are not in. But until the last 2 weeks, the understanding of the committee was that the completion of the ABA report completed a file. That has happened with 29 of district and circuit judges who are ready to be acted upon. It is time to move.  I see my friend and colleague from Arizona is here. I am happy to yield the floor.
