I recollect a few months ago there was a release on the Web site of the USDA suggesting they were going to relax, if not remove, the salmonella standard for school lunch programs. Many people saw it and started to respond.  If I am not mistaken, the very next morning, Ari Fleischer at the White House, in the opening briefing said: This is not true; it is not where the USDA stands; we are for the strictest standard when it comes to the presence of salmonella in ground beef for school lunch programs.  What the Senator from Iowa is arguing for, if I am not mistaken, is the position of the USDA, and the position President Bush has taken, is that they will establish the standards--the district court case in Texas notwithstanding.  The Senator from Iowa, a Democratic Senator, is offering a reaffirmation of the position taken by both Democratic and Republican Departments of Agriculture. Does the Senator from Iowa recall this?
