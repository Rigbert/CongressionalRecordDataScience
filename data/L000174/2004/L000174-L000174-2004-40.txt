President, as we near the end of this session, I am disappointed to report that Congress seems content to let the issue of foreign prisoner abuse linger without effective congressional oversight. Some have argued that continuing to investigate this matter will drag it out, and have the effect of preventing us from putting the scandal behind us. I disagree. We have to uncover the full truth in order to ensure that such abuses are not repeated. I am sorry to report that each week brings new allegations that reveal how much we still do not know.  Last week, I spoke on this floor about a recent Los Angeles Times article that raised troubling new allegations about the abuse of Afghan detainees in Gardez, including the death of one detainee that was never reported up the chain of command. The article revealed what appears to be a complete disregard for established Army procedure among certain units in Afghanistan.  I sent a letter to Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld on October 1, 2004, asking him several questions about the allegations raised in the news article. I asked Secretary Rumsfeld to explain how the special forces base at Gardez was allegedly allowed to operate with no recordkeeping requirements or standing operating procedures--an allegation that was corroborated by a U.S. Army investigator in Afghanistan. I asked whether any official policy allowed special forces units to suspend normal recordkeeping requirements while operating in Afghanistan or Iraq. I asked if there is an official policy to allow special forces units to detain prisoners in local Afghan jails or other undisclosed facilities. I asked Secretary Rumsfeld for a prompt response and hope that he delivers one soon.  Even without the answers to these questions, we now know that senior officials in the White House, the Justice Department, and the Pentagon set in motion a systematic effort to minimize, distort, and even ignore our international agreements on torture and the treatment of prisoners. I am dismayed to report that some Members of Congress are now attempting to make it much easier for the administration to circumvent our treaty obligations. The 9/11 Recommendations Implementation Act, H.R. 10, was recently introduced by the House Republican leadership. Sections 3032 and 3033 of that bill would make it official U.S. policy to exclude certain non-citizens from the protection of the Convention Against Torture, a treaty to which the United States is a party. To enact such language after the abuses that took place at Abu Ghraib and other locations would further undermine the once distinguished reputation of the United States as a world leader on human rights.  Reports of the administration's support of these provisions are conflicting. Last week, Speaker Hastert's office claimed that the Justice Department ``wants and supports'' the provisions. The Justice Department declined to offer an official endorsement of sections 3032 and 3033, but claimed that it favored any ``provisions that will better secure our borders and protect the American people from terrorists.'' In an attempt to reconcile these statements, Senator Kennedy and I sent Attorney General Ashcroft a letter on October 1 urging him to repudiate the Department's support for these sections. We were pleased to learn this week that the White House went on record in opposition to the provisions, but we still await a reply from the Attorney General definitively stating the position of the Department of Justice.  Next Friday, October 15, is the deadline imposed by a Federal judge for the administration to turn over or identify all documents relating to the treatment of prisoners held by the United States at military bases and other detention facilities overseas. In his order, Judge Hellerstein stated: ``No one is above the law: not the executive, not the Congress, not the judiciary.'' I could not agree more. Unfortunately, this administration has continually ignored my requests for these documents--I will not be surprised if it refuses to comply with this court order. I would note that the original Freedom of Information Act request for these documents was submitted in October 2003, a year ago. Any embarrassment their release may cause now--less than 3 weeks before the Presidential election--is due to the administration's own stonewalling.  As the 108th Congress comes to a close, many questions about the prison abuse scandal will undoubtedly remain unanswered. Several Pentagon investigations are now complete, but none of them paint a complete and unbiased assessment of the prisoner abuse scandal. This Senate, and in particular the Judiciary Committee and Governmental Affairs Committee, failed to fulfill its oversight responsibilities. I have said many times there needs to be a thorough, independent investigation of the actions of those involved, from the people who committed abuses, to the officials who set these policies in motion. Perhaps in the new year, with a new Congress, the administration in power will be ready to seek the full truth about this scandal and begin the process of restoring honor to our nation.  I ask unanimous consent that the letters to Secretary Rumsfeld and Attorney General Ashcroft, both dated October 1, 2004, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                      U.S. Senate,                                   Committee on the Judiciary,                                  Washington, DC, October 1, 2004.     Hon. Donald Rumsfeld,     Secretary of Defense,     Washington, DC.       Dear Secretary Rumsfeld: As you know, I am deeply troubled      by the revelations of abuse of prisoners in U.S. custody      overseas. I have closely monitored the numerous ongoing and      completed investigations instigated by the Pentagon, but      remain skeptical that these investigations will uncover the      full truth. Each of these probes is limited in scope or      authority and, therefore, none will comprehensively      investigate the abuse of detainees. Each week brings new      allegations that reveal how much we still do not know.       I am particularly disturbed by a story published in the Los      Angeles Times on September 21, 2004. This article raises      troubling new allegations about the abuse of Afghan detainees      in Gardez, but also reveals what appears to be a complete      disregard for established Army procedure among certain units      in Afghanistan. According to the news report, based in part      on a report written by Afghan prosecutors for the Afghan      Attorney General, U.S. Army Special Forces arrested eight      Afghan soldiers in March 2003 at the request of the      provincial governor. The prosecutors' report and an internal      memorandum prepared by a United Nations delegation both      allege American mistreatment of the detainees including      repeated beatings, immersion in cold water, electric shocks,      being hung upside down, and having toenails torn off. One      detainee, Jamal Naseer, reportedly died as a result of the      torture. The U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command (CID)      recently opened a criminal probe into Naseer's death.       This incident is very troubling, but it points to a much      larger problem. CID received a tip about Naseer's death      earlier this year, but stated that it could not investigate      the matter due to a lack of information. Christopher Coffey,      an Army detective based at Bagram air base, told the L.A.      Times: ``We're trying to figure out who was running the base.      We don't know what unit was there. There are no records. The      reporting     system is broke across the board. Units are transferred in      and out. There are no SOPs [standard operating procedures] .      . . and each unit acts differently.''       Apparently, because these units failed to follow Army      procedure, Naseer's death was never reported up the chain of      command. Yet, Lt. Gen. Mikolashek's report on detainee      operations inspection, released in July of this year,      conclusively stated that the team ``that visited Iraq and      Afghanistan discovered no incidents of abuse that had not      been reported through command channels; all incidents were      already under investigation.'' We now know that this      statement cannot be accurate. What we do not know is      whether and how many other deaths, let alone cases of      abuse, may have gone unreported.       I also have new questions about the Defense Department's      involvement in the ``ghost detainee'' matter. The Fay-Jones      report revealed that the ghost detainee problem in Iraq was      far more pervasive than the Defense Department had previously      acknowledged, but that report placed much of the blame on the      CIA. The L.A. Times story, however, accuses U.S. Special      Forces commanders in Afghanistan of using local jails to hide      prisoners off of the official roles.       In order to better understand the situation in Afghanistan,      and the role of the Department in monitoring the actions of      forces on the ground, I ask that you respond to the following      questions by October 8, 2004.       1. Please explain how the Special Forces base at Gardez was      allowed to operate with no recordkeeping requirements or      Standing Operating Procedures (SOPs).       2. Did any official policy allow Special Forces units to      suspend normal recordkeeping requirements or chain of command      reporting while operating in Afghanistan or Iraq?       3. Did any official policy allow Special Forces units to      detain prisoners in local Afghan jails, or in any other      undisclosed facilities?       4. Mr. Coffey's quote above suggests that an unknown number      of detention centers have operated or are now operating in      Afghanistan with total impunity. In light of the allegations      raised in the L.A. Times story, what actions is the Pentagon      taking to investigate the situation and resolve the problems?       5. In the absence of recordkeeping and SOPs, do you agree      that none of the ongoing or completed Pentagon investigations      can claim to have uncovered all allegations of abuse?       6. Are any other government entities, such as the CIA or      other intelligence agencies, involved in the operation of      these detention centers or in the treatment or interrogation      of prisoners? If so, please describe the agencies and their      role. If the answer to this or any other question contained      in this letter is classified, please submit your answer in      classified form and make it available to appropriately      cleared staff.       As stated above, I request that you answer these questions      by October 8, 2004. Thank you for your prompt attention to      this matter.           Sincerely,                                                    Patrick Leahy,     Ranking Member.                                  ____                                                      U.S. Senate,                                   Committee on the Judiciary,                                  Washington, DC, October 1, 2004,     Hon. John D. Ashcroft,     Attorney General, Department of Justice,     Washington, DC.       Dear Attorney General Ashcroft: We write to express our      deep concern about the report in yesterday's Washington Post      that the Department supports the ``rendition'' of detainees      to nations where they are likely to be tortured.       The United States is a party to the Convention Against      Torture, which provides that ``No State Party shall expel,      return or extradite a person to another State where there are      substantial grounds for believing he would be in danger of      being subjected to torture.'' Since 9/11, there have been      numerous reports that detainees in the custody of U.S.      military or intelligence officials have been transferred for      interrogation to governments known to torture prisoners.      According to such reports, detainees who refuse to cooperate      with U.S. interrogators have been ``rendered'' to foreign      intelligence services in Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Morocco,      Syria, and other countries that practice torture. One report      stated that Deputy Attorney General Thompson approved the      rendition to Syria of a Canadian citizen, who was confined in      a small dark cell for a year and beaten on his palms, wrists,      and back with an electric cable. Syrian officials later      released him, telling reporters they found no link to Al      Qaeda.       Until now, Administration officials have denied any      involvement in this practice. At a Senate Armed Services      Committee hearing on May 11, Undersecretary of Defense for      Intelligence Stephen Cambone testified that ``to the best of      [his] knowledge'' the Administration was fully complying with      all legal requirements and that all reports of U.S. officials      engaging in the practice of rendition were false.       Yesterday's report, however, states that the Department is      urging House Republicans to include provisions in the 9/11      intelligence reform legislation authorizing the practice of      renditions. Sections 3032 and 3033 of the bill, H.R. 10,      would require the Secretary of Homeland Security to issue new      regulations to exclude certain non-citizens from the      protection of the Convention Against Torture. The changes      would increase the burden of proof on any person being      deported or rendered to establish ``by clear and convincing      evidence that he or she would be tortured,'' and would deny      the jurisdiction of courts to review the new regulations or      claims brought under the Convention Against Torture by      aliens at ports of entry.       These changes would violate longstanding U.S. law and      policy, undermine basic humanitarian and human rights      standards, expose U.S. soldiers and citizens traveling abroad      to greater danger, and further weaken America's standing in      the world.       Yet the spokesman for House Speaker Hastert is quoted in      the report as saying that the Department ``really wants and      supports'' these provisions. Department spokesman Mark      Corallo was also quoted as saying, ``We can't comment on any      specific provision, but we support those provisions that will      better secure our borders and protect the American people      from terrorists.''       No Department official should express support, either      openly or behind the scenes, for provisions that so clearly      violate fundamental human rights. Torture defies our laws and      stains our ideals. The abuses at Abu Ghraib prison have been      a major setback in the war on terrorism. An essential part of      winning that war and protecting the country for the future is      respect for the ideals that America stands for at home and      throughout the world.       The Department has already undermined those ideals by      issuing legal memoranda attempting to weaken the definition      of torture and eliminate restraints imposed by U.S. laws and      international treaties on the conduct of Executive Branch      officials. We urge you to repudiate immediately and without      qualification the Department's support for sections 3032 and      3033 in the House legislation, and to put an immediate halt      to any Administration involvement in the illegal practice of      rendition.           Sincerely,     Edward M. Kennedy,       U.S. Senator.     Patrick Leahy,       Ranking Member.                          ____________________
