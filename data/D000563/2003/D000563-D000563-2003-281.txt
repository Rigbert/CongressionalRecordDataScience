      Social Security as we know it is a system in which each      generation's payroll taxes are mainly used to support the      previous generation's retirement. If contributions from      younger workers go into personal accounts instead, the      problem is obvious. Who will pay benefits to today's retirees      and older workers? Privatization creates a financial hole      that must be filled by slashing benefits, providing large      financial transfers.  The obvious question to the supporters of privatization is, Where will you find the $2 trillion that makes your proposal honest? Without filling that financial hole with $2 trillion, you have a theory that is too good to be true.
