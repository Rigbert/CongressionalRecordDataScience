 President, yesterday, the Supreme Court overturned the Gun Free Schools Zones Act, a 1990 law sponsored by Senator Kohl and others that made it a felony to bring a gun within 1,000 feet of a school. The case revolves around a San Antonio youth who was tried for bringing a .38 caliber to school, and the decision has ignited widespread debate because it reverses decades of Supreme Court precedent.  However, as a result of this controversy, it is extremely important to clarify the status of a separate, recently passed law, which has a similar name--the Gun-Free Schools Act of 1994--but remains firmly in place.  Parents, teachers, and school officials must know that gun possession on campus cannot be tolerated, that the Gun-Free Schools Act of 1994 remains in place, and that in order to receive Federal education funds every school district in the Nation must soon have in place and functioning a policy that assures that any youngster who brings a gun to school will be expelled for not less than 1 year.  The following points must be clearly understood:  First, the Gun-Free Schools Act of 1994 was not struck down by the Supreme Court yesterday.  Instead, the Court struck down a 1990 criminal law with a similar-sounding name--but a different legal status.  Second, the Gun-Free Schools Act of 1994 will not be swept away by the Court's decision.  By simply requiring schools to have a zero tolerance policy as a condition of receiving Federal education funds, the Gun-Free Schools Act does not rely on the commerce clause for its authority.  Third, the Gun-Free Schools Act remains in place, and zero tolerance policies are already showing positive results.  [[Page S5748]] Many school districts such as New York, Los Angeles, and San Diego that have already implemented zero tolerance policies are seeing fewer guns brought to school, and as a result fewer student expulsions.  In San Diego, gun possession on campus was cut in half during 1993, the first year of that district's policy, and there have been only 5 gun possession cases during this year.  Under the Gun-Free Schools Act, States have until October 1995 to enact or revise their own zero tolerance policies for school districts, requiring that students caught with guns on campus be expelled for not less than a year.  Fourth, the Court's decision to revoke Federal law does not affect State laws outlawing gun possession on campus.  Forty States, including California, have their own criminal statutes making gun possession on or near a school a State crime.  California's statute, signed into law by Pete Wilson, makes possession of a gun within 1,000 feet of a school a felony crime.  The Gun-Free Schools Act of 1994, which I have strongly supported, was passed last year in response to the increasing gun violence on school grounds, and the failure of many schools to respond clearly and forcefully to the presence of guns on campus.  In 1993, a Los Angeles high school student was shot waiting in line for lunch, and two other California high school students were killed within a 1-month period.  Over 100,000 guns are brought to school each day, according to several recent surveys and national projections.  There have been 105 violent school-related deaths in just the last 2 years, according to the Centers for Disease Control--caused by guns, knives, and other weapons.  In a nationwide survey, the CDC also found that 1 in 12 students brought a gun to school in 1993--up from 1 in 24 just three years before.  However, in too many school districts students who bring guns to school are simply given a short suspension, counseling, or transferred to another school.  By requiring that offenders be expelled from the regular school program, the Gun-Free Schools Act mirrors policies in a growing number of State education codes and urban school district policies.  School violence--especially deadly violence--must be the Nation's top educational priority.  Sixty-five students and six school employees were shot and killed at U.S. schools during 1985-90, according to the Center To Prevent Hand Violence.  Without being safe in school, neither teachers nor students can be expected to focus on learning.  In conclusion, there must be no uncertainty about the status of the Gun-Free Schools Act of 1994. Gun possession on campus cannot be tolerated, the Gun-Free Schools Act of 1994 remains in place, and in order to receive Federal education funds every school district in the Nation must soon have in place and functioning a policy that assures that any youngster who brings a gun to school will be expelled for not less than 1 year.                          ____________________
