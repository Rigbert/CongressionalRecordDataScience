Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I do not know why I should read this explanation, it was read before, if anybody was listening; but the manager's amendment consists of a number of provisions that Members have requested in order to improve our bill.  Some of these amendments clarify existing language in the bill to ensure that we truly have a better system of security for the traveling public. Others are intended to provide additional assistance to those who suffered substantial increased costs due to Federal security mandates since September 11.  We change the title of the bill to better reflect the fact that this bill federalizes the airport screening process, and want to make that clear.  The new title of this bill is ``Airport Security Federalization Act.''  The manager's amendment provides much-needed assistance to airports to meet their increased security expenses by authorizing $1.5 billion to cover increased security costs into FY 2003.  The amendment authorizes the Under Secretary to deputize screeners as Federal transportation security agents and ensure that such agents operate under common standards, badges, uniforms, and insignias.  We increase the requirements for retroactive background checks for screeners and airport employees.  The amendment strengthens existing language in the bill on the screeners who check baggage and sets a deadline for screening of all baggage for December 31, 2003.  The amendment addresses compensation for air marshals and ensures that they will be able to travel back to their homes without charge when they leave active duty status.  This is a good amendment. This amendment has been discussed and greatly improves the bill.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
