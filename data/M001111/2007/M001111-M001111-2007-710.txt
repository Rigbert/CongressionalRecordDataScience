 With that change, the White House was then able to install interim U.S. attorneys indefinitely without going through the normal Senate approval process.  This bill which is before us now restores the role of the Senate in confirming interim nominees. This legislation will force the White House to work with the Senate and home State Senators. This bill is an important step to protecting the U.S. Attorney's Office from the politicization it has suffered.  I urge my colleagues to take a step forward for justice and pass this critical reform today.  I yield the floor.
