speaker, I rise today in support of HR 2676, legislation to restructure and reform the Internal Revenue Service. I believe this is the most important issue currently being debated in households and businesses throughout the country. This is an enormous task for Congress, but one I believe we are ready, willing and able to tackle.  Ever since this issue became a national debate, I have heard from many constituents about their experiences with the IRS. To no one's surprise, the stories were filled with fear and anguish and anger. I did not hear one positive story. This has only reinforced my belief that the IRS is an agency that abuses its power and takes advantage of honest citizens. We have allowed our current system to become monstrous, unmanageable, and in some cases corrupt, and it is up to us to end the IRS as we know it and scrap the current tax code.  The legislation before us today is straightforward and non-partisan. This is not the debate about choosing between a flat tax or a national sales tax. It is not about whether we are Republicans or Democrats. This about representing our constituents and responding to their requests for help. It is unconscionable that criminals in this country are innocent until proven guilty, but taxpayers are not. HR 2676 will change this practice and finally hold the IRS accountable to taxpayers and force the IRS to bear the burden of proof when conducting an audit.  I am committed to improving the tax code and reforming the IRS. HR 2676 is much needed legislation that will benefit every American and I will be voting in favor of this much needed reform. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do the same.
