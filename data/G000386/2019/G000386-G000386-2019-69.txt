 President, before I read, I want to apologize to the Small Business Women of America because October is National Women's Small Business Month, and my apologies because this speech should have been given on October 1 rather than at the end of the month.  October is National Women's Small Business Month, and I want to recognize the many women-owned businesses. They really help make our economy stronger. In Iowa, we work hard to inspire women to start businesses and support them in their entrepreneurial journeys.  According to American Express, Iowa ranks eighth out of 50 States for growth in the number of women-owned businesses, as well as in their own growth in employment and revenues.  The network growth for women entrepreneurs and access to resources have helped make the difference in these women's lives and our communities. I hope that this growth will continue and that we will continue to have a massive increase in the number of women's small businesses in America.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 further minute as in morning business.
