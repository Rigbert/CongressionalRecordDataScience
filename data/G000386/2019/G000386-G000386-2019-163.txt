 President, Iowans from the organization Iowa Safe Schools asked me to note that July 15 is the kickoff of their annual Pride Camp. They tell me that it is an opportunity to learn valuable life skills and network with other LGBTQ youth in a supportive and nurturing environment and that it is a week full of fun and learning for its attendees.                          ____________________
