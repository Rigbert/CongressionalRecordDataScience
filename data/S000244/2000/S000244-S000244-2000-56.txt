Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Souder) for sponsoring this bill, which he introduced on the 30th anniversary of the Apollo 11 landing on the moon last year.  The enormous success of the Apollo program clearly stands as a watershed event in American history and one of man's greatest scientific achievements. The Apollo Exploration Award Act provides a fitting and tangible tribute to each of the astronauts who dedicated themselves and risked their lives for the Apollo program.                              {time}  1130  It recognizes and commemorates their bravery, substantial scientific and technical achievements, and unique contributions to American and world history.  I would like to note that these tremendous accomplishments were only possible due to the ingenuity, diligence, and determination of the men and women of NASA and the aerospace community who made the Apollo program a success. I only wish it were possible to recognize each and every one of these men and women for their contributions to the program as well.  Since the time of the Apollo program, the astronauts have promoted space exploration and scientific excellence by sharing their experiences with the American people and the world, stimulating the imagination and the belief that any goal can be achieved. I believe these contributions need to be recognized.  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
