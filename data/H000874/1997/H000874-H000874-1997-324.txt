Speaker, I am pleased to introduce today, along with Congressmen Cardin and Stark, the Medicare Medically Necessary Dental Care Act. This bill will improve health care for thousands of senior citizens and save the Nation millions of dollars in Medicare costs.  Under current law, Medicare cannot pay for outpatient dental work. However, untreated dental problems can lead to expensive complications when other unrelated procedures are performed. The failure to treat these conditions has both a high cost in suffering for seniors and a high price tag for Medicare.  The Medically Necessary Dental Care Act would permit Medicare to pay for dental care when it is necessary to prevent complications in valvular heart disease, cancer of the head or neck, lymphoma, leukemia, and organ transplants. While expanding dental coverage in these areas is estimated to cost nearly $17 million, the act would save Medicare about $117 million by preventing further complications. The bill would also give the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services the authority to expand coverage of medically necessary oral health care in connection with other medical problems if the Health Care Finance Administration determines that the dental coverage will result in cost savings to Medicare.  Take the case of Alma, a senior citizen in Baltimore who underwent a heart valve replacement surgery. Not long ago, she went to the University of Maryland medical system emergency room with a racing heart, fever, chills, and pain in her mouth. Alma was diagnosed with an acute abscess over her upper front teeth which had led to a systemwide infection. She was hospitalized, and will have to undergo 6 weeks of intravenous antibiotics to knock out the infection. In addition. she will probably have to have her heart valves replaced again.  In many ways, Alma is lucky. Dental infection is a common cause of complications in heart valve replacement patients, and some die before their infection can be stabilized. Medicare covered the cost of Alma's hospitalization, and will pay the $20,000 to $40,000 bill if her heart valves have to be replaced again. But all of this could have been avoided by a simple dental checkup and treatment before her first surgery.  A few years ago, James, another Maryland senior, was diagnosed with neck cancer and treated with radiation therapy to his head and neck. Over time, James started to feel pain in his lower jaw, and to have difficulty opening his mouth. His doctor diagnosed a jaw fracture, caused by radiation-related complications of previously infected teeth. To cure the problem, James underwent three surgeries, including removal of a portion of his jaw and a hip graft to replace it. Removal of James's infected teeth before radiation would have cost less than $300, but Medicare covered the actual cost of $27,950.  This bill is supported by the American Association of Hospital Dentists, the American Society for Geriatric Dentistry, the Academy of Dentistry for Persons With Disabilities, the American Association of Dental Research, the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry, the American Association of Dental Schools, and the American Association of Public Health Dentistry. More importantly, it will save taxpayers millions, while improving the quality of life for senior citizens. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation.                          ____________________
