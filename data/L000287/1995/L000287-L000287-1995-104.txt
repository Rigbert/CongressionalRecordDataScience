Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague and my friend, the gentleman from New Jersey, for participating in this special order, for his remarks, and for taking the time out to remember the people that participated in the march from Selma to Montgomery. I think it is fitting and appropriate tonight that we pause and commemorate, to take stock of the distance we have come as a Nation and as a people. I think as a Nation and as a people, we are on our way down that long road to creating a truly interracial democracy in America, a creative and beloved community, the open society, and this is what America is all about, creating a society where all of our people are able to participate and share in the fruits and dream of this great country of ours.  So tonight, as we commemorate, as we celebrate, as we pause, as I stated before, we have a distance to go, but we are on our way and there will be no turning back.  I would like to, Mr. Speaker, yield to a colleague and a friend, the gentleman from Louisiana [Mr. Fields], who, if not for the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the march from Selma to Montgomery, Mr. Fields, like many of us, would not be here tonight.
