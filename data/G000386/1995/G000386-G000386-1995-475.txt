 President, first I want to make a unanimous-consent request. I am doing it for the Republican leadership and it is my understanding it has been approved by the Democratic side of the aisle.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 2:15 on Tuesday, January 10, the Senate proceed to vote on the McConnell second-degree amendment to the Ford amendment.
