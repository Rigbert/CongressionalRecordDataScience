Chairman, I would point out that the amendment, as the gentleman suggests, seeks to exempt the Department of Defense from paying any fines related to infractions which seem to be environmental in nature from the California Air Resources Board.  I would point out to my colleagues that, as they know, there are a large number of military bases in California, and I believe it is imperative to maintain good working relationships with the communities who host the bases, as well as the various State agencies who ensure good living conditions for all Californians.  Accepting this amendment could create the perception that the Federal military installations in California are above the law when dealing with environmental issues.  I would certainly urge a ``no'' vote on this particular amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr. LaMALFA Mr. Chairman, in responding to that, this is a very narrow amendment that simply gives a green light to our military installations that, yes, we welcome you in California, we like the idea that you are here providing a safety security net over not only our State, but to all of the United States, and that overzealous regulators have had actually a very hostile relationship with these installations, as well as many businesses in California. So we need to send a signal that they can no longer go unchecked with the ability to come write up a fine at any time they choose to.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
