 President, there is more wrong with the Affordable Care Act than just the Web site not working. In fact, the Web site is just a symptom of bigger problems.  Similar to my colleagues, I wish to share the problems Iowans have with the Affordable Care Act. So I come to the floor today to share just one of hundreds of emails, letters, and phone calls from my constituents in Iowa expressing sticker shock about the Affordable Care Act.  A working mother in Decorah, IA, who lost her employer-sponsored coverage for her family because of rising costs, wrote to me and said the following:       . . . comparable plans do not seem to exist on the      healthcare exchange. The closest we can come (and still see      our own doctors) cost almost $1050 per month. This represents      a 247% increase in cost over our prior employer provided      plan--and with much higher deductibles!       My husband is a self-employed small business owner. We      covered our family of 4 on my group health plan, which      includes a 21 year old adult daughter in college, who is not      a legal tax dependent. If we receive any `subsidy', it will      be insignificant in relation to the total jump in our out of      pocket costs related to the so called ``Affordable Care      Act''.       The general public seems to believe that anyone who does      not qualify for premium subsidies can easily afford a premium      increase--no matter how outrageous. Yet an increase of almost      250% in our personal cost of providing an inferior policy for      our family--which represents an increase in costs of roughly      20% of our gross income--can only be described as an absolute      disaster.  I think this email from a real person who is really living this train wreck of a health care law speaks for itself.  I yield the floor.
