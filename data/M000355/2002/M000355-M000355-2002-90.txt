 President, it is true that unions file a lot of papers. The problem is that accuracy is not required. This requires certified records--certified by a CPA--and it requires the presidents and secretaries of their treasuries to certify that the records are accurate.  Union corruption is a serious problem. This will help correct it. I urge colleagues to support the amendment.
