 President, I come to the floor today to set the record straight.  Defense Week reports that I made inaccurate statements during the recent debate on the Boxer-Grassley-Harkin amendment on executive compensation.  The article was written by Mr. Tony Capaccio and appears in the July 14 issue of his publication.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have that portion of the Defense Week article printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                    Senate Rejects Maverick Measure       In endorsing the committee proposal, the Senate in a 83-16      vote rejected an amendment by Sens. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.),      Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) and his Democrat counterpart Tom      Harkin.       Their amendment would have made permanent a $200,000 cap      applicable to all government contractors and not just the top      five in a headquarters or division.       In their floor debate, Boxer and Grassley singled out as an      example of the 1995 law's problems the compensation packages      of five top McDonnell Douglas Corp. corporate officers,      examined by a July 8 report GAO report.       The MDC executives, labeled Nos. 1 through 5, earned a      total of $14.8 million in 1995, according to information      contained in a March 31 DCAA report and repeated by GAO.      Boxer and Grassley said the GAO indicated that based on the      huge compensation packages, the 1995 cap was riddled with      loopholes.       Grassley declined to name the executives, saying their      identities were ``proprietary.'' Defense Week learned that      the unnamed executives, followed by their 1995 compensation      packages, are: CEO Harry Stoneciper, $4 million; Chairman of      the Board John F. McDonnell, $3.9 million; then-McDonnell      Douglas Aerospace Co. Executive Vice President & President      John Capellupo, $2.3 million; MDA Deputy President Herbert      Lanese, $2.3 million; and, then-Douglas Aircraft Co.      president Robert H. Hood, $2.2 million.       Grassley was inaccurate when he said during the floor      debate that the Pentagon picked up $9.2 million of the      compensation.       That was the amount corporate MDC allocated to the overhead      pools of divisions that had DOD contracts, according to      government officials. That overhead would then be divided      between commercial, general government and defense contracts.       It was not possible to trace how much actually the Pentagon      reimbursed.
