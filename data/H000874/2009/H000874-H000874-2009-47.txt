 Ladies and gentlemen of the House, as the House well knows, we are contemplating the consideration of the Health Care for All Americans Act on Saturday. We will be considering theamendments on the chemical protection bill that we are now considering tomorrow. We will consider perhaps some other suspensions as well.  My expectation is that on Saturday we will convene at 9 o'clock in the morning. I expect to have five 1-minute speeches on each side, as we usually do on Friday and the end of the week. We will then go to the rule on the health care bill, and then it is my expectation we will have consideration of the health care bill and the Republican substitute.  It is my expectation that if we proceed apace and come to a vote and disposition on that piece of legislation, that we would then adjourn Saturday at whatever hour we complete our work and that the adjournment would be to the 16th of November, the Monday of the following week.  We will convene on the 16th at 6:30 p.m. and meet through Friday of that week. It is my expectation, as I have indicated, that we would be off the following week, which is Thanksgiving week.  That's my present plan, which oft go awry, as all of us know, but that is my present plan for the balance of the month.
