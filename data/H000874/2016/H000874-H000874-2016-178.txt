Speaker, I rise to mark an important milestone in the history of the Fifth District and the State of Maryland. This year, the City of Bowie celebrates the centennial of its incorporation, which took place on April 18, 1916. In the intervening century, Bowie has grown and flourished, becoming the fifth-largest city in Maryland and a vibrant and diverse community.  Bowie has its roots in a small village called Huntington City that developed in 1870 alongside a railroad depot named for Maryland Governor Oden Bowie, a local resident who had been instrumental in bringing the railroad to the area. Within twelve years, the village had grown into a small town of several streets lined with shops and houses, which was renamed Bowie after the rail station. When the Town of Bowie was first incorporated in 1916, its first commissioners were R.P. Watts, William Luers, and Thomas P. Littlepage, who held their town meetings in the Knights of St. John Hall, which still stands today.  In the 1950's, Bowie began to spread south of the original railroad settlement to include new suburban developments. These included Belair at Bowie, whose annexation by the Town of Bowie marked the beginning of today's City of Bowie. Today, the city operates under the same charter as it adopted in 1916 and is home to approximately 56,000 Marylanders. While still retaining the feel of a small town, Bowie has grown to include a number of new suburban developments that have brought diversity and economic opportunity that are benefitting the residents of Bowie and the surrounding area.  I'm honored to represent the City of Bowie and its residents in Congress. Bowie continues to follow an upward trajectory of growth and development, and I look forward to continuing to work with the Mayor and city officials to ensure that Bowie has all the resources it requires to succeed. I hope my colleagues will join me in marking this important milestone for Bowie and wishing it much success as it enters its second century of incorporation.                          ____________________
