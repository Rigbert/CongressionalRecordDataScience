Mr. Speaker, today the Russian people are mourning the passing of one of their most respected citizens and renowned scholars. Academician Dmitri Likhachev has passed away at the age of ninety-two. He was, in the words of the distinguished historian of Russia and Librarian of Congress Dr. James Billington, ``an extraordinary human being, a person of great moral integrity.''  Academician Likhachev epitomized what Russia has endured in this century. Born in 1906 in St. Petersburg, as a university student he was sent to the brutal Solovki labor camps established by Lenin to deal with ``counter-revolutionaries.'' Later he was condemned with hundreds of thousands of other prisoners to dig Stalin's infamous White Sea Canal, the first major forced labor project of the Soviet period. During World War II, he survived the 900-day siege of his native city, renamed Leningrad.  Through all the deprivations and hardships of Soviet Russia, Dmitri Likhachev pursued his studies in medieval literature, ultimately becoming Russia's foremost literary and cultural historian. In 1970, he became a member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. When the Academy voted to expel dissident scientist Academician Andrei Sakharov from its ranks, Academician Likhachev was one of the few to defend Sakharov openly and vote against expulsion. Soon afterward, he barely escaped an attempt on his life.  After the Soviet Union collapsed and Russia regained its independence, AcademicianLikhachev became prominent for his defense of Russian culture. He helped preserve many architectural monuments in St. Petersburg, and lobbied the Russian Government to finance a television channel devoted to culture.  However, it was not only the physical destruction of his homeland that concerned Academician Likhachev. He condemned the moral wasteland left by seventy years of communism. ``Like other members of the Russian intelligencia,'' wrote the New York Times, ``Likhachev was deeply disappointed by the violence, greed and vulgarity that surfaced in Russian society after the fall of communism.'' Without overcoming the perverted morality created by communist rule, he warned, Russia could fall prey to an irrational demagoguery that could threaten the entire world.  With his love of country, combined with tolerance and reason, I believe Academician Likhachev embodied ``Russian nationalism'' in the best sense of the word. May his example and his ideas thrive in Russia of the 21st century.                          ____________________
