 President, let me just make a few observations, and then I will turn first to Senator Roberts.  The subject we would like to discuss is the Berwick nomination to be administrator of CMS. To be perfectly frank with you, I think many of us are alarmed by this nominee's focus on the British system, where government makes decisions for people on their care. In fact, I am reminded of a decision by the Department of Health and Human Services that I personally had a good deal of concern about last summer to limit the dissemination of information by companies who were in the Medicare Advantage business so that they could not communicate with their customers--clients--their opinions about legislation that would affect their product.  It was a stunning government gag order in effect saying to a corporation: You are not free to discuss a public issue before the Senate and the House; we are going to tell you what you can say. It was one of the most blatant examples of the government basicallysquashing free speech as a condition for doing business with the government.  Now we have this nominee who is applauding--applauding--a system where care is delayed, denied, or rationed. So I am particularly concerned this attack on free speech is just a first step toward much greater government intervention.  I will be talking with Dr. Berwick about his plans, but now I would like to turn to Senator Roberts, whom I know has already spoken to Dr. Berwick, maybe as recently as today, to get his thoughts on this nominee for this very important position.
