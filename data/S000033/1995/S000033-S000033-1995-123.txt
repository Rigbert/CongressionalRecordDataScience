 Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, the speech from the gentleman from Texas was very moving and interesting but totally irrelevant to what we are talking about right now. I bitterly resent the gentleman's suggestion that anyone here is Mexico bashing.  The issue is whether the taxpayers of the United States were put at risk $20 billion without one word of discussion or one vote on the floor of the House. If the gentleman disagrees with me, then he should participate in that debate on the floor of the House. Maybe he will win. Maybe he will not. But that is the way democracy works and that is what the Constitution mandates.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 8\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from California [Mr. Cox].
