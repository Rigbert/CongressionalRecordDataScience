Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I want to thank the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Rules for his very eloquent remarks. We all have very fond memories. I know my first trip to Vietnam along with the gentleman from New York (Mr. Gilman) on behalf of POWs was in 1984.  Mr. Solomon was again tenacious in trying to ensure that there was an absolutely thorough accounting and that any live sightings be followed up as aggressively as possible to ensure that nobody was left behind.
