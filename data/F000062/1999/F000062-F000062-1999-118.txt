 President, it is with real pleasure that I rise today to note the swearing-in this afternoon of California State Senator Diane Watson as United States Ambassador to the Federated States of Micronesia. Senator Watson's confirmation was a long time coming, and I am proud that today she will finally come to occupy the Ambassadorial posting which she so well deserves.  State Senator Watson was the first African-American women elected to the California State Senate, and has represented California's 26th District--which includes Los Angeles, Culver City, Ladera Heights, Baldwin Hills, Palms, Miracle Mile, Mar Vista, Cheviot Hills, and Koreatown--since 1978. Senator Watson has been a real leader in California politics and community life, and has been in the forefront of the fight for civil rights and human rights in Los Angeles and the entire state of California for her entire career. She was a dedicated crusader inthe desegregation of Los Angeles school, and, in 1975, became the first elected African American to serve on the Board of Education of the Los Angeles Unified School District.  Prior to her elected office, Senator Watson led a distinguished career in the field of education, including service as an assistant superintendent of child welfare, a school psychologist, and as a member of the faculty at both California State university Los Angeles and Long Beach. She has also traveled extensively, participating in numerous international conference on women's health issues, democracy building, and trade.  As a member of the State Senate and as an educator, Diane Watson has always brought honor to the organizations and people she has represented. For many years now she has been a leader in improving the lives of Californians, and I am pleased that the people of the United States will now also be able to benefit from her experience, energy, and talents as our Ambassador to the Federated States of Micronesia.                          ____________________
