 President, I thank the majority leader. I was not going to take the occasion today, but in light of the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island speaking on this issue, I do not take issue with what he said but emphasize a very important point, from my point of view: this issue of sovereignty in Lebanon and whether or not there was a tragic mistake made in this particular raid. I do not deny there was a tragic mistake that was made.  I know we all know and heard that the Israeli military had no intention of striking the target they, in fact, struck. That happens in war. But the full responsibility, in my view, falls on the Lebanese Government and the Syrian Government. How can we talk about sovereignty, how can we talk about the notion that you cannot violate a nation's borders when, in fact, one nation--and the nation in this case, Lebanon--has within its borders Hezbollah that is, in fact, not under its control but within its mandate, and take no action to stop the action they are taking, firing Katyusha rockets into civilian populations into Israel and Syria, which has control of much of that area, refusing to do anything to stop it, and then criticize Israel for acting.  I just ask you all, what would happen if across the Mexican border Katyusha rockets were being fired into El Paso, TX, on a regular basis and the Mexican Government did nothing whatsoever to stop the terrorists from that action? Is there any American who would say we should withhold taking action on the grounds that we are crossing an international border? I think we would not even think twice about it.  I regret deeply the mistaken target that was, in fact, hit. I am confident the Israelis do as well. But we should be putting international pressure on Syria and Lebanon to act and deal with the Hezbollah operating almost in plain view across the Israeli border terrorizing Israeli citizens.  I yield the floor and thank my colleagues.                          ____________________
