Chairman, I share a lot of the sentiments expressed by the chairman. But I would point out that both of these programs, both the Forest Service and the Park Service are authorized by the appropriators through October 1 of next year, which would give our committee more than ample time to authorize before the expiration. Just to have a degree of certainty because people are so concerned about the parks, I said, well, the parks would still fall under the 2-year extension here. But the Forest Service, I just want to make sure that we get it done and the other body does not somehow mess us up on this.
