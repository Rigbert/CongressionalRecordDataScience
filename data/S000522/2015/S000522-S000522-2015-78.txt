Madam Speaker, I thank my friend.  We live in an age of ultrasound imaging, the ultimate window to the womb and the child, that precious child, who resides there. We are in the midst of a fetal health care revolution, an explosion of benign interventions designed to diagnose, treat, and cure the precious lives of these children.  Abortion is antithetical to that. It dismembers, chemically poisons, shots to the heart, to stop the heart from beating. As you know--and I know my friend from New York is next to speak--at testimony before your committee, Dr. Levatino said--and he is an abortionist--he said the baby can be in any position in the uterus.  You just reach in with a Sopher clamp and grasp whatever you can. You pull out an arm, he went on to say. You pull out and reach in again and again, and you tear out the spine, intestine, heart, and lungs.  These are gruesome procedures. That is what abortion is all about: the dismemberment and chemical poisoning of children.  H.R. 7 will save lives. There is no doubt about that. The Hyde amendment--I remember when Henry Hyde was told that 1 million, maybe even more than 1 million children have survived because of the Hyde amendment.  Tears came down his face, knowing that those kids are now in the world, going to school, having their own families, playing soccer, and doing other great things.
