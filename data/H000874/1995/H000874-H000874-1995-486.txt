I know all of us would. I thank the chairman for his consideration. I would hope that we did not have the point of order. Again, if we feel we have to do that, I am pleased we will pursue it in another forum.  The CHAIRMAN (Mr. Dickey). The Chair is prepared to rule.  The gentleman from North Carolina makes a point of order against the amendment offered by the gentleman from Louisiana on the ground that it carries a tax measure in a bill reported by a committee--the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure--not having jurisdiction to report tax measures, in violation of clause 5(b) of rule XXI.  Current law authorizes the collection of certain user fees to cover the costs to the Coast Guard of various vessel inspections. The amendment offered by the gentleman from Louisiana proposes to limit some of those fees and, as an offset, to increase another such fee. In doing so, the amendment destroys the character of the increased levy as a user fee.  By increasing the fee charged by the Coast Guard for inspecting large, luxury, foreign-flag cruise ships by whatever amount is necessary to offset specified reductions in the fees charged for inspecting other vessels, the amendment attenuates the relationship between the amount of the increased fee and the cost of the particular government activity for which it is assessed.  Under the precedents recorded in section 846b of the House Rules and Manual, a fee that is calculated in an amount that is not merely commensurate with the cost of the governmental activities that the class of assessed parties make necessary, but instead is collected as a proxy for general revenue financing of general governmental activity of broader benefit, may constitute a tax or tariff within the meaning of clause 5(b) of rule XXI.  The Chair finds that the proposed increase in the fee charged for inspecting cruise ships overcollects for the costs of the governmental activities occasioned by the parties on whom it is assessed to such a degree that it is properly characterized as a tax or tariff under the rule.  Accordingly, the point of order is sustained.                              {time}  1745
