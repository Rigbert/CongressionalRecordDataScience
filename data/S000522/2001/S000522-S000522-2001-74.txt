Madam Speaker, I want to commend my good friend and colleague, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. LoBiondo), for this meaningful resolution and for his sensitivity and his bipartisanship in proffering it today and for naming the tech center, which is an outstanding center in New Jersey in his district, after Frank Lautenberg.  Madam Speaker, while I had serious differences with Senator Lautenberg from time to time especially on safeguarding unborn children there is no doubt that Frank worked tirelessly for the State of New Jersey. A self-made millionaire, he knew that hard work and industry are key ingredients in any endeavor. He was a great friend of Amtrak. We all know how vital Amtrak is to the Northeast Corridor and New Jersey in particular. The ridership continually climbs, not just because of aviation safety issues but because people like it; it is relatively inexpensive; and it gets you there on time and schedule, permits maximum flexibility in personal or professional planning.  He also worked very hard with me and as he did with other Members of our delgation. For example we recently had a specific need in Manasquan. We wanted to get a new state of the art motorized lifeboat, for sea rescues and recovery. Senator Lautenberg and I worked the procurement of the boat from both ends of the Capitol and succeeded.  He helped lead the effort against smoking on commercial aircraft. My mother died from lung cancer as a result of smoking and my family and I miss her dearly. We know that something on the order of 400,000 to 500,000 people will die from smoking every year. It's an outrage. Yet, having a flight attendant as a sister-in-law and a brother who is a pilot and 757 captain, we know that secondhand smoke can be very deleterious to one's health and can lead to lung cancer and emphysema and other anomalies attributable to smoking.  Finally, one seemingly obscure provision that Senator Lautenberg took the lead on that really does not make the front page, and it is something that I have worked with him on for many years, and that was known as the Lautenberg amendment. It was an amendment designed to assist, to facilitate emigration of Soviet Jews and otherpersecuted people in the Soviet Union as well as Indochinese nationals, to give them a special and a vitally necessary protection and refugee status.  Madam Speaker, normal refugee procedures require an adjudication of that case on a case-by-case basis. The record clearly indicated that many people, worthy individuals, were being improperly screened out and being left behind in a the country where tyranny did its terrible misdeeds to those individuals. Because the Soviets, for example, imposed such egregious repression on Jews and whole categories of people by reason of their inclusion and identification with that group, the Lautenberg amendment first adopted in 1990 stipulated that if the whole group was affected, they as individuals would be able to get the kind of protection refugee status that would lead to their freedom.                              {time}  1645  The Lautenberg amendment has resulted in freedom for thousands of people. Again, it never made a big splash in the media, but it is a very humanitarian piece of legislation for which he is the author.  I thank again my good friend, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. LoBiondo), for sponsoring this bill.
