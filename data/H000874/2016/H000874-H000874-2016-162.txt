 Mr. McCARTHY. One thing that Speaker Ryan has laid out for this body is that it is not top-down, it is bottom-up, and that we go through regular order. Committees are there to do their work.  Look at the metrics of just this last year: If you take the 25-year average, it is usually a little over 300 bills come through committee to this floor. We are well over 500. So we've shown that we are taking that path and improving on having them come to the floor.  I think what the Speaker said and what I read was that he may have a personal opinion, but he wants it to go through committee so that all voices are heard and we have the opportunity for amendments. When it gets out of committee, we can move it to the floor.  I will keep you posted on when it is scheduled.
