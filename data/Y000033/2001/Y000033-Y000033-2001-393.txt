Mr. Chairman, I would say to the gentlewoman that there is no doubt in my mind that there are currently adequate resources to provide all appropriate resources and necessary assistance for her constituents. I will work to guarantee that that remains the case. And even after this rescission, there is $1.6 billion remaining in that emergency fund. Should that not be sufficient in the future, we will react quickly to make sure any emergency is dealt with.
