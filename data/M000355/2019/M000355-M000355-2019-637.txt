 President, the Senate also needs to remain focused onour important job of funding the Federal Government.  Last week brought an unfortunate spectacle: The vast majority of our Democratic colleagues actually filibustered legislation to fund our national defense--at a dollar figure they had previously agreed to--for the sake of a political fight with the President.  The funding our commanders need to keep pace with China and Russia, the funding our men and women in uniform need for their tools and training, even a pay raise for our servicemembers--all of it was blocked by our Democratic colleagues, blocked by Democrats in order to pick a partisan fight with the White House. That is an interesting statement of priorities, but I remain hopeful that we can get this process back on track.  Back in July, both parties in both Houses of Congress and the White House all agreed to a bipartisan, bicameral roadmap to guide appropriations. We all agreed to rule out poison pill policy riders and not to seek changes in Presidential authorities relative to current law. So I hope we can rediscover that roadmap and make some progress. In the meantime, before the end of the week, we will vote on a continuing resolution to prevent a lapse in funding while the work continues.                          ____________________
