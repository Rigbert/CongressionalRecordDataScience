 The Supreme Court has always put political discourse in a special protected category. Pornography, by its very definition, has been excluded from first amendment protection.  My guess is that in that particular piece of litigation we didn't have a very good idea how the Supreme Court was going to decide and the Senator from Wisconsin is probably going to say why not take a chance here and see if the Court will uphold these restrictions on express advocacy.
