Mr. Speaker, the long and brutal campaign of terror against the Baha'i in Iran is unfortunately not a new issue to this House. Congress has passed resolutions on any number of occasions condemning the vicious persecution of the Baha'i at the hands of the Teheran regime, but the persecution continues.  In the last month the persecution has intensified, resulting in the death by execution of at least one man, Ruhollah Rowhani. The law under which he was convicted--which makes it a crime to convert a Muslim to the Baha'i faith or any other faith--is a clear and flagrant violation of the God-given and internationally recognized right to freedom of religion. Other Baha'i prisoners, who like Mr. Rowhani are guilty of nothing other than the nonviolent exercise of their faith, are now believed to be in grave and imminent danger. Since the current regime took power in 1981, over 200 Baha'is have been executed on account of their religion. Many were executed for the spurious and absurd crime of ``Zionist Baha'i activities,'' others for apostasy, conversion, or various charges that boil down to ``disagreement with the regime.''  The Baha'i are a peace-loving community, members of a religion that had its origin in Iran but that has adherents the world over, including many Americans. The extremist regime in Iran considers the Baha'i religion to be a kind of heresy or group apostasy, and so it persecutes them even more severely than it persecutes Christians, Jews, and Muslims who are not in accord with the views of the extremists. Baha'is cannot elect institutional leaders, organize schools, or conduct other religious activities. The elected assemblies which had governed the religious community were disbanded by government order in 1983. All Baha'i cemeteries and holy places were seized soon after the 1979 revolution. Under the law now in force in Iran, Baha'is may not hold government jobs, Baha'i students may not attend universities or even graduate from high school. Baha'i marriages and divorces are not recognized, the right to inherit is denied, and contracts with Baha'is are not legally enforceable. And now the government has gone back to murdering them.  Ironically, the latest crackdown comes at a time when Western government officials had been prematurely congratulating themselves on the emergence of an ostensibly ``moderate'' regime in Iran. As often turns out to be the case in such instances, we have now learned either that the moderates are not really in charge or that they are not really so very moderate after all.  Mr. Speaker, the White House reacted to the execution of Mr. Rowhani with a statement noting that ``[t]he world ha[d] been encouraged by the recent statements from Iranian leaders about the need for rule of law and the rights of individuals.'' The White House statement correctly noted that ``[s]uch words have little meaning so long as the rights of the Iranian people, including the right to worship freely, are not upheld.'' Our government must take care, however, to head its own advice. The best words in the world can be rendered meaningless by inconsistent actions. A government that commits such gross forms of persecution on account of religious belief and practice as have been perpetrated against the Baha'i must not be accorded the privileges of membership in the community of civilized nations. The United States must bring all of its dealings with Iran into conformity with this principle, and must encourage other nations, international organizations, financial institutions, and other public and private entities to do likewise.                          ____________________
