President, let me say also that Senator Reed and I worked together on a lot of these over the years, and this is not going to be any different than before. We can get it done. We will get it done on time. We will get it done to put us back in the position we should be in, the United States of America with our military capability.  With that, I appreciate it and look forward to working together.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
