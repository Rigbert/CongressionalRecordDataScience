President, today I wish to honor a brave and passionate Oregonian who is an incredible example of a person finding bold solutions to challenging problems.  I am proud to boast about my friend, Brenda Tracy, being named a Woman of Impact by Politico at its sixth annual Women Rule Summit.  Brenda Tracy survived childhood sexual abuse. She is also a survivor of a brutal sexual assault that happened to her as a young single mother in Oregon. Brenda reported her sexual assault but she didn't speak of it publicly. She says that, at the time, she was saved by the compassion of a trauma nurse who treated her with dignity. Soon, Brenda went into nursing herself, graduating from the Oregon Health and Science University.  After 16 years of silence, Brenda courageously decided, in 2014, to share her sexual assault survival story publicly. Going public has exposed her to harsh judgments, disbelief, unwanted publicity, and harassment.  But since 2014, Brenda's story of survival also has positively reverberated across the entire country, sparking productive conversations and genuine reforms along the way.  In 2016, Brenda began traveling the country to speak to high school and college athletic departments. As the founder of ``Set the Expectation,'' she has spoken to nearly 100 college athletic programs and several high schools, setting the expectation with thousands of athletes that physical assault and sexual violence are never okay.  Set the Expectation is combating sexual and physical violence by directly engaging with men, who perpetrate 9 in 10 instances of domestic violence and sexual assault.  Brenda says her efforts are geared toward men because, if women could stop sexual violence, they would have already. This is an all-hands-on-deck nonpartisan national issue. Today, Brenda continues to share her story in order to educate, engage, and inspire athletes and coaches to become involved in the fight against sexual and physical violence.  Sexual assault on college campuses is pervasive. An estimated one in five women who attend college will be sexually assaulted during her time there. Sexual assaults on campus spike by 40 percent when a Division I football team has a home game.  When repeating those awful statistics, I hear folks grumble about their accuracy or about people falsely reporting assaults. The truth is; one assault is too many. Every year in college, too many students will have their lives permanently changed by assault. The reality is often worse for students in K-12 schools, where abused children, like Brenda once was, may be forced to suffer in silence, as even less attention is paid to their plight.  Even knowing this, we have seen the President mock survivors of sexual violence on the national stage. His unacceptable words and actions reaffirm the dangerous notion that powerful men can take--advantage of their influential positions to abuse women.  We are now seeing Trump's Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos, move to dismantle Federal enforcement of sexual violence protections. Secretary DeVos has doubled down even though survivor advocates, like Brenda, agree and have told her that these changes would make it much harder for sexual assault survivors to report their assaults.  The fight against physical and sexual violence is far from over. It couldn't be more clear: there is more to do to ensure that fewer students experience sexual assaults and that more students feel protected and advocated for on campus. Like I said before, even one assault is too many. Until our society steps up and accepts this as a fact, we have work to do.  Brenda said to me earlier this week that she can't wait to talk to her 10-month-old granddaughter about going to college. She said she can't wait for her granddaughter to say, ``Wow, Grandma. Things were really that bad? They are so much better now.''  This really struck me because Brenda's unfailing optimism and candor are what will change the norms around sexual violence. Her courage in sharing her story is inspiring, and I know I join folks from around the country in saying: Congratulations, Brenda, and thank you!                          ____________________
