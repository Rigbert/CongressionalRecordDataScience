President, I thank the Senator from Vermont for an excellent statement. That historic perspective is important for a number of reasons. The whole highway system under Eisenhower came as a result of a quest for national security. That was almost 50 years ago, and we have been funding highways the same way we did 50 years ago. We have not changed at all.  We have this excise tax. In the bill we are to pass--and hopefully it will get passed today and sent on to conference--we have new and innovative ways of financing. We allow the States to use their ways. We give them more latitude toward their methods of financing highways. We also appoint a national commission to study how we could do this in the future so we will not be standing up here 6 years from now talking about the same problems we have today.  If we operate on an extension, that is not going to happen. I made a list of all these things that are not going to happen if we have just another extension. We are on the sixth extension right now.  Let me, first of all, encourage anyone who is going to offer an amendment to come down and do so.                          Judicial Nominations  But while we are waiting, Mr. President, let me respond to one of the statements that was made about an hour ago--or was it 2 hours ago--when they were talking about a floor vote.  Regardless of how you interpret the Constitution on advice and consent, sometimes I say I am a very fortunate person in this body because I am one of the few Members of the Senate who is not a lawyer. So when I read the Constitution, I know what it says. It says we are supposed to advise and consent. It means a majority of us are going to have to determine whether a nominee who is presented by the President of the United States is one who is, in fact, acceptable.  What we have been asking for, as our leader articulated many times--and apparently the senior Senator from West Virginia agreed with the President yesterday--is just an up-or-down vote. That is all we want, an up-or-down vote.  Now, is this so outrageous? I will go back and quote some of my good friends on the Democrat side who are opposed to an up-or-down vote.  Senator Biden, on March 19, 1997, said:       But I also respectfully suggest that everyone who is      nominated ought to have a shot, to have a hearing and to have      a shot to be heard on the floor and have a vote on the floor.      . . .  Senator Boxer said, on May 14, 1997:       It is not the role of the Senate to obstruct the process      and prevent numbers of highly qualified nominees from even      being given the opportunity for a vote on the Senate floor.  Senator Durbin, who has been very outspoken, said, on September 28, 1998:       Vote the person up or down. They are qualified or they are      not.  Mrs. Feinstein, one of our fine colleagues, the senior Senator from California, on September 16, 1999, said:       A nominee is entitled to a vote. Vote them up; vote them      down. . . .  Now, apparently, their interpretation of the Constitution is what mine is.  Senator Kennedy, on January 28, 1998, said:       But we should resolve these disagreements by voting on      these nominees--yes or no.  I agree with Senator Kennedy.  Senator Kohl, on August 21, 1999, said:       These nominees, who have to put their lives on hold waiting      for us to act, deserve an ``up or down'' vote.  Senator Leahy, on October 22, 1997, said:       I hope we might reach a point where we as a Senate will      accept our responsibility--  That is us.     and vote people up or vote them down.  Senator Schumer, on March 7, 2000, said:       I also plead with my colleagues to move judges with      alacrity--vote them up or down.  So I am saying that I agree with all of my good Democrat colleagues that we should give them an up-or-down vote, and I have no question but that the American people feel the same way. You see different polling data, but when they are asked the question, Should these people be entitled to a vote up or down? they overwhelmingly believe they should.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). The Senator from Mississippi.
