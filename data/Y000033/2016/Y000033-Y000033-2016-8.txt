Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I would like to compliment the gentleman from New Jersey. I do hope he understands that this is his district and I will support his legislation. I would like to have him do the same thing when I bring legislation to the floor that only affects my district.  So, with courtesy to him, I will urge a ``yes'' vote on this legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
