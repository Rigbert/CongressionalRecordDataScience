Speaker, I have the greatest respect for the gentleman from Florida, and I wonder if he would be willing to answer a question.  The Chairman has a tremendous weight on him, and I have some understanding of that. I do want to ask the gentleman, however, seeing as how he says that the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Skeen) has no objection to this motion, does that mean that if the motion passes, the members, the full set of members of the Subcommittee on Agriculture and Rural Development will be able to meet in full and open conference to deal with our disagreements with the members in the otherbody? Or does it mean, as last year, that our members would be appointed, but then the conference never called and the bill written in the back rooms here and brought to the floor?  Could the gentleman describe the process forward?
