President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1183       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Haiti Reforestation Act of      2009''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--       (1) the established policy of the Federal Government is to      support and seek protection of tropical forests around the      world;       (2) tropical forests provide a wide range of benefits by--       (A) harboring a major portion of the biological and      terrestrial resources of Earth and providing habitats for an      estimated 10,000,000 to 30,000,000 plant and animal species,      including species essential to medical research and      agricultural productivity;       (B) playing a critical role as carbon sinks that reduce      greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, as 1 hectare of tropical      forest can absorb up to approximately 3 tons of carbon      dioxide per year, thus moderating potential global climate      change; and       (C) regulating hydrological cycles upon which agricultural      and coastal resources depend;       (3) tropical forests are also a key factor in reducing      rates of soil loss, particularly on hilly terrain;       (4) while international efforts to stem the tide of      tropical deforestation have accelerated during the past 2      decades, the rapid rate of tropical deforestation continues      unabated;       (5) in 1923, over 60 percent of the land of Haiti was      forested but, by 2006, that percentage had decreased to less      than 2 percent;       (6) during the period beginning in 2000 and ending in 2005,      the deforestation rate in Haiti accelerated by more than 20      percent over the deforestation rate in Haiti during the      period beginning in 1990 and ending in 1999;       (7) as a result, during the period described in paragraph      (6), Haiti lost--       (A) nearly 10 percent (approximately 11,000 hectares) of      the forest cover of Haiti; and       (B) approximately 22 percent of the total forest and      woodland habitat of Haiti;       (8) poverty and economic pressures are--       (A) two factors that underlie the tropical deforestation of      Haiti; and       (B) manifested particularly through the clearing of vast      areas of forest for conversion to agricultural uses;       (9) the unemployment rate of Haiti is approximately 80      percent;       (10) the per capita income of Haiti is $450 per year, which      is barely one-tenth of the per capita income of Latin America      and the Caribbean;       (11) two-thirds of the population of Haiti depend on the      agricultural sector, which consists mainly of small-scale      subsistence farming;       (12) 60 percent of the population of Haiti relies on      charcoal produced from cutting down trees for cooking fuel;       (13) soil erosion represents the most direct effect of the      deforestation of Haiti, as the erosion has--       (A) lowered the productivity of the land due to the poor      soils underlying the tropical forests;       (B) worsened the severity of droughts;       (C) led to further deforestation;       (D) significantly decreased the quality and, as a result,      quantity of freshwater and clean drinking water available to      the population of Haiti; and       (E) increased the pressure on the remaining land and trees      in Haiti;       (14) tropical forests provide forest cover to soften the      effect of heavy rains and reduce erosion by anchoring the      soil with their roots;       (15) when trees are cleared, rainfall runs off the soil      more quickly and contributes to floods and further erosion;       (16) in 2004, Hurricane Jeanne struck Haiti, killing      approximately 3,000, and affecting over 200,000, people,      partly because deforestation had resulted in the clearing of      large hillsides, which enabled rainwater to run off directly      to settlements located at the bottom of the slopes;       (17) research conducted by the United Nations Environmental      Programme has revealed a direct (89 percent) correlation      between the extent of the deforestation of a country and the      incidence of victims per weather event in the country;       (18) finding economic benefits for local communities from      sustainable uses of tropical forests is critical for the      long-term protection of the tropical forests in Haiti; and       (19) tropical reforestation efforts would provide new      sources of jobs, income, and investments in Haiti by--       (A) providing employment opportunities in tree seedling      programs, contract tree planting and management, sustainable      agricultural initiatives, sustainable and managed timber      harvesting, and wood products milling and finishing services;      and       (B) enhancing community enterprises that generate income      through the trading of sustainable forest resources, many of      which exist on small scales in Haiti and in the rest of the      region.       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide      assistance to the Government of Haiti to develop and      implement, or improve, nationally appropriate policies and      actions--       (1) to reduce deforestation and forest degradation in      Haiti; and       (2) to increase annual rates of afforestation and      reforestation in a measurable, reportable, and verifiable      manner--       (A) to eliminate within 5 years after the date of enactment      of this Act any further net deforestation of Haiti; and       (B) to restore within 30 years after the date of enactment      of this Act the forest cover of Haiti to the surface area      that the forest cover had occupied in 1990.
