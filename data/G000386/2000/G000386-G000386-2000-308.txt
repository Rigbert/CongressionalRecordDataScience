 President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until the hour of 9:30 a.m. on Thursday, March 23. I further ask unanimous consent that on Thursday, immediately following the prayer, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the morning hour be deemed expired, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and the Senate begin a period of morning business until 11 a.m. with the time equally divided between Senator Craig or his designee and Senator Durbin or his designee, and that Senator Craig be in control of the first half of the time. Finally, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Baucus be allotted up to 10 minutes of the time under the control of Senator Durbin.
