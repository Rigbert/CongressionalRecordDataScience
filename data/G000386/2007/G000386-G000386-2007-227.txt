 President, I hope Senator Thune is here. I was going to yield time to him first.  I yield myself a couple minutes while we are waiting for Senator Thune.  Mr. President, first of all, to change direction from where Senator Gregg was, today corn is $3.50 in central Iowa, and it is down 25 cents from yesterday because it rained in Illinois in the last 48 hours. So weather is affecting the price of grain quite a bit. If city slickers are worried about the price of corn flakes going up, just remember that a farmer only gets a nickel out of every box of corn flakes that is half filled with air anyway.
