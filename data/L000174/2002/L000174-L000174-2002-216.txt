DASCHLE. Madam President, it is for that reason that I believe this package ought to be viewed in its entirety. The Sarbanes bill lays out the framework. The Leahy bill lays out the penalties for violating that framework. So I don't know that you can have one without the other and not have a complete package.  So I appreciate very much the work of the Judiciary Committee, and the chair of the Judiciary Committee especially, for the work in allowing this package to come to the floor. I thank him again for the contributions he made.  Several Senators addressed the Chair.
