President, this morning's headline reports that budget negotiations between the President and the Republican congressional leaders have broken down. Instead of working together, the leaders are slinging partisan arrows of blame at each other in today's papers. I think, because of that, it is all the more reason to have a bipartisan summit on the budget.  In fact, this is the third time in the last 2 months and the fourth time this year that I have called for a summit meeting between congressional leaders and the President to resolve their budget differences.  In my earlier speeches, my main concern has been to avoid the costly and unnecessary Government shutdown that some have predicted in the beginning of the fiscal year last week. Fortunately, the President and the Congress have avoided this disaster. We agreed to a continuing resolution that funds the Government for the next 6 weeks. I applaud the bipartisan cooperation displayed to reach this continuing resolution.  But I fear that the President and the Republican congressional leadership are now playing a more serious game of chicken--a high-stakes game over raising the debt limit.  The Government is fast approaching the $4.9 trillion ceiling of Federal borrowing imposed by Congress in 1993. For the Government to keep paying its bills, Congress has to increase the debt limit. I think the deadline is about a month away on November 15, when the Government needs to borrow to meet $25 billion in interest payments, payments due thousands of individuals, businesses, financial institutions, and pension funds that own Treasury securities.  The Republican leaders are now threatening to use the debt limit as a club to beat the President into submission over the budget. Already, 165 Republican Members of the House of Representatives have pledged to refuse to vote for raising the debt limit, unless the President agrees to what they say should be the budget. In 21 years here, I have not seen an action so irresponsible by either Democrats or Republicans. The Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, is not helping by going along with the ultimatum and saying, ``I am with them. I do not intend to schedule the debt limit if they are not met.'' It sounds almost like a child in a sandbox throwing a tantrum, instead of somebody who leads a great institution and is a leader of a great national political party.  The Speaker says he will use this hard-line approach no matter what, declaring, ``I do not care what the price is.'' Treasury Secretary Rubin responded that the President will not be blackmailed by the use of the debt limit as a negotiating level.  Well, I am one Vermonter who feels that issuing ultimatums is dumb and counterproductive. Raising the debt limit should not be a partisan issue. It is just too important.  Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan got it right when he said: ``The issue of default should not be on the table. To default for the first time in the history of this Nation is not something anyone should take in a tranquil manner.''  In fact, such a default would have serious consequences, indeed.  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, reflecting some of the feelings as Republican Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board recently warned:       Defaulting on payments have much graver economic      consequences than failing to enact discretionary      appropriations by the start of the fiscal year * * *  even a      temporary default--that is, a few days' delay in the      Government's ability to meet its obligations--could have      serious repercussions in the financial markets. Those      repercussions include a permanent increase in Federal      borrowing costs * * *.  It is foolish to risk increasing our Federal borrowing costs through a default.  Unfortunately, the United States carries close to a $4.9 trillion debt burden and over 16 percent of our annual budget goes to interest payments on the Federal debt.  Interestingly enough, some of the same people who say that we will not honor this debt today are some of the same Members of Congress who strongly supported the President of their own party who, during the 1980's, tripled the national debt.  One analyst estimated that if the Government's interest rate had been just a 0.01 percentage point higher than the last year, the Government's annual borrowing costs would have increased by $211 million. Those same people say they want a balanced budget are willing to throw away a chance to balance the budget by permanently jacking up the Government's interest costs.  That repercussion of default goes a lot further than just the Government's borrowing costs. It may make some nice political points back home to say, ``We do not care; we will just shut down the Government, that mean, nasty old government. We do not need it anyway.''  Well, they ought to also tell some of their constituents, if they are a homeowner looking for a mortgage, their mortgage rates will go up. If they are consumers shopping for a new car, the costs of that new car will go up. If they are a small business that wanted to expand, wanted to increase their inventory, wanted to increase their equipment, they will pay more for the money to do that.  To crush the dreams of millions of Americans over this silly game of political poker is totally irresponsible. Some have even suggested that the Treasury Department play games with Government trust funds--including the Social Security trust fund, the Medicare trust fund--in order to postpone default. I believe that also is irresponsible.  Every day Treasury collects billions of dollars for these public trust funds for the payroll taxes. They invest the fund surpluses to pay beneficiaries later on. This year, the Social Security trust fund will run a surplus of $481 billion. The Medicare trust fund will run a surplus of $147 billion. Tapping into these funds allows the Treasury to avoid default, but cashing in the surpluses is morally and fiscally wrong.  We made a commitment to the American people to keep these funds in trust for future generations. Divesting the funds ignores the long-term investment needs to provide the baby-boom generation with Social Security and Medicare benefits in the years to come.  The Republican leadership and the President need to get together. The consequences of a Government default are just too serious to be held hostage by partisan politics. To protect our public trust funds, to keep the Government's and private sector's costs down, and maintain America's creditworthiness, we need a bipartisan budget summit now to avoid a debt limit crisis.                          ____________________
