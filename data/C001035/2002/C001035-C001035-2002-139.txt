President, I rise today to introduce a resolution to commemorate the 40th anniversary of theWilliam Randolph Hearst U.S. Senate Youth Program. I am pleased to be joined by Senator Breaux, who serves with me as a co-chair of the 40th anniversary program, as well as Senators Hutchison, Domenici, Lugar, and Levin, who all serve on the advisory committee. As the first graduate of the program to become a U.S. Senator, I can honestly say that the week I spent in Washington in 1971, as one of two delegates from Maine, profoundly influenced my life and career.  Even though my family has a long and proud tradition of public service, my great grandfather, my grandfather and my father all served in the State legislature, and both of my parents served as mayor of Caribou, ME, it was the week I spent in Washington with the Senate Youth Program that caused me to seriously consider a career in the public sector.  For the past 40 years, the Senate Youth Program has selected two of the brightest and most active students in each of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and the Department of Defense schools abroad to spend a week learning about our Nation's government first-hand. Over the years, over 4,000 such students have participated in the program and gone on to serve our Nation in various capacities, having seen first-hand what it means to serve in what has been called the world's greatest deliberative body.  The continued generosity of the William Randolph Hearst Foundation enables students to come to the District of Columbia and see a side of government that few Americans see in their lifetime. Each year the delegates meet with top members of the legislative, executive, and judicial branches.  I remember how fascinated I was as a delegate to listen to Senators Byrd and Thurmond speak to us about the history of the Senate and the issues of the day.  But the highlight of my week was the time I spent talking with my home State Senator, Margaret Chase Smith. I went to Senator Smith's office hoping to shake her hand; instead, she took me into her private office and spent 2 hours talking with me about the importance of public service and the difference one person can make. When I left her office, I remember feeling so proud that she was my Senator and that I could do anything I set my mind to.  So, today it is my pleasure to sponsor this resolution paying tribute to the more than 4,000 delegates who have participated in the Senate Youth Program over the past 40 years, some of whom we may see here in the Congress, at the Supreme Court, or even in the White House in years to come. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure.                          ____________________
