  It is a crisis present in every ZIP Code, one that has wrecked lives throughout our country.  My home State of Kentucky has been hit particularly hard, but I am relieved to say that we are seeing at least a glimmer of hope on the horizon.  This past summer brought news of the first nationwide decrease--decrease--in overdose fatalities in almost three decades. Kentucky saw a nearly 15-percent drop. After so much suffering, this is an indication that the tide may be starting to turn.  The result has been hard-won, after years of coordinated efforts between States, localities, and Washington. It has been a nationwide response, and we in Congress, along with the Trump administration, have been focused on doing our part.  Today marks the 1-year anniversary of one key part of our ongoing efforts. One year ago today, President Trump signed into law our landmark opioid legislation that will hopefully spare more families from the pain of addiction.  This legislation included work from 5 different committees and 70 Senators. Thanks to Chairman Lamar Alexander and so many of our colleagues, this significant package focused on providing innovative solutions, promoting long-term recovery, and empowering local leaders and first responders out on the frontlines.  A little more than a year ago, it passed the Senate with overwhelmingbipartisan support. I am proud that two of my own bills were included in that package. The Protecting Moms and Infant Act safeguards of the addiction crisis from its heartbreaking consequences, and the CAREER Act addresses the major role that stable employment plays in long-term recovery. It encourages treatment facilities to form partnerships with local businesses and short-term housing facilities to ``hand up'' to those who need it.  We are proud of what we accomplished a year ago, and I am proud that my Kentucky colleague, Representative   Andy Barr, is leading the push for the CAREER Act's companion legislation over in the House.  But we know all too well that, unfortunately, this work is far, far from finished. That is why, this very week, the Senate is moving forward $25 million more for the CAREER Act's transitional housing pilot program in the domestic appropriations we are advancing here on the floor.  The work will not stop there. This fight has been one of my top priorities since I became majority leader. We have put cutting-edge tools into the hands of healthcare professionals and first responders who face this crisis every single day.  In my State alone, I helped secure an unprecedented $200 million to address the urgent crisis facing Kentuckians--a funding increase of more than 400 percent on this issue for Kentucky since I became majority leader.  We have committed to a comprehensive strategy of prevention, treatment, and enforcement efforts. At my invitation, the White House drug czar, Jim Carroll, saw some of Kentucky's innovative leadership firsthand when he visited this past April. We have pushed the boundaries of research to find new ways to treat addiction and help families escape its painful consequences.  Earlier this month I joined Secretary Azar, NIH Director Collins, and an all-star research team at the University of Kentucky to celebrate the largest Federal grant in the University of Kentucky's history. These new resources will fuel UK's bold commitment to cutting overdose deaths by 40 percent in 16 counties over the coming 3 years. I was proud to help secure those funds.  Kentucky is proud that we are leading the national response, but I know my colleagues each have their own inspiring stories of how States are fighting back.  As I said, the work is far from over, but today we take a moment to celebrate the progress of the past year. To help mark this anniversary, the First Lady of the United States joined us here in the Senate yesterday.  I am proud to stand with her and the Trump administration and my colleagues in this body as we recommit ourselves to this effort.                          ____________________
