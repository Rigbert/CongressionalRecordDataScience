Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding this time to me and thank him for his leadership on the committee in trying to strengthen this supplemental bill. I also want to congratulate the new chairman of the committee who has tried hard to put a bill together, but I must say to my colleagues it is truly inadequate. Certainly from the standpoint of agriculture America's farmers are in crisis.  Mr. Chairman, this bill should have been up here two months ago. We have been witnessing price declines at record levels across this country with an additional income drop for our farmers this year of over 20 percent. This House bill falls so far short of the mark. Though it contains much needed credit authority to help farmers over this spring planting period, it is too little, too late. As we stand here, equipment auctions are going on across the country, bankruptcies mount, and people cannot move product to market.  One of the most curious aspects of this particular measure is that one of the budget offsets in the bill is to reduce the P.L. 480 Program, which is a program at the Department of Agriculture where we take surplus, which we have plenty of on this market, and move it into foreign markets to help hungry people around the world, and there are certainly lots of those, but also to help our farmers here at home get out from under the weight of all this production which is helping prices to continue to plummet here in the domestic market.                              {time}  1145  So we should have been able to perfect a more perfect bill. Unfortunately, this is not the one.  I wanted to mention that the bill contains some very important language that has to do with the Russian food aid package that is currently being delivered, over a billion dollars of Russian food aid, and yet very few checks by the government of the United States in order to assure that that product is not diverted and graft does not occur.  Mr. Chairman, I include for the Record questions that we should ask the executive branch and expand congressional oversight of that Russian food aid package as it proceeds over the next several weeks.  Our American family farmers are suffering. While the general economy is strong, the U.S. agricultural economy continues to experience significant declines in agriculture commodity prices that began over a year ago.
