  Mr. President, I remind my colleagues of the issue we will be debating for the next 90 minutes. Basically, today a woman who serves in the military overseas at a facility, if she so desires to have an abortion--and it is her choice; it is her personal choice between herself and her family and her doctor and her religion--has to go to her commanding officer to ask for permission to come home to the United States to have a safe and legal abortion.
