Speaker, the Endangered Species Act passed in 1973 was well-intentioned legislation. But the Fish and Wildlife Service, especially in California, is working outside of the ESA and undermining the original intent.  The Galena Interchange is a freeway construction project in my district that is being held hostage by the Delhi Sands flower-loving fly. The Galena Interchange is not an expansive new highway program. We are not talking about building a new six-lane highway. It is a simple project connecting Interstate 15 to Galena Street, and it has received $20 million in Federal, State and local funds last year to correct the commuters' nightmare.  After plans have been designed and the funds allocated, Fish and Wildlife claims that the county needs to establish a preserve for the Delhi Sands flower-loving fly and wants as many as 200 acres of the Inland Empire's priciest industrial lands for habitat mitigation. Two hundred acres could cost as much as $32 million, 32 million for a $20 million project. On top of all this, not one fly has been found in this area. Apparently the Branch Chief of the Carlsbad Fish and Wildlife Office heard the buzz of the fly but did not see it and now wants $32 million.  We need common sense reform. Support this legislation.                          ____________________
