Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague from Georgia for the work he has done on this bill. As he has said, it is a simple, noncontroversial bill to help the 1996 Olympic games.  I am proud to represent the city of Atlanta, which will host the 1996 games. I know many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have supported this effort. I would like to thank all my colleagues for their hard work and their support. I believe that the 1996 Olympics, when we celebrate the 100th anniversary of the games, will be the best Olympics ever.  This bill governs the production of commemorative coins for the 1996 games. These coins will commemorate an Olympics that will highlight the best of Atlanta, GA and the United States. We will witness the largest coming together in history of people of different nations, religions, and heritage. The Olympics not only celebrate athletic accomplishment, they celebrate diversity, peace, and our ability to overcome our differences and unite as a people. We all can learn something from the Olympic message.  I urge my colleagues' support for H.R. 2336.
