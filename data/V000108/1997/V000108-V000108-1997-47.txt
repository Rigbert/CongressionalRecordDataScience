Speaker, it is a great privilege to take this opportunity to congratulate the Valparaiso Community School System. Valparaiso placed in the top 10 percent of 15,893 school systems nationwide, and it was named a 1997 ``What Parents Want'' award winner by SchoolMatch, an Ohio-based school selection consulting firm. I would especially like to recognize Valparaiso Community School System's superintendent, Michael Benway, and its director of secondary education, Glen Gambel, for their significant roles in this distinguished achievement.  The ``What Parents Want'' award was established 6 years ago by school administrators concerned about negative publicity surrounding public education. In making its decision, SchoolMatch uses information from county and State auditors, State taxing authorities, and State boards of education. To assess a school's qualifications, the firm uses a checklist of what parents look for when deciding which school system is best for their children. The seven-point list includes: competitiveness; academically solid, but not intimidating, testing; accreditation; recognition by a national foundation or by the U.S. Department of Education; competitive teacher salaries; above-average instructional expenditures; above-average library and media expenditures; and small class size.  The award is especially meaningful for the Valparaiso Community School System since SchoolMatch is a prominent organization that performs its own extensive research to determine which schools meet the above criteria.  With families increasingly having to relocate for job related purposes, SchoolMatch provides an invaluable service to parents with school-age children. SchoolMatch is used by a number of large corporations as they help relocating employees match their expectations with a school system in the area of relocation. The program has gained national recognition, as more than 48,000 parents contacted SchoolMatch's headquarters in Columbus, OH, last year.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in commending the Valparaiso Community School System on its receipt of this prestigious award. The dedication of Valparaiso's teachers and administrators to the education of citizens in the Valparaiso community is truly inspirational.                          ____________________
