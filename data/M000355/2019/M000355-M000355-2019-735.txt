 President, I want to take a moment today to honor Tony Reck, who recently marked 50 years of excellence in the railway industry. He has been a friend and a leader in western Kentucky for many years, and I would like to join his family, friends, and colleagues in celebrating Tony's great success.  Interestingly enough, Tony never planned to enter the railroad business at all. He studied aviation and joined the Air National Guard, expecting to spend his career in the skies. Instead, Tony's half-century career in the railroad industry began as a summer job at the Illinois Central railroad after his first year of college. When he returned to school, Tony kept working at the railroad, eventually going to class all day and working at night. Clearly, Tony had developed an unbeatable work ethic early on, and it has served him well throughout his career.  Tony was selected to join the railroad's sales department based in St. Louis, giving him the chance to travel throughout its service area. It was that position in which Tony began overseeing the operations in Kentucky.  Changes in Federal regulations also meant big changes for Tony. When Jim Smith and David Reed purchased a Western Kentucky railway, they named it the Paducah & Louisville Railway and asked Tony to help them run the operation. Two years later, Tony was named the president of the P&L Railway, and in 1995, he became chairman and CEO. According to P&L, this full-service, 265-mile, regional railroad moves more than 21 million tons of freight each year and supports hundreds of good jobs in western Kentucky.  Tapping into Paducah's geography as the inland waterways capital of the world, the railway coordinates with barge operators to expand its reach even further. Shipping many important products, including coal, P&L also connects to five of the largest railroads in the country. Tony's long career managing these complex logistics has earned him a top-notch reputation both in the industry and the local community.  Tony's experience and leadership continue to serve western Kentucky well, and I am proud to help him celebrate this milestone accomplishment. I wish him and his wife Farideh many more happy years as they continue to help make Paducah a great place to live and work. I urge my Senate colleagues to join me in marking 50 years of Tony's remarkable career in the railway industry.                          ____________________
