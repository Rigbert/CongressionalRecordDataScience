Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to pay tribute to an outstanding citizen of Indiana's First Congressional District, Mr. Edward Patz. On March 27, 1999, Mr. Patz, along with his friends and family, will celebrate his retirement from the Pipefitter's Local Union 597. This reception will take place at the Villa Cesare in Schererville on March 27, 1999.  Ed Patz has dedicated a substantial portion of his life to the betterment of union members and the community of Northwest Indiana, as well as the entire state.  Mr. Patz's distinguished career in the labor movement has made his community and nation a better place in which to work and live. For more than forty years, Mr. Patz has served as an important figure in Local #597. He has held several positions throughout his tenure, but none as important as Business Agent, a position from which he retired on January 1, 1999.  Mr. Patz began his involvement with Local Union 597 in 1956, through his Pipefitter Apprenticeship with the Robert Gordon Corporation. Ed Patz was the top apprentice in the state of Indiana and won the state apprenticeship contest on November 23, 1960. In the same year, Mr. Patz graduated from the apprenticeship program and attained the rank of a journeyman. In 1983, Mr. Patz was elected to the Pipefitter's Local Union 597 executive board, where he served a three-year term. Mr. Patz was elected to the position of Business Agent in June of 1986, where he remained until his retirement in January 1999. Ed Patz served three consecutive two-year terms as Secretary-Treasurer for the Northwest Indiana Building Trades Council, and was involved as a committee chairman and/or member of numerous committees associated with the Building Trades Council. Ed Patz has devoted his career toward the expansion of labor ideals and fair standards for all working people.  On this special day, I offer my heartfelt congratulations to Ed Patz. His large circle of family and friends can be proud of the contributions this prominent individual has made. His work in the labor movement provided union workers in Northwest Indiana opportunities they might not have otherwise had. Mr. Patz's leadership kept the region's labor force strong and helped keep America working. Those in the movement will surely miss Mr. Patz's dedication and sincerity. I sincerely wish Ed Patz a long, happy, and productive retirement.                          ____________________
