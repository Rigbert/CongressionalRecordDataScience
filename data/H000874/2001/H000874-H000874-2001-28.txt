Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Speaker, we have come to a time after 11\1/2\ months of work on a bill which, although there is still controversy attached to it, has created, I think, great consensus. That consensus has been articulated on this floor, and that consensus is a conviction that every American ought to be assured the right to vote, full access to the polls and education so they know what they are voting for or against, and assistance in making sure that their vote is accurately cast.  In addition, we dedicate resources to ensure that the technology, once that citizen has voted, to make sure that that citizen's vote is correctly counted. As has been said on both sides of the aisle, it is central to democracy that that happen.  The former Governor of Delaware, one of our most respected colleagues, the gentleman from Delaware (Mr. Castle), said it best, that when on election day we vote and Americans go to the polls, both Presidents and paupers go to the polling place, and each will have his or her vote counted, and it will count equally.  That is the majesty of America; that is the general use of our democracy. That is central to our philosophy, and it must be our continuing commitment. For when one American's vote is not counted, when one American is prohibited by whatever means from coming to the polls, from casting their ballot, from participating in democracy, we lessen that democracy, and we lessen the promise of our Founding Fathers.  The gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Brown) said it best I think on this floor: ``This bill perhaps is not perfect, but it is,'' as she said, ``a perfect beginning.''  Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote for the Help America Vote Act.
