I would like to amend that request to allow language to be added to amend this particular section stating that if you have a youth organization that is guilty of wasting or stealing Federal funds, that youth organization is not automatically going to receive the same amount of funds in the next year. That is malfeasance at its worst and a waste of taxpayer dollars. I am sure the Senator from Virginia and the Senator from Michigan and I don't want to be party to that.  If I may reserve the right to offer a second-degree amendment to that section, I would be happy to allow the unanimous-consent agreement.
