President, this amendment is cosponsored by my colleague, Senator Bingaman, and others. It expresses the sense of the Senate that Congress enact legislation this year that grants the Food and Drug Administration authority to regulate tobacco products. This amendment does not specify what form of regulation will be adopted, but it authorizes the FDA to adopt a legislative scheme to regulate tobacco products.  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Kennedy be added to the amendment as a cosponsor.
