President, the Senate has confirmed the nomination of Maurice Hicks to be a United States District Court Judge for the Western District of Louisiana. Maurice Hicks has spent 25 years as a litigator in Shreveport, LA, where he has appeared frequently in State and Federal courts. He comes to us with the support of his home State Senators. Mr. Hicks is the seventh nominee of President Bush to be confirmed to the Federal courts in Louisiana. Just this year, the Senate already confirmed Dee Drell and Patricia Minaldi to the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana. With these confirmations, there are no longer any current vacancies in the Federal courts in Louisiana.  Under my chairmanship last Congress, the Senate Judiciary Committee held the first hearing for a Fifth Circuit nominee in 7 years. Judge Edith Brown Clement of Louisiana was promptly given a hearing in October 2001 and confirmed in November 2001, despite the fact that three of President Clinton's Fifth Circuit nominees never received a hearing, including H. Alston Johnson of Louisiana. The Democrats turned the other cheek on past obstruction by the Republicans in order to move forward. In fact, with Democratic support, the Senate recently confirmed another nominee to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, Judge Edward Prado, despite the fact that President Clinton's Hispanic nominees to that court, Enrique Moreno and Jorge Rangel, never received a hearing or a vote.  With the confirmation of Mr. Hicks, the Senate will have confirmed 25 of President Bush's judicial nominees so far this year and 125 overall. So far this year we have confirmed more judicial nominees of President Bush than the Republican majority was willing to confirm in the entire 1996 session when President Clinton was in the White House. That entire year only 17 judges were confirmed all year and that included none to the circuit courts, not one. In contrast, already this session, 5 circuit court nominees, including several highly controversial nominees, have been confirmed among the 25 judges the Senate has approved to date. Those confirmations--including two that had more negative votes than the required number to be filibustered but who were not filibustered never get acknowledged in partisan Republican talking points.  We are also almost 6 months ahead of the pace the Republican majority set in 1999 when it considered President Clinton's judicial nominees. It was not until October that the Senate confirmed as many as 25 judicial nominees in 1999.  In the 17 months when I chaired the Judiciary Committee, we were able to confirm 100 judges and vastly reduce the judicial vacancies that Republicans had stored up by refusing to allow scores of judicial nominees of President Clinton to be considered. We were able to do so despite the White House's refusal to work with Democrats on circuit court vacancies and many district court vacancies.  With Mr. Hicks' confirmation, the Senate will have succeeded in reducing the number of Federal judicial vacancies to the lowest level it has been in 13 years. The 110 vacancies that I inherited in the summer of 2001 have been more than cut in half. In the 17 months that I chaired the Judiciary Committee we not only kept up with attrition, but reduced those vacancies from 110 to 60 and with Mr. Hicks's confirmation we will only have 46 vacancies for the entire Federal judiciary. I congratulate Mr. Hicks and his family on his confirmation.  Republican talking points will likely focus on the impasse on 2 of the most extreme of the President's nominations rather than the 125 confirmations and the lowest judicial vacancy rate in 13 years. They will ignore their own recent filibusters against President Clinton's executive and judicial nominees in so doing and their own delays in considering some of this President's judicial nominees.  I continue to be disappointed that the Republican leadership has not found time to proceed to the nomination of Judge Consuelo Callahan to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. This is another of the judicial nominees that Senate Democrats has strongly supported and whose consideration we had expedited through the Judiciary Committee weeks ago.  Just as Senate Democrats cleared the nomination of Judge Edward Prado to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit without delay, so, too, the nomination of Judge Callahan, another Hispanic nominee to another circuit court, was cleared on the Democratic side. All Democratic Senators serving on the Judiciary Committee voted to report this nomination favorably. All Democratic Senators had indicated that they are prepared to proceed to this nomination and, after a reasonable period of debate, vote on the nomination. I am confident this nomination will be confirmed by an extraordinary majority--maybe unanimously.  It is most unfortunate that so many partisans in this administration and on the other side of the aisle insist on bogging down consensus matters and consensus nominees in order to focus exclusively on the most divisive and controversial of this President's nominees as he continues his efforts to pack the courts. Democratic Senators have worked very hard to cooperate with this administration in order to fill judicial vacancies. What the other side seeks to obscure is that effort, that fairness and the progress we have been able to achieve without much help from the other side or the administration. Judge Callahan's nomination has been delayed on the Senate Executive Calendar unnecessarily in my view. It is time to act on this nomination and make progress.                          ____________________
