Accustomed as we and the American people are to having our proceedings in the Senate open to the public and subject to press coverage, the most striking prescription in the ``Rules of Procedure and Practice in the Senate when Sitting on Impeachment Trials'' has been the closed deliberations required on any question, motion and now on the final vote on the Articles of Impeachment.  The requirement of closed deliberation more than any other rule reflects the age in which the rules were originally adopted in 1868. Even in 1868, however, not everyone favored secrecy. During the trial of President Johnson, the senior Senator from Vermont, George F. Edmunds, moved to have the closed deliberations on the Articles transcribed and officially reported ``in order that the world might know, without diminution or exaggeration, the reasons and views upon which we proceed to our judgment.'' [Cong. Globe Supp'l, Impeachment Trial of President Andrew Johnson, 40th Cong., 2d Sess., vol. 4, p. 424.] The motion was tabled.  In the 130 years that have passed since that time, the Senate has seen the advent of television in the Senate Chamber, instant communication and rapid news cycles, distribution of Senate documents over the Internet, the addition of 46 Senators representing 23 additional States, and the direct election of Senators by the people in our States.  Opening deliberations would help further the dual purposes of our rules to promote fairness and political accountability in the impeachment process. I supported the motion by Senators Harkin, Wellstone and others to suspend this rule requiring closed deliberations and to open our deliberations on Senator Byrd's motion to dismiss and at other points earlier in this trial. We were unsuccessful. Now that we are approaching our final deliberations on the Articles of Impeachment, themselves, I hope that this secrecy rule will be suspended so that the Senate's deliberations are open and the American people can see them. In a matter of this historic importance, the American people should be able to witness their Senators' deliberations.  Some have indicated objection to opening our final deliberations because petit juries in courts of law conduct their deliberations in secret. Analogies to juries in courts of law are misplaced. I was privileged to serve as a prosecutor for eight years before I was elected to the Senate. As a prosecutor, I represented the people of Vermont in court and before juries on numerous occasions. I fully appreciate the traditions and importance of allowing jurors to deliberate and make their decisions privately, without intrusion or pressure from the parties, the judge or the public. The sanctity of the jury deliberation room ensures the integrity and fairness of our judicial system.  The Senate sitting as an impeachment court is unlike any jury in any civil or criminal case. A jury in a court of law is chosen specifically because the jurors have no connection or relation to the parties or their lawyers and no familiarity with the allegations. Keeping the deliberations of regular juries secret ensures that as they reach their final decision, they are free from outside influences or pressure.  As the Chief Justice made clear on the third day of the impeachment trial, the Senate is more than a jury; it is a court. Courts are called upon to explain the reasons for decisions.  Furthermore, to the extent the Senate is called upon to evaluate the evidence as is a jury, we stand in different shoes than any juror in a court of law. We all know many of the people who have been witnesses in this matter; we all know the Republican Managers--indeed, one Senator is a brother of one of the Managers; and we were familiar with the underlying allegations in this case before the Republican Managers ever began their presentation.  Because we are a different sort of jury, we shoulder a heavier burden in explaining the reasons for the decisions we make here. I appreciate why Senators would want to have certain of our deliberations in closed session: to avoid embarrassment to and protect the privacy of persons who may be discussed. Yet, on the critical decisions we are now being called upon to make our votes on the Articles themselves, allowing our deliberations to be open to the public helps assure the American people that the decisions we make are for the right reasons.  In 1974, when the Senate was preparing itself for the anticipated impeachment trial of former President Richard Nixon, the Committee on Rules and Administration discussed the issue of allowing television coverage of the Senate trial. Such coverage did not become routine in the Senate until later in 1986. In urging such coverage of the possible impeachment trial of President Nixon, Senator Metcalf (D-MT), explained:       Given the fact that the party not in control of the White      House is the majority party in the Senate, the need for      broadcast media access is even more compelling. Charges of a      `kangaroo court,' or a `lynch mob proceeding' must not be      given an opportunity to gain any credence whatsoever.      Americans must be able to see for themselves what is      occurring. An impeachment trial must not be perceived by the      public as a mysterious process, filtered through the      perceptions of third parties. The procedure whereby the      individual elected to the most powerful office in the world      can be lawfully removed must command the highest possible      level of acceptance from the electorate.'' (Hrg. August 5 and      6, 1974, p. 37).  Opening deliberation will ensure complete and accurate public understanding of the proceedings and the reasons for the decisions we make here. Opening our deliberations on our votes on the Articles would tell the American people why each of us voted the way we did.  The last time this issue was actually taken up and voted on by the Senate was more than a century ago in 1876, during the impeachment trial of Secretary of War William Belknap. Without debate or deliberation, the Senate refused then to open the deliberations of the Senate to the public. That was before Senators were elected directly by the people of their State, that was before the Freedom of Information Act confirmed the right of the people to see how government decisions are made. Keeping closed our deliberations is wholly inconsistent with the progress we have made over the last century to make our government more accountable to the people.  Constitutional scholar Michael Gerhardt noted in his important book, ``The Federal Impeachment Process,'' that ``the Senate is ideally suited for balancing the tasks of making policy and finding facts (as required in impeachment trials) with political accountability.'' Public access to the reasons each Senator gives for his vote on the Articles is vital for the political accountability that is the hallmark of our role.  I likewise urge the Senate to adjust these 130-year-old rules to allow the Senate's votes on the Articles of Impeachment to be recorded for history by news photographers. This is an momentous official and public event in the annals of the Senate and in the history of the nation. This is a moment of history that should be documented for both its contemporary and its lasting significance.  Open deliberation ensures complete accountability to the American people. Charles Black wrote that presidential impeachment ``unseats the person thepeople have deliberately chosen for the office.'' ``Impeachment: A Handbook,'' at 17. The American people must be able to judge if their elected representatives have chosen for or against conviction for reasons they understand, even if they disagree. To bar the American people from observing the deliberations that result in these important decisions is unfair and undemocratic.  The Senate should have suspended the rules so that our deliberations on the final question of whether to convict the President of these Articles of Impeachment were held in open session.  I ask that following my remarks a copy of the Application of Cable News Network, submitted by Floyd Abrams and others, be printed in the Record.  The material follows:          IN THE U.S. SENATE SITTING AS A COURT OF IMPEACHMENT                               __________                                                                In re   Impeachment of William Jefferson Clinton, President of the United                                  States                               __________                               application of cable news network for a determination that the closure of these proceedings violates the first amendment to the united states                               constitution                               __________                                    To: The Honorable William H. Rehnquist and The Honorable          Members of the U.S. Senate       Cable News Network (``CNN'') respectfully submits this      application for a determination that the First Amendment to      the United States Constitution requires that the public be      permitted to attend and view the debates, deliberations and      proceedings of the United States Senate as to the issue of      whether President William Jefferson Clinton shall be      convicted and as to other related matters.---------------------------------------------------------------------------     Footnotes at end of document.---------------------------------------------------------------------------                              introduction       Under Rules VII, XX and XXIV of the ``Rules of Procedure      and Practice in the Senate When Sitting On Impeachment      Trials,'' the Senate has determined to sit in closed session      during its consideration of various issues that have arisen      during these impeachment proceedings. Motions to suspend the      rules have failed and the debates among members of the Senate      as to a number of significant matters have been closed. As      the final debates and deliberations approach at which each      member of the Senate will voice his or her views on the issue      of whether President Clinton should be convicted or acquitted      of the charges made, the need for the closest, most intense      public scrutiny of the proceedings in this body increases. By      this application, CNN seeks access for the public to observe      those debates, as well as other proceedings that bear upon      the resolution of the impeachment trial. The basis of this      application is the First Amendment to the Constitution of the      United States.       We make this application mindful that deliberations upon      impeachment were conducted behind ``closed doors'' at the      last impeachment trial of a President, in 1868. We are, as      well, mindful of the power of the Senate--consistent with the      power conferred upon it in Article I, Section 3 of the      Constitution--to exercise full control over the conduct of      impeachment proceedings held before it. In so doing, however,      the Senate must itself be mindful of its unavoidable      responsibility to adopt rules and procedures consistent with      the entirety of the Constitution as it is now understood and      as the Supreme Court has interpreted it.       The commands of the First Amendment, we urge, are at war      with closed-door impeachment deliberations. If there is one      principle at the core of the First Amendment it is that, as      Madison wrote, ``the censorial power is in the people over      the Government, and not in the Government over the people.''      4 Annals of Congress, p. 934 (1794). That proposition in turn      is rooted in the expectation that citizens--the people--will      have the information that enables them to judge government      and those in government. The right and ability of citizens to      obtain the information necessary for self-government is      indeed at the heart of the Republic itself: ``a people who      mean to be their own Governors,'' Madison also wrote, ``must      arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives.'' James      Madison, Letter to W.T. Barry, in 9 Writings of James Madison      103 (G. Hunt ed., 1910). As Chief Justice Warren Burger      observed, writing for the Supreme Court in 1980 in one of its      many recent rulings vindicating the principle of open      government: ``People in an open society do not demand      infallibility from their institutions, but it is difficult      for them to accept what they are prohibited from observing.''      Richmond Newspapers,  Inc. v. Virginia, 448 U.S. 555, 572      (1980). Those very words could well have been written      about the proceedings before the Senate today.       All agree that the impeachment of a President presents the      most solemn question of self-government that a free society      can ever confront. All should also agree that the public      ought to have the most complete information about each      decision made by the body responsible for ruling upon that      impeachment. Should the Senate vote to convict, a President      duly elected twice by the public will be removed from office.      Does not a self-governing public have the most powerful      interest in being informed about every aspect of that      decision and why it was taken? Should the Senate vote to      acquit, the President will not be removed in the face of      impeachment proceedings in which the majority in the House      branded him a criminal. Can it seriously be doubted that the      public possesses just as profound a right to know why?       Only recently--and only during this century (and well after      the trial of Andrew Johnson)--has our commitment to the      principle that debate on public issues should be open become      not merely a nationally shared philosophy but an element      embedded in constitutional law as well. But deeply-rooted in      the law it has become. It is thus no answer to observe that      impeachment deliberations in the Senate were closed in the      nineteenth century. The Senate has a duty to consider the      transformation of First Amendment principles since that time      in determining whether it is now constitutionally permissible      to close impeachment deliberations on the eve of the twenty-     first century. If, as is also true, the Senate, rather than      the Supreme Court, was chosen to try impeachments precisely      because its members are ``the representatives of the      nation,'' Federalist No. 65, and as such possess a greater      ``degree of credit and authority'' than the Supreme Court to      carry out the task of determining the fate of a President,\1\      that ``credit and authority'' can only be brought to bear if      the process by which judgment is reached is open to the      public.   the obligation of congress to account for and abide by the first                                amendment       As we have said, we are mindful of the language of Article      I, Section 3, according the Senate the ``sole Power to try      all Impeachments.'' See Nixon v. United States, 506 U.S. 224      (1993) (according the Senate broad discretion to choose      impeachment procedures). But this very delegation of      authority to the Senate, a delegation that makes most issues      concerning impeachment rules ``non-justiciable'', see Nixon,      supra, also imposes on this body a very special      responsibility to ensure that those rules comply with      constitutional mandates.\2\ Congress itself--the very entity      against which the First Amendment affords the most explicit      protection \3\--is bound to abide by the First Amendment. The      Constitution is ``the supreme Law of the Land,'' U.S. Const.,      art. VI, para. 2, and all ``Senators and Representatives . .      . shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support'' it. Id.      para. 3. The Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized that      Congress is itself obligated to interpret the Constitution in      exercising its authority. See, e.g., Rostker v. Goldberg, 453      U.S. 57, 64 (1981) (``Congress is a coequal branch of      government whose Members take the same oath we do to uphold      the Constitution of the United States.''). And in      promulgating its rules the Congress must, of course, abide by      the Constitution: ``The constitution empowers each house to      determine its rules and proceedings. It may not by its rules      ignore constitutional restraints or violate fundamental      rights. . . .'' United States v. Ballin, 144 U.S. 1, 5      (1892), quoted in Consumers Union of United States, Inc.      v. Periodical Correspondents' Assoc., 515 F.2d 1341, 1347      (D.C. Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 1051 (1976); see      Watkins v. United States, 354 U.S. 178, 188 (1957).                   the command of the first amendment       The architecture of free speech law--and, in particular,      that law placed in the context of access to information as to      how and why government power is being exercised--could not      more strongly favor the broadest dissemination of information      about, and comment on, government. The foundation of the      First Amendment is, in fact, our republican form of      government itself. As the Supreme Court recognized in the      landmark free speech decision, New York Times Co. v.      Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254 (1964): ``. . . the Constitution      created a form of government under which `[t]he people, not      the government possess the absolute sovereignty.' The      structure of the government dispersed power in reflection of      the people's distrust of concentrated power, and of power      itself at all levels. This form of government was `altogether      different' from the British form, under which the Crown was      sovereign and the people were subjects.'' Id. at 274 (quoting      Reporting of the General Assembly of Virginia, 4 Elliot's      Debates). In Sullivan, a unanimous Court determined that the      ``altogether different'' form of government ratified by the      Founders necessitated an altogether ``different degree of      freedom'' as to political debate than had existed in England.      Id. at 275 (citation omitted). It was in the First Amendment      that this unique freedom was enshrined and protected.       For the Court, the ``central meaning of the First      Amendment,'' 376 U.S. at 273, was the ``right of free public      discussion of the stewardship of public officials. . . .''      Id. at 275. Thus, the First Amendment ``was fashioned to      assure unfettered interchange of ideas for the bringing about      of political and social changes desired by the people.'' Roth      v. United States, 354 U.S. 476, 484. ``The maintenance of the      opportunity for free political discussion to the end that      government may be responsive to the will of the people and      that changes may be obtained by lawful means, an opportunity      essential to the security of the Republic, is a fundamental      principle of our constitutional system.'' Stromberg v.      California, 283 U.S. 359, 369. Id. at 269.\4\       The decision in Sullivan related specifically to libel law.      But what made Sullivan so     transformative--what made it, as the eminent First Amendment      scholar Alexander Meiklejohn remarked, cause for ``dancing in      the streets'' \5\--was this: it recognized (in Madison's      words) that ``[t]he people, not the government, possess the      absolute sovereignty.'' Sullivan, 376 U.S. at 274. It      emphasized that the First Amendment protected the ``citizen-     critic'' of government. Id. at 282. It barred government      itself from seeking damages from insults directed at it by      its citizens. And it declared that ``public discussion is a      political duty.'' Id. at 270.       In the decades following Sullivan, these notions became      embedded in the First Amendment--and thus the rule of law--     through dozens of rulings of the Supreme Court. In      particular, and following from, the First Amendment      protection of public discussion is the right of the public to      receive information about government. The First Amendment is      not merely a bar on the affirmative suppression of speech; as      Chief Justice Rehnquist has observed, ``censorship . . . as      often as not is exercised not merely by forbidding the      printing of information in the possession of a correspondent,      but in denying him access to places where he might obtain      such information.'' William H. Rehnquist, ``The First      Amendment: Freedom, Philosophy, and the Law,'' 12 Gonz. L.      Rev. 1, 17 (1976).       And, indeed, the Supreme Court has repeatedly affirmed      Chief Justice Rehnquist's insight. ``[T]he First Amendment      goes beyond protection of the press and the self-expression      of individuals to prohibit government from limiting the stock      of information from which members of the public may draw.''      First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U.S. 765, 783      (1978); Accord Kleindienst v. Mandel, 408 U.S. 753, 762      (1972) (``In a variety of contexts this Court has referred to      a First Amendment right to `receive information and ideas.'      '').       The Supreme Court has thus ruled on four occasions that the      First Amendment creates a right for the public to attend and      observe criminal trials and related judicial proceedings,      absent the most extraordinary of circumstances. Richmond      Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia, 448 U.S. 555 (1980); Globe      Newspaper Co. v. Superior Court, 457 U.S. 596 (1982); Press-     Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court, 464 U.S. 501 (1984); Press-     Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court, 478 U.S. 1 (1986). The      cases are particularly relevant to this application because      they--perhaps more clearly than any others--illustrate the      core constitutional principle that government may not      arbitrarily foreclose the opportunity for citizens to obtain      information central to the decisions they make--and the      judgments they render--about government itself.       The teaching of this quartet of cases was aptly articulated      by another Chief Justice, Warren Burger, writing for the      Court in Richmond Newspapers, the first of the four      decisions. The First Amendment, he wrote, ``assur[es] freedom      of communication on matters relating to the functioning of      government.'' 448 U.S. at 575. Noting the centrality of the      openness in which trials were conducted to that end, id. at      575, the Court stated that openness was an ``indispensable      attribute of an Anglo-American trial.'' Id. at 569. It had      assured that proceedings were conducted fairly, and it had      ``discouraged perjury, the misconduct of participants, and      decisions based on secret bias''. Id. Most significantly,      open trials had provided public acceptance of and support for      the entire judicial process. It was with respect to this      benefit of openness--the legitimacy it provides to the      actions of government itself--that Chief Justice Burger (in      the passage quoted above), observed that ``[p]eople in an      open society do not demand infallibility from their      institutions, but it is difficult for them at accept what      they are prohibited from observing.'' Id. at 562.\6\       To be sure, the Chief Justice in Richmond Newspapers rested      heavily on the tradition of openness of criminal trials      themselves--a difference of potential relevance because      impeachment debates and deliberation have historically been      conducted in secret. But, taken together, Richmond Newspapers      and its progeny stand for propositions far broader than the      constitutional value of any specific historical practice. The      sheer range of proceedings endorsed as open by the Supreme      Court suggests the importance under the First Amendment of      public observation of the act of doing justice. Moreover,      Supreme Court precedent itself suggests that the crucial      right to see justice done prevails even where the specific      kind of proceeding at issue had a history of being closed to      the public. In Globe Newspaper Co.,  the Court ruled that the      First Amendment barred government from closing of trials of      sexual offenses involving minor victims. It did so despite      the ``long history of exclusion of the public from trials      involving sexual assaults, particularly those against      minors.'' 457 U.S. at 614 (Burger, C.J., dissenting).       New York Times Co. v. Sullivan and Richmond Newspapers have      significance which sweep far beyond their holdings that      debate about public figures must be open and robust and that      trials must be accessible to the public. Both cases--and all      the later cases they have spawned--are about the centrality      of openness to the process of self-governance. ``[T]he right      of access to criminal trials plays a particularly significant      role in the functioning of the judicial process and the      government as a whole. Public scrutiny of a criminal trial      enhances the quality and safeguards the integrity of the      fact-finding process, with benefits to both the defendant and      to society as a whole. . . . And in the broadest terms,      public access to criminal trials permits the public to      participate in and serve as a check upon the judicial      process--an essential component in our structure of self      government.'' Globe Newspaper Co., 457 U.S. at 606.       The First Amendment principles set forth above lead      inexorably to a straightforward conclusion: the Senate should      determine as a matter of First Amendment law that the public      may attend and observe its debates and deliberations about      the impeachment of President Clinton. No issue relates more      to self-government. No determinations will have more impact      on the public. No judgment of the Senate should be subject to      more--and more informed--public scrutiny.       We are well aware that it is sometimes easier to be      subjected to less public scrutiny and that some have the      perception (which has sometimes proved accurate) that more      can be accomplished more quickly in secret than in public.      But this is, at its core, an argument against democracy      itself, against the notion that it is the public itself which      should sit in judgment on the performance of this body. It is      nothing less than a rejection of the First Amendment itself.      What Justice Brennan said two decades ago in the context of      judicial proceedings is just as applicable here: ``Secrecy of      judicial action can only breed ignorance and distrust of      courts and suspicion concerning the competence and      impartiality of judges; free and robust reporting, criticism,      and debate can contribute to public understanding of the rule      of law and to comprehension of the functioning of the entire      criminal justice system, as well as improve the quality of      that system by subjecting it to the cleansing effects of      exposure and public accountability.'' Nebraska Press Ass'n v.      Stuart, 427 U.S. 539, 587 (1976) (Brennan, J., concurring).       That it is the tradition of this body to conduct      impeachment deliberations in closed session is not      irrelevant. But neither should it be governing. The Senate      has, after all, conducted only one presidential impeachment      trial before this one. Our society in 1868--and, more      significantly still, our law in 1868--was far different than      it is today. As we have demonstrated, First Amendment      jurisprudence as we know it--as it governs us and binds the      Senate--is essentially a creature of the twentieth century.      That jurisprudence assures public scrutiny, not public      ignorance.       There are, to be sure, certain limited instances when      closure of Senate deliberations may serve useful purposes,      such as when they involve disclosure of matters of national      security. But no such concerns are present here. And however      proper it may be to analogize the Senate in some ways to a      jury, none of the considerations that permits juries to      deliberate out of the public eye are present here. The      identities of the ``jurors'' her are well known, as, under      the Senate rules, will be how each one voted. The      Constitution does not offer protection to the ``jurors'' here      from the force of public opinion for their votes for or      against the conviction of President Clinton. They will face      the full weight of public approval or rejection the next time      they seek re-election. The Constitution does require that the      reasons they give for their votes and other statements made      in the course of debate be made in public so that both the      debate and the votes themselves can be assessed by the      people--the ultimate ``Governors'' in this republic.                               conclusion       From the time these proceedings commenced in the House of      Representatives through the submission of this application,      members of the Congress have repeatedly--and undoubtedly      correctly--referred to the weighty constitutional obligations      imposed upon them by this process. This application focuses      on yet another constitutional obligation of the members of      the Senate, an obligation reflected in the oath of office      itself. it is that of adhering to the First Amendment. We      urge the Senate to do so by permitting the public to observe      its deliberations.     Dated: New York, NY, January 29, 1999.
