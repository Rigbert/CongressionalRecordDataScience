Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, my staff behind me has suggested that Members should not forget to smile. I think it is appropriate that we take a picture of the House of Representatives and its Members on an annual basis, or at least once during every Congress. I think this is not only a substantial memento for those who have the great honor and privilege of serving here, but as well, an historical record of those who are here, and of course I rise in strong support of the resolution.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
