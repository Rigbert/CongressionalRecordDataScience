President, Sergeant Lawrence A. Roukey, a native of Maine, was honored today for his exceptional service and sacrifice by the Defense Intelligence Agency, DIA, in a ceremony at DIA Headquarters. SGT Roukey was among four servicemembers honored and inducted into the DIA Patriots' Memorial located in the lobby at DIA Headquarters on Joint Base Bolling Anacostia in Washington, DC. The DIA Patriots' Memorial honors DIA employees who died in service to the United States in support of DIA's mission.  As a recipient of the Bronze Star Medal and the Purple Heart, Sergeant Roukey has previously been recognized for emulating the highest values of selflessness, dedication, and courage. Let me illustrate how DIA described Sergeant Roukey's heroism and outstanding contribution on behalf of our country and why the agency is honoring him today. A member of the U.S. Army Reserve, Sergeant Roukey volunteered to serve during Operation Iraqi Freedom as a member of the security detail for the Iraq Survey Group mobile collection team that was conducting a critical field inspection in an anticoalition forces area. Under dangerous conditions, Sergeant Roukey and his squad mate provided protective security for personnel charged with inspecting a suspected weapons of mass destruction facility in Baghdad on April 26, 2004. Both soldiers lost their lives when a massive explosion occurred at the facility being inspected.  Prior to rejoining the military as an Army Reservist in Maine, Sergeant Roukey served in the U.S. Army infantry in South Korea and Egypt. He was a respected teammate in the Reserves and at the Portland Post Office, where he worked as a civilian, and he enjoyed hiking and sharing stories about his family.  It is fitting for the DIA and for all of us to honor Sergeant Roukey so close to Veterans Day, as well as all of the men and women who have sacrificed so much in defense of America and American values, including our military intelligence professionals. Prior to today's ceremony, the memorial at DIA honored 21 individuals for their ultimate sacrifice. Now the memorial honors 25 individuals. Today we commemorate Sergeant Roukey and the other servicemembers honored with him, as well as all of those who have served under the flag of the United States of America.                          ____________________
