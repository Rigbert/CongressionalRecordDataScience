Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Missouri [Mr. Emerson] and would point out to the Members and to all who are paying attention to this debate that the gentleman from Missouri has spent more time in regards to personally visiting feeding programs and soup kitchens. It is his amendment that consolidates many of the feeding programs and adds $100 million to that effort.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr. de la GARZA. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Maine [Mr. Baldacci].
