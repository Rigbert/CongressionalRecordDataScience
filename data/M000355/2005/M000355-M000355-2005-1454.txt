 President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous consent the Banking Committee be discharged from further consideration of PN 76, Pamela Hughes Patenaude, to be an Assistant Secretary of Housing and Urban Development; I further ask consent that the nomination be confirmed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.
