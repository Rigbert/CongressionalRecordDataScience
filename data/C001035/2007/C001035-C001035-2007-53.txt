President, I rise to speak in support of the National Agriculture and Food Defense Act of 2007 that my distinguished colleague, Senator Burr, and I are introducing today.  A decade ago, the General Accounting Office report illustrated the danger of lapses in food safety, a single-year toll of millions of cases of food-borne illnesses and 9,100 food-related deaths. I conducted a series of investigative hearings in 1998 that confirmed America faced significant risks from tainted food imports.  In 2003, I also chaired a Senate Homeland Security Committee hearing that pointed out new threats. I noted that al-Qaida had announced that the U.S. economy was a target, that hundreds of U.S. agricultural documents had been found translated into Arabic, and that some of the 9/11 terrorists had investigated using crop-dusting planes as weapons of agroterrorism.  Today, food security problems persist, and their potential for death and disruption has been greatly magnified by the terrorist threats against the United States. Ensuring the safety of our food must include considerations of homeland security.  We have all heard the recent news stories of contamination involving food and toothpaste imported from China. But the concerns extend far beyond anyone trading partner. Food and Drug Administration data for 2006 show that hundreds of shipments from India, Mexico, Denmark, the Dominican Republic, and other countries were impounded for defects or safety concerns. Considering that the vast majority of incoming food shipments are not inspected, these facts are troubling. Even more troubling, we must consider how much worse the potential impacts could be if large-scale deliberate contamination were attempted, whether by attacks on domestically produced food or imports or the distribution, production, and processing systems.  Congress has recognized the threats to our seaports, chemical facilities, transportation, and critical infrastructure. We have acted to protect these vital systems that sustain our economy. We must also extend our homeland security vigilance to the food that sustains our very lives.  The National Agriculture and Food Defense Act would integrate and strengthen the federal government's ability to promote food security. With the Department of Homeland Security in a directing role, and with sector-specific leadership roles for the Departments of Agriculture and Health and Human Services, the bill would providea coherent National Agriculture and Food Defense Strategy consistent with our national emergency management plans.  As Congress has already provided in other areas, the national food security strategy would address preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery. Its provisions for stockpiling veterinary supplies and establishing a plant-disease recovery program would add vital new Federal capabilities. Coordination of Federal food security budget activity and outreach State, local, and private sector stakeholders are also important features of the bill.  In light of the gravity of the threat to our food security and this measure's thoughtful and promising response to that threat, I encourage my colleagues to support expeditious action on this bill.                                 ______                                       By
