Speaker, it is with great pleasure and sincerity that I take this time to congratulate the individuals who took their oaths of citizenship on July 4, 2013. In true patriotic fashion, on the day of our great Nation's celebration of independence, a naturalization ceremony took place, welcoming new citizens of the United States of America. This memorable occasion, coordinated by the League of Women Voters of the Calumet Area and presided over by Magistrate Judge Andrew Rodovich, was held at The Pavilion at Wolf Lake in Hammond, Indiana.   America is a country founded by immigrants. From its beginning, settlers have come from countries around the globe to the United States in search of better lives for their families. The oath ceremony is a shining example of what is so great about the United States of America--that people from all over the world can come together and unite as members of a free, democratic nation. These individuals realize that nowhere else in the world offers a better opportunity for success than here in America.   On July 4, 2013, the following people, representing many nations throughout the world, took their oaths of citizenship in Hammond, Indiana: Chong Ran Embury, Weiping Zhong, Boyanka Radeva Odiseeva, Olena Mykhailivna Rogers, Izabela Zuzanna Mazur, Kavita Goyal, Pooja Goyal, Yoshiko Tonosaki Simpson, Nora Mardi, Margarita Figueroa De Cornejo, Syed Durvesh Mohiuddin, Eunice Childress, Rafael Navarro Gomez, Justyna Ksiazek, James Lisitsas, Yvonne Monalisa Odemba, Dragoljub Martinovic, Elizabeth Anne Robinson, Danute Jackson, Daniela Gotis, Edgardo Reyes Eliscupides, Sergio Hernandez Romo, Lynn Bouziotis, Nancy Alondra Gallardo, Jose Guadalupe Gonzalez Zambrano, Fadma Alburei, Maria Nazare Barros Bezerra, Liliana Guadalupe Brady, Norma Angelica Camarillo, Adrian Ferrer, Angel Giron, Vandana Mona Graham, Michael Ikechukwu Ibekie, Marija Klechkaroski, Maria Leanos Mota, Guillermina Lopez, Mauricio Lopez, Himelda Morua, Syeda Vajahath Muhiuddin, Antonio Ochoa, Cristina Pellegrini Rath, Amrit Pal Singh Sarai, Amela Spahic, Salvador Tinoco, Angela Arutiunovna Tonoyan-Hopkins, Huseyin Salih Usak, Ana Luisa Vargas, Genoveva Viramontes, and Jennifer Zhang.   Though each individual has sought to become a citizen of the United States for his or her own reasons, be it for education, occupation, or to offer their loved ones better lives, each is inspired by the fact that the United States of America is, as Abraham Lincoln described it, a country ``. . . of the people, by the people, and for the people.'' They realize that the United States is truly a free nation. By seeking American citizenship, they have made the decision that they want to live in a place where, as guaranteed by the First Amendment of the Bill of Rights, they can practice religion as they choose, speak their minds without fear of punishment, and assemble in peaceful protest should they choose to do so.   Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in congratulating these individuals, who became citizens of the United States of America on July 4, 2013, the day of our Nation's independence. As American citizens, they are guaranteed the inalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We, as a free and democratic nation, congratulate them and welcome them.                          ____________________
