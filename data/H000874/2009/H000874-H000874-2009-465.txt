Joseph C. Martin, a son of Maryland who devoted his life to helping tens of thousands of alcoholics overcome their addiction--an addiction he overcame himself. Father Martin drank heavily for more than a decade until, with the help of a treatment center for the clergy, he recovered his sobriety. Drawing on his personal struggle, Father Martin developed his famous ``Chalk Talk on Alcohol,'' a common-sense lecture on addiction that remains in heavy use to this day, from the U.S. Armed Forces to substance-abuse programs around the world.  Along with his hard-won lessons on sobriety, his most lasting legacy is Father Martin's Ashley, a treatment center overlooking the Chesapeake Bay in Harford County, Maryland. Father Martin's Ashley has kept its doors open for more than three decades and, with the guidance and leadership of its co-founder, has served more than 30,000 people. A giving, loving man who exemplified the best tenets of his faith and of the sobriety movement, Father Martin never turned away a potential patient who was short on funds. His example and his wise counsel enabled recovering alcoholics around the world to reclaim control of their lives.  Michael Deaver, who served as chief of staff to President Reagan and received treatment at Father Martin's Ashley, said: ``I had been with presidents, kings, popes, and prime ministers, but Father Martin was the most powerful person I had ever met. You see, Father has the power to change people, to make them better, to make them whole again.''  Though Father Martin is gone, I am sure that his legacy, his teaching, and his example will have that same power for years to come.                          ____________________
