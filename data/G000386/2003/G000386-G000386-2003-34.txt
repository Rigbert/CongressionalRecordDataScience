  She was active in this issue of Medicare prescription drugs a long time before I was. But on July 25, 2001, we held our first meeting of what was called the tripartisan group. She was obviously part of that tripartisan group along with Senators Hatch, Jeffords, Breaux, and Grassley.  I remember that meeting we had. The AARP sent us a birthday cake with a pie-shaped piece cut out of it. Their admonition to the tripartisan group was: Fill in the missing piece. The missing piece of Medicare was prescription drugs.  The Senator from Maine has been very aggressive since July 25 in various ways, helping us fill in that piece of the pie. On August 1 of that year, we held a news conference, all five of us, announcing our plans for doing that. We have not exactly come out where we were a year ago. We probably have come out a lot better with the legislation we have before us. But regardless, the Senator from Maine was in on the ground floor, a long time before I was, on that issue.  I yield to the Senator from Maine 7 minutes.
