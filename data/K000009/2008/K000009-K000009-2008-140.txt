Thomson, Jr. of Toledo, Ohio.  Louis M. Thomson, Jr., blessed Toledo, OH with his many talents, always giving an enthusiastic word about his native city. Louis passed from this life April 18, 2008, but will always be remembered by his family and friends for his warm smile, quick wit and uncompromising passion to better his community. Louis served as a longtime labor arbitrator, fact-finder, and mediator. Mr. Thomson, a Toledo native, graduated from Scott High School in 1945. Afterwards he serve in the U.S. Army from 1945 to 1947, later graduating from the University of Toledo in 1950. Louis started his career with the city of Toledo in 1960 as director of public information and industrial relations, a position he held until 1968.  Following his position with the city of Toledo, he served as the director of the Toledo Labor-Management-Citizens Committee from 1968 until 1991. He worked as an independent arbitrator, fact-finder, and mediator. During his years on the job, he was known for working behind the scenes to improve the local labor climate. His family and colleagues remembered how he enjoyed helping to resolve labor disputes. His wife, Rose Thomson, recalled that the career called on him to be neutral and exercise good judgment. She said, ``He liked listening to all the different things and trying to decide if people had been treated properly''.  He retired from the job two weeks before his death and only because of his failing health. In addition to his work, Mr. Thomson was involved with a number of local community groups, including the University of Toledo Alumni Association, which he had served as president; the Scott Alumni Association; the City of Toledo Credit Union, of which he was also a past president; the Toledo Museum of Art; the Maumee Valley Historical Society; the Committee on Relations with Toledo, Spain, and numerous other organizations.  Louis simply desired to help people and do things for other, and in the meantime improve the city of Toledo as well. However, the organization closest to his heart was the Toledo Zoo, family members recalled. They estimated he had been involved with the Toledo Zoo for nearly 50 years because it was a landmark for the people of Toledo and surrounding areas. His love for the Toledo Zoo mimicked his love for the Toledo community. Louis always promoted the city of Toledo from an industrial, business and cultural perspective, never ceasing in the opinion that Toledo was a great place to live.  Toledo will miss one of its dearest sons. May his positive spirit and love of community be remembered in word and deed by all Toledo residents.                          ____________________
