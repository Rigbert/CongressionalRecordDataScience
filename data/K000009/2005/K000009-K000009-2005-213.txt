Speaker, I join my colleagues in congratulating the people of Ukraine on their free and fair election that elevated Victor Yushchenko to the office of President. I have joined my colleagues in extending an invitation to President Yushchenko to address the Congress.  Just days before the elections, I traveled to Ukraine for the ninth time. On November 21, Ukraine held a run-off election for the office of President between Victor Yushchenko and Victor Yanukovych. International observers immediately found widespread fraud and declared the election invalid. Immediately following these events, supporters of the opposition party took to the streets to demand a recount or a new vote in what has been dubbed the ``Orange Revolution.'' The Ukrainian Supreme Court agreed and called for new elections. Our six member Congressional delegation added our voices for a free and fair revote in the Presidential elections to be held December 26 in that nation of nearly 50 million people.  My first journey to Ukraine inspired a three-decade long quest that now explodes in the hearts of the people of Ukraine. The momentum of the opposition party in Ukraine is with the young. They crowded into the streets of Kiev. They blazed a trail on email. They are building a new future for Ukraine and this election cycle has been a transformational moment for them.  Ukraine was host to thousands of election observers from around the world, and from within Ukraine, with the purpose of preventing the abuses that characterized the earlier elections, particularly manipulation of mobile voting stations and absentee voting. Laws had been passed in parliament to avoid these pitfalls. However, election observers were critical in assuring a fair vote.  I continue to ponder how much Ukraine has changed in my lifetime. When I first drove into Ukraine in 1973, there were no other cars on the road other than military vehicles. Today, though far from an open society, Ukraine is making major strides toward developing liberty's institutions. The impact of this election in inspiring the next generation of Ukraine's youth cannot be underestimated. There is enormous fervor among the young people. Their free assembly is allowed in many regions of the nation.  As Co-Chair of the Congressional Caucus, I look forward to building strong ties between our nations. Just a few weeks ago, the Congress held a videoconference with members of the Ukrainian parliament, the Rada. As part of our 1999 agreement, we will continue to hold these discussions, both in person and via videoconference. Our relationship has just begun to blossom. I am very hopeful for Ukraine and her people.                          ____________________
