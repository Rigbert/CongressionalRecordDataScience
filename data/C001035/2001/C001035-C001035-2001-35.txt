President, I rise to comment the managers of the Treasury, Postal appropriation bill, Chairman Dorgan and Ranking Member Campbell, for including in their bill funds to increase the number of Customs officers stationed on our northern border. I particularly commend their foresight, which was confirmed by the tragic events of last week, and the suggestion that some of the terrorists may have entered the United States through ports of entry in my home State of Maine.
