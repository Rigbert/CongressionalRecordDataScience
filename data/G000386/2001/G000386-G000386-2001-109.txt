 I appreciate the man, he is a friend of mine, and I do not have any ill will towards him, but I just do not want to yield at this point.  Would I suggest this amendment is about politics? I could not suggest this amendment is about politics. But here is what we have to do. We have to think of the reality of it. We are trying to make Government work. When you are sending out $60-some billion in checks, you want to make sure they go to the people they are supposed to go to, and you want to know that the people know this is happening and what they are supposed to do with it.  Some suggest we should have the notices, but the wording should be changed. As stated earlier, I believe the wording is important to better inform taxpayers. Further, to rewrite and reprint the notice will cost millions of dollars and delay the notices by weeks. Delay would undermine the whole point of the notice: To better inform the people prior to checks being issued.  Remember, you want to get the checks out on time because of the stimulus benefit that comes from this. That is not just my saying this as a Republican because you want to remember, the last week of March people on the other side of the aisle said we ought to have an immediate tax rebate to help the economy. So that is something we both agreed ought to be done.  This notice, the Treasury Department informs me, will actually be cost-effective. If there is no notice, the IRS will be flooded with calls and will not be able to perform other valuable and important activities. The language regarding notices is in the conference report because of concerns about the impact of issuing checks on IRS operations.  Finance Committee staff has met with the Treasury Department several times to ensure that the notice and check effort is performed with minimal trouble.  In addition, Senator Baucus and I have asked the GAO to oversee the notice and check effort to ensure it is properly managed.  I reserve the remainder of my time.
