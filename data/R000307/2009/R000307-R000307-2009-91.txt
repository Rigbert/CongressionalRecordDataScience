This is a very ambitious budget, particularly, coming on the heels of this omnibus package. It seems as if we have one huge bill after another--TARP, omnibus, stimulus, and now budget.  For the first time we are looking at a budget that tops $3.6 trillion. At a time when many families are struggling, this budget asks them, to support Federal spending on new and very questionable programs and higher taxes to support those programs. We ought to be concentrating instead on the scope of the economic recovery package, not on these other programs--which I will go into in just a moment.  I also want to help set the record straight with regard to the Federal deficit. If we are ever going to achieve any progress, and with some bipartisan support, then we ought to quit looking in the rear-view mirror and citing some statistics that do not add up. Facts are stubborn. Since the new administration took office, we have heard a persistent drumbeat from the majority about the legacy of debt that they say they have inherited from the previous administration.
