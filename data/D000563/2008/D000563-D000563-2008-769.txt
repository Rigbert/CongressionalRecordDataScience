President, if the Senator will yield for only two or three more questions.  I might acknowledge the fact that currently those lenders can renegotiate the terms of a mortgage without a bankruptcy court and that giving them the last word is going to diminish, I believe, the likelihood that they would agree to anything by the bankruptcy court.  I might also say that under chapter 12 bankruptcies and on farm loans a few years ago, we gave this authority to the Bankruptcy Court and the lenders said: Oh, interest rates will go up, and they didn't.  But I wish to ask this specific question. My amendment limits these modifications to mortgages that are subprime mortgages, and the Specter bill, S. 2133, says these modifications would apply to any type of loan, even prime fixed rate mortgages. Is that not correct?
