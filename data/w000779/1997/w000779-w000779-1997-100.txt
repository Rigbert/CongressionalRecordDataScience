President, I hope our colleagues will oppose the Bingaman amendment. This is not a question of ``not in my backyard'' run rampant. In fact, Hanford is in the State of Washington. It is not in the State of Oregon.  The reason that it is important to include Hanford in this legislation is that there is no place in the United States where nuclear materials are now stored under worse conditions than at Hanford. In fact, there is already more high-level nuclear waste stored at Hanford than at any other Federal facility in the country. I offered this in the committee with Senator Smith of Oregon.  I hope our colleagues will reject the Bingaman amendment.
