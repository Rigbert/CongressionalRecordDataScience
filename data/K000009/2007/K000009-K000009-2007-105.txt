 Congressman Hare and I are thinking about going to track the whole Maytag saga, starting in his home community but then going over to Iowa and the whole buyout of Maytag by Wall Street and the shedding of jobs, thousands, thousands of jobs.  Then, in my home State of Ohio, 2,000 more jobs hang in the balance at a place called Hoover Vacuum, which was part of this leveraged buyout. There was an article recently in the paper about the Maytags now being made by Samsung in South Korea, 250,000 of them being recalled in this country because they are burning up. They are actually catching on fire because water is dripping off the back onto the electrical panel. That never happened with Maytag. The Maytag repairman really was in that little room, and nobody bothered him.  I think it is important for us as Members to tell the story, whether it is Maytag, whether it is Champion, Dixon Ticonderoga, companies that Congressman Michaud worked for, and whether it is Maytag. We need to help America give full voice to what is happening.  It is interesting how little is on television, because some of the very same advertisers that own the airwaves do not want this story on there.  I understand Lou Dobbs is coming to Congress this week for a hearing that Congressman Sherman is going to have. That is one of the few reporters that even talks about this, but for the most part you do not see this on the evening news.  So I am very anxious to travel and tell the Maytag story and then maybe tell the story of Brachs Candy and tell the story of some our steel mills and to give these workers, first, appreciation for the fine products that they have built and it is not their fault and to say that we understand, but we know we are outnumbered sometimes, but our numbers are growing.
