I thank him for his amendment. I would like to engage him in a colloquy if I might.  There could be a situation here when States are able to define the food items that are eligible, that conceivably that could slow down the conversion by States to the EBT system.  I know that that is not the outcome that the gentleman anticipates or wants and the body should understand that if it looks like this could occur, that the 2-year time frame can be extended to 5 years. I think the gentleman has stated this, but I wanted to make sure that that was the gentleman's intent.
