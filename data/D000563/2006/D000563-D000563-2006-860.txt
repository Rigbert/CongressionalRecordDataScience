REID. We know, I say to my friend, what can be done in this body if we get a nudge from the President, a little bipartisanship. Look what we did, I say to my friend. We spent several weeks on the Senate floor on a bipartisan basis passing a comprehensive immigration reform bill. Why were we able to do that? Because the President decided to get involved in it. He decided it was time to do comprehensive immigration reform, and I complimented him on that.  Isn't that the way we should be legislating around here, I say to my friend, the distinguished Senator from Illinois? Shouldn't we be working in conjunction with the White House on these issues, bills that we can pass, something that has some meaning, having the President lead a charge on health care reform, not little specks of things here? How about doing something here to lessen our dependence on foreign oil. We use in America 21 million barrels of oil a day--21 million barrels of oil every day, every day, 66 percent of it is from foreign sources. We have less than 3 percent, counting what is in Alaska, for the United States. We can't drill our way out of our problems. I say to my friend from Illinois, maybe that is what it is all about.
