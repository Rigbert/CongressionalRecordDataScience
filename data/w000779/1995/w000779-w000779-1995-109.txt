CONYERS. And the other thing that bothers me:  The gentleman raised the name of Professor Wilson, who is a great scholar of criminal justice but whose ideas and mine occasionally comport, and just as often they probably do not.  So, as my colleagues know, what they are asking us to do is adopt a new philosophy, and I am sure when they say the juvenile system does not work, they mean some parts of it do not work, and there are in many instances for many youngsters that do not keep repeating crimes where the juvenile system has been very successful. But in some instances it has not been, but it is not a total failure, like other systems.  So what I am suggesting here respectfully is:       Shouldn't this matter be considered in the committee? It's      an incredibly important event, but now the gentleman from      Oregon is asking me to accept a new philosophy on the floor.      He's mentioned a professor's name, and that's supposed to do      it. I don't know what that philosophy is. It's not clear to      me exactly where we are going here.
