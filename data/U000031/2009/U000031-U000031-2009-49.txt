Throughout the month of October, Mr. Art Van Elslander and Art Van Furniture are celebrating 50 years as a family-owned and Michigan-based company.  In my district, the city of Kalamazoo is home to an Art Van Furniture store that has been dedicated to supplying guests with quality furniture and superior customer service. They have continued to provide jobs and revenue to the local economy during a time when Southwest Michigan has needed it most.  As Michigan's largest furniture retailer with 32 locations, Art Van Furniture has brought recognition and notoriety to our State by receiving numerous distinguished honors. One recent accolade was the 2009 Retailer of the Year Award from Furniture Today, a furniture industry publication. In acknowledgment of their green efforts, the Michigan Retailers Association named Art Van Furniture a 2007GreenTailer. This inaugural honor is given to retailers who are protecting the environment by adopting energy conservation and Earth-friendly practices.  Providing continual and vital economic growth to local communities statewide by employing more than 2,500 Michiganders, Art Van Furniture has been continually named one of West Michigan's 101 Best and Brightest places to work. Furthermore, Art Van Furniture has an exceptional record of giving back to area charities and communities through a variety of generous financial contributions.  Again, it is my honor to rise today in honor of Art Van Furniture on the monumental occasion of its 50th anniversary. Congratulations and best wishes for another five decades.                          ____________________
