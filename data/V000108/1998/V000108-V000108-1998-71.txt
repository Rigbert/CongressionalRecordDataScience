Speaker, on behalf of the people of Northwest Indiana that I represent and as an Indiana University and Notre Dame University graduate, I want to congratulate Valparaiso University, which is in the First Congressional District of Indiana. I want to congratulate the Valparaiso men's basketball team on their impressive wins in the first and second rounds of the NCAA Tournament. It is a remarkable achievement for Valparaiso University and a great source of pride for me and the citizens I represent.  Valparaiso is the smallest school represented in the tournament, with a total of 2,700 undergraduate students. Nonetheless, Valparaiso has seen a level of success few teams have experienced. They have won both the regular season conference title and the Mid-Continent Conference tournament title for the last 4 years, a feat accomplished by only three other teams in NCAA history.  Valparaiso has been to the NCAA tournament twice before this year. It was unable to advance beyond the first round. This year it is different. Valparaiso has now become only the second 13-seed in history to advance to the Sweet Sixteen. Their opening round win over the University of Mississippi last Friday was nothing short of inspiring.  For the six senior players who have fought hard to bring success to this team and this school, it was an amazing culmination of determination and perseverance that led to their victory. Bryce Drew's 3-point shot to win the game was reminiscent of the final scene in the movie ``Hoosiers,'' in which a tiny high school team came together in the waning seconds to win the championship game against a much larger and more powerful foe.  After Valparaiso's second-round overtime win over Florida State on Sunday, coach Homer Drew said, ``Only in America and only in the NCAA Tournament can you have the opportunity to go against the best athletes and the best programs in America. We beat two schools from the best conferences in America.''  Coach Drew and his team have proven that hard work and persistence eventually lead to success. The coach has spent the last 10 seasons building the basketball program that exists today. His dedication to the success of the program and the success of his players merits recognition. In the last 6 years, he has seen 80 percent of his players graduate, a higher rate than the school has as a whole. Further, all six players on this year's team who are seniors are set to graduate. He has been a positive influence on his students, a model of sportsmanship on the sidelines, an example of the type of hard work that makes the people of Northwest Indiana great.  Not only has Valparaiso University continued to shine on the basketball court, but the school itself has a stellar academic record. Valparaiso has consistently ranked in the top 15 of regional universities, as published by U.S. News and World Report. This year, of the over 500 colleges listed, Valparaiso is ranked number two of the best universities in the Midwest, and Valparaiso's overall graduation rate of 72 percent makes them one of the best schools around.  I would like to wish Coach Drew and the Valparaiso Crusaders the best of luck for their game against the University of Rhode Island on Friday. This is an exciting time for the people I represent and for college basketball fans everywhere.                          ____________________
