 President, we in Delaware, the first State to ratify the Constitution, take great pride in our history, and a special part of that history is represented by the City of New Castle, which is celebrating its 350th anniversary this year.  New Castle was founded by the Dutch in 1651 as Fort Casimir. Because of its strategic location on what is now the Delaware River, the settlement was sought and held by a series of colonial powers, the Dutch, the Swedes and, finally, the British.  When William Penn was given authority over the so-called ``lower three counties,'' which became the State of Delaware, he traveled to New Castle to take possession. When the counties were granted an independent legislature, New Castle became the colonial capital, and briefly, the first State capital, of Delaware.  Despite a devastating fire in 1824, which destroyed many of the structures on the historic, river-front street called The Strand, and all the changes and pressures of the intervening years, New Castle's colonial history is still a defining and very visible part of the town's life and character.  Several of its remaining colonial era buildings have been converted into museums, including the Dutch House, which dates to the 17th Century, and the Old Court House, which was built in 1732 and was the meeting place for the colonial and State assemblies from that year until 1777. George Read was one of three signers of the Declaration of Independence who lived in New Castle; although his house was destroyed by the Great Fire, the current Read House, which was built by his son in 1801, is one of the most striking attractions of the town.  But New Castle itself is not a museum. It is a residential town, it is a vibrant community. New Castle is home to two churches that date back to the earliest part of the 18th Century, and they have active congregations today. Families live in the homes that were built so long ago, families who add their own mark to those of previous owners, with a sensitivity and obligation to preserve the unique character of the town, New Castle is, not surprisingly, a National Landmark Historic Area.  With its history as a colonial seat for the legislature and the courts, New Castle has a tradition of political activity and public leadership, and many of its citizens have played prominent roles throughout the history of Delaware and our nation.  In addition, as a personal point, although I know it is a perspective shared by many Delawareans, New Castle is one of my favorite places in our State. It is more than historic and scenic; it is, simply, beautiful, a place where the past and present meet with remarkable harmony and spirit. It is inspiring.  I share the pride of Delaware with the Senate, and with the Nation, today, in marking the 350th anniversary of the founding of New Castle, and I am proud to extend congratulations and best wishes to the mayor, city council, trustees and all the citizens and friends of the town, which is a valued and unique treasure to us all.                          ____________________
