 President, Senators have been working diligently this week, continuing our efforts to advance American priorities and responsibly fund important programs through the appropriations process. We have made good progress so far. The Senate already passed one funding bill by a broad majority at a record early time. Another Appropriations subcommittee approved its own funding bill just the other day, and it is my hope that we will be able to move two more funding measures across the finish line very shortly. With continued work and cooperation, we can do just that.  The two measures before us are the result of hard work, negotiation, and compromise. They are the product of strong leadership by Senators Collins and Kirk, and they are the culmination of a good deal of input from both sides of the aisle.  Here is what we know these bills can achieve: The transportation and housing infrastructure appropriations bill will invest in our transportation systems and help ensure safety and efficiency. The veterans and military construction funding bill will help improve care for veterans and increase oversight and accountability efforts at the VA.  The legislation before us will also include a provision to help address Zika. This compromise provision will focus on immediate needs while also providing resources for longer term goals such as a vaccine. It is another reminder that keeping Americans safe and healthy is a top priority for us all. Let's continue our work today to move these important funding measures closer to passage.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
