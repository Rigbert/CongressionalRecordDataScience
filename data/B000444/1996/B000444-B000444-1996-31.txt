 President, I realize I still have the floor. A number of people want to speak. Before my colleague leaves the floor, let me say that one of the things that I know he has knowledge about is how so much has changed in the last 30 years. And that is that we had plenty of room to expand with airports in certain areas. We do not have that same flexibility now. We had the ability to expand the highways in certain areas. We do not have that now. He may be right that this trust fund might in fact meet the same fate that he suggested the others had. But the bottom line is that I am a lot better off with this than I am with any other alternative that I can think of. I think that is fair. I thank him. I know he sincerely means it when he says he will listen. And I thank him very much for that. I thank my friend from Oregon. He indicated that he might have a question. I yield for a question.
