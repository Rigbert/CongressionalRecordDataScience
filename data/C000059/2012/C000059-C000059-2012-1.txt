Speaker, today we honor seven Members of Congress from California who have honorably served in the United States House of Representatives. The combined experience, knowledge, and expertise of my departing colleagues will be sorely missed.  I have been joined by some of my California Members who will be coming in and out; they may wish to speak and we will be happy to yield to them. But first we have a good friend from North Dakota who is also departing, U.S. Representative Rick Berg, and I will yield to him.
