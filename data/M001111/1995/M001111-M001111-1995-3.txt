 President, this letter shows unity and it demonstrates support for President Clinton in his negotiations on this vital matter. As you heard the eloquent Senator from West Virginia describe yesterday, sometimes we have to look beyond partisanship and do what needs doing as Americans. As you heard our respected colleague say, we need to look beyond partisanship, toward compromise if we want to succeed in creating a balanced budget.  This letter is partisan in that it is signed by all Democrats. But it is my feeling that as Americans every Member of the Senate should have an opportunity to endorse the position described in this document. As Americans we all must do our very best for our children in this Nation, and that is what this letter is about.  As the Senators from Nebraska and North Dakota discussed yesterday with the release of the Senate Democratic budget, we can balance the budget in 7 years using the most conservative CBO estimates without hurting our children.  This letter I hold in my hand reflects just one part of that commitment. I do not think my colleagues across the aisle are advocating the block grants so that we will intentionally hurt children in this country. I will simply tell you the reaction of people at the State and local level who actually provide Medicaid services to children is overwhelmingly negative.  They can see from the grassroots level what it will mean to design a Medicaid program, and they do not want drastic funding cuts, and they do not want a block grant, because it fundamentally will not work.  Groups representing almost every decisionmaker and provider in this country have come out against the Medicaid block grant proposal. The Conference of Mayors, the National Association of County Officials, the National Conference of State Legislatures, the Democratic Governors Association, the American Hospital Association, and most other medical provider organizations, and all child advocacy groups, all have rallied in opposition to this bad idea.  I heard yesterday from Mayor Norm Rice of Seattle and the Mayors Association, who are sending a letter of their own to the President. The block grant has been condemned by anyone who has thought about how it will affect this country's children and other vulnerable populations. Tonight there will be a child within a few blocks from this building who will need the help of a caring health care professional, and Medicaid will pay for the care.  Marion Wright Edelman uses a phrase that sums up what we are talking about when it comes to Medicaid and children, ``protection of last resort.'' We have to guarantee that protection. It is a moral commitment, and it is within our grasp. We can balance the budget but we can do it without giving in to mindless partisanship and we can do it without sacrificing our basic commitments.                               Exhibit 1                                                  U.S. Senate,                                 Washington DC, December 13, 1995.     President William J. Clinton,     The White House,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. President: We are writing to express our strong      support for the Medicaid per-capita cap structure in your      seven-year budget. We have fought against Medicaid block      grants and cuts in the Senate, and we are glad you      acknowledge the importance of our position.       We support a balanced budget. We are glad you agree with us      that we can balance the budget without undermining the health      of children, pregnant women, the disabled, and the elderly.       The savings level of $54 billion over seven years included      in your budget will require rigorous efficiencies and      economies in the program. However, after consulting with many      Medicaid Directors and service providers across the country,      we believe a reduction of this level is possible to achieve      without dramatic limits on eligibility or cuts to essential      services. States will need flexibility to achieve these      savings, and you have taken steps toward granting it in your      bill.       We were encouraged that your Medicaid proposal does not pit      Medicaid populations against one another in a fight over a      limited pot of federal resources.       We were further encouraged to hear Chief of Staff Panetta      relay your commitment to veto any budget not containing a      fundamental guarantee to Medicaid for eligible Americans.       We commend you on the courage you have exercised in making      these commitments to Americans eligible for Medicaid. There      is a bottom line when it comes to people's health; do not      allow the current Congressional leadership to further reduce      our commitment to Medicaid beneficiaries.       Your current proposal is fair and reasonable, and is      consistent with what we have advocated on the Senate floor.      We urge you in the strongest possible terms to hold fast to      these commitments in further negotiations. We are prepared to      offer any assistance you may need in this regard.           Sincerely,         Bob Graham; John Breaux; Jay Rockefeller; Herb Kohl;            Patrick Leahy; Frank R.
