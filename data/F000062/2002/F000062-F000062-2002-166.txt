 President, this amendment would say that in an emergency, instead of having to wait 240 days for the EPA to respond, either to serious harm to the economy or an inadequate domestic supply or distribution capacity to meet the requirements of the mandate, the EPA would have 90 days to consider that.  I ask unanimous consent this amendment be set aside.
