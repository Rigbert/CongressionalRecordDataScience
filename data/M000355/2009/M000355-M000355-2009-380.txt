 President, I would like to take a moment to recognize the first Honor Flight from Kentucky for the 2009 operational season. Many members of this body have had the chance to see their constituents at the World War II Memorial because of the noble work Honor Flight does in transporting surviving World War II veterans from around the country to see their memorial free of charge. I am honored to have been invited to participate in previous flights from the Commonwealth, and I regret that my schedule prevented me from attending the one that took place this past weekend. I hope to have the chance once again to visit with Kentucky Honor Flight participants.  On Saturday, May 16, Honor Flight's Bluegrass Chapter arrived in our Nation's Capital with 79 World War II veterans from my home State of Kentucky to see the memorial which they inspired. It is my hope that these veterans felt a sense of pride in seeing their memorial after all, pride is the very same feeling these men and women inspire in their fellow Americans.  In my previous experiences in meeting with the participants of Honor Flight trips, people of all ages have been humbled by the presence of these veterans at the memorial. School children have shook hands with the men and women who served in World War II and thanked them for their service. Others have asked for the privilege of taking a photo with a real-life American hero. Still more, including myself, have shared stories that have been passed down through generations about how World War II affected their family. In watching these interactions, one thing is clear: the sacrifices that these men and women made will never be forgotten.  I wish to express my sincere gratitude to the Kentucky veterans who were here over the weekend for having served to protect our great nation's principles from the enemies of freedom. I ask unanimous consent that the names of the 79 World War II veterans from the Commonwealth be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                         World War II Veterans       Allen Courts, Robert Adams, Charles Alessandro, Donald      Cobb, Kenneth Gillespie, Guthrie Catlin, Joe Terrell, Donivan      Mahuron, George Spaulding, George Schembari, Dale Tinkle,      Jack Distler, Walter Pearce, Joseph Crouse, Kathleen      Drummond, Clarence Lange, Leroy Lange, Marcus Shearer,      Garland Lewis, Gordon Lewis.
