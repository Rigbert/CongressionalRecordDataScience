 Very frankly, I am convinced that the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Rogers) and the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Lowey)--Mrs. Lowey being the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee; Mr. Rogers being the Republican chair--could agree today and could bring a bill to the floor on Tuesday that would get overwhelming support.  The gentleman knows that in accommodating some in your caucus either for legislative additions to the appropriation bill for which you need a waiver--as you know having served on the Appropriations Committee, legislating on appropriation bills is not consistent with the rules, and therefore you need a waiver to accomplish that--and the, what we hear, unwillingness to fund the Homeland Security agency, which, as the gentleman from South Carolina, Senator Graham, said just the other day was a bad idea and would undermine national security because of the duties of the Homeland Security Department, what the leader on our side of the aisle, the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), was saying is that we cannot commit to something that, A, we don't know what is happening fully, that hasn't been decided yet, but, secondly, that is inconsistent with the agreement that we have on a bipartisan basis with the Ryan-Murray funding caps and that we think Mr. Rogers and Mrs. Lowey have agreed upon and can report out a bill that will be one that we can support fully. That, I think, is what the leader is saying. I agree with her on that.  I am, therefore, hopeful that the bill will be in a fashion that will reflect, A, the Ryan-Murray agreement on numbers, and, B, not have in it ``poison pills,'' as we refer to them, that will make it difficult, if not impossible, for us to support. Both of us want to keep the government open. That is the responsibility of the appropriations bills. Other extraneous legislative actions that may want to be taken which would put that at risk I would hope would not be taken; and that was, I think, what the leader was saying.  If the gentleman has nothing further, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________
