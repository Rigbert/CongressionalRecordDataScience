 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a man who dedicated most of his career to making Kentucky government run more smoothly. For over 20 years, Vic Hellard, Jr., who passed away September 18, worked behind the scenes as the glue that held the Kentucky General Assembly together.  Vic Hellard was born and raised in Versailles, KY, the son of a Ford dealer. He received his undergraduate degree from Eastern Kentucky University and earned a law degree from the University of Kentucky. In fact, Vic and I attended law school together. He later practiced law in Versailles and was twice elected to the State House of Representatives.  After a year as chief counsel to House Speaker Bill Kenton, Mr. Hellard was hired as director of the Legislative Research Commission--the administrative and research arm of the General Assembly. He held this position from 1977 until his retirement in 1995. This career spanned a period of sweeping change in Kentucky government.  Former House Speaker Bobby Richardson told the Courier-Journal, ``Vic's legacy is that he turned the LRC into a professional, informed support staff for the legislature, which allowed the legislature to become an equal partner with the governor.''  Attorney General Ben Chandler said of Mr. Hellard, ``He was the shepherd of legislative independence, but he never accepted the credit he deserved for anything he did. That was part of his charm.''  Mr. Hellard was also known for remaining above the fray. He was always courteous to lawmakers regardless of their party affiliation or seniority. He always avoided partisan and factional rivalries.  Vic Hellard, Jr. is survived by his wife, Ellen Carpenter Hellard, his mother, Leona Tilghman Hellard, and two brothers, George D. and Ronald W. Hellard. I ask that my colleagues join me in paying tribute to this outstanding Kentuckian.                          ____________________
