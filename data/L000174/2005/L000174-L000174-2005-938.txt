President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a number of recent editorials regarding the nomination of Alberto Gonzales.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Los Angeles Times, Jan. 6, 2005]   A Window on a Man's Morality; Alberto R. Gonzales' Record Raises         Questions About His Fitness To Serve as Attorney General       The Republicans' comfortable majority in the Senate means      that Alberto R. Gonzales will almost certainly be confirmed      as the next attorney general. With hearings on his nomination      set to start today, many Democrats think the best they can do      is wound Gonzales enough with questions about his notorious      torture memos to disqualify him for any future Supreme Court      seat. In the end, however, they will feel pressure to support      him or face retaliation from Republicans.       They should resist.       The eight Democrats and a smattering of moderate      Republicans who voted for John Ashcroft four years ago      probably felt the same pressure.       No one now can doubt the enormous power the attorney      general wields or the lasting harm the person who holds that      office can do. Gonzales may not share his predecessor's zeal      in hounding X-rated moviemakers or cancer patients who smoke      marijuana, but as the president's chief lawyer, he has been      every bit as reckless.       As a leading architect of Bush's ends-justifies-means war      on terror, Gonzales pushed to justify torturing terror      suspects in violation of international law, promoted military      tribunals that echo Stalin's show trials, helped write the      Patriot Act (which, among other powers, gives government      agents vast new snooping authority) and excused the limitless      imprisonment of American citizens whom the president merely      suspects of terror activity.       Three years into that war, much of Gonzales' handiwork has      been rejected by courts, damned by the world community and      disavowed by the administration--as in the Justice Department      memo quietly released last week declaring that ``torture is      abhorrent to both American law and values and to      international norms.''       Gonzales' defenders argue that, as White House counsel, he      was simply a passionate advocate for his client. But the most      devoted counselor knows that, even in wartime, there are      legal and moral lines this nation crosses at peril to its own      citizens and those of other countries. Gonzales'      justifications opened the door to the abuse at Abu Ghraib      prison and the Guantanamo Bay detention facility. The      mistreatment and prisoner deaths that occurred have raised      fears of retaliation against captured Americans. Those      concerns prompted a dozen retired generals and admirals,      along with civil rights groups, to oppose Gonzales'      nomination.       Our justice system relies on an attorney general willing to      defend civil liberties as ardently as he pursues criminals      and terrorists. That person must be someone who respects both      the power and the limits of law.       Gonzales' record as White House counsel is not just a      series of unfortunate missteps; rather, it is a troubling      window into the man's morality and his fitness to be the      nation's chief lawyer. Democratic senators will surely ask      Gonzales sharp and embarrassing questions about the      principles that guided his tenure in the Office of Legal      Counsel. These lawmakers then ought to demonstrate that they      understand the principles at stake by actually voting no.                                  ____              [From the Arizona Daily Star, Jan. 8, 2005]                           Wrong for the Job       George W. Bush understandably wants a trusted adviser to be      his next attorney general. White House Counsel Alberto      Gonzales enjoys that trust, but the President's nominee is      the wrong man for the job.       With Republicans outnumbering Democrats by 55-45 in the      Senate, Gonzales is likely to win approval for the position.      Yet, the man who advocated the use of torture as an      interrogation tool is not only unqualified, he is a threat to      the rights of Americans.       Before Thursday's Senate hearing on his nomination,      Gonzales was merely a legal adviser who was unqualified. But      during the hearing he showed himself to be a man of      questionable morality and ethics.       For example, his 2002 memo to the president stated that the      war on terror ``renders obsolete Geneva's strict limitations      on questions of enemy prisoners and renders quaint some of      its provisions.'' The Geneva Conventions outline how      prisoners of war should be treated.       But when questioned by the Senate on Thursday, Gonzales      said this: ``Contrary to reports, I consider the Geneva      Conventions neither obsolete nor quaint.'' He said his early      interpretation applies only to organizations like al-Qaida      that have no national affiliation and do not ``fight      according to the laws of war.'' And he said the Geneva      Conventions' protections for terrorists would ``honor and      reward bad conduct.'' And he pledged to prosecute those who      tortured terrorism suspects.       However, he noted that the White House is looking to change      some of the Geneva Conventions' guidelines. There again, one      has to question whether Gonzales is saying the right things      in order to win the job.       His statements now and in the past are inconsistent at      best. But more important, the legal opinion he forwarded to      the president and this administration cannot be separated      from the scandals of torture and death at Abu Ghraib prison      in Iraq.       It is significant that among his Senate supporters,      Gonzales' legal abilities and his leadership skills are      hardly mentioned as top qualifications. Supportive senators      instead promote the nominee's rags-to-riches story. Second      among his qualifications is that he would become the nation's      first Hispanic attorney general.       This administration has an affinity for those kinds of      stories. But it should have learned from the Bernard Kerik      nomination that they don't always make for good national      leadership. Kerik withdrew his nomination as head of Homeland      Security after questions arose about the immigration status      of a housekeeper and nanny he employed.       Gonzales' ethnicity, his accomplishments and his role as      adviser to the president for nine years are admirable but      irrelevant. His background makes for great political theater      but does not qualify him to be attorney general. And one      would hope that Hispanics would not rush to blindly support a      man who is clearly wrong for the job.       Alberto Gonzales has a history of bending the law to fit      policy and the wishes of the president. Eagerness to please      makes him a great adviser and confidant.       But as head of the Justice Department, the attorney general      should answer only to the law.                                  ____          [From the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Jan. 8, 2005]                   Editorial: Don't Confirm Gonzales       Thursday's Senate confirmation hearing provided Alberto R.      Gonzales with an opportunity to confront some of the nagging      questions that have been raised about his nomination to be      attorney general. So important is the office to which      Gonzales aspires that the Senate and the American people      needed to hear convincing answers to these questions. They      deserved assurances that Gonzales had the judgment, the      temperament and the integrity necessary for this cabinet      position.       Far from supplying this reassurance, Gonzales proved to be      consistently weak and evasive. So intellectually sterile was      his testimony that it showed Gonzales to be unfit for the      important office he seeks, and for this reason the Senate      should reject his nomination.       Realistically, of course, this will almost certainly not      happen; Democrats on the Judiciary Committee signaled      Thursday that, despite reservations about Gonzales, they will      support the nomination. Indeed, they make a respectable case,      which is that presidents are entitled to broad leeway in the      selection of their cabinet members. But there are limits to      the discretion to which presidents are entitled; otherwise,      the entire confirmation process becomes meaningless.       Unfortunately, Gonzales's views put him beyond even these      broad limits. As White House counsel, he was largely      responsible for, or at least acquiesced in, a repudiation of      some of this country's most precious ideals, such as the      notion that human beings should not be tortured.       In January 2002, Gonzales told President Bush that the war      on terror ``renders obsolete'' some of the strict limitations      imposed by the Geneva Conventions as applied to al-Qaida and,      in some cases, Taliban fighters. Arguably, one can make that      legal case but elsewhere in that letter, and more disturbing,      was the tone Gonzales adopted when he dismissed as merely      ``quaint'' some of the convention's human rights provisions.      In August 2002, Gonzales received a Justice Department      memorandum that a president could suspend Geneva Convention      protections at will and that some forms of torture ``may be      justified.''       On Thursday, Gonzales disavowed the use of torture. A week      earlier, the Justice Department had repudiated its August      2002 memo. But why did this reversal take this long? In light      of Gonzales's four-year record, his disavowal of terrorism      seemed merely rhetorical and tactical. Efforts to elicit      Gonzales's views were met with vagueness and equivocation.      Gonzales said he couldn't remember key details of his      involvement with the August 2002 memo. He wasn't even sure      whether Americans could legally engage in torture under any      circumstances.       Ordinarily, even these gross deficiencies might be      tolerable. But these are not ordinary times. The threat to      civil liberties posed by the fight on terror requires an      attorney general with a demonstrated record of sound      judgment, independent temperament and unquestioned integrity.       Gonzales's rags-to-riches personal story is an inspiration      to all Americans. But his story is not the issue. He has not      demonstrated the judgment and integrity to be the nation's      chief law enforcement officer at this pivotal time in our      history.                                  ____        [From the Star Tribune (Minneapolis, MN), Jan. 8, 2005]                 Gonzales; Democrats Should Reject Him       Democrats in the U.S. Senate have many well-founded reasons      to oppose with all their might President Bush's nomination of      Alberto Gonzales to be attorney general. But one reason      stands out above all others, and Democrats should pound it      home: Gonzales believes the president of the United States      has the power, as commander in chief, to permit the use of      torture by American forces by immunizing from prosecution      anyone who does it.       This reasoning was put forward in an August 2002 memo,      called the Bybee memo, from the Department of Justice to the      White House. Gonzales testified before the Senate Judiciary      Committee Thursday that he, as the president's lawyer, simply      passed the memo along. It wasn't his job, he said, to warn      the president of the memo's implications or to disagree with      it. Gonzales has a peculiar notion of his role as the      president's attorney; others quite rightly characterize his      behavior as a dereliction of duty. In fact, there's good      reason to believe Gonzales was an active participant in the      memo's construction.       But whatever his role, Gonzales clearly agreed with the      memo, and does to this day.       Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., the ranking Democrat on the      committee, tried every way he could to get Gonzales to answer      ``yes'' or ``no'' to a simple question: ``Now, as attorney      general, would you believe the president has the authority to      exercise a commander-in-chief override and immunize acts of      torture?'' Gonzales tried all kinds of tacks to avoid      answering: The question is hypothetical because Bush opposes      the use of torture, etc. Leahy persisted, and finally      Gonzales said, ``Senator, I do believe there may come an      occasion when the Congress might pass a statute that the      president may view as unconstitutional,'' and therefore he      can ignore it. The answer was disingenuous because the issue      isn't laws Congress might pass, but established U.S. and      international laws that prohibit the use of torture. Thus,      the only reasonable way to interpret Gonzales' answer in the      context it was asked is that, indeed, the president has the      power to permit torture by immunizing those who do it.       The White House has done its darnedest to frustrate      Judiciary Committee inquiries into Gonzales' role in the      torture scandal. Leahy Thursday held aloft a hefty file of      unanswered questions and letters he had sent to the White      House seeking information on Gonzales' views about torture      and his role in framing policies that led to the Abu Ghraib      scandal and the abuse of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. Despite      that, Leahy and his colleagues got Gonzales on the record      saying that he does believe the president has the power to      override U.S. laws.       That's all the Democrats need to oppose Gonzales'      confirmation en masse, and they should. Torture is always out      of bounds, no matter the circumstance; it is immoral,      ineffective and puts captured American forces at risk.      Previous congresses and presidents have enacted laws and      ratified international treaties to that effect.       The United States does not need an attorney general who      believes that this president has the right to override those      laws and treaties at his whim. Even if Gonzales is eventually      confirmed, as it appears he will be, Senate Democrats must be      on the record upholding the powerful principle that the      United States unequivocally rejects torture.                                       ____         [From the Slate (South Carolina), Sat. Jan. 15, 2005]            Torture Taint Should Disqualify Nominee Gonzales       After last week's confirmation hearing for Alberto      Gonzales, even senators who disliked the nomination said he      would be confirmed, for no other reason than he is the one      President Bush asked for. ``There's a lower standard,      frankly, for attorney general than for judge, because you      give the president who he wants,'' said Sen. Charles Schumer,      D-N.Y.       There's a sad symmetry in this. Mr. Gonzales's work as      legal counsel to the president on the issue of torture has      been rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court and disowned by the      White House--only after it backfired politically and legally.      His principal qualification is unambiguous loyalty to the      president. In short, his selection reflects what sadly seems      to be the overriding attribute this president wants in his      subordinates. That might be good enough for the president,      but it does not make him the right choice to be the nation's      top lawyer; in fact, in this case it should mean just the      opposite.       Mr. Gonzales has helped this administration pursue the      human equivalent of the hiddenball trick. Guantanamo Bay,      Cuba, was chosen as the U.S. detention facility for ``enemy      combatants'' under the assumption that it could be defined as      a legal no-man's-land, a place where the laws of the United      States do not apply. It would be years before the U.S.      Supreme Court ruled, as Sen. Lindsey Graham put it, that      ``Gitmo is not Mars.'' The administration took other actions,      including denying legal counsel to detainees, that it thought      were unlikely to withstand court scrutiny, so it endeavored      instead to stall definitive rulings as long as it could.       Few of these actions can rise to the appropriately high      standard delineated by Sen. Graham during the confirmation      hearing: ``I do believe we have lost our way, and my      challenge to you as a leader of this nation is to help us      find our way without giving up our obligation and right to      fight our enemy.''       But will Mr. Gonzales lead the Justice Department to meet      that standard?       His answers during the confirmation hearing showed less of      the firm moral base the position requires, and more of a      tendency to look at things in a lawyerly way, in the      Clintonian sense of the term. He said his new zeal to keep to      the legal straight-and-narrow on torture stems from a new      understanding that he would represent not just the president      anymore, but the whole United States. But shouldn't advising      the president have been enough of a guide for Mr. Gonzales to      strive to uphold bedrock American principles? He treats the      now-discredited legal opinions as if they have been      vaporized. But they had, and are still having, real-world      effects, some of them disastrous to the U.S. cause (such as      Abu Ghraib). And which represents the real Alberto Gonzales:      the man who appeared before the Senate or the one who advised      President Bush?       This administration, and far more importantly this nation,      must make a clean break from the policies identified with Mr.      Gonzales. Making him attorney general of the United States      accomplishes the opposite.       This nomination tells the world that no minds have been      changed in this country about the use of torture; it says      America sees no conflict between detaining suspects without      legal counsel and trying to hold our constitutional democracy      aloft as an example to the world.       Sen. Graham seems to understand that Alberto Gonzales is      not the best choice. Both he and Sen. Jim DeMint have a duty,      if they truly see the problems with this nomination, to vote      against it, as loyal Republicans and as Americans. Only when      they and others do so might this president finally see the      need for change in key elements of his war strategy, and      start making top personnel decisions based on that new      understanding. This must happen, for the sake of the nation.                                  ____                 [From the Boston Globe, Jan. 18, 2005]                       Unfit as Attorney General       Two memos on the US treatment of detainees from Afghanistan      and Iraq stand in the way of Alberto Gonzales becoming the      next attorney general of the United States. At his      confirmation hearing earlier this month, he neither disavowed      the memos nor showed an understanding of how their denial of      international protections to detainess could lead to the many      cases of prisoner abuse reported by both the FBI and the      International Red Cross. The Senate should reject his      nomination.       In his testimony, Gonzales made frequent reference to the      much-photographed instances of prisoner humiliation and abuse      at Abu Ghraib, as though the naked-body pyramid and other      abuses that Specialist Charles Graner was justifiably      convicted of Friday were the worst of what has occurred. But      the FBI and Red Cross reports as well as the military's own      investigations of killings of prisoners make clear that some      interrogators and guards crossed the line into torture or      homicide. It is disingenuous of Gonzales not to acknowledge      the link between permissive torture policies from Washington      and acts of abuse that occurred not just at Abu Ghraib but in      Afghanistan and Guantanamo as well.       In 2002 as White House counsel, Gonzales wrote a memo in      which he called provisions of the Geneva Conventions      regarding prisoners of war ``obsolete'' and ``quaint'' and      said the United States could operate as though the      conventions did not apply to the Afghan war. Indeed, some of      the fighters captured during the 2001 war against the Taliban      and Al Qaeda in Afghanistan might not have deserved the      status of POWs.       But the Geneva Conventions--and American law--make clear      that any battlefield detainee has that status until a      ``competent tribunal'' puts him in the less protected      category of ``enemy combatant.'' As US Judge James Robertson      noted in a ruling last November, the Geneva Conventions do      not give any individual, including the president, the      authority to say who deserves POW status. The White House      counsel certainly lacks that authority.       The second memo that has damaged the US reputation      worldwide was written in 2002 by a Justice Department      official as a guide to interrogation techniques. The memo,      which Gonzales discussed with administration officials, said      a president has the power to authorize torture despite a 1994      US law banning it. At the confirmation hearing, Gonzales      declined chances to repudiate that view.       The Sept. 11, 2001, attacks thrust the United States into a      new kind of conflict in which useful intelligence from      detainees is crucial. But Gonzales has been at the center of      administration policy-making that set aside tried and true US      and international rules governing the collection of this      information. His blindness to the consequences of those      policies makes him a poor choice for chief law enforcement      officer of the nation.                                  ____      [From the Republican (Western Massachusetts), Jan. 23, 2005]               Gonzales Nomination Leaves Many Questions       When Alberto Gonzales appeared before the Senate Judiciary      Committee earlier this month, some of his answers to      questions about the treatment of prisoners in Iraq,      Afghanistan and elsewhere left some Democratic committee      members wanting more. So they asked a series of follow-up      questions to be answered in writing. And when Gonzales      provided his answers, those same senators still found      themselves wanting more.       So they decided to delay--for at least one week--a      committee vote on his nomination to succeed John Ashcroft as      attorney general. It was the right move.       There are real questions about Gonzales's fitness to serve      as attorney general. His nomination should not move forward      until those questions are answered.       He has written that certain provisions of the Geneva      Conventions--which provide for the treatment of enemy      prisoners--are ``quaint'' or ``obsolete.'' Gonzales approved      a memorandum saying that the president ``wasn't bound by laws      prohibiting torture and that government agents who might      torture prisoners at his direction couldn't be prosecuted by      the Justice Department.''       Gonzales has said he believes that the president of the      United States has the authority to order the detention of      enemy combatants indefinitely during wartime. He has      repeatedly backed the provisions in the USA Patriot Act that      infringe most broadly on civil liberties and the fundamental      right of the citizens to be left alone.       When he was attorney general of Texas--while George W. Bush      was governor--he wrote a memo directly contradicting a      federal law that grants foreign nationals access to American      courts when they are accused of a crime.       And the list goes on and on.       The president has nominated Alberto Gonzales to be the      chief law enforcement officer in the United States. The      attorney general sits at the very top of the U.S. Department      of Justice. The person in that position must possess a      scrupulousness that is beyond question.       Gonzales has not, to date, demonstrated that he has the      qualities that an individual needs to be elevated to one of      the most significant positions in this nation.                                  ____                [From the New York Times, Jan. 26, 2005]                       The Wrong Attorney General       Alberto Gonzales's nomination as attorney general goes      before the Senate at a time when the Republican majority is      eager to provide newly elected President Bush with the      cabinet of his choice, and the Democrats are leery of      exposing their weakened status by taking fruitless stands      against the inevitable. None of that is an excuse for giving      Mr. Gonzales a pass. The attorney general does not merely      head up the Justice Department. He is responsible for      ensuring that America is a nation in which justice prevails.      Mr. Gonzales's record makes him unqualified to take on this      role or to represent the American justice system to the rest      of the world. The Senate should reject his nomination.       The biggest strike against Mr. Gonzales is the now      repudiated memo that gave a disturbingly narrow definition of      torture, limiting it to physical abuse that produced pain of      the kind associated with organ failure or death. Mr.      Gonzales's attempts to distance himself from the memo have      been unconvincing, especially since it turns out he was the      one who requested that it be written. Earlier the same year,      Mr. Gonzales himself sent President Bush a letter telling him      that the war on terror made the Geneva Conventions' strict      limitations on the questioning of enemy prisoners      ``obsolete.''       These actions created the legal climate that made possible      the horrific mistreatment of Iraqi prisoners being held in      Abu     Ghraib prison. The Bush administration often talks about its      desire to mend fences with the rest of the world,      particularly the Muslim world. Making Mr. Gonzales the      nation's chief law enforcement officer would set this effort      back substantially.       Other parts of Mr. Gonzales's record are also troubling. As      counsel to George Bush when he was governor of Texas, Mr.      Gonzales did a shockingly poor job of laying out the legal      issues raised by the clemency petitions from prisoners on      death row. And questions have been raised about Mr.      Gonzales's account of how he got his boss out of jury duty in      1996, which allowed Mr. Bush to avoid stating publicly that      he had been convicted of drunken driving.       Senate Democrats, who are trying to define their role after      the setbacks of the 2004 election, should stand on principle      and hold out for a more suitable attorney general.      Republicans also have reason to oppose this nomination. At      the confirmation hearings, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican      of South Carolina, warned that the administration's flawed      legal policies and mistreatment of detainees had hurt the      country's standing and ``dramatically undermined'' the war on      terror. Given the stakes in that war, senators of both      parties should want an attorney general who does not come      with this nominee's substantial shortcomings.                                  ____               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 26, 2005]                           A Degrading Policy       Alberto R. Gonzales was vague, unresponsive and misleading      in his testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee about the      Bush administration's detention of foreign prisoners. In his      written answers to questions from the committee, prepared in      anticipation of today's vote on his nomination as attorney      general, Mr. Gonzales was clearer--disturbingly so, as it      turns out. According to President Bush's closest legal      adviser, this administration continues to assert its right to      indefinitely hold foreigners in secret locations without any      legal process; to deny them access to the International Red      Cross; to transport them to countries where torture is      practiced; and to subject them to treatment that is ``cruel,      inhumane or degrading,'' even though such abuse is banned by      an international treaty that the United States has ratified.      In effect, Mr. Gonzales has confirmed that the Bush      administration is violating human rights as a matter of      policy.       Mr. Gonzales stated at his hearing that he and Mr. Bush      oppose ``torture and abuse.'' But his written testimony to      the committee makes clear that ``abuse'' is, in fact,      permissible--provided that it is practiced by the Central      Intelligence Agency on foreigners held outside the United      States. The Convention Against Torture, which the United      States ratified in 1994, prohibits not only torture but      ``cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment.'' The Senate      defined such treatment as abuse that would violate the Fifth,      Eighth or 14th amendments to the Constitution--a standard      that the Bush administration formally accepted in 2003.       But Mr. Gonzales revealed that during his tenure as White      House counsel, the administration twisted this      straightforward standard to make it possible for the CIA to      subject detainees to such practices as sensory deprivation,      mock execution and simulated drowning. The constitutional      amendments, he told the committee, technically do not apply      to foreigners held abroad; therefore, in the administration's      view the torture treaty does not bind intelligence      interrogators operating on foreign soil. ``The Department of      Justice has concluded,'' he wrote, that ``there is no legal      prohibition under the Convention Against Torture on cruel,      inhuman or degrading treatment with respect to aliens      overseas.''       According to most legal experts, this is a gross distortion      of the law. The Senate cited the constitutional amendments in      ratifying the treaty precisely to set a clear standard that      could be applied to foreigners. Nevertheless, Mr. Gonzales      uses this false loophole to justify practices that contravene      fundamental American standards. He was asked if there were      any legal prohibition against U.S. personnel using simulated      drowning and mock executions as well as sleep deprivation,      dogs to inspire fear, hooding, forced nudity, the forced      injection of mood-altering drugs and the threat of sending a      detainee to another country for torture, among other abuses.      He answered: ``Some might. . . be permissible in certain      circumstances. ``       This is not a theoretical matter. The CIA today is holding      an undetermined number of prisoners, believed to be in the      dozens, in secret facilities in foreign countries. It has      provided no account of them or their treatment to any outside      body, and it has allowed no visits by the Red Cross.      According to numerous media reports, it has subjected the      prisoners to many of the abuses Mr. Gonzales said ``might be      permissible.'' It has practiced such mistreatment in Iraq,      even though detainees there are covered by the Geneva      Conventions; according to official investigations by the      Pentagon, CIA treatment of prisoners there and in Afghanistan      contributed to the adoption of illegal methods by military      interrogators.       In an attempt to close the loophole, Sen. Richard J. Durbin      (D-Ill.), Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Sen. Joseph I.      Lieberman (D-Conn.) sought to attach an amendment to the      intelligence reform legislation last fall specifying that      ``no prisoner shall be subject to torture or cruel, inhumane      or degrading treatment or punishment that is prohibited by      the Constitution, laws or treaties of the United States.''      The Senate adopted the provision unanimously. Later, however,      it was stripped from the bill at the request of the White      House. In his written testimony, Mr. Gonzales affirmed that      the provision would have ``provided legal protections to      foreign prisoners to which they are not now entitled.''      Senators who supported the amendment consequently face a      critical question: If they vote to confirm Mr. Gonzales as      the government's chief legal authority, will they not be      endorsing the systematic use of ``cruel, inhumane and      degrading'' practices by the United States?
