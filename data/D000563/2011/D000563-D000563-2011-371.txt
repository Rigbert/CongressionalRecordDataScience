President, let me say a word about the leadership in the Senate. I have the good fortune of working with Senator Harry Reid, our majority leader. In my role as whip, or assistant leader, I have been close at hand when most of the major decisions have been made. I have come to take the measure of this man from Searchlight, NV, and I have found him to be an extraordinary leader.  At first blush, most people would not choose him for his ringing oratory or a commanding presence. But I will tell you that he has created a leadership style in the Senate that is exceptional. I have watched him during the span of the last 2\1/2\ years, particularly as he has faced a myriad of challenges: a new President of his own party; passing the stimulus bill, when we didn't have 60 votes on the Democratic side and had to rely on a cross-over vote from three Republican Senators; dealing with the TARP crisis; the recession and what needed to be done to save financial institutions from dissolution; his efforts, as well, on the Health Care Reform Act, which might have been the mightiest political battle I have ever been engaged in; the Financial Reform Act--the list goes on and on.
