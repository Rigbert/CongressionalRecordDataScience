 President, I rise to offer an amendment to the Department of Defense Authorization bill regarding Russian nonproliferation and U.S.-Russian cooperation on commercial space launch service.  This amendment is very simple: It states that a sustained Russian commitment to cooperation with the United States in preventing the proliferation of ballistic missile technology to Iran can provide the basis for an increase in the current quota limit on commercial space launches. Lifting the launch quota is an important incentive for Russia to cooperate with the U.S. on this issue.  This amendment also demands continued Russian cooperation on non-proliferation, and calls on the UnitedStates to take every appropriate measure to encourage the Russian government to seek out and prevent the illegal transfer of fissile material or missile equipment or any other technology necessary for the acquisition or development of nuclear weapons or ballistic missiles.  I offer this amendment because I believe that there may be no greater long term threat to peace and stability in the Middle East than an Iran actively seeking ballistic missile and nuclear weapons.  Preventing the transfer of illegal nuclear and missile technology from Russia to Iran must be at the top of the U.S. policy agenda.  There have been numerous reports over the past several years of Russian missile technology reaching Iran, sometimes with a semi-official wink from government authorities in Moscow, sometimes by rogue operators.  Either way, the Russian Government must put a stop to these transfers.  As much as we want good relations with Russia, cooperation in this area is crucial. In some ways, I believe it is a litmus test of what sort of player Russia wants to be in the post-cold war international system.  There is ample reason for concern. According to a Congressional Research Service report:  Despite pledges by Soviet leaders in 1990 and by various Russian leaders since then to ban missile exports, President Yeltsin's 1994 agreement to refrain from new arms sales to Iran, and Russia's entry into the Missile Technology Control Regime in October 1995, there are recurring reports that Russian companies are selling missile technology to Iran and other countries.  On February 6, 1997, Vice President Gore issued a diplomatic warning to then-Premier Chernomyrdin regarding Russian transfers to Iran of parts and technology associated with SS-4 medium-range ballistic missiles. Over the next several months, press reports indicated that Russian enterprises provided Iran specialty steels and alloys, tungsten coated graphite, wind tunnel facilities, gyroscopes and other guidance technology, rocket engine and fuel technology, laser equipment, machine tools, and maintenance manuals.  Russian assistance has apparently helped Iran overcome a number of obstacles and advance its missile development program faster than expected. The Rumsfeld Commission said, ``The ballistic missile infrastructure in Iran is now more sophisticated than that of North Korea and has benefitted from broad, essential assistance from Russia. * * *''  In February 1998, the Washington Times reported that Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB, a successor to the KGB) was still working with Iran's intelligence service to pass technology through a joint research center, Persepolis, with facilities in St. Petersburg and Tehran.  In March 1998, the State Department listed (but did not make public) 20 Russian entities suspected of transferring missile technology to Iran.  Lastly, there are still unanswered questions about Russian-Iranian nuclear cooperation raised by the January, 1995 contract signed by the Russian nuclear agency MINATOM to finish one unit of the Bushehr nuclear power project. Although the Bushehr plant itself is not considered a source of weapons material, the project is viewed as a proliferation risk because it entails massive involvement of Iranian personnel in nuclear technology, and extensive training and technological support from Russian nuclear experts.  Last year, the American Jewish Committee released a report, ``The Russian Connection: Russia, Iran, and the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction'' which provides an excellent overview of Russia's record in this area, as well as U.S.-Russian cooperation.  In addition to the troubling questions raised by some of Russia's past actions, however, there are also indications that the Russian government is making efforts to control the proliferation of missile and nuclear technology to Iran.  Although initially Moscow denied that its missiles or missile technology had been transferred to Iran, in September 1997, Russian officials reportedly stated that such transfers were being made without the consent of the government.  In January 1998, in response to concerns raised by numerous U.S. officials, Yuri Koptev, head of the Russian space agency, said of 13 cases raised by the U.S. Government, 11 had no connection to technology transfers related to weapons of mass destruction (nuclear, biological, or chemical) that were banned under a 1996 agreement.  On July 15, 1998, Russian authorities announced that nine Russian entities were being investigated for suspected violation of laws governing export of dual-use technologies. The nine include the Inor NPO, Polyus Research Institute, and Baltic State Technical University cited earlier, plus the Grafit Research Institute, Tikhomirov Institute, the MOSO Company, the Komintern plant (Novosibirsk), Europalace 2000, and Glavcosmos.  Also last year, Russia announced the cancellation of a 1997 contract between a Russian entity, NPO Trud, and Iran in which rocket engine components were to have been shipped under the guise of gas pipeline compressors.  According to an April 15 letter I received from the Vice President, which I would like to submit for the Record, U.S. Special Ambassador Gallucci and Mr. Koptev have agreed to a work plan that addresses many of the concerns the U.S. has about missile proliferation, including the establishment of internal compliance offices at several of the entities of concern.  U.S. experts have also developed a work plan with the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy on measures to sever the links between NIKIET, a leading Russian nuclear institute, and Iran, according to the Vice President.  I believe that we should try to build on Russia's record of cooperation, and that the best and most effective way to work with Russia on this issue is to offer them a carrot--lifting the launch quota--as an inducement to continued cooperation on this vital matter.  The current quota on commercial space launches is set at sixteen. Pending Russian cooperation, I believe that this quota can be raised to 20 and, if Russia continues to cooperate, incrementally raised again in the coming years. Each launch provides Russia with approximately $100 million in hard currency--a good incentive to cooperate.  This amendment also states, however, that the United States must continue to demand full and complete cooperation from Russia on this issue, and that the United States should take every appropriate measure to assure that the government of Russia continues to cooperate on this issue.  Russia must understand that just as we are willing to offer inducements to cooperate, there will also be a price to be paid for non-cooperation on this critical issue.  This amendment, I believe, is rather simple and straightforward in its make-up. But it is also essential and far reaching in its impact. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.  I ask unanimous consent the letter I received dated April 15, 1999, from the Vice President be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                           The Vice President,                                   Washington, DC, April 15, 1999.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: Thank you for your recent letter      requesting that I raise the issue of non-proliferation with      Russian Prime Minister Primakov during his planned visit to      Washington. Cutting off the flow of missile and nuclear      technologies from Russian entities to Iran is one of the      Administration's most important national security objectives.      As you know, I have engaged my Russian counterparts on this      issue for the past several years, most recently in January      when I saw Prime Minister Primakov in Davos.       It was my intention to raise this issue again with the      Prime Minister last month, but our planned meeting was      postponed. I can report, however, that over the past several      weeks United States and Russian experts developed concrete      plans to curtail cooperation by Russian entities with Iran's      nuclear and missile programs. Because of intelligence and      security consideration, I will outline only the core elements      of the work plans in this letter. My staff can arrange a      classified briefing if that would be helpful.       U.S. Special Ambassador Gallucci and Yuri Koptev, head of      the Russian Space Agency, agreed to a work plan that      addresses some of our most pressing concerns about missile      proliferation. As a central element of this plan--and as a      direct result of my earlier intercession with Mr. Primakov--     Mr. Koptev     agreed to cancel a contract with Iran's missile program and      to establish on a priority basis internal compliance offices      at several entities of concern. These internal compliance      offices would be staffed by individuals specially trained in      export control procedures and techniques, and would have      access to the records they need to do their jobs. The United      States Government has offered technical assistance to help      these entities set up the necessary export control      procedures. The Russian government has committed to take      effective measures to prohibit Iranian missile specialists      from operating in Russia and to facilitate the early adoption      of the Russian export control law.       The missile work plan represents some forward movement and      in my judgment reflects Russia's intense desire to see the      launch quota increased and sanctions lifted. It is not,      however, a complete accounting for past problems. It may      create a credible foundation to inhibit future cooperation. I      have underscored that we will be watching Russian      implementation of the agreement closely. I have also made      clear that a solid track record is needed for us to consider      an increase in the launch quota.       United States experts have also developed a work plan with      the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy on measures to sever      the links between NIKIET, a leading Russian nuclear      institute, and Iran. Again, the key principle underlying this      work plan is performance, which we are in a position to judge      through our intelligence information. If we are satisfied      that Russia's commitments are being implemented, we can begin      to incrementally lift our sanctions against NIKIET, beginning      with the nuclear reactor safety projects that have been      suspended.       The work plans I have described could represent a path      forward if the Russian government acts effectively and      quickly. I am by no means ready to suggest that we have      resolved either the missile or the nuclear proliferation      problem. However, we now have a clear delineation of steps in      that direction which we are in a position to verify.      Positive, concrete actions by Russia will be the basis for      any decisions we take to increase commercial and other forms      of cooperation with Russian space and nuclear entities.       I will continue to raise this issue in discussions with my      Russian counterparts until I am satisfied that all our      concerns have been addressed.           Sincerely,                                                          Al Gore.                           amendment no. 507       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:       Of the funds in section 301a(5), $23,000,000 shall be made      available to the American Red Cross to fund the Armed Forces      Emergency Services.                                  ____                           amendment no. 508 (Purpose: To require the Department of Defense and the Department of    Veterans Affairs to carry out joint telemedicine and telepharmacy                         demonstration projects)       On page 272, between lines 8 and 9, insert the following:     SEC. 717.
