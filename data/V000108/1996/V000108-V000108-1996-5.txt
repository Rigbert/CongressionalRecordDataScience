Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me.  I want to draw particular attention to one provision of the bill that I strongly support, and that is the inclusion of $24 million for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to expand their ongoing investigation of the recent wave of church burnings occurring across the United States. Since January of last year, 36 African-American churches have been burned to the ground by arsons. These burnings have destroyed important sources of American history and left small rural communities gripped by an epidemic of terror and fear unknown since the days when marauding Klansmen destroyed lives and property at will.  I am saddened to witness a climate in which many of America's most sacred institutions can be subjected to such abuse. Currently an estimated 1,000 Federal and State investigators are involved in the ongoing investigations, and ATF alone is spending more than $1 million a month for these investigations.  I applaud Chairman Lightfoot for the leadership he has shown in his decision to include $24 million for ATF to expend in their investigations of these arsons. I also applaud his decision to create a joint Treasury-Justice Department task force whose investigation will be national in scope.  This action by the chairman compliments legislation recently signed into law by the President, the Church Arson Prevention Act.  These new laws make it easier for Federal authorities to investigate crimes against places of worship and broadens jurisdictional authority in church arson cases. I applaud the new law, but I feel the action taken by the committee is of immediate importance. Clearly funds for additional personnel and resources will ultimately prove to be the difference between success and failure in the investigations.  This Congress must send a strong message that hate and intolerance will no longer be tolerated in any sector of our society.  Mr. Chairman, I would also be remiss if I did not commend the chairman of the committee, the gentleman from Iowa [Mr. Lightfoot], for his outstanding service to his country and to this institution. The chairman and I are classmates, and he is a gentleman in every sense of the word. And I think Charles Dickens, in ``A Christmas Carol,'' said it best, he is as a good a friend, as good a master and as good a man as this institution has ever known.  His dedication to his family has never been in doubt, and his dedication to his country has never been questioned.  Every night I tell my two sons to have happy dreams and a good life. As you continue your life and career, I hope that you may live your dream. As you continue your very good life, good luck, my friend.                              {time}  1800
