 Rather than be one of many offices subsumed in a larger bureau or office, the Violence Against Women Officer will now be its own, separate and distinct entity within the Department of Justice. This provision means that the Office will be removed from its current location in the Office of Justice Programs, and become its own free-standing entity. This is a non-negotiable and unambiguous provision of the act. What this means is that the leadership and the agenda of the Office cannot be pushed to the sidelines or marginalized. You and I both know that ending violence against women is too important of an issue to be relegated to a back office.
