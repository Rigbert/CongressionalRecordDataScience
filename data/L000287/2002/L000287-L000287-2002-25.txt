Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 586. This tax cut bill is not the way to go. It does not provide real relief for all Americans. It is just plain, downright irresponsible.  I ask my Republican colleagues to reconsider their priorities.  Mr. Speaker, if we make the Republican tax cut permanent, we risk stealing, taking, really raiding the Social Security trust fund by more than $4 trillion. We risk gambling the future of the Medicare trust fund. We jeopardize funding for education and a prescription drug benefit for our seniors.  This tax cut bill breaks the promise that we made to the American people to use their tax dollars wisely. A huge windfall for the wealthy, pocket change for working Americans. We should be taking care of the basic needs of all of our people, not rushing to pass a tax cut bill that puts us deeper and deeper in debt.  Today we have a choice, a choice between a permanent tax cut bill that benefits a few, or Social Security and Medicare security that benefit all Americans. I urge my colleagues to make the right choice, the moral choice, the good choice. Vote against this bill.
