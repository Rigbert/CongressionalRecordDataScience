 President, dynamic scoring is nothing more than an accounting gimmick that makes tax cuts appear at least partly pay for themselves. It is an attempt to make it seem like the failed policies of trickledown economics work, but we know better.  According to the CBO, the Bush tax cuts from 2001 and 2003 are responsiblefor more than 13 percent of the increase in our national debt from 2001 to 2011.  Tax cuts did not grow the economy; they just grew our debt. The fuzzy math of dynamic scoring may get to a different answer, but the reality is that tax cuts for large profitable corporations and the wealthiest Americans do not pay for themselves. They just make the rich richer.  Once again, Republicans are opting for accounting gimmicks to cover up their real intentions. Dynamic scoring will rig the scoring process in favor of legislation that benefits those who are already doing very well.  I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment.
