Since 2001, Judge Chen has been a well-respected Federal Magistrate Judge on the court to which he is now nominated to serve as a Federal District Judge. His nomination has received the strong and consistent support of his home state Senators, Senator Feinstein and Senator Boxer, since he was first nominated over 21 months ago. When he is confirmed, Judge Chen will be only the second Asian Pacific American to serve on the district court bench in the 150-year history of the Northern District of California.
