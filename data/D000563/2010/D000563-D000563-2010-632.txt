President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it recess until 9:30 a.m. on Thursday, May 27; that following the prayer and pledge, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and the Senate resume consideration of H.R. 4899, as provided for under the previous order; further, I ask that the filing deadline for second degree amendments be 11 a.m. tomorrow.
