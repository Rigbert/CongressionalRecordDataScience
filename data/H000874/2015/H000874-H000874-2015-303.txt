Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to a friend and a great Marylander, Earl Christian Hargrove Jr., who passed away on April 6 at the age of eighty-six. I've known Earl for many years, and I am certain that he will be missed by a great many people throughout the Greater Washington area.  Earl was a larger than life presence in Harwood, Maryland. His estate--Holly Springs Farm--attracts thousands of neighbors and residents from throughout the region each Christmas with a captivating display of holiday lights and decorations. A graduate of Bladensburg High School in 1946, Earl served in the U.S. Marine Corps that same year and was honorably discharged in 1948. When the Korean War broke out, however, Earl re-enlisted and served his country in uniform until 1954. Following his military service, he returned to Maryland and to the business he had launched with his father, Earl Hargrove Sr., in the late 1940s creating parade floats and specialty decorations.  Known affectionately as ``the President's prop-man,'' Earl provided event staging for every presidential inauguration since Harry Truman's in 1949. In January 2013, his company, Hargrove Inc., did so once again for the second inauguration of President Barack Obama. Earl Jr. became president of the company after his father's sudden death in 1971, and today the business is run by Earl's daughter, Carla Hargrove McGill, and son-in-law, Timothy McGill. Hargrove Inc. continues to employ talented artists and craftspeople who design and plan some of Washington's largest events and conferences, including the National Walk for Epilepsy, the annual AIPAC Policy Conference, and the White House Correspondents Dinner.  My thoughts and prayers are with his beloved wife of sixty years, Gloria Love Hargrove, his children Earl ``Chris'' Hargrove III, Kathleen Hargrove Kelly and her husband Clyde, Carla Hargrove McGill and her husband Timothy, Cynthia Diane Hargrove and her husband Michael Busada, and Carey Martin Hargrove and his wife Wendy Miller, and his seven grandchildren. May his memory continue to bring strength and comfort to them and to all of us who were fortunate to know and cherish Earl Hargrove Jr.                          ____________________
