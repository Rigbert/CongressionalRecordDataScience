 Feinstein, Mr. Daschle, Mr.         Schumer, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Crapo, Mrs. Clinton, Mrs. Carnahan,         Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Edwards, Mr. Cleland, Mr.         Ensign, Mr. Johnson, and Mr. Inouye):  S. 1409. A bill to impose sanctions against the PLO or the Palestinian Authority if the President determines that those entities have failed to substantially comply with commitments made to the State of Israel; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.                MIDDLE EAST PEACE COMPLIANCE ACT OF 2001  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am today joining with my good friend, Senator Feinstein from California, who is in the Chamber as well, in offering the Middle East Peace Compliance Act of 2001. We do that with the support also of our colleagues, Senators Daschle, Schumer, Mikulski, Crapo, Clinton, Carnahan, Boxer, Torricelli, Edwards, Cleland, Ensign, and Shelby.  We also do so with full appreciation of the dire and untenable situation in the Middle East.  Given the ongoing and relentless bloodshed in the Middle East, the time has come for finger pointing. Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) Chairman Yasser Arafat--and the terrorists he allows free reign in the West Bank and Gaza--are guilty of waging a guerrilla war against America's most important and reliable ally in that region. Scores of innocent Israeli men, women and children have been killed by bombs, bullets, knives, and stones. In acts of cowardice, Palestinian suicide bombers have caused death and destruction in discos, pizza parlors, cafes, and on the streets of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.  There appears no end to this madness. On Monday of this week, four bombs exploded in the Jerusalem neighborhood of French Hill. On Tuesday, a Palestinian suicide bomber disguised as an orthodox Jew killed himself and injured others on a Jerusalem street close to two international schools. One wonders how much more of this terror the people of Israel can--or should--endure.  Mr. Arafat and his minions are enlisting Palestinians of all ages to their misguided cause of mutually assured destruction. One Palestinian children's television show reportedly broadcast a song: ``When I wander into Jerusalem, I will become a suicide bomber.'' Mr. President, Israel is well aware of the people in Mr. Arafat's Neighborhood, and they are not ones they, or anypeaceful loving people, would choose to associate with.  The legislation we are introducing will make clear the intentions of Mr. Arafat and the PLO. In a report to Congress, the Administration is required to determine whether or not the PLO has lived up to its 1993 commitments under the Oslo Accords to renounce violence against Israel, and what steps have been taken by the PLO and the Palestinian Authority to investigate and prosecute those responsible for killing American and Israeli citizens. Should the Administration determine that the PLO's actions run contrary to their word, the President is required to immediately suspend all assistance to the West Bank and Gaza, except humanitarian aid. He is also required to initiate additional sanctions against the PLO, which may include denying visas to senior officials and downgrading their representative office in the United States.  I intend to offer this legislation, along with Senator Feinstein, as an amendment to the Foreign Operations Appropriations bill, which may be considered by the full Senate in the near future.  While I will have much more to say on the situation in the Middle East at a later date, let me close by asking a question of my colleagues: If the daily terrorists attacks taking place against Israelis were occurring on American soil against U.S. citizens, what would our response be? A democracy in a region of dictatorships and kingdoms, Israel has the right and responsibility to protect and defend its citizens against terrorism. The United States should be clear in its support of Israel exercising this right, in whatever manner the people of Israel, through their elected leaders, deem appropriate. To date, Israel has shown remarkable restraint.  Mr. McCONNELL. With great thanks to my colleague from California in collaborating with me on this effort, and looking forward to further efforts on behalf of this proposal, I now yield the floor.
