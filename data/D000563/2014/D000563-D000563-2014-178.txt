CRUZ. I don't have the precise cutoff date in my mind, but the point that is being raised is these children don't fall under the precise terms of DACA, but they believe they will get amnesty.  I would respond to my friend from Illinois, does my friend from Illinois believe these children who are coming today should get amnesty, yes or no?
