 President, will the last aerospace worker leaving America turn out the lights? I ask that question to sound an alarm for every American who cares about our economy and our security.  We are about to surrender our global aerospace leadership because we are sitting on our hands while Europe is doing everything it can to dismantle our aerospace industry.  Today, I am sounding the alarm. Unless we wake up to this threat, we are going to lose an industry that Americans created and that has brought innovation to every corner of our economy.  We Americans led the first century of flight, but we might not even have a role in the second century if we keep sleepwalking down this dangerous road.  I am here on the Senate floor tonight to say: Wake up. Wake up to this threat before we lose another American industry. Wake up to this threat before we lose more high-wage, high-skill American jobs. Wake up to this threat before it is too late.  Too many Americans, especially in our Government, are not aware of what Europe is doing to kill off our aerospace industry. I want to expose the unlimited assault that Europe and Airbus are leveling at America's aerospace workers.  As my colleagues know, I have been troubled by Europe's market-distorting actions in commercial aerospace for many years. I have raised my concern with Senators, with foreign leaders, and with administrations of both parties.  Tonight, I am detailing my concerns before the full Senate because EADS and Airbus have launched a deceptive PR and lobbying campaign to convince the U.S. Government that it is essentially an American company. The Airbus campaign of half-truths is on full display as the company works overtime in Washington, DC, to recreate a competition they already lost to build the next generation refueling tanker for the Air Force.  I have come to the Senate floor tonight to set the record straight and to show how Europe's broader plan to dominate aerospace threatens our future.  Tonight, I am going to focus on five issues.  First, I want to explain why this is so important for our country.  Secondly, I want to explain how the European view of aerospace as a social program to create jobs is helping Europe beat out our more traditional business perspective.  Third, I want to expose, in detail, the underhanded things that Airbus is doing to dismantle our aerospace industry, from providing subsidies for launch aid, research, facilities and suppliers, to selling planes below cost, guaranteeing the future value of aircraft, tying sales to landing rights, and linking plane sales to other trade issues.  Fourth, I want to expose the deceptive lobbying and PR campaign Airbus is using to reopen a competition it lost and the dangers that poses for American security. Finally, I want to talk about the steps we must take to retain our leadership of this critical industry.  Let me explain the title of my speech, ``Will the Last Aerospace Worker Leaving America Turn Out theLights?'' I have the great honor of representing the State of Washington which is one of America's great aerospace centers. We are very proud of our long history and our leadership. On July 15, 1916, Bill Boeing started his airplane company in Seattle, WA. Since that day, Boeing and Washington State have shared the ups and downs of the commercial aerospace industry. We have experienced extended periods of nearly full employment, and we have endured marked downturns that left tens of thousands unemployed.  In the early 1970s, there was a particularly bad downturn. It seemed as if everyone was leaving Seattle. So two Seattle businessmen decided to post a billboard to put a lighthearted spin on all the layoffs. Here is the photo that ran in the Seattle Times in 1971. It shows a billboard with a light bulb and a string coming out of it. It says, ``Will the last person leaving Seattle turn out the lights.''  Anyone who lived through this difficult period in Washington State knows this sign. Eventually Seattle recovered, and since the 1970s we have experienced ups and downs. Today we are facing another severe downturn in the aerospace industry. But today it is not just Seattle or Washington State that is hurting. We are hemorrhaging aerospace jobs in Kansas, California, Texas, Florida, New York, Illinois, Georgia, Arizona, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Connecticut, Maryland, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and Colorado. This is a national problem, and we are not too many years away from asking, will the last aerospace worker leaving America turn off the lights? We have to take action before it is too late. Sadly, we are approaching a point of no return.  Last week the top two executives of EADS revealed their plans to take over the global aerospace industry. According to a German newspaper on April 27, 2004, CEO Rainer Hertrich said:       In ten years, we'll be number one, everywhere, worldwide.  His CEO Phillipe Camus said:       We're now ready for our final step: globalization.  Some of my colleagues may wonder why I am speaking at some length tonight about the future of our aerospace industry. It is because this industry is critical for jobs, for our economy, for our security, and for our future.  The commercial aerospace industry employs more than 2 million Americans with an average salary of $47,000. But unfortunately, we are losing these good-paying jobs at a rapid rate. In the past 15 years, we have lost 700,000 American aerospace jobs. These are scientific and technical jobs; 700,000 high-skilled, high-wage jobs are gone. Unless we wake up, we are about to lose more.  We spend a lot of time in the Senate talking about how American jobs are being shipped overseas in search of cheaper labor. Aerospace is a little different than some of the other industries we have discussed. Aerospace jobs are not low-wage, low-skill jobs that move to where the labor is cheapest. These are high-wage, high-skilled jobs we need to keep in America. But we are being aggressively challenged by Europe for those jobs.  Aerospace is also important for our overall economy. Our leadership in commercial aerospace has helped American industries, from health care to automobiles, become safer, more efficient, and more productive.  According to John Douglas, president of the Aerospace Industries Association of America, the aerospace sector ``generates economic activity equal to nearly 15 percent of the nation's gross domestic product and supports approximately 11 million American jobs.'' Mr. Douglas notes that aerospace also led the Nation in net exports with a $30 billion surplus in 2000.  The Commission on the Future of the U.S. Aerospace Industry found that in 2001:       . . . more than 600 million passengers relied on U.S.      commercial air transportation and over 150 million people      were transported on general aviation aircraft. Over 40      percent of the value of U.S. freight is transported by air.      Aerospace capabilities have enabled e-commerce to flourish      with overnight and parcel delivery and just in time      manufacturing.  Not only is this about jobs, it is also about security. It is irresponsible to let our country surrender our aerospace leadership. Once our plants shut down, once our skilled workers move to other fields, once the infrastructure is gone, you can't recreate that overnight. It took 100 years to build our aerospace leadership, and we could lose it all in the next 10 years.  Finally, commercial aerospace is important for our future. Europe is working hard to overtake our leadership of aerospace because they know it is the future, the future of the worldwide economy and the future of human exploration. Europe wants to lead the future. And if we stay on this track, they will.  This industry is worth saving because it is important for our jobs, our economy, our security, and our future. I should explain by way of background there are only two companies in the world that make large passenger airplanes. One is the Boeing Company. Its commercial air operation is headquartered in Renton, WA. The other is Airbus which is headquartered in Toulouse, France. Airbus is a division of the European Aeronautics Defense and Space Company also known as EADS. Throughout my remarks tonight, I will refer to Airbus and EADS interchangeably. So it is one European company and one American company competing for control of the commercial aerospace industry.  Next I want to talk about how the United States and Europe view commercial aerospace, because we have two very different visions. Unfortunately, their vision will allow them to overtake us unless we realize what they are doing.   Let me start at home. For us in America, commercial aerospace is seen as private business. Some companies will win; some companies will lose. We will let the marketplace decide. But for Europe, aerospace is a jobs program. The European governments will fund and support their domestic industry because creating aerospace jobs in and of itself is considered a priority. They don't care if Airbus loses money. They don't even require Airbus to pay back loans on failed products. They don't care as long as they are creating jobs for Europeans.  Europe views aerospace as a long-term investment. They are aggressively subsidizing the industry and pressuring and rewarding customers without regard to making a profit or following the business rules American workers must follow. Simply put: They are willing to pay any price to take over American leadership.  Don't take my word for it. Look at what EU leaders have said. Here is what British Prime Minister Tony Blair had to say last year:       As a result of over 500,000 pounds in launch aid, Airbus is      today in a position where it can take over the leadership of      the large aircraft market from Boeing in the United States.      That would be tremendous for British manufacturing and for      European industry.  It is not just Tony Blair. Here is what a 2001 report to the European Commission, titled ``European Aeronautics, a Vision for 2020'' states:       European aeronautics has grown and prospered with the      support of public funds, and this support must continue if we      are to achieve our objective of global leadership.  The same report goes on to say:       Total funding required from all public and private sources      over the next 20 years could go beyond 100 billion euros.  Simply put, Europe views aerospace jobs as a priority. According to the European Aerospace Industry Association, there are at least 407,000 direct jobs in Europe's aerospace sector, more than 1.2 million total jobs supported by aerospace in Europe, and there are more than 80,000 firms in the European aerospace supply chain.  Europe has maintained a $20 billion annual trade surplus in aerospace goods since 1996. Europe has an aggressive investigation for the future of aerospace. It wants to use significant public investment to create and sustain jobs, largely at the expense of U.S. competitors and workers.  Here is how the Commission on the Future of the U.S. Aerospace industry put it in 2002:       Unfortunately, it appears that European officials intend to      continue directly subsidizing EU companies. The recently      unveiled EU aerospace policy strategy calls for an increase      in subsidies to continue building market share, largely at      the expense of U.S. companies.  So Europeans are willing to do anything to subsidize Airbus and distort the market so it can beat Boeing. But here in the United States, our Government is sitting on the sidelines. We arefollowing a normal business model, and we are getting creamed by the Europeans, who are following a social welfare model, where it doesn't matter if they lose money if their products fail. As long as they are employing Europeans and taking over America's market share, they don't care. That is not competition; that is subsidized slaughter.  We have to wake up before it is too late for America's aerospace companies and workers. This is not a truly competitive market. Private U.S. companies, responsible to their shareholders, are confronting subsidized companies funded by governments who don't care if they make a profit as long as they create jobs. Understanding how the Europeans approach aerospace is the first step to helping American workers survive this onslaught. The next step is to understand how the Europeans are putting their vision into action, and that is what I want to focus on next.  Tonight, I want to explore the unprecedented means that Airbus and the Europeans are using to overtake American workers. Europe is taking over America's aerospace industry through aggressive, unfair market-distorting measures. Specifically, European governments are supporting Airbus on the development side, as Airbus creates new aircraft, and on the sales side, as Airbus pressures airlines and foreign governments to buy their aircraft.  Let's start with the development side, where we find massive market-distorting subsidies at every stage. Let's remember that Airbus was created by European governments in 1967 specifically to challenge Boeing and U.S. aerospace dominance in the manufacture of large civil aircraft. EADS gets subsidies at nearly every stage of aircraft development. They benefit from launch subsidies, research subsidies, facility subsidies, and supplier subsidies. These aggressive subsidies give Airbus virtually unlimited backing to overtake the American aerospace industry. It is like an American worker stepping into a boxing ring only to find out that, instead of one opponent, he is up against the full force and power of the entire European Union. It is not a fair fight.  Europe's abuses have been well documented by our own Government. Here is what the U.S. Trade Representative said about Airbus subsidies in its 2003 report on trade barriers:       Since the inception of Airbus in 1967, the governments of      France, Germany, Spain, and the UK have provided direct      subsidies to their respective Airbus member companies to aid      the development, production, and marketing of Airbus civil      aircraft. Airbus member governments have borne a large      portion of development costs for all Airbus aircraft modes      and provided other forms of support, debt rollovers, and      marketing assistance, including political and economic      pressure on purchasing governments.  These subsidies create an uneven playing field and allow Airbus to do things that normal private companies cannot afford to do. Airbus has grown without assuming any of the financial risk and accountability that U.S. firms have to contend with every day. Here is how a top aviation analyst put it:       Airbus cares a lot less about returning value to      shareholders. Boeing is the classic American shareholder-     driven corporation.  Europe's approach is working, too. Today, EADS is the second largest aerospace company in the world. In the last decade, Boeing has seen its market position globally erode significantly. At one time, Boeing sold 75 percent of the aircraft purchased worldwide. Airbus was in the teens. Today, Airbus claims to supply more than 50 percent of the industry.  Mr. President, I have made the case with statistics, data, trade reports, and official Government findings. Let me put it a little more simply: Airbus has a sugar daddy named Europe, who will keep forking over money until Airbus has demolished America's aerospace industry and put hundreds of thousands of skilled American workers on the unemployment lines.  We cannot sit back and continue to let that happen. But it is not just the support and development side in the form of subsidies for launching facilities, research, and suppliers. Europe's market distortions go much further on the sales side. Tonight I want to expose some of the ways that European governments are supporting Airbus sales.  Airbus uses a series of incentives and threats to steal customers away from Boeing--everything from bribes and landing rights, to discounts, value guarantees, and trade threats and rewards. Airbus has a history of graft and corruption. But don't take my word for it. Look at what the Economist magazine, on June 14, 2003, said in a special report, entitled ``Airbus's Secret Past; Aircraft and Bribery":       Up until 2000, Airbus and other French companies were      allowed to take a tax deduction for bribes.  Imagine that--bribing someone to buy your airplane and then you take a tax deduction for the bribe you paid. The Economist article details Airbus sales campaigns in India, Syria, and Canada that involved corruption and bribes. The article notes that, in 2001, the Under Secretary for Commerce for International Trade testified before Congress on U.S. competitiveness in aircraft manufacturing. The Under Secretary warned that bribery remains a threat to U.S. competitiveness. He said:       This is an industry where foreign corruption has a real      impact. Bribery by foreign companies can have important      consequences for U.S. competitiveness because of the critical      role governments play in selecting aircraft suppliers; and      because of the huge sums of money involved in aircraft      purchases, this sector has been especially vulnerable to      trade distortions involving bribery of foreign public      officials.  His remarks were directed squarely at Airbus and the European nations that aggressively back Airbus sales campaigns throughout the world.  This article also notes that, according to a 2001 European Parliament report, the U.S. National Security Agency intercepted faxes and phone calls between Airbus, Saudi Arabian Airlines, and Saudi Government officials in early 1994. The NSA found that Airbus agents were offering bribes to a Saudi official to ensure that Airbus received a $6 billion order to modernize the Saudi Arabian airlines fleet. Bribes and corruption have long been a part of their standard operating procedure for getting other countries to buy their airplanes.  Those are just a few of the many techniques they have used to beat out American workers. Let me turn to another one. Airbus purchases have long been linked to landing rights at Europe's busiest airports; a very attractive incentive to offer them to buy their airplanes, but it is a very questionable practice.  I want to share four documented examples. In 2002, an airline named easyJet placed a big Airbus order and then received favorable landing spots at Orly Airport in France. In 2002, Malaysia Airlines received landing rights at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris 3 days after buying 6 Airbus A 380s. Emirates Airlines and Qatar Airways both received extra landing rights after buying Airbus airplanes.  A source close to Emirates Airlines said:       It seems that Airbus leans on Air France, which has the      slots at Paris Charles de Gaulle and the slots are given to      the airline that has bought airbus. . . .This has been known      for years. Airbus sells one of its planes to a customer and      promises to do its best to get slots for that airline.  But landing rights are not the only trick Airbus uses to sell their planes. Airbus also aggressively discounts the purchase price of its planes, often at the last minute, and often below the cost of production.  Airbus regularly makes a late final offer to an airline after Boeing has made its best offer. Time and again, Boeing has lost a commercial sale because Airbus doesn't have the same commercial accountability. Airbus regularly sells aircraft below the price of production simply to gain market share and to take customers away from Boeing.  The 2000 easyJet deal I just mentioned a moment ago is a prime example of Airbus's willingness to discount airplanes to win sales campaigns.  Airbus does not reveal its discounts or the particulars of a given order. However, it was widely reported that Easy Jet got a 50-percent discount on its Airbus purchase. Boeing said the deal was below the cost of production. Airbus sold its planes below cost. Airbus got the order at Boeing's expense, and the Europeans got at least 10,000 direct jobs. It is a great deal for Europe; it is a horrible deal for American workers. It happened because of all the financial backing, subsidies, and special deals that Airbus gets from its European sponsors.  Let me share another way that Airbus distorts the marketplace. Buying new aircraft is a big expense for any airline. Airlines want to make sure the planes they buy will hold their value for years after their purchase. Normally, the market price decides the value of a used airplane, just like the marketplace decides the value of a used car. But Airbus uses its deep pockets to override the marketplace. When Airbus sells a plane to an airline, it often promises the airline that the plane will hold its value in the future, and if it does not, Airbus will pay the difference to the airline.  For example, Airbus will tell an airline that the plane it buys will be worth $60 million in 10 years. The market only pays $40 million. Airbus will pay the difference to the airline. It is a very attractive incentive for an airline, but it is also unfair because it allows one company to completely distort the marketplace. These Airbus guarantees allow the company to use their government subsidies to buy market share.  If this happened in another field such as cars, this Congress would be up in arms. Imagine going to a Toyota dealer and a salesman makes you a guarantee that in 10 years your car will be worth a certain amount of money far above its actual value. As a car buyer, you love that dealer. Airlines like Airbus's guarantee. But if a foreign carmaker did that, every representative from U.S. carmakers, suppliers, and dealers would be here in Congress demanding fairness.  The same abuse is taking place today in the aircraft market, but Congress is not responding. That is why I am exposing all of these techniques.  Let me share two specific cases where Airbus used these value guarantees to distort the market and take sales away from American workers.  In 2003, Boeing and Airbus competed to sell planes to Iberia Airlines of Spain. At the last minute, Airbus stepped in and undercut Boeing's price. It then offered Iberia a residual value guarantee on the future value of the aircraft. Airbus got the deal. An official with Iberia Airlines said Airbus got the deal because of the ``extraordinary conditions'' it offered at the last minute. Once again, because of its government support, Airbus was able to do things that a private for-profit company could not.  Airbus used that same market-distorting approach with easyJet, a low-cost carrier that had a fleet of all Boeing aircraft. In 2002, easyJet agreed to buy 120 planes from Airbus and take options on an additional 120 planes. Airbus offered a significant price discount and a residual-value guarantee to win that deal.  These are just a few examples of how Airbus, backed by European governments, is taking jobs away from American workers through market-distorting tactics. But it is not just the bribes, corruption, the landing slots, the discounts, and the value guarantees Airbus is using to undermine American aerospace. Airbus also steals sales by making threats and rewards on unrelated trade issues.  Airbus and European government officials regularly link Airbus sales to other trade issues. There is constant cooperation between Airbus and European leaders to pressure foreign airlines and governments to buy Airbus aircraft. Let me share a few documented examples that span the globe.  First, Europe gives special rewards to countries for buying Airbus planes. It happened with Russia 2 years ago. After the Russian airline Aeroflot bought Airbus planes, Russian exporters were given greater access in the European market, and Russia was given use of the EU space launchsite.  It happened in Thailand as well. Following a 2002 Thai Airlines Airbus purchase, Airbus lobbied the EU to lower trade barriers to Thai chicken and shrimp exports.  Time and again, Airbus links their plane purchases to other trade deals. But Airbus is not content to just use trade rewards. It also threatens to punish other countries unless they buy Airbus planes. Let me share a couple examples that first involves Pakistan.  In April 2003, Pakistan media reported that EU retaliated in textile negotiations against Pakistan following the Boeing 777 purchase. Airbus is not competing on the merits of its product. Instead, it uses threats of retaliation to pressure countries into going along.  Another example of these threats and pressure tactics involves Taiwan. During an aggressive 2002 competition between Boeing and Airbus for an important Taiwan sale, the Government of France threatened to terminate its satellite cooperation with Taiwan if Airbus was turned away.  Let me share a final example of these trade tactics, and it is one of which I have personal knowledge.  European governments have linked Airbus purchases to EU accession. I saw this myself on a trip to Central Europe that I took in 1998 when I visited Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. One Central European airline told me pointblank that they are under pressure from the Europeans to buy Airbus because it would ultimately make EU accession easier.  This is just a sampling of the very aggressive competitor that my constituents and our aerospace workers confront every day in the global market. I note that this is just the tip of the iceberg. I have been briefed by some of our Government intelligence agencies, and the examples I shared are just a very small part of what is happening. I encourage all of my colleagues to be briefed by the appropriate agencies because it will shock you, just as it shocked me. Arrange a briefing and find out for yourself.  I now want to turn to my fourth point. Airbus and EADS are now engaged in a slick campaign to market themselves as an American company to policymakers and to the general public. They are running a campaign of misinformation and half-truths to secure more U.S. business for European workers. Their campaign is particularly evident in Washington, DC, where Airbus is seeking to influence both the administration and this Congress. They have their lobbyists working to unravel the Boeing tanker contract, and their PR shop is making false claims about Airbus's impact on our economy. Simply put, they are trying to get us to see them as an American company.  Airbus and EADS have hired a small army of lobbyists. At least 18 lobbyists at multiple lobbying firms are registered to represent Airbus and EADS in Washington, DC. Their lobbyists include the current chairman of the Republican National Committee, former Members of Congress, former staffers to a previous Senate majority leader, a previous House minority leader, and others heavily involved in congressional campaigns. Lobbyists with ties to the administration are also at work for Airbus, including former officials at the White House, Defense Department, Commerce Department, Transportation Department, Export-Import Bank, OPIC, and NASA.  Airbus and EADS have also hired prominent Americans to help them gain entry into the U.S. markets and to put an American face on this European operation.  Ralph Crosby is the CEO of EADS North America. Mr. Crosby was a longtime senior executive with the Northrup Grumman Corporation. EADS said Crosby's hiring was ``to enhance the access of EADS to all elements of the U.S. defense and aerospace marketplace.''  T. A. McArtor is the chairman of Airbus North America. He previously served as the administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration. David Oliver is the executive vice president and chief operating officer of EADS North America. Oliver was previously the principal Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics. With this team of lobbyists and former U.S. Government officials in place, Airbus and EADS now want policymakers and the public to believe that Airbus is actually an American company.  Here is what Airbus and EADS say in Washington, DC, and all over the country in speeches, in paid advertisements, and in other official materials: They say Airbus has created and supports 120,000 jobs in our country. They say Airbus subcontracts with as many as 800 U.S. firms in the United States, and they say Airbus now does $6 billion in business annually in the United States.  For more than a year, I have called on Airbus to justify and document these assertions, and they have refused. Last year, I wrote to the Commerce Department and asked them to investigate these claims, and I want to share the results.  On jobs, Airbus used to claim they created 100,000 U.S. jobs. The U.S. Commerce Department could not find any justification for that claim. Commerce asked Airbus to document these claims. Airbus refused. Now Airbus is inflating its bogus figures, saying it is responsible for 120,000 American jobs.  Do my colleagues know what figure the Commerce Department came up with? Five hundred. Not 120,000, not 100,000, but 500 jobs is what the Commerce Department came up with.  The truth is, Airbus in large part is responsible for the economic shock, consolidation, and dislocation that has hurt American aerospace workers over the last decade. Thousands of small businesses have gone out of business. Consolidation in the industry has brought enormous change, and hundreds of thousands of jobs have been lost throughout the industry. Let us set the record straight. Airbus does not create American jobs; it kills them.  Airbus also makes false claims about the number of U.S. suppliers it uses. Airbus says it contracts with 800 U.S. firms. The Commerce Department, after looking into this request, can only come up with 250 firms, not 800. After that, Airbus did something kind of fishy. They revised their supplier figure down from 800 firms to 300 firms, but they increased the alleged value of its contracts from $5 billion up to $6 billion annually. We just cannot trust Airbus' funny numbers.  When it comes to suppliers, Airbus deserves no credit for using U.S. suppliers, and that is because commercial aerospace--the airlines, not the manufacturers--select many of the suppliers. Clearly Airbus does not deserve credit for the choices that its customers make. So again, Airbus does not help American firms; it hurts them.  Finally, Airbus claims it does $6 billion in business in the United States each year. They say that every chance they get, but here is something they do not say. EADS alone has a $6 billion trade surplus with the United States. I am not talking about another country; I am talking about one company running a $6 billion trade surplus with the United States.  Airbus and EADS are not helping America's aerospace industry. They are destroying it. Already, 700,000 American workers have lost their jobs while Europe keeps adding new workers to the Airbus payroll. It is time for the Senate, for our Government, and for the American people to take a real close look at Airbus' real impact on the United States.  The truth is that Airbus is a horrible investment for our country. According to EADS' documents, North America provides EADS with 35 percent of its revenues, about 10 billion euros, but North American workers only make up 2 percent of the company's jobs--just 2,400 jobs out of 107,000 worldwide. We give them a third of their business. What do we get in return? Two percent of their jobs. That is a bad deal.  The truth is, Airbus and EADS are exporting U.S. jobs, suppliers, and dollars to Europe as fast as they can. It is clear to me that Airbus is making phony claims about its impact on the U.S. economy, hiring lobbyists and mounting a PR campaign so it can position itself to steal the tanker contract from American workers.  I will turn to that tanker contract and some disturbing developments. As all of my colleagues know, I have been involved in the tanker contract from the very beginning. I have been proud to work with many other Senators on it. There is no question our Air Force needs new air refueling tankers. There is also no question that Airbus is trying to reopen a competition it lost 2 years ago.  I want to make sure American policymakers understand how Europe is hurting American aerospace workers and what Airbus has been doing behind the scenes to undermine the Boeing tanker contract. If we allow Airbus to steal the tanker contract through its phony claims, we will be helping Europe dismantle our domestic aerospace industry and asking U.S. taxpayers to foot that bill.  No one doubts the need for new tankers. Airborne refueling tankers allow our country to project military force around the globe. Most of our tankers are more than 40 years old. One-third of the fleet is unfit to fly at any given time due to mechanical failure. Each plane requires a full year of maintenance for every 4 years spent on duty.  There is no question they must be replaced with new tankers. The only question is, who is going to build these tankers--American workers or French workers? If we give this contract to the French, we will be rewarding Europe's trade-distorting behavior, putting Americans out of work, and helping Europe dismantle our aerospace industry.  Congress and the administration have wrestled with a variety of issues having to do with the tanker replacement program adopted by Congress and signed into law by the President 2 years ago. We are still trying to sort through all of the issues. It has been a unique and, frankly, at times a very frustrating process.  We are all aware of the impropriety of a few Boeing employees surrounding this deal. There is no excuse for their behavior. I will not defend it. I will not excuse it. They are being investigated and I expect they will be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law. But the actions of a few do not lessen the merits of a tanker deal. The Air Force needs this equipment, and Boeing is the best company to provide it.  Let us remember that the Air Force looked at a proposal from Airbus in 2002 and rejected it on the merits. In fact, the Air Force gave very detailed reasons why the Airbus proposal was inferior. Let me quote from the Air Force statement on March 28, 2002:       The EADS offering presents a higher risk technical approach      and a less preferred financial arrangement. First, EADS lacks      relevant tanker experience and needs to develop an air      refueling boom and operator station, making their approach a      significantly higher risk.       Second, a comparison of the net present values of the      aircraft recommended by Boeing and EADS establishes Boeing as      the preferred financial option.       Third, the size difference of the EADS' proposed KC-330      results in an 81 percent larger ground footprint compared to      the KC-135E it would replace, whereas the Boeing 767 is only      29 percent larger.       The KC-330 increase in size does not bring with it a      commensurate increase in available air refueling offload.       Finally, the EADS aircraft would demand a greater      infrastructure investment and dramatically limits the      aircraft's ability to operate effectively in the worldwide      deployment.  Those are the detailed technical reasons why Airbus lost the tanker contract. The Air Force essentially said that EADS and Airbus did not have a real tanker or tanker technology; their proposed aircraft was so large it required a larger footprint on the ground and a significant infrastructure investment.  Their proposal was ``significantly higher risk,'' for the Air Force, and, their proposed aircraft couldn't operate worldwide--limiting our ability to project force.  Finally, the Air Force said that Boeing was the ``preferred financial option,'' meaning the Boeing proposal was the cheaper alternative for taxpayers.  So in March 2002, Airbus lost. For most people, it would be over, but not for a company like Airbus. Airbus continued its campaign to delay and if possible, kill the KC-767 tanker deal. Airbus lobbyists have continued to work on and off of Capitol Hill with tanker opponents.  Airbus lobbyists worked to convince Members of Congress that Airbus should be recognized as an American Company. Airbus even used the United States Chamber of Commerce to sponsor trips to Paris and Toulouse, France for Congressional staffers.  Airbus tried to derail the lease of four 737 aircraft to the Air Force for executive transport at the General Accounting Office. Airbus didn't care about the four 737's. They were testing the system to see if they could use a bid protest at the GAO to block the tanker lease. The GAO dismissed the Airbus bid protest.  As the tanker deal was scrutinized, criticized and delayed, Airbus was regularly available to offer its tanker again to U.S. taxpayers and the Air Force. During the delay, Airbus spent $90 million to develop a real tanker. Now they are working as hard as they can to reopen the competition they lost.  For Airbus, the tanker competition is not over. We see that in Airbus materials--that are riddled with references to the tanker program. Again and again, EADS and Airbus say they are prepared to bid for the tankers.EADS even went to Wall Street earlier this year to pitch the company to U.S. financial interests.  As part of their pitch to U.S. investors, EADS says they still may compete for tankers in the U.S.  Would they dare to say these things if they weren't hard at work to give EADS another opportunity at tankers funded by U.S. taxpayers?  This week, EADS Joint Chief Executive Rainer Hertrich was quoted by Reuters saying:       I see a realistic chance that the issue will be taken up      again by the administration after the election.  Mr. President, over the past few months, I have been very concerned about what Airbus has been doing. In late March, I sent a letter to Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld detailing my concerns with Airbus's campaign of distortion and misinformation to kill the tanker program.  I ask unanimous consent that my letter to Secretary Rumsfeld printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                   U.S. Senate                                   Washington, DC, March 22, 2004.     Hon. Donald Rumsfeld,     Secretary, Department of Defense,     The Pentagon, Washington, DC       Dear Secretary Rumsfeld: I am deeply concerned about recent      comments by Secretary James Roche regarding re-opening      competition to supply aerial refueling tankers to the U.S.      Air Force.       The Air Force has already conducted a careful and open      competition to build the required tankers. As Secretary Roche      outlined in his testimony to the Senate Commerce Committee in      September, Boeing won that competition based on the      superiority of its design, technology, delivery schedule, and      overall risk reduction plan. Although Airbus demanded that      the General Accounting Office review that decision, the      review was dismissed almost immediately as lacking merit.      Rather than honorably accept the competition's outcome,      Airbus has resorted to a campaign of distortion and half-     truths in an effort to kill the proposed Air Force tanker      lease program.       I have fully supported thorough reviews of all aspects of      this program, and will continue to support constructive      modifications based on recommendations from those reviews.      However, I will not tolerate Airbus's attempts to undermine      the program itself by forcing the government to revisit      careful determinations about specific issues that have      already been made, reviewed, re-reviewed, and validated by      responsible government entities. The outcome of the initial      tanker competition is one such issue that has been clearly      and conclusively settled.       Airbus's corporate behavior on this matter cannot be      tolerated by the U.S. government. Its actions are further      delaying our ability to meet a key military requirement, and      if successful, will result in the outsourcing of thousands of      American manufacturing jobs to a foreign corporation that is      unfairly subsidized by European governments and that unfairly      competes with the only U.S. aircraft manufacturer. Such an      outcome represents ill-conceived public policy, and will also      unfairly punish the nearly 30,000 workers who will be      employed should the Air Force tanker lease program proceed      with a domestic manufacturer, as currently planned.       As you know, the average age of our existing tanker fleet      is 42 years and one-third of our tanker fleet is unfit to fly      at any given time due to mechanical and operational failure.      KC-135's spend 400 days in major depot maintenance for every      five years of service. Any unnecessary delay in replacing our      aging tanker fleet puts in jeopardy our ability to meet      critical air refueling and power projection requirements.       The Air Force's proposed tanker lease program is one of the      most closely scrutinized programs ever undertaken by the      Department of Defense. I support the DOD Inspector General's      current efforts to provide an independent assessment of      various aspects of this program. However, barring evidence of      wrongdoing, it is critical that we proceed without delay to      implement the Air Force tanker lease program and begin      production of those aircraft here in the United States.       I know how committed you are to replacing our aging tanker      fleet, and I know that meeting the demands of the critics of      this plan has taken a toll. But you and I both know that many      of these critics will not be satisfied until they stop this      contract with the only American airplane manufacturer capable      of producing a new generation tanker. We cannot allow that to      happen.           Sincerely,                                                     Patty Murray,                                                     U.S. Senator.
