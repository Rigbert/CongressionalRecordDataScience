Speaker, today the House will vote on House Resolution 57, a privileged resolution to assert Congress' constitutional duty to vote on the expenditure of our taxpayer dollars regarding the recent Mexico rescue package. The resolution will require the Comptroller General to perform an audit of the Mexican rescue package and report back to the Congress within 7 days.  One man in the White House, one Speaker and three other men here in Congress do not a republic make.  We ask the Speaker to grant our privileged resolution the right of full debate.  Authorizing billions of dollars without a vote of this Congress is wrong. Vote for your right to know. Vote for our people's right to know, vote for our taxpayers' right to know, vote for House Resolution 57, and vote ``no'' on any motions to table this bill.                          ____________________
