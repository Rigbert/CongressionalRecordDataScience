President, I am disappointed that Senate Republicans continue to focus on the most divisive judicial nominees and the White House continues its efforts to pack the courts ideologically, while the nomination of Judge Edward Prado to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit is being held captive on the Senate calendar. All Democratic Senators serving on the Judiciary Committee voted to report this nomination favorably. All Democratic Senators have indicated that they are eager to proceed to this nomination and, after a reasonable period of debate, voting on the nomination.  I am confident this nomination will be confirmed by an extraordinary majority--maybe unanimously. The question arises why the Republican leadership in the Senate has made no effort to proceed to Senate consideration of this judicial nomination--none.  In a statement in the Record early this month, I raised this matter. Then at the Judiciary Committee business meeting on April 10, more than two weeks ago, I raised this matter, again. Still, there has been no response and no effort to bring this matter before the Senate for consideration and a vote. The Republican leadership would rather focus exclusively on those controversial circuit court nominees that raise the most problems than proceed to fill vacancies with nominations on which we are able to achieve agreement.  That is most unfortunate and most telling.  Instead of proceeding to the nomination of Judge Prado, Republicans insisted on pressing forward with the controversial and divisive nomination of Priscilla Owen in early April and with the controversial and divisive nomination of Jeffrey Sutton this week.  Judge Prado is nominated to the Fifth Circuit and is an exceptional candidate for elevation to the appeals court. He has significant experience as a public servant in west Texas. Perhaps the fact that he has bipartisan support is the reason why he is not being brought forward at this time for a floor vote.  That does not fit the Republican message but reveals the truth: That Democratic Senators, having already acted on 119 judges appointed by President Bush are prepared to support even more of his nominations when they are mainstream, consensus nominees. Perhaps the fact that Democrats unanimously supported his nomination in Committee is seen as a drawback for Mr. Prado in the Republican world of nomination politics. I hope that is not the case.  I also hope the fact that Judge Prado is Hispanic is not a factor in the Republican delay. Some have suggested that Judge Prado is being delayed because Democratic Senators are likely to vote for him and thereby undercut the Republican's shameless charge that the opposition to Miguel Estrada is based on his ethnicity. Republican partisans have made lots of partisan hay attacking Democrats in connection with the Estrada nomination. We all know that the White House could have cooperated with the Senate by producing his work papers and the Senate could have proceeded to a vote on the Estrada nomination months ago. The request for his work papers was sent last May.  Rather than respond as every other administration has over the last 20 years and provide access to those papers, this White House has stonewalled. Rather than follow the policy of openness outlined by Attorney General Robert Jackson in the 1940's, this administration has stonewalled. And Republican Senators and other partisans could not wait to claim that the impasse created by the White House's change in policy and practice with respect to nominations was somehow attributable to Democrats being anti-Hispanic. The charge would be laughable if it were not so calculated to do political damage and to divide the Hispanic community. That is what Republican partisans hope is the result. That is wrong.  So some have come to the conclusion that Republican delay in connection with the consideration of Judge Prado's nomination may be related to the political strategy of the White House to unfairly characterize Democrats. Might the record be set straight if Democrats were seen to be supporting this Hispanic nominee to the Fifth Circuit. Might the Republicans' own record of opposing President Clinton's nominations of Judge Jorge Rangel and Enrique Moreno to that same circuit court be contrasted unfavorably with Democrats' support of Judge Prado.  Might Judge Prado, a conservative from Texas with a public record service as a Federal district court judge, become the first Hispanic appointed by President Bush to the circuit courts with widespread support from Senate Democrats. Might this more mainstream, consensus nominee stand in stark contrast to the ideological choices intended to pack the courts on which the White House and Senate Republicans concentrate almost exclusively.  Judge Prado has 19 years of experience as a U.S. District Court judge, which provides us with a significant judicial career to evaluate. A review of Judge Prado's actions on the bench demonstrates a solid record of fairness and evenhandedness.  While I may not agree with each and every one of his rulings or with every action he has taken as a lawyer or judge, my review of his record leads me to conclude that he will be a fair judge. No supervisor or colleague of Judge Prado's has questioned his ability or willingness to interpret the law fairly. Judge Prado enjoys the full support of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund. Not a single person or organization has submitted a letter of opposition or raised concerns about Judge Prado. No controversy. No red flags. No basis for concern. No opposition.  This explains why his nomination was voted out of the Judiciary Committee with a unanimous, bipartisan vote on an expedited basis.  To understand the importance of Judge Prado's nomination, we must put it in the context of prior nominations to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. Until Judge Prado's hearing, it had been more than a decade since a Latino nominee to that Court had even been allowed a hearing by the Senate Judiciary Committee, let alone a vote on the floor. I recall President Clinton's two Hispanic nominations to the Fifth Circuit and the poor treatment they received from the Republican-led Senate.  Judge Jorge Rangel was a former Texas State judge and a dedicated attorney in private practice in Corpus Christi, Texas when President Clinton nominated him to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in 1997. Judge Rangel is a graduate of the University of Houston and the Harvard Law School and earned a rating of ``Well Qualified'' by the American Bar Association. Yet, under Republican leadership, he never received a hearing on his nomination, let alone a vote by the Committee or by the full Senate. His nomination languished without action for 15 months. Despite his treatment, this outstanding gentleman has recently written us in support of a judicial nominee of President Bush.  After Judge Rangel, disappointed with his treatment at the hands of the Republican majority, asked the President not to resubmit his nomination, President Clinton nominated Enrique Moreno, a distinguished attorney in private practice in El Paso, Texas. Mr. Moreno is a graduate of Harvard University and the Harvard Law School. He was given the highest rating of unanimously ``Well Qualified'' by the ABA. Mr. Moreno also waited 15 months, but was never allowed a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. President Clinton renominated him at the beginning of 2001, but President Bush, squandering an opportunity for bipartisanship, withdrew the nomination and refused to renominate him.  In addition, President Clinton nominated H. Alston Johnson to the 5th Circuit in 1999. This talented Louisianan came to the Senate with the support of both of his home state Senators, but he never received a hearing on his nomination or a vote by the Committee or the full Senate in 1999, 2000, or the beginning of 2001. His nomination languished without action for 23 months.  In contrast, when I served as Chair of the Judiciary Committee last Congress, we granted Edith Clement a hearing within months of her nomination. At that time there had been no hearings on 5th Circuit nominees since 1994 and no confirmations since 1995.  Under Republican leadership, none of President Clinton's nominees to this Court received a hearing during his entire second term of office.  Some of my friends on the other side of the aisle have made the outrageous claim that Democratic Senators are anti-Hispanic or anti-Latino. I think it is important to set the record straight.  Of the 10 Latino appellate judges currently seated in the Federal courts, eight were appointed by President Clinton. Three other Latino nominees of President Clinton to the appellate courts were blocked by Republicans, aswell as several others for the district court. In fact, in contrast to the President's selection of only one Latino circuit court nominee in hist first 2 years in office, three of President Clinton's first 14 judicial nominees were Latino, and he nominated more than 30 Latino nominees to the Federal courts.  During President Clinton's tenure, 10 of his more than 30 Latino nominees, including Judge Rangel, Enrique Moreno, and Christine Arguello to the circuit courts, were delayed or blocked from receiving hearings or votes by the Republican leadership.  Republicans delayed consideration of Judge Richard Paez for over 1,500 days, and 39 Republicans voted against him. The confirmations of Latina circuit nominees Rosemary Barkett and Sonia Sotomayor were also delayed by Republicans. Judge Barkett was targeted for delay and defeat by Republicans based on claims about her judicial philosophy, but those efforts were not successful.  After significant delays, 36 Republicans voted against the confirmation of this nominee who received a ``Well-Qualified'' rating by the ABA. Additionally, Judge Sotomayor, who also received a ``Well-Qualified'' rating and had been appointed to district court by President George H.W. Bush, was targeted by Republicans for delay or defeat when she was nominated to the Second Circuit. She was confirmed, although 29 Republicans voted against her.  It is unfortunate how few Latino nominees this President has sent to the Senate. It is reassuring, however, that the Latino nominations that we have received have been acted upon in a expeditious manner.  They have overwhelmingly enjoyed bipartisan support. Under the Democratically-led Senate, we swiftly granted hearings for and eventually confirmed Judge Christina Armijo of New Mexico, Judge Phillip Martinez and Randy Crane of Texas, Judge Jose Martinez of Florida, U.S. Magistrate Judge Alia Ludlum, and Judge Jose Linares of New Jersey to the district courts. This year, we also confirmed Judge James Otero of California, and we would have held his confirmation hearing last year if his ABA peer rating had been delivered to us in time for the scheduling of our last hearing.  Also on the Senate executive calendar is the nomination of Cecilia Altonaga to be a Federal judge in Florida.  We expedited consideration of this nominee at the request of Senator Graham of Florida. She will be the first Cuban American woman to be confirmed to the Federal bench when Republicans choose to proceed to that nomination. Indeed, Democrats in the Senate have worked to expedite fair consideration of every Latino nominee this President has made to the Federal trial courts in addition to the nomination of Judge Prado.  Another example, may be the nomination of Consuelo Callahan to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Unlike the divisive nomination of Carolyn Kuhl to the same court, both home state Senators returned their blue slips and support a hearing for Judge Consuelo Callahan. I hope she receives a hearing in the near future and look forward to learning more about her record as an appellate judge for the State of California. Rather than disregarding time-honored rules and Senate practices, I urge my friends on the other side of the aisle to help us fill more judicial vacancies more quickly by bringing those nominations that have bipartisan support to the front of the line for Committee hearings and floor votes.  As I have noted throughout the last two years, the Senate is able to move expeditiously when we have consensus, mainstream nominees to consider. Nationally-respected columnist David Broder made this point in an April 16 column that appeared in the Washington Post. Mr. Broder noted that when he asked Alberto Gonzales if there might be a lesson in Judge Prado's easy approval, Mr. Gonzales missed the point. In Mr. Broder's mind: ``The lesson seems obvious. Conservatives can be confirmed for the courts when they are well known in their communities and a broad range of their constituents have reason to think them fair-minded.'' To date the Senate has proceeded to confirm 118 of President Bush's nominees, 100 in the 17 months in which Democrats made up the Senate majority.  The lesson that less controversial nominees are considered and confirmed more easily was the lesson of the last two years and that lesson has been lost on this White House.  Unfortunately, far too many of this President's nominees raise serious concerns about whether they will be fair judges to all parties on all issues. Those types of nominees should not be rushed through the process. I invite the President to nominate more mainstream individuals like Judge Prado. His proven record and bipartisan support makes it easier for us to uphold our constitutional duty of advise and consent. I encourage those on the other side of the aisle to allow us to consider his nomination.  I look forward to casting a vote in favor of his confirmation.  I, again, urge the Senate Republican leadership to work with us and to agree to proceed to this consensus nomination, to provide adequate time for debate and to proceed to a vote without further delay. Judge Prado's nomination has been delayed on the Senate executive calendar for several weeks, unnecessarily in my view. I recall all too vividly when anonymous Republican holds delayed Senate action on the nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the Second Circuit for seven months. I do not want to see that experience repeated by Judge Prado. Let us work together. Let us debate and act on the nomination of Judge Prado without further unnecessary delay.  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of David Broder's April 16 column on the nomination of Judge Prado be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                           Tale of Two Judges                          (By David S. Broder)       Were it not for an old friend, I would have been as      oblivious to the story of Judge Edward Prado of San Antonio      as the rest of the Washington press corps.       Judge Tom Stagg of Shreveport, La., told me his pal was up      for appointment to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th      Circuit and suggested I go by and ``see how they treat him''      at his confirmation hearing.       Turns out it's like the Sherlock Holmes story of the dog      that didn't bark. In the midst of the bitter partisan battle      in which Democrats have repeatedly blocked a Senate      confirmation vote on the nomination of Miguel Estrada to the      U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, Prado went      through like gangbusters.       The story of why one Latino Republican has such an easy      time while another creates such controversy is an instructive      tale--and one with hopeful implications.       Estrada has been denied an up-or-down vote on the Senate      floor because Democrats call him ``a stealth nominee,'' a man      of high credentials but no judicial experience and one they      say was unresponsive to their questions. Their demand to look      at memos he wrote while serving in the Justice Department has      been rejected by the administration and neither side has      yielded.       Given this background, I was expecting to see Prado, 55,      put to the test at his Judiciary Committee hearing. His      credentials are impressive: a graduate of the University of      Texas and its law school, four years each as a prosecutor and      a public defender, a short stint as a state judge, U.S.      attorney for three years and, since 1984, a federal district      judge--the last two appointments coming from President Ronald      Reagan.       But Prado is also a character. His courtroom is wired with      the latest audiovisual equipment, which Prado, a music lover      and showman, loves to demonstrate. Three years ago, during a      murder-for-hire trial, he came onto the bench while a      recording of ``Happy Together'' by the Turtles filled the      air, and then sang: ``Imagine me as God. I do. I was      appointed by the president. Appointed forever. My decisions      cannot be questioned by you. I'm always right.''       Many judges may feel that way; few say so, and even fewer      put it to music.       More seriously, in answering the committee's questionnaire,      Prado noted controversial cases in which he ruled against a      woman's claim of job discrimination by the San Antonio fire      department, a diabetes patient's claim that he was unfairly      found to be medically ineligible for a police officer's job,      and a claim that the Texas high school graduation test      discriminated against Hispanics.       In another part of the questionnaire, he listed 68      criminal, immigration and civil cases in which he had been      reversed or criticized by the court of appeals. Plenty of      fertile ground, one imagined, for liberal groups to challenge      elevating a Reagan judge to a closely balanced and important      bench just one level below the Supreme Court.       But in fact the Congressional Hispanic Caucus--which has      vigorously opposed the Estrada nomination--wrote a letter      endorsing Prado. Rep. Charlie Gonzalez, a Texas Democrat and      co-signer of the letter, told me that he had known Prado for      almost 40 years and ``he was everything you want in a     judge--he's smart and articulate, he's not arbitrary, and he      really understands people. Some of his rulings I would take      issue with, but when the caucus interviewed him, he talked      honestly about cases that have impacted minorities and he      made it clear he knows how important the courts have been to      us. It was so different from our hour's conversation with      Estrada, who conveyed no sense of what we would think a      Latino should appreciate about the historical role of courts      in bringing us to where we are today and where we need to be      tomorrow.''       With the backing of the White House and the Hispanic      caucus, Prado's confirmation hearing was perfunctory Sen.      Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the ranking Democrat and scourge of      Estrada, read a statement complaining of past Republican      treatment of President Bill Clinton's Latino nominees, then      left without asking any questions. The two Republicans      present--Sens. John Cornyn of Texas and Jeff Sessions of      Alabama--said they had known Prado for years and simply      congratulated him.       Prado was then unanimously confirmed by the Judiciary      Committee.       When I asked Alberto Gonzales, the White House counsel, if      there might be a lesson in Prado's easy approval, he replied,      ``It's hard to say. We view Judge Prado as no more qualified      than Miguel Estrada or others they [the Democrats] have      opposed.''       But the less on seems obvious. Conservatives can be      confirmed for the courts when they are well known in their      communities and a broad range of their constituents have      reason to think them fair-minded. Even if they can't resist      breaking into song.
