 President, I thank the Senator from Connecticut for his kind remarks, not only on this issue but the other issue that has kept us largely preoccupied in the last few days. Hopefully, we will have a vote in the morning and will know where we stand on the future of this bill.  I commend all of those involved. The Senator from New Hampshire has been waiting patiently. Therefore, we look forward to what he has to say.  I yield the floor.
