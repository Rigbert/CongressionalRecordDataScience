 President, I rise not to speak on this bill but to do two things. First, to say a few words and share my respect and admiration for the senior Senator from Georgia. And, second to share some of my reflections of the past year and where I think we seem to be heading with the reconciliation bill.  Mr. President, I do not serve on a committee with the senior Senator from Georgia, but I do try to listen to the floor when I am in the office. I have a very simple test, I either turn the sound up or down or off depending on the merit I find in the discussion. I have always turned the sound up to listen to Senator Sam Nunn. And, what I have heard is an intelligent, a reasoned, and a very informed person who has brought a great deal to bear in the debates on the Senate floor. He has been a strong and tireless advocate for a national defense policy that is well thought out, for foreign policy that explores each issue as part of a whole policy situation and not a separate stand-alone issue.  His ability, I think, to see individual defense programs or foreign policy actions as part of the total debate has given him the ability to think independently of party and the daily public opinion poll and put forth a policy that is really important.  I will miss him greatly. I very much regret his decision to retire from the U.S. Senate. I think it is to the Senate's loss when we lose one of our great minds.  The distinguished Senator has been an advocate for a strong national defense, especially pushing for a well-trained and modern force. He has constantly lent his support to support programs which would better prepare our men and women in uniform for war, but moreover for operations-other-than-war including humanitarian missions.  His leadership in foreign policy is marked, as well. He has been the single strongest voice for lessening the threat of nuclear proliferation from the States of the former Soviet Union with the policies advanced under the Nunn-Lugar program. And, he has helped our relationship with the new Russia and the nations of Eastern Europe through his ideas on NATO expansion and the Partnership for Peace Program.  Senator Nunn will continue to remain a voice of moderation and independent thought throughout the remainder of his term. I will miss his contributions to some of the most important issues of our day and this body will miss his leadership.                          ____________________
