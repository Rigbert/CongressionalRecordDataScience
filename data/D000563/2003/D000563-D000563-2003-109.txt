It may have been two hearings, if I am not mistaken, and a lot of questions asked by individual Senators and then several lengthy debates on the floor of the Senate leading to the cloture votes.  In the case of the nominee, Priscilla Owen, who is a Texas Supreme Court Justice, she was not only given a hearing and considered previously and rejected, she was brought again for another consideration by the committee and more debate on the floor.  When it comes to Attorney General Pryor of Arkansas, I can recall it was a very lengthy hearing in the large hearing room over at the Hart Building, the Senate Judiciary Committee, and then with Judge Pickering, another district court judge from Mississippi, who received two separate hearings, and then after those hearings was rejected, then brought back again, more lengthy debate. So I ask the Senator from Nevada, through the Chair, is it his belief that any of these four nominees have been treated rudely by the committee or denied an opportunity for a hearing or given a chance in the Senate to have had their qualifications considered before the votes were taken?
