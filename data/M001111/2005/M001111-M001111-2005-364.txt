 President, today I cast a vote for the McCain-Lieberman climate stewardship and innovation amendment to H.R. 6.  My vote is a statement on the need for the United States to take action to address global climate change in a real and proactive manner.  The authors of the amendment have recently added provisions related to nuclear power. I don't agree that these two policy issues should be linked, but it was my colleagues' option.  The real message and point of this amendment remains that the United States needs to acknowledge and rapidly begin addressing global climate change.  Voluntary measures are constructive but not good enough. We cannot afford to sit back and indulge those who choose against making reductions in harmful emissions at the expense of those who do. Scientific evidence shows that global warming poses a real threat to the Pacific Northwest environment, way of life, and economy.  As the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, we should lead by example and innovation. We should not wait for other countries to lead on this important priority. We should seek and promote technologies that promote energy efficiency and make significant cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, as the climate stewardship and innovation amendment would have us do.  Mr. President, I support this amendment because it commits the United States to a mandatory program that makes real cuts in greenhouse gas emissions. This amendment will make our country, and the entire globe, a safer, cleaner place.
