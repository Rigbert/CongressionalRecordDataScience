President, I am proud to join my colleagues in introducing the National Invasive Species Act of 1996. This comprehensive bill includes the provisions of my Lake Champlain Zebra Mussel Control Act and is the vehicle which can help Vermont and other States wage war on exotic nuisance species like the zebra mussel.  Mr. President, a tiny mussel the size of my thumbnail threatens to choke off 25 percent of Vermont's drinking water, clog our hatcheries, and unravel the Lake Champlain ecosystem. It was only three summers ago when the mussel was first discovered in the South Lake near Orwell, VT, by a young boy. Two years later, zebra mussel densities has reached 134,000 larvae per cubit meter. The end is not in sight.  We did not ask for them, but we got them. Now Vermont has to face the consequences of a problem that Vermont has been powerless to stop. The zebra mussel problem in Lake Champlain deserves immediate and swift action. This exotic pest poses a serious risk to the water resources throughout Vermont, economic opportunities along the lake, and the health and safety of the people of Vermont.  This bill we are introducing today addresses a number of issues that can only be resolved through Federal coordination and cooperation. Millions of gallons of water are imported each day from foreign ports throughout the globe. One gallon can contain the seeds of an invasive species epidemic that can wipe out domestic species, ecosystems, and economic resources. Vermonters know this well through our experience with lampreys on trophy sportfish, millfoil throughout our lakes, and zebra mussels in Lake Champlain.  The United States needs this bill now. Our inland and marine seaports are a ticking time bomb. The heart of this bill is a nationwide effort to control the transportation and discharge of ballast water from international cargo ships. One seaport cannot tackle this problem alone without risking their economic base. However, if every port works together, we can protect fisheries, marine resources, and ultimately taxpayers from the enormous cost of fighting an exotic nuisance species.  The other major theme in this bill is a concerted effort to control exotic species once they have arrived and multiplied. This second theme is based largely on my bill, the Lake Champlain Zebra Mussel Control Act. In addition to highlighting the specific needs of Lake Champlain, my bill--and this bill--includes a three point plan for tackling exotic species.  First, establishes national voluntary guidelines for recreational boaters who are a major mechanism for the spread of zebra mussels and other exotics within the United States freshwater bodies.  Second, allows states to work cooperatively on watershed approaches to attack this problem. If Vermont devotes millions of dollars to this effort and our neighbors do nothing, the effort will be futile.  Third, reauthorizes and enhances the Federal authority for agencies to fight exotics. The nuisance species problem crosses many jurisdictions. Therefore, the comprehensive strategy set forth in this bill includes the Army Corps of Engineers, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of the Interior, the Department of Commerce, the Coast Guard, the Smithsonian, and other Federal efforts. As our Federal foot soldiers in this war against the zebra mussel and other species, all of these departments and agencies need the authority, resources, and flexibility to win the battle.  Mr. President, every minute that we delay an effort to stop the zebra mussels, the mussels multiply exponentially and risk the physical and economic health of Vermont. While my colleagues may not know first hand the scourge of zebra mussels or other exotic species, let me assure them that the ounce of prevention in my bill will save them pounds of cure. To turn our backs on this problem of national significance only guarantees that it gets much worse. Mr. President, I hope we can move this bill quickly.                                 ______      By
