President, today I wish to recognize my former staffer, Ms. Annie Caputo, as she is finally confirmed by the Senate as a Member of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Annie has over 20 years of experience handling nuclear energy issues, which will serve her well in her new role at the NRC.  Annie worked as senior policy adviser on my EPW committee staff from 2007 through 2012 and again in 2015 through 2016. Her experience and expertise is so well known and well regarded that staff and Senators on both sides of the aisle seek her input when it comes to nuclear issues. During her career, Annie also worked for the House Energy and Commerce Committee and Exelon Corporation, which operates more nuclear plants than any other company.  Her expertise was invaluable to me during the aftermath of the Fukushima nuclear accident, in my work to ensure the NRC issued timely decisions on new nuclear plant licenses, and most recently, she has been central in developing the bipartisan Nuclear Energy Innovation Act.  I want to congratulate Annie Caputo on this well-deserved confirmation and wish her well in her new role at the NRC.                          ____________________
