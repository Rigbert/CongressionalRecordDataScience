 President, today I am pleased to express my strong support for the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003. This bill sends a powerful message to the ruling military junta in Burma that their violent restrictions against freedom and democracy will not be tolerated and will have serious consequences. Their recent actions have yet again demonstrated to the world that this junta cannot be trusted.  The international community cannot allow the crimes committed by the Burmese military against the rightfully elected leader of Burma, Aung San Suu Kyi, her followers, and the Burmese people to go unpunished. So, it is my great hope that the actions that the Senate is taking today will provide the international leadership needed to put the spotlight on the Burmese military junta and make them change their ways.  I know that other countries, including the European Union, are also considering sanctions against Burma. A multilateral effort must be made so that we send the right message and so that our efforts are as effective as possible.  I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003. I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues to help bring freedom and justice to the Burmese people.
