I know it was an accident. We are good friends. He is probably not aware I do support the H-1B.  But is the Senator aware that out of the top 10 companies that secured H-1B visas, 6 of those companies were Indian corporations; 5,000 visas to Infosys, an Indian corporation which is a body shop which moves H-1B engineers from India to the United States for a fee and then back to India to compete with American companies; WoodPro, which is the second largest company, 4,000 visas; and the first American company on the list for H-1B visas was Microsoft, with 3,000. So 9,000 had already been awarded to Indian companies, and the Government of India has said the H-1B is what they consider their outsourcing visa so they can send engineers to the United States to learn how to compete against American companies.  Does the Senator believe that is an abuse which should be addressed?
