 Dole, Mr. Lieberman, and Mr.         Moynihan):  S. 1860. A bill to provide for legal reform and consumer compensation relating to motor vehicle tort systems, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.                   the auto choice reform act of 1996                                 ______      By Mr. McCONNELL (for himself and Mr. Dole):  S. 1861. A bill to provide for legal reform and consumer compensation, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.         the legal reform and consumer compensation act of 1996 Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, several weeks ago, I was disappointed, but not surprised, when the President vetoed the bipartisan product liability reform bill. The bill would have curbed runaway punitive damage awards--which the Supreme Court endorsed in its recent BMW versus Gore decision--and offered some protection to those needlessly dragged into lawsuits. The President, erroneously, in my view, charged that the product liability reform bill, offered too many benefits to business and unfairly burdened the injured.  The President missed an opportunity to correct some of the defects in the legal system. The fact is the system is too costly and fails to provide prompt and fair relief to those who are injured. Less than half of every dollar spent on lawsuits goes to the injured.  And, spiraling legal costs exact a toll on every American family and business owner in the form of higher insurance premiums and ever-increasing costs for medical care. FBI Director Louis Freeh estimates that fraudulent medical claims arising out of phony car accidents cost every American household $200 a year.  Moreover, economic growth is impeded when new American-made products, technology, medicines, and medical devices aren't brought to worldwide markets because of too many lawsuits.  This mess-of-a-legal system can be turned around with reforms that will ensure those who are injured get fairly and quickly compensated without resort to expensive and protracted litigation. The two bills I am introducing today take aim at the unnecessary costs of personal injury lawsuits. The result will be more money in the hands of the injured more quickly, and a massive savings to American consumers.  The Joint Economic Committee estimates that the Auto Choice Reform Act will save the driving public $40 billion annually in insurance costs. Savings would be progressive, resulting in savings to low-income drivers of about 45 percent on their insurance premiums.  The Legal Reform and Consumer Compensation Act, designed to change the monopolistic and anticompetitive contingent fee system and to provide a rapid recovery mechanism for personal injury victims, would save more than $45 billion a year.  These dramatic savings are achieved without capping punitive damages, or limiting the rights of victims. Rather, these bills expand consumer options. By adding a new type of auto insurance, new ways of paying victims fairly for their injuries, and breaking the contingent fee hold, Americans will be begin to be relieved of the litigation burden that threatens to strangle every family and burdens the overall economy.  The changes proposed in these bills will require a major rethinking about the current zero-sum, adversarial legal system. Occasionally, the legal system rewards a persistent plaintiff with a windfall damage award--like the woman who won a multi-million-dollar verdict from McDonald's for spilling hot coffee on herself. But odds of winning in the legal system are about as good as hitting a jackpot in Las Vegas.  The perverse incentive structure--the one-in-a-million chance of winning the lottery--discourages settlement and rewards a piling on of claims. If a jury will award an injured party 3 times his or her out-of-pocket losses, then 10 trips to the doctor are better than 2. The Rand Corp., in a study released earlier this year, estimates that excess medical claiming connected with lawsuits consumed some $4 billion of health care resources.  But the fault for the runaway legal system does not lie exclusively with the injured and their lawyers. Defendants and their lawyers know that the multimillion-dollar jury award is a rare occurrence. Yet, most cases are fought as if every case results in $1 million verdict. Every dollar spent on defense buys delay and precludes early and reasonable resolution.  In the meantime, every American pays the price--through higher car insurance premiums, spiraling medical bills, and soaring prices at the checkout counter. And the economy suffers from slow growth and through products, inventions, and technologies withheld from the world's markets because of the cost of lawsuits. It's time we cut the tort tax and give every American relief from the costly legal system.  I am pleased that Senator Dole is joining this effort. His sponsorship of this ambitious effort to overhaul the legal system will probably be one of his last legislative initiatives. I am honored to have his support.  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the two bills and a summary of the bills be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S.1860       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Auto Choice Reform Act of      1996''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       The Congress finds that--       (1) the costs of operating a motor vehicle are excessive      due to the legal and administrative costs associated with the      processing of claims under the tort system;       (2) the costly fault and liability insurance system often      fails to provide compensation commensurate with loss, takes      too long to pay benefits and wastes too many dollars on legal      fees;       (3) the distorted incentives of the tort system for motor      vehicles produce--       (A) significant fraud in the claiming process, thereby      dangerously exacerbating the national distrust felt by many      Americans toward the legal process in general and the rule of      law itself;       (B) significant wasteful, fraudulent, and costly overuse      and abuse of scarce health care resources and services,      thereby increasing the problems of affordability and      accessibility in the health care system;       (C) significant and unbearable cost burdens on low-income      Americans, which impose on them the Hobson's choice of      driving on an unlawful, uninsured basis or compelling them to      forego essential needs;       (D) significant reductions in access to, and purchases of,      motor vehicles, thereby damaging the economic well-being of      many low-income Americans, while also unnecessarily harming a      critical component of the American economy;       (E) significant deterioration of the economic well-being of      most major American cities through the imposition of a      massive, differentially greater ``tort tax'' on urban      residents, thereby contributing to the abandonment of cities      by many American taxpayers able to achieve substantial after-     tax savings on automobile insurance premiums by the sole act      of moving to adjacent suburban communities; and       (F) significant inability to achieve market-based discounts      in insurance rates for owners of safer cars, thereby      powerfully contributing to the lesser safety of American      drivers and passengers;       (4) a system that allows consumers the opportunity to self-     insure and separates economic and non-economic damages for      the purpose of purchasing insurance would provide enormous      cost savings to drivers;       (5) consumer choice in selection of motor vehicle insurance      would be greatly enhanced if each consumer could decide upon      the form of insurance that best suits the individual needs of      the consumer;       (6) insurance to indemnify individuals for personal injury      arising from motor vehicle collisions is frequently      unavailable at reasonable cost because of the potential for      third-party claims;       (7) a system enabling individuals to select the form of      motor vehicle insurance coverage that best suits individual      needs would enhance individual freedom and reduce the costs      of motor vehicle insurance for consumers; and       (8) a system which targets and emphasizes the scourge of      those who drive under the influence of drugs or alcohol will      further deter such dangerous and unlawful conduct.     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.       The purpose of this Act is to authorize consumers of motor      vehicle insurance to choose between their present tort      remedies under State law and a system which combines first-     party insurance and the right to sue negligent drivers for      all further uncompensated economic losses.

SEC. 5. MOTOR VEHICLE PERSONAL PROTECTION INSURANCE.       (a) Insurance Policy Provisions.--(1) An insurance policy      that includes provisions that entitle the insured to receive,      without regard to fault or lack of fault, the insured's net      economic losses caused by an injury along with an express,      specific waiver of tort rights as provided in the insurance      policy shall be valid notwithstanding any contrary provisions      of State law.       (2) In order for a personal protection insurance policy to      be covered by this Act, a motor vehicle insurance policy      issued by an insurer shall, at a minimum--       (A) provide personal protection coverage of the greater      of--       (i) up to the minimum limits of liability insurance for      personal injury under the State's financial responsibility      law; or       (ii) in a State covered by a no-fault motor vehicle      insurance law, up to the minimum level of insurance required      for no-fault benefits; and       (B) contain provisions under the State's financial      responsibility law, including those related to liability for      property damage, except to the extent State law would bar      contractual provisions giving effect to personal protection      authorizations set forth in this Act, or to the extent that      State law would be contrary to other provisions of this Act.       (3) A personal protection insurer is authorized to contract      to pay personal protection benefits periodically as losses      accrue. Unless the treatment or expenses related thereto are      in reasonable dispute, an insurer who does not pay a claim      for net economic loss covered by a personal protection      insurance under this Act within 30 days after payment is due,      shall pay the loss compounded at a rate of 50 percent per      annum, as liquidated damages and in lieu of any penalty or      exemplary damages.       (b) Operation of the Right To Choose.--(1) Under this Act,      in lieu of buying traditional tort liability insurance for      personal injury to protect third parties, motorists have the      right to choose personal protection which will be available      to themselves and their family members in the event of a      motor vehicle accident, including the amount of financial      protection they deem appropriate and affordable for      themselves and such others. As an alternative, motorists have      the right to elect traditional tort liability coverage for      personal injury at the minimum limits (or higher) under the      State's financial responsibility law.       (2)(A) A motorist who chooses traditional tort liability      has automatically included in such coverage tort maintenance      coverage at least at the equivalent of the minimum levels of      insurance under the higher of--       (i) the State's financial responsibility law for personal      injury; or       (ii) the State's no-fault motor vehicle law, if applicable.       (B) A motorist described under subparagraph (A) who is      involved in an accident with another motorist remains subject      to tort law for personal injury except that, based on fault,      such motorist--       (i) may be claimed against by those covered by personal      protection insurance or tort maintenance coverage only for      net economic loss; and       (ii) may not claim against those covered by personal      protection insurance or tort maintenance coverage except for      net economic loss.       (C)(i) With respect to a claim under subparagraph (B)(ii),      a deduction is made against the recovery equal to the limits      of tort maintenance coverage applicable to the economic loss      of the claimant.       (ii) One-half of any amount paid under tort maintenance      coverage referred to under clause (i) shall be deemed payable      for economic loss.       (3) A motorist who chooses personal protection coverage and      who is involved in an accident with another such motorist is      compensated under his or her own policy for net economic loss      only without regard to fault. But if the motorist sustains      net economic loss in excess of his or her policy's benefit      levels, that person retains the right to claim and sue for      net economic loss based on fault.       (4) If a motorist who has chosen personal protection      coverage is involved in an accident with an uninsured      motorist, the personal protection insured is compensated for      net economic loss without regard to fault according to the      terms of his or her personal protection policy, and has the      right to claim against the uninsured motorist for net      economic loss based on fault. The uninsured motorist forfeits      the right to claim for noneconomic loss against the motorist      who has chosen the personal protection policy.       (5)(A) A motorist who chooses either personal protection      insurance or tort liability insurance also binds by such      choice his or her resident relatives, provided that--       (i) an adult resident relative shall not be bound without      his or her consent, which, in the absence of express consent,      shall be implied when the relative is present in a motor      vehicle operated by the motorist; and       (ii) insurers are authorized to specify reasonable terms      and conditions governing the commencement, duration, and      application of the chosen coverage depending on the number of      motor vehicles and owners thereof in a household.       (B) In order to minimize conflict between the two options      under subparagraph (A), insurers are authorized to maintain      underwriting rules that encourage uniformity within a      household.       (6) A personal protection insured retains the right to      claim, and remains subject to a claim, for driving under the      influence of alcohol or illegal drugs, both as defined by      State law, or for intentional misconduct.       (7) A personal protection insured claims personal      protection benefits in the following priority:       (A) The personal protection of an employer if the person      injured is an employee of the employer and the accident      occurs while the employee is acting within the scope of the      employee's employment.       (B) The personal protection under which the injured person      is or was an insured.       (C) The personal protection covering a motor vehicle      involved in the accident, if the person injured was an      occupant or was struck by such motor vehicle at the time of      the accident.       (8) A personal protection insurer is authorized to write      personal protection coverage--       (A) without any deductible or subject to a reasonable      deductible not to exceed $1,000; and       (B) with an exclusion of coverage for persons driving under      the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs.       (9) A personal protection insurer is subrogated, to the      extent of its obligations, to all of the rights of its      personal protection insured with respect to an accident      caused in whole or in part, as determined by applicable State      law, by the negligence of an uninsured motorist or driving      under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs, or caused in      whole or in part by intentional misconduct or any person who      is not affected by the limitations on tort rights and      liabilities under this Act.       (10) Any person lawfully uninsured under the terms of State      law for either personal protection or tort liability      insurance retains his or her tort rights in a form unaffected      by this Act.       (c) Renewal or Cancellation.--An insurer shall not cancel,      fail to renew, or increase the premium of its insured solely      on account of the insured or any other injured person making      a claim for personal protection benefits or, where there is      no basis for ascribing fault to the insured or one for whom      the insured is vicariously liable, for tort maintenance      coverage.       (d) Immunity.--No insurer or any agent or employee of such      insurer, no insurance producer representing a motor vehicle      insurer or any automobile residual market plan, and no      attorney licensed to practice law within this State shall be      liable in an action for damages on account of an election of      the tort liability option, an election of the personal      protection option, or a failure to make a required election,      unless such person has willfully misrepresented the available      choices or has fraudulently induced the election of one      system over the other.       (e) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this Act shall be      construed--       (1) to waive or affect any defense of sovereign immunity      asserted by any State under any law or by the United States;       (2) to preempt State choice-of-law rules with respect to      claims brought by a foreign nation or a citizen of a foreign      nation;       (3) to affect the right of any court to transfer venue, to      apply the law of a foreign nation, or to dismiss a claim of a      foreign nation or of a citizen of a foreign nation on the      ground of inconvenient forum;       (4) subject to paragraph (1), to create or vest      jurisdiction in the district courts of the United States over      any motor vehicle accident liability or damages action      subject to this Act which is not otherwise properly in the      United States District Court;       (5) to prevent insurers and insureds from contracting to      limit recovery for lost wages and income under personal      protection coverage such that only 60 percent or more of lost      wages or income is covered, or to offset death benefits under      personal protection coverage by amounts paid for lost wages      and replacement service losses;       (6) to prevent an insurer from contracting with personal      protection insureds, as permitted by State law, to have      submitted to arbitration any dispute with respect to payment      of personal protection benefits;       (7) to relieve a motorist of the obligations imposed by      State law to purchase tort liability insurance for personal      injury to protect third parties who are not affected by the      immunities of subsection (b); and       (8) to preclude a State from enacting, for all motor      vehicle accident cases including cases covered by this Act, a      minimum dollar value for defined classes of cases involving      death or serious bodily injury.     SEC. 6. APPLICABILITY TO STATES; CHOICE OF LAW; JURISDICTION;                    AND CONSTRUCTION.       (a) Election of Nonapplicability by States.--This Act shall      not apply in a State if such State enacts a statute that--       (1) cites the authority of this subsection; and       (2) declares the election of such State that this Act shall      not apply.

Effective date.     SEC. 3. FINDINGS.       The Congress finds that--       (1) the current liability system is, all too often, a      frustrating experience for many personal injury claimants,      resulting in a time-consuming process which provides      inadequate compensation for their injuries;       (2) for other personal injury claimants, the system can      provide a windfall of financial gain, greatly in excess of      their actual losses;       (3) the unpredictable and erratic system is a product of a      perverse incentive structure in which the magnitude of      noneconomic damages is directly linked to, and is a multiple      of, the out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the claimant;       (4) the incentives of the litigation system perpetuate the      overuse and abuse of the medical system, costing the economy      billions of dollars and costing every United States family      hundreds of dollars in unnecessary insurance premiums and      health care expenses;       (5) the system as it has recently developed--       (A) is highly regressive;       (B) is often duplicative of and inconsistent with Federal      regulatory and social welfare programs for the protection of      injured parties;       (C) is burdened by an administrative cost structure that      causes a disproportionate amount of its dollars to go to      lawyers rather than to injured parties;       (D) is particularly prejudicial to the competitive position      of the American small business community;       (E) is a major and increasing threat to the economic      viability of American cities;       (F) imposes a major burden on the American economy and if      reformed would significantly enhance American productivity      and consumer wealth;       (G) is replete with incentives that reward abusive claiming      and defensive behavior; and       (H) is therefore a major cause of the dangerous disesteem      increasingly felt by increasing numbers of Americans toward      the legal system and, indeed, the rule of law itself; and       (6) there is a need for a system of early offer, rapid      recovery and consumer choice to enable claimants to be made      whole and recover all economic losses without resort to      complex and protracted litigation.                TITLE I--EARLY OFFER AND RAPID RECOVERY     SEC. 101. EARLY OFFER AND RAPID RECOVERY MECHANISMS.

In any      subsequent proceeding in the action, no evidence shall be      admitted as to the amount of economic loss for which      collateral benefits have been paid to, or will be paid to,      the claimant. The claimant may recover for noneconomic loss      to the extent authorized by other applicable law only if the      claimant proves each element of the claim for noneconomic      loss by clear and convincing evidence, that the allegedly      responsible party caused the injury by intentional or wanton      misconduct.       ``(2) A notice of such a rejection is required to be made      not later than 90 days after the date on which the offer of      compensation benefits is made.

(c) Technical and Conforming Amendments.--The table of      sections for chapter 111 of title 28, United States Code, is      amended by adding at the end the following new item:``1660. Early offer and rapid recovery mechanisms.''.                    TITLE II--FAIRNESS IN LEGAL FEES     SEC. 201. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that contingency fees      play a useful and often critical role in ensuring access to      counsel and the courts on the part of those who would      otherwise be unable to afford such access, but that--       (1) personal injury claimants are often subjected to      unnecessary costs, delays, and inefficiencies in processing      their compensation claims;       (2) virtually all such claimants who are represented by      attorneys are charged contingent fees;       (3) the ethical and legal validity of a contingent fee is      dependent upon an attorney undertaking risk in exchange for      sharing proportionately in the proceeds of a claim;       (4) the perverse incentives of the existing system often      encourage and reward defendants who take intransigent      settlement positions and otherwise unethically add to the      costs and delays of settling meritorious claims for, among      other reasons, the purpose of reducing the marginal rates of      compensation received by claimants' counsel;       (5) many deserving claimants receive inequitable      compensation because--       (A) such claimants are required to pay attorneys      approximately one-third or more of any recovery even when      there is little or no issue of liability or damages and      therefore little or no assumption of risk by the attorney;      and       (B) when a defendant or its insurer has made a substantial      settlement offer before the attorney's retention or shortly      thereafter and the attorney has added little or nothing to      the value of the claim to that point, payment of a      substantial contingent fee is nonetheless generally required;       (6) the current compensation system often fails to provide      sufficient financial incentives to effectuate prompt and      adequate compensation to deserving claimants, resulting in--       (A) delays in adjudications and case settlements often      caused by intransigent defendant conduct that the present      system perversely rewards and thereby deprives claimants of      prompt compensation;       (B) a substantial burden on Federal and State courts      contributing to very high case backlogs; and       (C) regressive cost burdens and substantial avoidable costs      imposed on all parties resulting from the long delays in      resolving many claims;       (7) the current tort compensation system which results in      delays in resolving claims and which effectively provides for      increased noneconomic damages and, therefore, increased legal      fees as medical care costs increase, provides perverse      financial incentives for both more intensive and unnecessary      use of medical care providers and the fraudulent incurrence      of medical care expenses, thereby adding materially to the      Nation's health care costs and burdens;       (8) delays in resolving claims often result in more      intensive and unnecessary use of medical care providers,      thereby adding to the Nation's health care burden;       (9) the claims process gives rise to substantial, avoidable      transaction costs because of the lack of adequate incentives      for defendants and their insurers to offer prompt and      equitable settlements to meritorious claimants and because      claimants' attorneys exact a significant share of any      settlement even when their efforts do not generate or augment      the settlement offer;       (10) contingency fee practices, as described in the      preceding paragraphs, expose a clear and impermissible gap      between (A) the ethical standards established and promulgated      by courts and professed by the Bar, and (B) the actual      practices of the Bar;       (11) contingency fee practices, as described in the      preceding paragraphs, bring substantial disrepute to the Bar      and to the legal system as a whole and loss of confidence in      the rule of law itself, not the least because they create and      expose broad gaps between the stated ethical principles of      the legal profession and its real world practices;       (12) the inability of the Bar and the courts to curb      contingency fee abuses has led to higher settlement costs,      lowered compensation to injured persons, excessive medical      care costs and delayed claims processing; and       (13) there is a need for adopting a procedure to implement      appropriate ethical and legal standards and to resolve      personal injury claims more fairly and promptly.       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are to--       (1) enforce more efficiently and effectively ethical      standards governing the reasonableness of lawyers' fees and      correspondingly to implement the stricter scrutiny that      courts are obliged to apply to contingent fees;       (2) reverse systemic incentives now in effect so as to      reward, and not to penalize, defendants who make substantial      early settlement offers;       (3) compensate claimants' attorneys more rationally by      calculating their compensation in relation to the value of      services rendered and risks undertaken;       (4) compensate more fairly those seeking redress for      injuries by giving them a larger share of promptly achieved      settlements;       (5) further enhance the likelihood of early settlement of      claims by preserving a larger share of early settlement      offers for claimants;       (6) lower the costs of the personal injury tort      compensation system including unnecessary medical and defense      costs;       (7) remove the burdens on interstate commerce and the      Nation's health care programs that are imposed by the current      tort compensation system;       (8) create a simple, self-enforcing system, controlled by      the parties, which forms an early basis for establishing the      sums and issues that are in dispute;       (9) reduce unworkable burdens now placed on courts and bar      grievance boards presently charged with enforcing ethical      standards through ex post facto, case-by-case fact finding      processes that pose difficult burdens of proof and impose      disproportionate transaction costs on both parties and fact      finders; and       (10) provide alternatives to across-the-board fee cap      reforms, which often provide defendants with unearned      advantages and further encourage many defendants in unethical      protraction of settlement of meritorious claims.     SEC. 202. DEFINITIONS.       For purposes of this title:       (1) The term ``allegedly responsible party'' means a      person, partnership, corporation, and an insurer thereof,      alleged by a claimant to be responsible for at least some      portion of a personal injury alleged by claimant.       (2) The term ``claim'' means an assertion of entitlement to      compensation for personal injury from an allegedly      responsible party and, to the extent subject to a contingent      fee agreement, to all other related claims arising from such      injury.       (3) The term ``claimant'' means an individual who, in his      or her own right, or vicariously as otherwise permitted by      law, is seeking compensation for personal injury.       (4) The term ``contingent fee'' means the fee negotiated in      a contingent fee agreement that is payable in fact or in      effect only from the proceeds of any recovery on behalf of      claimant.       (5) The term ``contingent fee agreement'' means a fee      agreement between an attorney and claimant wherein the      attorney agrees to bear the risk of no or inadequate      compensation in exchange for a proportionate share of any      recovery by settlement or verdict obtained for claimant.       (6) The term ``contingent fee attorney'' means an attorney      who agrees to represent claimant in exchange for a contingent      fee.       (7) The term ``fixed fee'' means an agreement between an      attorney and claimant whereby the attorney agrees to perform      a specific legal task in exchange for a specified sum to be      paid by claimant.       (8) The term ``hourly rate fee'' means the fee generated by      an agreement, or otherwise by operation of law, between an      attorney and claimant providing that claimant pay the      attorney a fee determined by multiplying the hourly rate      negotiated, or otherwise set by law, between the attorney and      claimant, by the number of hours that the attorney has worked      on behalf of claimant in furtherance of claimant's interest.      An hourly rate fee may also be a contingent fee to the extent      it is only payable in fact or in effect from the proceeds of      any recovery on behalf of claimant.       (9) The term ``injury'' means personal injury.       (10) The term ``personal injury'' means an occurrence      resulting from any act giving rise to a tort claim,      including, without limitation, bodily injury, sickness,      disease, death, or property damage accompanying bodily      injury.       (11) The term ``post-retention offer'' means an offer of      settlement in response to a demand for compensation made      within the time constraints, and conforming to the provisions      of this title, made to a claimant who is represented by a      contingent fee attorney.       (12) The term ``pre-retention offer'' means an offer to      settle a claim for compensation made to a claimant not      represented by an attorney at the time of the offer.       (13) The term ``response'' means a written communication by      claimant or an allegedly responsible party or the attorney      for either, deposited into the United States mail and sent      certified mail or delivered by an overnight delivery service.       (14) The term ``settlement offer'' means a written offer of      settlement set forth in a response within the time limits set      forth in this title.     SEC. 203. CREATION OF A FIDUCIARY RELATIONSHIP.       For purposes of this title, a fiduciary relationship      commences when a claimant consults a contingent fee attorney      to seek professional services.     SEC. 204. WRITTEN HOURLY RATE FEE AGREEMENT.       Contingent fee agreements for the representation of parties      with claims shall also include alternate hourly rate fees. If      a contingent fee attorney has not entered into a written      agreement with claimant at the time of retention setting      forth the attorney's hourly rate, then a reasonable hourly      rate is payable, subject to the limitations set forth in this      title.     SEC. 205. NATURE OF DEMAND FOR COMPENSATION.       (a) In General.--At any time after retention, a contingent      fee attorney pursuing a claim shall send a demand for      compensation by certified mail to an allegedly responsible      party, which shall set forth the material facts relevant to      the claim including--       (1) the name, address, age, marital status, and occupation      of claimant, which term for the purposes of this title      includes the injured party if claimant is operating in a      representative capacity;       (2) a brief description of how the injury occurred;       (3) the names, and, if known, the addresses, telephone      numbers, and occupations of all known witnesses to the      injury;       (4) copies of photographs in claimant's possession that      relate to the injury;       (5) the basis for claiming that the party to whom the claim      is addressed is at least partially responsible for causing      the injury;       (6) a description of the nature of the injury, the names      and addresses of all physicians, other health care providers,      and hospitals, clinics, or other medical service entities      that provide medical care to claimant or the injured party      including the date and nature of the service;       (7) medical records relating to the injury and those      involving a prior injury or pre-existing medical condition      which an allegedly responsible party would be able to      introduce into evidence in a trial or, in lieu of either or      both, executed releases authorizing the allegedly responsible      party to obtain such records directly from health care      providers that produced or possess them; and       (8) relevant documentation, including records of earnings      if a claimant is self-employed and employer records of      earnings if a claimant is employed, or any medical expenses,      wages lost, or other pertinent damages suffered as a      consequence of the injury.       (b) Mailing of Copies.--At the time of the mailing of the      demand for compensation, a claimant's attorney shall mail      copies of each such demand to the claimant and to every other      allegedly responsible party.       (c) Limitation on Fee.--A fee received by or contracted for      by a contingent fee attorney that exceeds 10 percent of any      settlement or judgment received by his or her client after      reasonable expenses have been deducted is unreasonable and      excessive if the attorney has sent a timely demand for      compensation but has omitted information of a material nature      that is required by this section which he or she had in his      or her possession or which was readily available to him or      her at the time of filing.     SEC. 206. TIME LIMIT FOR, AND REQUISITE CONTENTS OF, RESPONSE                    SETTING FORTH SETTLEMENT OFFER.       (a) Post-Retention Offer.--To qualify its response as a      post-retention offer under this title, an allegedly      responsible party shall--       (1) issue a response stating a settlement offer within 60      days from receipt of a demand for compensation;       (2) send the response to claimant's attorney with a copy to      claimant;       (3) state that the offer is open for acceptance for a      minimum of 30 days from the time of its receipt by claimant's      attorney and further state whether it expires at the end of      this period or remains open for acceptance for a longer      period or until notice of withdrawal is given; and       (4) include with the offer copies of materials in its or      its attorney's possession concerning the alleged injury upon      which the allegedly responsible party relied in making the      settlement offer except material that such party or its      attorney believes in good faith would not be discoverable by      claimant during the course of litigation.     If reproduction costs under paragraph (4) would be      significant relative to the size of the offer, the allegedly      responsible party may, in the alternative, offer other forms      of access to the materials convenient and at reasonable cost      to claimant's attorney.       (b) Time Limitations.--If within 30 days of receipt of a      claimant's demand for compensation an allegedly responsible      party notifies an unrepresented claimant or a claimant's      attorney that it seeks to have a medical examination of      claimant, and claimant is not made available for such      examination within 10 days of receipt of the request, the      time herein provided for issuing a response is extended by 1      day for each day that the request is not honored after the      expiration of 10 days from the date of the request. Any such      extension also includes a further period of 10 days from the      date of the completion of the medical examination.       (c) Increase in Offer.--The settlement offer may be      increased during the 60-day period set forth in subsection      (a)(1) by issuing an additional offer stating that the time      for acceptance is 10 days after receipt of the additional      offer by claimant's attorney or 30 days from receipt of the      initial response, whichever is longer, unless the additional      response specifies a longer period of time for acceptance as      set forth in subsection (a)(3).     SEC. 207. CONSEQUENCES OF FAILURE TO INCLUDE PRESCRIBED                    MATERIAL WITH SETTLEMENT OFFER.       (a) In General.--If an allegedly responsible party or its      attorney willfully fails to include the material required by      section 206(a)(4) with a response stating a settlement offer      or does not otherwise make such material available--       (1) a claimant may revoke its acceptance of such settlement      offer within 2 years of having accepted it; and       (2) any fees and costs reasonably incurred by a claimant in      revoking its acceptance of such settlement offer and      reinstating its claim is recoverable from the allegedly      responsible party, including the losses suffered by a      claimant who is precluded from reinstating its claim by      operation of a statute of limitations.       (b) Sanctions for Party.--Willful failure of an allegedly      responsible party to comply with section 206(a)(4) shall      subject such party to the sanctions applicable to a party who      fails to comply with requests for the production of      documents.       (c) Sanctions for Attorney.--Willful failure of an attorney      for an allegedly responsible party to comply with section      206(a)(4) shall subject that attorney to the same sanctions      applicable to attorneys who improperly counsel their clients      not to produce documents for which there has been a discovery      request.     SEC. 208. NO OBLIGATION TO ISSUE RESPONSE; INADMISSIBILITY OF                    DEMANDS, RESPONSES, AND FAILURE TO RESPOND.       (a) No Obligation To Respond.--Nothing in this title      imposes on an allegedly responsible party an obligation to      issue a response to a demand for compensation.       (b) Inadmissibility of Offer.--Demands for compensation,      early settlement offers, or the failure of an allegedly      responsible party to issue same, are inadmissible in any      subsequent litigation, proceeding, or arbitration, to the      extent that evidence of settlement negotiations is      inadmissible in the jurisdiction where the case is brought.     SEC. 209. EFFECT OF PRE-DEMAND SETTLEMENT OFFER.       A settlement offer to an injured party represented by a      contingent fee counsel made before receipt of a demand for      compensation, which is open for acceptance for 60 days or      more from the time of its receipt and which conforms to the      requirements of section 206, is deemed a post-retention offer      and has the same effect under this title as if it were a      response to a demand for compensation.     SEC. 210. PRE-RETENTION OFFER.       (a) Prohibition of Percentage Fee of Pre-Retention Offer.--     It is a violation of this title for an attorney retained      after claimant has received a pre-retention offer to enter      into an agreement with claimant to receive a contingent fee      based upon or payable from the proceeds of the pre-retention      offer, provided that the pre-retention offer remains in      effect or is renewed until the time has elapsed for issuing a      response containing a settlement offer as defined under      section 206.       (b) Unreasonable and Excessive Fee.--An attorney entering      into a fee agreement that would effectively result in payment      of a percentage of a pre-retention offer to a claimant has      charged an unreasonable and excessive fee.       (c) Presumptive Reasonable Fee.--An attorney who contracts      with a claimant for a reasonable hourly rate or a reasonable      fixed fee, or who is paid such a fee for advising claimant      regarding the fairness of the pre-retention offer, has      charged a presumptively reasonable fee.     SEC. 211. POST-RETENTION OFFER WHEN A PRE-RETENTION OFFER HAS                    BEEN MADE.       (a) Reasonable Fee Based on Hourly Fee.--A fee paid or      contracted to be paid to a contingent fee attorney by a      claimant who has rejected a pre-retention offer and who later      accepts a post-retention offer of a greater amount is an      unreasonable and excessive fee unless it is an hourly rate      fee that does not exceed 25 percent of the excess of the      post-retention offer over the pre-retention offer.       (b) Reasonable Fee Based on Percentage.--If the accepted      post-retention offer is less than the pre-retention offer, a      total fee for all services rendered that is greater than 10      percent of the first $100,000 of the post-retention offer      plus 5 percent of any amount that exceeds $100,000 after all      reasonable expenses have been deducted is an unreasonable and      excessive fee.     SEC. 212. POST-RETENTION OFFER WHEN NO PRE-RETENTION OFFER                    HAS BEEN MADE.       A fee paid or contracted to be paid to a contingent fee      attorney by a claimant who has not received a pre-retention      offer and who has accepted a post-retention offer is an      unreasonable and excessive fee unless it is an hourly rate      fee that does not exceed 10 percent of the first $100,000 of      the offer plus 5 percent of any amount that exceeds $100,000      after all reasonable expenses have been deducted.     SEC. 213. CALCULATION OF ATTORNEY'S FEE WHEN THERE IS A                    SUBSEQUENT RESOLUTION OF THE CLAIM.       Irrespective of any pre-retention offer, the provisions of      section 212 regarding maximum allowable fees remain in effect      if a post-retention offer is not accepted by claimant within      the time provided by this title. Contingent fees are      unreasonable and excessive unless charged against the      difference between an unaccepted post-retention offer and the      judgment or settlement ultimately obtained by claimant. When      such judgment or settlement is lower than the unaccepted      offer, the fee limitations of section 212 apply against the      judgment or settlement.     SEC. 214. PROVISION OF CLOSING STATEMENT.       Upon receipt of any settlement or judgment, and prior to      disbursement thereof, a contingent fee attorney shall provide      claimant with a written statement detailing how the proceeds      are to be distributed, including the amount of the expenses      paid out or to be paid out of the proceeds, the amount of the      fee, how the fee amount is calculated, and the amount due      claimant.     SEC. 215. EFFECT OF CONTRAVENING AGREEMENTS.       (a) Violation.--A contingent fee attorney who charges a fee      that contravenes this title has charged an unreasonable and      excessive fee.       (b) Excessive and Unreasonable Fees.--If the fee violates      subsection (a), then it is also excessive and unreasonable to      the extent that it has not been reduced by any reasonable      fees and costs incurred by claimant in establishing that the      fee agreement contravened this title.       (c) Unenforceable Fee Agreements.--Fee agreements between      claimants and contingent fee attorneys who have charged fees      defined under this title as unreasonable or excessive are      illegal and unenforceable except to the extent provided in      this title.     SEC. 216. INAPPLICABILITY.       (a) Evaluations and Collections.--Except for the provisions      of section 203, nothing in     this title applies to an agreement between a claimant and an      attorney to retain the attorney--       (1) on an hourly rate fee or fixed fee basis solely to      evaluate a pre-retention offer; or       (2) to collect overdue amounts from an accepted pre-     retention or post-retention settlement offer.       (b) Agreements in Which Certain Offers Not Made.--The      provisions of this title prohibiting the charging of      contingency fees in the absence of assuming meaningful risk      and defining reasonable and unreasonable fees, shall have no      effect on contingent fee agreements in cases in which neither      a pre-retention nor a post-retention offer of settlement is      made.       (c) Motor Vehicle Accidental Bodily Injury.--(1) This title      shall not apply to accidental bodily injury caused by the      operation or the use of a motor vehicle in claims in which an      uninsured motorist or personal protection insured is      involved.       (2) For purposes of this subsection the term ``operation or      use''--       (A) means operation or use of a motor vehicle as a motor      vehicle, including, incident to its operation or use as a      vehicle, the occupation of the vehicle;       (B) does not cover conduct within the course of a business      of manufacturing, selling, or maintaining a motor vehicle,      including repairing, servicing, washing, loading, or      unloading; and       (C) does not include such conduct not within the course of      such a business unless such conduct occurs while occupying a      motor vehicle.           TITLE III--APPLICABILITY AND RULE OF CONSTRUCTION     SEC. 301. APPLICABILITY TO STATES; CHOICE OF LAW;                    JURISDICTION; AND CONSTRUCTION.       (a) Applicability to States.--Title I or II of this Act      shall not apply in a State if such State enacts a statute      that--       (1) cites the authority of this subsection; and       (2) declares the election of such State that the title      shall not apply.       (b) Choice of Law.--In disputes between citizens of States      that elect nonapplicability under subsection (a) and citizens      of States that do not so elect, ordinary choice of law      principles shall apply.       (c) Jurisdiction.--This section shall not confer      jurisdiction on the district courts of the United States      under section 1331 or 1337 or title 28, United States Code.       (d) Construction.--Nothing in this Act shall alter or      diminish the authority or obligation of the Federal courts to      construe the terms of this Act.     SEC. 302. EFFECTIVE DATE.       This Act shall take effect on the date of enactment of this      Act.                                                                    ____            Summary of Dole-McConnell Legal Reform Proposals                    1. ``Choice'' in Auto Insurance       The principal feature of this proposal is the unbundling of      economic losses and non-economic (``pain & suffering'')      losses and enabling individuals to self-insure for non-     economic losses.       Without changing substantive state law of negligence, the      proposal would offer drivers two choices for motor vehicle      insurance:       a. Traditional tort coverage--the injured collects against      his/her own policy for economic and non-economic losses, upon      a showing that another party was at fault, pursuant to      relevant state law. If the injured's economic losses exceed      his/her policy limits, the injured will be able to sue the      negligent party for those remaining losses and to collect a      reasonable attorney's fee; or       b. Personal Injury Protection--the injured collects against      his/her policy for economic losses, regardless of fault. As      in the traditional tort coverage, if the injured's economic      loses exceed his/her policy limits, the injured will be able      to sue the negligent party for remaining economic losses,      including a reasonable attorney's fee.       In all cases of intentional injury or injury that occurs as      a result of drug or alcohol use, the injured retains the      ability to sue for both economic and non-economic losses in      accordance with applicable state law.       The Joint Economic Committee estimates that this proposal      will save consumers $40 billion annually in reduced premiums      for automobile insurance.                        2. Contingent Fee Reform       This provision limits traditional contingent fee      arrangements in order to ensure that more of the proceeds of      a settlement or award will more often go to the insured      party.       First, an attorney would be required to offer all clients      an hourly rate and an hourly rate is presumed, if the      attorney does not have a specific contingent fee agreement.       Where an injured party hires a lawyer to evaluate a      settlement offer (pre-retention offer), the attorney is      prohibited from receiving a percentage of the offer. The      attorney may collect an hourly fee or a fixed fee.       In a case where an injured party retains a lawyer to engage      in settlement negotiations on his behalf, and the injured      party accepts a settlement offer, the lawyer is restricted to      a fee of 10% of the first $100,000 and 5% of amounts above      $10,000, after all reasonable expenses have been deducted.       If the settlement offer is not accepted and the case goes      to trial, the lawyer may take a contingent only out of that      portion of the award which exceeds the settlement offer. If      the judgment is lower than the settlement offer, then the      lawyer's fee is limited to the 10%/5% formula above.                     3. early offer/rapid recovery       This provision, originally sponsored a decade ago by      Congressmen Richard Gephardt and Henson Moore, will encourage      an injured individual to receive an offer of full      compensation for economic losses, including future losses,      without a lawsuit. In order to encourage this offer, an      injured individual will be required, in making a claim      against the allegedly responsible party, to provide all      relevant information, including medical records. The      allegedly responsible party will have 120 days to provide      such economic compensation (the time may be extended by the      claimant), and the allegedly responsible party can verify the      information, including requesting the injured to get a      medical examination.       The claimant retains the right to reject such early offer      and may sue to recover all losses. However, noneconomic      losses, including any punitive damages may only be recovered      if the injured party proves, by clear and convincing      evidence, that the injury was caused intentionally or by      wanton misconduct.       In the event of more than one responsible party, relative      fault and proportionate contribution will be assessed by an      arbitrator.       And, the states can establish a minimum payment for serious      bodily injury (for example, a loss of a limb which may not      result in significant economic losses) that will have to be      paid to the injured party under early offer.       To satisfy the federalism concerns raised by some, the bill      will allow states to ``opt out'' of any of these      provisions.                                 ______      By
