 I will withhold it for the moment to see how many speakers there are on the other side. Suffice it to say, that taxpayer funding of elections is about as unpopular as voting to raise congressional pay.  We have the most complete poll ever taken on any subject, every April 15, when taxpayers get an opportunity to check off on their tax return the diversion of $3 to the Presidential campaigns and to help subsidize the conventions. It doesn't add to their tax bill. It is just diverting $3 of their tax money to politics.
