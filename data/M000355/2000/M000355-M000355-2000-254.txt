 So I prefer to look at the bright side of this, I say to the Senators. It makes progress. We are moving in the right direction and, hopefully, tomorrow there will be even fewer than 38 votes. I think we are heading in the right direction. We have some time remaining. I don't know whether the Senator from Utah would like to speak further. I would be happy to give him the remainder of the time. It is my understanding there are 2 hours equally divided in the morning?  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The Senator is correct in that assumption.  Mr. McCONNELL. It is not yet determined when that would begin, is it?
