President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Illinois. His dramatic showing of the difference between the pro se appeals that many courts handle and the complexity of the administrative issues that the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals handles is very instructive for us. Everybody talks about caseloads. Somecases are handled in a matter of minutes. Others take months. They each count for one case. He has demonstrated that in the District of Columbia circuit, because of its unique nature, many of them count for a month.  Mr. President, I withhold the remainder of my time.
