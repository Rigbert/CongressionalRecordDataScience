Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend and colleague for yielding me this time.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to two American heroes, Officer Jacob ``J.J.'' Chestnut, and Special Agent John Gibson. Mr. Speaker, this is a very sad day, for these two men, members of the Capitol Hill Police Force, gave their lives last Friday in defense of this, the people's House. They are heroes. They are patriots. They put their bodies on the line. They are the victims of a senseless act of violence. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families of these two brave officers, and to all of the members of the Capitol Hill police family.  These young men and women who provide security for the Capitol, for the people's House, are like members of our own family. They are part of the Capitol Hill family. When we are here in session, we see them every day, sometimes many times a day. We mourn with the members of the Capitol Hill Police Force.  The men and women of the Capitol Hill Police Force put their lives on the line every day just as police officers in so many other cities and communities all across America. Today, Mr. Speaker, we pay tribute, we pay honor, to Officers Chestnut and Gibson, but we also say a prayer and give thanks for the safety of people serving in uniform everywhere.  Mr. Speaker, God bless John Gibson and Jacob Chestnut. We are forever in their debt. They will never, ever be forgotten.
