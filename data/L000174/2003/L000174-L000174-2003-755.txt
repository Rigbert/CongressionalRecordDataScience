I have a short note from Chairman McConnell,  also indicating his support for this project, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                                Washington, DC, February 13, 2003.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     U.S. Senator,     Washington, DC.       Dear Pat: Please know that I support additional funding to      the United States Telecommunications Training Institute      (USTTI)--at the Senate reported level of $1,000,000.       I would appreciate your conveying my support for this      funding level to our friend and colleague from Hawaii.       Thank you for your kind consideration.           Sincerely,                                                  Mitch McConnell,                                            United States Senator.                        Technical Clarification
