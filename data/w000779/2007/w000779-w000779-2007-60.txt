President, on June 18, I announced my intention to object to any unanimous consent request for the Senate to take up the nomination of Dennis Schrader to be Deputy Administrator for National Preparedness in the Department of Homeland Security. I did so because, prior to his confirmation as Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Michael Chertoff told me in my office that if confirmed, he would move expeditiously to implement the National Emergency Technology Guard--NET Guard program. Unfortunately, Secretary Chertoff had failed to honor that pledge.  Today, I received a letter from Secretary Chertoff describing how the Department is moving forward with 12-month NET Guard pilots beginning in September 2007, and how the DHS will be requesting funds to continue the program in its 2009 budget request to the Office of Management and Budget.  The Secretary also communicated to me that the Department of Homeland Security will be publicizing NET Guard and seeking involvement from the private sector, a step critical to the success of this vital program.  The Department has also set aside funds to run the pilots for the year and convened a working group of subject matter experts to guide the design of NET Guard. These activities and Secretary Chertoff's letter indicate that he is making a good-faith effort to get NET Guard off the ground.  In light of these actions, I will no longer object to any unanimous-consent request for the Senate to take up Mr. Schrader's nomination. I will, however, continue to closely monitor DHS's actions on NET Guard.  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of Secretary Chertoff's letter be printed in the Congressional Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                              Department of Homeland Security,                                   Washington, DC, August 1, 2007.     Hon. Ron Wyden,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Wyden: Thank you for taking time this morning      to discuss the Department of Homeland Security's plans for      the National Emergency Technology Guard (NET Guard) program.      Following my June 29, 2007 letter to you that outlined our      program approach, and as a prelude to our discussion, members      of the Department's NET Guard team briefed your staff on our      proposed plan. The positive feedback from your staff, coupled      with your positive feedback this morning and the positive      feedback that we have received from State, local, and private      sector stakeholders, gives us confidence that we are taking      the right approach to implementing this important disaster      response program.       Accordingly, the Department is moving forward with plans to      implement 12-month NET Guard pilots beginning in September      2007. The recommendation to establish pilots in September is      consistent with the NET Guard Scoping Initiative Report,      which I will provide to you upon its completion this month.      To fund our efforts in fiscal years 2007 and 2008, we will      continue to work with Congressional appropriators. I will      also submit a request to the White House Office of Management      and Budget to fund the NET Guard program in fiscal year 2009.      On these and other program matters, the Department's Office      of Legislative Affairs will keep your staff apprised of our      progress.       I appreciate your interest and support of the Department's      disaster response mission and look forward to working with      you on this and other issues.           Sincerely,     Michael Chertoff.                          ____________________
