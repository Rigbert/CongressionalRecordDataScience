 LOTT. I am aware that there have been some survey data. I am trying to remember what the numbers were. I believe--perhaps you will have them--in one instance it was 62 percent; in another it was 78 percent.  Mr. McCONNELL. I think the 78 percent figure the majority leader refers to is the one that I saw; 78 percent of workers would like to have an opportunity, up front in advance, to make the decision on whether or not they contribute, in effect, to a political cause; fundamental American right. That is what the leader's amendment would have provided, not just for union members but employees of corporations who are not union members, and of course any shareholders who are aggrieved have the option to sell the shares, if they object to any political donation of a corporation. So I commend the majority leader.
