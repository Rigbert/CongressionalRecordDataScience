 In the State of Maryland, few judges commanded more respect than Judge Loveless. First appointed to the 7th Judicial Circuit in 1960, Judge Loveless rose to the position of Chief judge in 1976. Serving on the bench until his retirement in 1992, Judge Loveless left behind a legacy of fair rulings and a more effective and efficient court.  During his 32 years on the 7th Circuit, Judge Loveless became known for his management skills. As the populations of Prince George's County and southern Maryland grew in the 1970s, Judge Loveless recognized the need to update the court's systems to better enable it to handle the increased caseload. He succeeded in installing new computer systems, and he made other necessary changes to help the 7th Circuit keep pace with the changing times.  Known across our State as an expert on juvenile law, Judge Loveless presided over thousands of adoption cases, even adopting two children of his own. He had the foresight to hire a resident psychologist to assist with family law matters, a valuable asset to the court and the cases it handles.  On a personal note, I believe it was clear to all who knew him that serving others was a deeply held value for Judge Loveless. Before becoming a judge, he served our Nation proudly in the Navy during World War II, and he then went on to serve the people of Maryland in the House of Delegates from 1954 to 1960. He was active in several civic organizations in Clinton, MD, and he continued to contribute to the community throughout his life.  Madam Speaker, Judge Loveless was a good and honest man who lived an honorable life, and he will long be remembered in southern Maryland and Prince George's County for his devotion, his knowledge of the law, and his fairness. I join countless Marylanders whose lives were touched by Judge Loveless in sending my deepest sympathies to his family and friends.                          ____________________
