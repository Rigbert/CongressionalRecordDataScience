 President, the Dole bill requires that income and resources of an immigrant sponsor be deemed as available to the immigrant when determining eligibility for all federally funded, means-tested programs. This is the case, whether or not the immigrant is a United States citizen. In other words, it creates two classes of citizens. A naturalized citizen, under the Dole bill, could not be eligible for any form of assistance. I believe this is unprecedented and, as I said, creates two classes of American citizens, which will surely be challenged in the courts on constitutional grounds.  So I rise today to offer an amendment to this bill to provide equal treatment for naturalized and native-born U.S. citizens. This amendment is cosponsored by Senators Kohl and Simon. It is supported by the National Governors Association, the National Conference of State Legislatures, the National Association of Counties, the National League of Cities, the United States Catholic Conference, and the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, as well as several other organizations.  The amendment simply removes any reference to citizens in all places in the underlying bill that require deeming, and leaves in place the deeming requirements for benefits to legal aliens.  I think the question before the Senate is this: Does the Constitution of the United States of America provide for two distinct classes of United States citizens--those who are naturalized and those who are native-born? I know of only one benefit which is denied by the Constitution to citizens of our country who were not born in this country, and that one thing is the Presidency of the United States. Article II, section 1 of the Constitution expressly states that ``no person, except a natural born citizen, or a citizen of the United States at the time of the adoption of the Constitution, shall be eligible to the office of President.'' That is where the line is drawn for me.  I do not believe that, absent a constitutional amendment, the Constitution gives this body the authority to deny outright any benefits, save that one, to naturalized citizens. Article I of the Constitution does contain one other distinction with regard to naturalized citizens and their qualifications to be Members of Congress. It says, ``No person shall be a representative who shall not have attained the age of 25 years and been 7 years a citizen of the United States.'' That is whether they are native-born or naturalized. It also says, ``No person shall be a Senator who shall not have attained the age of 30 years, and been 9 years a citizen of the United States.''  I do not believe our forefathers necessarily foresaw the specifics of the debate which is before us today. But I do believe they considered what distinctions should be made between naturalized and native-born citizens. And the result of that consideration is reflected in the Constitution.  The Department of Justice has expressed serious concerns about the constitutionality on the proscription of benefits as applied to naturalized citizens in this bill. In a letter to Senator Kennedy, dated July 18, a copy of which was also provided to me, Assistant Attorney General, Andrew Fois states:       The deeming provision, as applied to citizens, would      contravene the basic equal protection tenet that ``the rights      of citizenship of the native born and of the naturalized      person are of the same dignity and are coextensive.''  The letter goes on to say:       To the same effect, the provision might be viewed as a      classification based on national origin; among citizens      otherwise eligible for government assistance, the class      excluded by operation of the deeming provision is limited to      those born outside the United States. A classification based      on national origin, of course, is subject to strict scrutiny      under equal protection review, and it is unlikely that the      deeming provision could be justified under this standard.  At this time, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the letter from the Justice Department be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                       U.S. Department of Justice,                                Office of Legislative Affairs,                                    Washington, DC, July 18, 1995.     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Kennedy: This letter follows your question to      Attorney General Janet Reno regarding the constitutionality      of the deeming provisions in pending immigration legislation      at the Senate Judiciary Committee's oversight hearing on June      27.       You have asked for our views regarding the ``deeming''      provisions of section 204 of S. 269, Senator Simpson's      proposed immigration legislation. Our comment here is limited      to the question raised by application of section 204 to      naturalized citizens.       We have serious concerns about section 204's      constitutionality as applied to naturalized citizens. So      applied, the deeming provision would operate to deny, or      reduce eligibility for, a variety of benefits including      student financial assistance and welfare benefits to certain      United States citizens because they were born outside the      country. This appears to be an unprecedented result. Current      federal deeming provisions under various benefits programs      operate only as against aliens (see, e.g., 42 U.S.C. Sec. 615      (AFDC); 7 U.S.C. 2014(i) (Food Stamps)) and we are not aware      of any comparable restrictions on citizen eligibility for      federal assistance. As a matter of policy, we think it would      be a mistake to begin now to relegate naturalized citizens--     who have demonstrated their commitment to our country by      undergoing the naturalization process--to a kind of second-     class status.       The provision might be defended legally on the grounds that      it is an exercise of Congress' plenary authority to regulate      immigration and naturalization, or, more specifically, to set      the terms under which persons may enter the United States and      become citizens. See Mathews v. Diaz, 426 U.S. 67 (1976);      Toll v. Moreno, 458 U.S. 1, 10-11 (1982). We are not      convinced that this defense would prove persuasive. Though      Congress undoubtedly has power to impose conditions precedent      on entry and naturalization, the provision at issue here      would function as a condition subsequent, applying to      entrants even after they become citizens. It is not at all      clear that Congress' immigration and naturalization power      extends this far.       While the rights of citizenship of the native born derive      from Sec. 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment and the rights of the      naturalized citizen derive from satisfying, free of fraud,      the requirements set by Congress, the latter, apart from the      exception noted [constitutional eligibility for President],      becomes a member of the society, possessing all the rights of      a native citizen, and standing, in the view of the      constitution, on the footing of a native. The constitution      does not authorize Congress to enlarge or abridge those      rights. The simple power of the national Legislature, is to      prescribe a uniform rule of naturalization, and the exercise      of this power exhausts it, so far as respects the individual.       Schneider v. Rusk, 377 U.S. 163, 166 (1964) (internal      quotations omitted) (statutory restriction on length foreign      residence applied to naturalized but not native born citizens      violates Fifth Amendment equal protection component).       Alternatively, it might be argued in defense of the      provision that it classifies not by reference to citizenship      at all, but rather on the basis of sponsorship; only those      naturalized citizens with sponsors will be affected. Again,      we have doubts about whether this characterization of the      provision would be accepted. State courts have rejected an      analogous position with respect to state deeming provisions,      finding that the provisions constitute impermissible      discrimination based on alienage despite the fact that they      reach only sponsored aliens. See Barannikov v. Town of      Greenwich, 643 A.2d 251, 263-64 (Conn. 1994); El Souri v.      Dep't of Social Services, 414 N.W.2d 679, 682-83 (Mich.      1987). Because the deeming provision in question here, as      applied to citizens, is directed at and reaches only      naturalized citizens, the same reasoning would compel the      conclusion that it constitutes discrimination against      naturalized citizens. Cf. Nyquist v. Mauclet, 432 U.S. 1, 9      (1977) (``The important points are that [the law] is directed      at aliens and that only aliens are harmed by it. The fact      that the statute is not an absolute bar does not mean that it      does not discriminate against the class.'') (invalidating      state law denying some, but not all, resident aliens      financial assistance for higher education).       So understood, the deeming provision, as applied to      citizens, would contravene the basic equal protection tenet      that ``the rights of citizenship of the native born and of      the naturalized person are of the same dignity and are      coextensive.'' Schneider, 377 U.S. at      165. To the same effect, the provisions might be viewed as a      classification based on national origin; among citizens      otherwise eligible for government assistance, the class      excluded by operation of the deeming provision is limited to      those born outside the United States. A classification based      on national origin, of course, is subject to strict scrutiny      under equal protection review, see Korematsu v. United      States, 323 U.S. 214 (1944), and it is unlikely that the      deeming provision could be justified under this standard. See      Barannikova, 643 A.2d at 265 (invalidating state deeming      provision under strict scrutiny); El Souri, 414 N.W.2d at 683      (same).       The Office of Management and Budget has advised that there      is no objection to the submission of this letter from the      standpoint of the Administration's program.           Sincerely,                                                      Andrew Fois,                                       Assistant Attorney General.
