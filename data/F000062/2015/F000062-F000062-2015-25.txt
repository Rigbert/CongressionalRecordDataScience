 It is something we ought to take a look at. I haven't reviewed the case law, I don't think ever on this specific point, and I would like an opportunity to do so. But what I really bristle to is the extreme rhetoric and throwing everybody into the same basket as somebody who is a violent criminal, because the immigrants whom I know in California by and large are not violent criminals. They are family people. They sustain the No. 1 agricultural industry in America. They work hard, they pay their taxes, they get in line for legalization, they are good citizens, and our economy is better for them, not worse. So I don't want to impugn everybody, which your broad, sweeping language, candidly, does.
