Speaker, I rise today along with my colleague Congresswoman Mary Bono, with a heavy heart to pay tribute to a fallen deputy sheriff from Sun City, California. Deputy Sheriff Eric Andrew Thach died Friday in the line of duty for his Riverside County community. We send our condolences and prayers to his family, neighbors and the community.  Eric Thach was 34 years of age and employed with the Riverside County Sheriff's Department for three years, since September 1996. He leaves behind his young wife, Evelyn, and daughter, Shana. He also leaves behind neighbors and a community that will miss his constant self-sacrifice, generosity and quiet demeanor. And, now those left behind must pull together to support and strengthen each other during the coming months and years as they heal.  ``Deputy Sheriff Eric Thach lived his life with strength and courage. He was a good man, taken from us too soon . . . He will live on in our memory and in the many respects paid to him by the community,'' stated Riverside County Sheriff Larry D. Smith.  Eric Thach's sacrifice will be further remembered as his name is engraved next to the names of three fellow officers, also felled in the line of duty. The marker sits outside the Riverside County Sheriff's Department as a reminder to us all of the selfless duty for law enforcement officers assume as they protect the people or Riverside County--a sacrifice that we often take for granted. As Madam de Stael once said, ``We understand death for the first time when he puts his hand upon the one whom we love.''  The National Law Enforcement Officer Memorial, though, says it the best, that ``it is not how these officers died that made them heroes, it is how they lived.'' Many of us can not truly understand the latent danger associated with the day to day routines of our law enforcement officers. They put themselves in the line of danger everyday as they stop a vehicle, respond to an incident or a suspicious circumstances--like Deputy Thach. The danger and violence they face day in and day out is very real and it is times like these--sadly--that make us stop and honor our law enforcement officers. We hope that they be given such honor, respect and thanks always--not only when life's fragile nature is revealed. Deputy Eric Thach lived his life with this constantly in the forefront and his memory can be best served by us all doing the same.  Mr. Speaker, we ask that you and our colleagues join us today to remember this fine deputy. On behalf of the residents of Riverside County, we extend our prayers and most heartfelt sympathy to his family and loved ones.                          ____________________
