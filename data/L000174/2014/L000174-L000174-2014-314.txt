President, the Record will indicate that I opened the Senate in my role as President pro tempore, and now the distinguished Senator from New Jersey is in the Chair.  I wish to respond to the distinguished senior Senator from Nevada and thank him for what he said.  I was in Montpelier, which is our capital, on Friday, and I spent some time with Governor Peter Shumlin, who did his State of the State message on this subject, as the distinguished Senator from Nevada has said. I talked to him about it. I will call him later this morning and tell him what the leader said. I am also going to wear my hat as chair of the Judiciary Committee and do a hearing on this issue.  Ours is a very special and very precious State, but I think it points out that every State in the Union can face this problem. While on the national news this morning, Governor Shumlin was great and focused the attention of this issue on many States.  I will close by saying to my dear friend from Nevada that I appreciate his comments. He knows how precious Vermont is to me and Governor Shumlin, and I will make sure the Governor knows what he said.  I yield the floor.
