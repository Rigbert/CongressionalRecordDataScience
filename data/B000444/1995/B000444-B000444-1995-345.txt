 I am attempting to modify the underlying bill.  Mr. President, I want to make clear. I may have done something inadvertently here.  I do not mean to modify, I am sending the amendment to the desk, the purpose of which is to amend the Hatch amendment. We need a vote on it. I am not seeking unanimous consent for that.
