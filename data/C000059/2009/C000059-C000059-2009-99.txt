 Specifically, H.R. 637, the South Orange County Recycled Water Enhancement Act, which I introduced on January 22, 2009, contains two earmarks as defined under House Rule XXI, clause 9. Both earmarks contained in H.R. 637 authorize appropriations for projects under Title XVI of Public Law 102-575, the Reclamation Wastewater and Groundwater Study and Facilities Act.  The first project authorized in H.R. 637 is an advanced water treatment plant facility and recycled water system located in the City of San Juan Capistrano. Located in Orange County, California, the City of San Juan Capistrano relies on imported water from the Sacramento/San Joaquin Bay-Delta and the Colorado River to meet much of its water needs. Recognizing the increasing need to provide local water for irrigation, large fields and other non-potable uses, the City plans to construct a water recycling project consisting of four reservoirs, one pump station, and 29 pipelines. The legislation authorizes $18.5 million of federal appropriations, which sunsets 10 years following the passage of the H.R. 637. The federal cost share shall not exceed 25 percent of the total project cost and no federal funds shall be used for project operation and maintenance.  The second project authorized in H.R. 637 will expand reclaimed water distribution, storage and treatment facilities in the City of San Clemente. The City of San Clemente also relies on imported water to meet some of its needs. In 1991, San Clemente completed construction of a water treatment and reclaimed water facility that produced 2.2 million gallons of reclaimed water per day. The plant could be expanded to produce over 4 million gallons per day. The project would also consist of a two million gallon storage reservoir, a pumping station, retrofit of an existing pumping station at the treatment facility, and pipelines. The legislation authorizes $5 million of federal appropriations, which sunsets 10 years following the passage of the H.R. 637. The federal cost share shall not exceed 25 percent of the total project cost and no federal funds shall be used for project operation and maintenance.  I certify that neither project has a direct and foreseeable effect on any of my financial interests, nor the financial interests of any member of my family. Consistent with the Republican Conference's policy on earmarks, I hereby certify that to the best of my knowledge this request (1) is not directed to an entity or program that will be named after a sitting Member of Congress; (2) is not intended to be used by an entity to secure funds for other entities unless the use of funding is consistent with the specified purpose of the earmark; and (3) meets or exceeds all statutory requirements for matching funds where applicable.                          ____________________
