I want to say that the debt limit extension will have--Mr. Leader, I want to give you the information--in my view, well over 180 votes on our side of the aisle if that is a clean debt limit so that America can pay its bills and default is not a risk. As the gentleman indicates, we don't want it to be.  The Speaker has indicated that it would be solved long before we would come to any deadline precipitating another crisis and undermining confidence.                              {time}  1230  I want to tell the gentleman, the majority leader, that I will assure him that if we get a clean debt limit extension on the floor, that Democrats will work with him and his party to pass that in a way that we have a significant majority for that bill.  Mr. Leader, I was encouraged to see last week at your retreat that the House Republicans put forward a set of principles for immigration reform and have now expressed a readiness to discuss how to fix our broken immigration system. I am sure you have seen the response from my side of the aisle, not only from the President, but myself and Leader Pelosi, has been positive. We see the steps that have been taken as positive steps. We do look forward to working together on these principles.  We were just somewhat disappointed, however, that one of your Members, Raul Labrador of Idaho, was quoted yesterday as saying there was:       Overwhelming support for the idea of doing nothing this      year. It is a mistake to have an internal battle this year      about immigration.  I would hope that Mr. Labrador's remarks do not lead us to a place where we will either not proceed or to pass immigration reform on this floor.  The majority leader has indicated in some of our colloquies that he believes the immigration system is broken. Again, we share that view, and I think almost all Members share the view that the immigration system is not working as intended. There have been four bills passed out of Judiciary and another out of Homeland Security. Homeland Security was essentially unanimous in terms of dealing with security. We have introduced, as the majority leader knows, H.R. 15, which is a compilation of the bipartisanly passed Senate provisions, dropping the border security provision and inserting the border security passed out of the Republican-led Homeland Security Committee, I think by unanimous vote, but maybe it was by voice vote.  I would hope that we could, therefore, move forward and that Mr. Labrador's observation that there was ``overwhelming support for the idea of doing nothing this year'' would not be the prevalent view. We will again be ready to discuss this, and I can tell you that the overwhelming majority of my party, as I think the gentleman knows, would vote for the Senate bill. We don't think that the Senate bill is perfect. We would like to see a House bill. We have introduced a House bill, and we would like to consider it on the floor.  I will close with this observation with reference to immigration. I am sure the gentleman read the comments of former Speaker Dennis Hastert:       The House will act in its own way, as it should; but it      should act soon. Immigration reform is necessary for our      economic recovery.  Again, this is former Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois. He goes on to say:       First, securing our borders, so we know who is entering our      country and for what purpose.  I think there is unanimous consensus that needs to be addressed.  He continues:       Second, a legalization of those folks who are already here.  Again, I think there is consensus on that.  He goes on to say we should provide them with:       A path to citizenship, much like any other immigrant would      have.  Apparently, there is not necessarily consensus on that, but we do have consensus on the first proposition. He goes on to say:       These two things being satisfied, I believe immigration      reform can move forward. It will make us economically      stronger. It is politically smart, and morally right.  That was quoted in Politico on February 2. Those are words of former Speaker Hastert. I would hope and I know the gentleman has been very constructive in his comments that we can move forward together in reaching some agreement so we can see comprehensive immigration legislation on the floor consistent with the principles of both parties, and we can come together and pass some legislation.  I yield to the gentleman as to the prospects of doing so.
