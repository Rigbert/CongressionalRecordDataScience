President, does that mean--it just boggles the mind--this goes way beyond the wildest dreams, for example, of J. Edgar Hoover. Does that mean, for example, if somebody in the press criticizes the chairman or if a constituent wrote in and criticized some action of the chairman or, let us say, that some Member of Congress dared to vote against a bill of the chairman, their staff could just go and grab all their tax returns and then just give it to anybody and have no penalty?  I realize this is not the old former Soviet Union, but this could possibly happen in America?
