 President, I would like to close on this note. When I chaired a hearing on tithing and bankruptcy before my subcommittee late last year, I heard from the pastor of Crystal Free Evangelical Church. This church is the one fighting right now in the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals to keep the bankruptcy court out of its church coffers. Pastor Goold testified in a very compelling way about the practical difficulties his church has faced because of the Bankruptcy Code. As Pastor Goold put it, when there's a conflict between the bankruptcy laws and the laws of God, we should change the bankruptcy laws because God's laws aren't going to change.  Whether someone believes in tithing or not, it's clear that many Americans feel that tithing is an act of worship, required by divine law. It's completely unacceptable to have the bankruptcy code undo an act of worship.                               Exhibit 1                                    University of Texas at Austin,                                                School of Law,                                          Austin, TX, May 6, 1998.     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,     Hart Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Grassley: The question has arisen whether S.      1244 and H.R. 2604 would protect unincorporated churches. The      answer is yes; unincorporated churches would be protected.       These bills protect organizations defined in Sec. 170(c)(2)      of the Internal Revenue Code, which includes any      ``corporation, trust, or community chest, fund, or      foundation'' organized and operated exclusively for      charitable, religious, or other listed purposes. The Internal      Revenue Code defines ``corporation'' to include an      ``association.'' 26 U.S.C. Sec. 7701(a)(3). An unincorporated      association may also be a ``fund.''       The language of Sec. 170(c)(2) dates to shortly after World      War I. Related sections drafted more recently use the word      ``organization,'' which more obviously includes      unincorporated associations. See, e.g., Sec. 170b and      Sec. Sec. 502-511. The implementing regulations under      Sec. 170 and Sec. 501(c)(3) also used the word      ``organization.'' 26 C.F.R. Sec. Sec. 1.170 and 1.501.      ``Organization'' does not appear to be a defined term. But      Treasury Regulations define ``articles of organization'' in      inclusive terms: ``The term articles of organization or      articles includes the trust instrument, the corporate      charter, the articles of association, or any other written      instrument by which an organization is created.'' 26 C.F.R.      Sec. 1.501(c)(3)(b)(2) (emphasis added) ``Articles of      association'' clearly seems designed to include      unincorporated associations.       The clearest statement from the Internal Revenue Service      appears to be Revenue Procedure 82-2 (attached), which sets      out certain rules for different categories of tax exempt      organizations. Section 3.04 provides a rule for      ``Unincorporated Nonprofit Associations.'' This Procedure      treats the question as utterly settled and noncontroversial.       Tax scholars agree that Sec. 170 includes unincorporated      associations. The conclusion appears to be so universally      accepted that there has been no litigation and no need to      elaborate the explanation. The leading treatise on tax-exempt      organizations states: ``An unincorporated association or      trust can qualify under this provision, presumably as a fund      or foundation or perhaps, as noted, as a corporation.'' Bruce      R. Hopkins, The Law of Tax-Exempt Organizations Sec. 4.1 at      52 (7th ed. 1997).       Borris Bittker of Yale and Lawrence Lokken of NYU says:      ``Since the term corporation includes associations and fund      or foundation as used in IRC Sec. 501(c)(3) is construed to      include trusts, the technical form in which a charitable      organization is clothed rarely results in disqualification.''      Boris I. Bittker & Lawrence Lokken, 4 Federal Taxation of      Income, Estates and Gifts para.100.1.2 at 100-6 (2d ed.      1989).       Closely related provisions of the Code expressly cover      churches. I.R.C. Sec. 170(b)(1) states special rules for a      subset of organizations defined in Sec. 170(c), including ``a      church, or a convention or association of churches.'' I.R.C.      Sec. 508(c)(1) provides that ``churches, their integrated      auxiliaries, and conventions or associations of churches'' do      not have to apply for tax exemption. These provisions plainly      contemplate that churches are covered; they also prevent the      accumulation of IRS decisions granting tax exempt status to      unincorporated churches. These churches are simply presumed      to be exempt.       There are tens of thousands of unincorporated churches in      America. I am not aware that any of these churches has ever      had difficulty with tax exemption or tax deductibility of      contributions because of their unincorporated status. I work      with many church lawyers and religious leaders, and none of      them has ever mentioned such a problem. There are no reported      cases indicating litigation over such a problem. If      unincorporated churches were having this problem, Congress      would have heard demands for constituent help or corrective      legislation.       The fact is that legitimate unincorporated churches that      otherwise qualify for tax deductibility under Sec. 170 and      for tax exemption under Sec. 501(c)(3) are not rendered      ineligible by their failure to incorporate. There is so      little doubt about that that neither Congress, the IRS, nor      the courts has ever had to expressly elaborate on the rule      that everyone knows. This is a question that can be safely      dealt with in legislative history affirming Congress's      understanding that unincorporated associations are included      in Sec. 170(c)(2) and Congress's intention that they be      protected by these bills.       I consulted informally with Deirdre Halloran, the expert on      tax exempt organizations at the United States Catholic      Conference, and with tax professors here and elsewhere, who      confirmed these conclusions. Ms. Halloran would be happy to      respond to inquiries from your office if you need a second      opinion.           Very truly yours,                                                  Douglas Laycock.
