 President, I thank the majority leader. Let me just make the point that we have recently adopted S. Res. 250, which condemns the military junta in Burma and calls for the immediate and unconditional release of Aung San Suu Kyi. The State Peace and Development Council, which rules Burma, is a truly outrageous, pariah regime that deserves universal condemnation. I only wish there were more countries that would join us in publicly criticizing the regime and in taking action to help bring about positive change in this troubled nation.  I yield the floor.
