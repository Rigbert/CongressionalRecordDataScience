 President, I had planned to offer an amendment to this supplemental appropriations that would have alleviated the emergency shortages of utility helicopters in the Army National Guard. Senators Leahy, Bond, Carnahan, Dodd, Lieberman, and Carper were cosponsors of the amendment and some have short statements that they will enter.  Our amendment would have procured 20 new Blackhawks for those Guard units in States with the most serious shortages of modern lift helicopters. It is my understanding that there are between seven and nine States that are at a critical level, having no modern aviation assets.  Delaware is one of those States. The people of my State expect the Army Guard to be there when emergencies hit. Unfortunately, the Army Guard may not be there because they do not have lift helicopters that are flyable. Let me repeat that and be more specific. Since January, the Delaware National Guard has had no more than two UH-1 Huey helicopters that were flyable--two out of a fleet of twenty-three, and they have had two only rarely. The norm has been one. One vintage Vietnam-era helicopter out of a fleet of twenty-three is all they have had to fly for 6 months--6 months. This is absolutely insupportable. Pilots cannot fly and stay proficient and the people who depend on the Guard can no longer be sure of their assistance in emergencies.  A week ago, the Secretary of Defense released his amended budget for 2002. Unfortunately, there was only enough funding for 12 new Blackhawk helicopters for the Army. This is incredible. It is completely insufficient to deal with this problem. Over the next 5 years, the Army is retiring over 700 Vietnam-era helicopters that are no longer safe to fly, but nothing is replacing them. Instead of the 330 Blackhawks that are needed--130 for the active duty and 200 for the National Guard--less than 70, or about twenty percent of the requirement, are funded.  I have a copy of a letter sent to all of the leaders of the congressional defense committees and the appropriations committees that details this critical problem. It describes the concern these generals have that their ability to do their national security missions today is severely impaired and that the situation will only get worse and qualified pilots and technicians leave the Guard because they are not able to do their missions or even train for them. The letter was signed by the 50 Adjutant Generals of the United States.  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                        National Guard Association                                         of the United States,                                Washington, DC, February 27, 2001.     Hon. Daniel K. Inouye,     Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Defense, Committee on          Appropriations, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Inouye: The FY2001 Army Aviation Modernization      Plan requires the Army National Guard to significantly reduce      its aviation force structure by retiring over 700 grounded      Vietnam vintage utility aircraft by FY2004. These aircraft      have been replaced by requirements for 330 UH-60L utility and      HH-60L MEDEVAC helicopters. However, less than 20% of these      helicopters are funded from FY2002 through FY2007. Virtually      every state is currently short of its required H-60      helicopters, and many states' capability to perform their      national security mission including protecting our nation      against the threat of weapons of mass destruction is severely      impaired by the lack of flyable aircraft.       The H-60 helicopter is the number 1 unfunded equipment      requirement in the Army National Guard. As the Defense      Committees discuss the FY2001 supplemenal and the FY2002      defense budget, we request your support in two areas. First,      to add the procurement of 20 additional UH-60L Black Hawk      utility helicopters ($204 million) and 6 HH-60L (formerly UH-     60Q) MEDEVAC helicopters ($95.4 million) for the Army      National Guard to the budget. This will help alleviate an      immediate shortfall within the Army National Guard. Second,      to fix this problem in the long term we need your support for      a multi-year procurement of H-60s at a rate of 60 aircraft      per year for the next five years.       This problem has reached a critical phase. Without the      procurement of additional H-60 aircraft for our aviation      force to train and utilize, we will soon face a significant      loss of valuable pilots and technicians. Your support in      funding will assist in our efforts to continue to modernize      the aging National Guard fleet and provide our nation with      the best equipped and most relevant National Guard force.           Sincerely,         Major General Ronald O. Harrison, The Adjutant General of            Florida and President, National Guard Association of            the United States; Major General Stephen P.
