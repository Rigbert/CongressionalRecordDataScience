President, I want to take a few minutes to celebrate the bipartisan passage of this year's Water Resources Development Act. This critically important legislation will help keep our drinking water safe, move goods on Illinois waterways, protect communities from flooding and preserve the precious natural resources that are our rivers, streams, and wetlands.  Our Nation's water infrastructure plays a vital role in protecting our communities from flooding, safeguarding our drinking water from contamination, and advancing commerce through the safe and secure movement of goods. The safety of the American people and the stability of the American economy depend on the reliability of our water infrastructure.  But our water infrastructure in the U.S. is aging and overburdened, and investment is not keeping up with the need. We have locks and dams that are crumbling, in serious need of maintenance and upgrades, and lead water pipes that are long overdue for replacement. What happened in Flint has shown just how vulnerable our water infrastructure is and why investing in it is so important. That is why I was proud to support the passage of the Water Resource and Development Act of 2016, which makes significant investments in water infrastructure around the country.  I am proud to report that much of the water infrastructure funding in this bill will benefit my home State of Illinois. The bill authorizes a final feasibility report on phase II of the Des Plaines River Project, which will provide flood risk management and environmental restoration on the Upper Des Plaines River and tributaries in Illinois and Wisconsin. The bill also includes language that expedites thecompletion of the McCook Reservoir in the Chicago region. McCook is a 10-billion-gallon reservoir designed to redirect flood and wastewater from the Chicago region. When completed, the project will benefit Chicago and 36 surrounding suburbs, including 1.5 million structures and over 5 million people. Also included is language that will help pay for work on the Lockport Prairie Nature Preserve and the Prairie Bluff Preserve in Will County. These are important projects for Illinois that will help prevent flooding in our communities and restore our region's ecosystems.  In Illinois, we treasure Lake Michigan, from the drinking water it provides to millions of people, to the commerce and tourism it brings to the Chicago area. That is why protecting and restoring our Great Lakes is so important to Illinois. This bill authorizes $300 million per year to help protect our Great Lakes through the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, or GLRI, which provides Illinois with millions in Federal funding to combat invasive species like Asian carp; reduce and remove pollution, waste runoff, and toxic chemicals; and restore wetlands and other lakefront assets. GLRI funds have been used for restoration projects like the removal of toxic chemicals from Waukegan Harbor, green infrastructure like the Millennium Reserve near the Calumet River, and the restoration of 40 acres of land at Northerly Island.  Finally, this bill takes important steps to address the water contamination issues that have been plaguing communities across the country. Lead water contamination is not a new problem. In Illinois, we have been battling this issue for years. The contaminated water crisis in Flint, MI, was a wakeup call to all of us that we must have strong drinking water protections in place and invest the necessary resources to keep our water safe for our children. This bill provides $220 million in direct emergency assistance to Flint and other communities facing similar drinking water emergencies. It provides $1.4 billion over 5 years to help small and disadvantaged communities comply with the Safe Drinking Water Act. The bill modernizes our State Revolving Loan Fund program and provides $300 million in grants for communities to replace lead service lines. And because we are also seeing high levels of lead in our schools' water, the bill authorizes $100 million for additional lead testing in schools. This bill also addresses many of the issues that I raised in the Lead-Safe Housing for Kids Act that I introduced with Senator Menendez and the CLEAR Act that I introduced with Senator Cardin, two bills that would ensure our children are protected from the dangerous effects of lead in our water and our housing.  Congress has a responsibility to protect the safety of our drinking water, defend our communities from flooding, improve our waterways, and fix the Nation's crumbling water infrastructure. I want to congratulate Chairman Inhofe and Ranking Member Boxer for their hard work and dedication to improving our water infrastructure and for getting this bill passed by the Senate. I am proud to support the important investments that this bipartisan bill makes to improve water infrastructure in Illinois and around the country.                          ____________________
