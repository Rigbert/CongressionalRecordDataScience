She writes:       I have worked since the age of 15. I hold two MA degrees      and have worked a full and part-time job for 15 years. I      entered the private sector until my position was eliminated      approximately 14 months ago. Gas prices almost prevented my      seeking employment very far from home. At 55 years of age, I      never thought I would be without health care. I never      considered that I would have difficulty finding a job. By the      way, my spouse was also employed by a company which was      downsized and sold twice within 1 year. He is also      unemployed. We live in Kentucky which is a more rural part of      America. Our state and county typically have a high      unemployment rate as well. Extension of unemployment      insurance would be a lifeline.  That lifeline has been cut off by the objection of the Senator from Kentucky.  I yield to the Senator from Vermont for purposes of a question.
