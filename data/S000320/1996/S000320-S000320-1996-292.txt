 President, I would like to take a moment today to share with my Senate colleagues the outstanding accomplishments of a very talented group of students from Montgomery. On April 13, the Montgomery Academy Forensics Team won the State forensics championship at the Alabama Forensic Educators Association State Tournament. While this is wonderful achievement, it was an even more impressive showing, for this is the second consecutive year the Montgomery Academy team has won this award.  For the past 5 years, the team has been led my Mr. James W. Rye III. Mr. Rye founded the forensics program at Montgomery Academy, and in those 5 years, the team has grown in both size and strength, and I would like to congratulate and commend him for his efforts today.  Mr. President, I would also like to extend my congratulations to the young men and women from Montgomery Academy who performed so well at this year's tournament. To win two consecutive State championships is an impressive accomplishment, and I wanted to share their success with my colleagues. The Montgomery Academy Forensics Team has certainly earned their award, and I would wish them the best of luck in next year's competition and in all of their future endeavors.                          ____________________
