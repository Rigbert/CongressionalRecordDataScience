President, I am pleased to introduce on behalf of Senator Feingold and myself, the Criminal Copyright Improvement Act of 1995. This bill would close a significant loophole in our copyright law and encourage the continued growth of the National Information Infrastructure by insuring better protection of the creative works available online.  This bill reflects recommendations and hard work of the Department of Justice. I want to commend the Department for recognizing the need for prompt action on this important problem.  Bruce Lehman, Commissioner of Patent and Trademark and chair of the Working Group on Intellectual Property Rights of the President's Information Infrastructure Task Force, recognizes the critical role of copyright protection as we move forward with the NII. The preliminary draft of the report of the working group, explained:       The potential of the NII will not be realized if the      information and entertainment products protectable by      intellectual property laws are not protected effectively when      disseminated via the NII. Owners of intellectual property      rights will not be willing to put their own interests at risk      if appropriate systems--both in the U.S. and      internationally--are not in place to permit them to set and      enforce the terms and conditions under which their works are      made available in the NII environment. Likewise, the public      will not use the services available on the NII and generate      the market necessary for its success unless access to a wise      variety of works is provided under equitable and reasonable      terms and conditions, and the integrity of those works is      assured. All the computers, telephones, fax machines,      scanners, cameras, keyboards, televisions, monitors,      printers, switches, routers, wires, cables, networks and      satellites in the world will not create a successful NII, if      there is not content. What will drive the NII is the current      moving through it.--Intellectual Property and the National      Information Infrastructure, July, 1994, p. 6.  The copyright Act, which is grounded in the copyright clause of the Constitution, assures that ``contributors to the store of knowledge [receive] a fair return for their labors.'' Harper & Row The Nation Enterprises, 471 U.S. 539, 546 (1985). I am mindful, however, that when we exercise our power to make criminal certain forms of copyright infringement, we should act with ``exceeding caution'' to protect the public's First Amendment interest in the dissemination of ideas. Dowling v. United States, 473 U.S. 207, 221 (1985).  For a criminal prosecution under current copyright law a defendant's willful copyright infringement must be for purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain. Not-for-profit or noncommercial copyright infringement is not subject to criminal law enforcement, no matter how great the loss to the copyright holder. This presents an enormous loophole in criminal liability for willful infringers who can use digital technology to make exact copies of copyrighted software and other digitally encoded works, and then use computer networks for quick, inexpensive and mass distribution of pirated, infringing works. This bill would close this loophole.  United States v. LaMacchia, 871 F. Supp. 535 (D. Mass. 1994), is an example of the problem this criminal copyright bill would fix. In that case, an MIT student set up computer bulletin board systems on the Internet. Users posted and downloaded copyrighted software programs. This resulted in an estimated loss to the copyright holders of over one million dollars over a 6-week period. Since the student apparently did not profit from the software piracy, the Government could not prosecute him under criminal copyright law and instead charged him with wire fraud. The district court described the student's conduct ``at best . . . as irresponsible, and at worst as nihilistic, self-indulgent, and lacking in any fundamental sense of values.''  Nevertheless, the Court dismissed the indictment in LaMacchia because it viewed copyright law as the exclusive remedy for protecting intellectual property rights. The Court expressly invited Congress to revisit the copyright law and make any necessary adjustments, stating:       Criminal as well as civil penalties should probably attach      to willful, multiple infringements of copyrighted software      even absent a commercial motive on the part of the infringer.      One can envision ways that the copyright law could be      modified to permit such prosecution. But, ``[i]t is the      legislature, not the Court which is to define a crime, and      ordain its punishment.''  This bill would ensure redress in the future for flagrant, willful copyright infringements in the following ways: First, serious acts of willful copyright infringement that cause significant loss to the copyright holders would be subject to criminal prosecution.  The bill would add a new offense prohibiting willful copyright infringement by reproduction or distributing copyrighted material with a total retail value of $5,000 or more. Under the new offense, it would be a misdemeanor to make even a single copy of a copyrighted work with a total retail value of between $5,000 and $10,000, and a felony if the total retail value of the infringed upon item or items was over $10,000.  These monetary thresholds, combined with the scienter   requirement, would insure that criminal charges would only apply to willful infringements, not merely casual or careless conduct, that result in a significant level of harm to the copyright holder's rights. De minimis, not-for-profit violations, including the distribution of pirated copies of works worth less than $5,000, would not be subject to criminal prosecution.  Second, the bill would increase the monetary threshold for the existing criminal copyright offense, which makes it a misdemeanor to commit any willful infringement for commercial advantage or private financial gain, and a felony if 10 or more copies of works with a retail value of over $2,500 are made during a 180-day period. The bill would increase the monetary threshold in this offense from $2,500 to $5,000 for felony liability.  Third, the bill would expressly prohibit willfully infringing a copyright by assisting others in the reproduction or distribution, including by transmission of an infringed work. This would further ensure coverage of activities such as those of alleged in LaMacchia.  Fourth, the bill would add a provision to treat more harshly recidivists who commit a second or subsequent felony criminal copyright offense. Specifically, repeat offenders would be punished by imprisonment for up to 10 years rather than 5 years for a first felony offense. Such a calibration of penalties takes an important step in ensuring adequate deterrence of repeated willful copyright infringements.  Fifth, the bill would extend the statute of limitations for criminal copyright infringement actions from 3 to 5 years, which is the norm for violations of criminal laws under Title 18, including those protecting intellectual property.  Finally, the bill would strengthen victims' rights by giving victimized copyright holders the opportunity to provide a victim impact statement to the sentencing court. In addition, the bill would direct the Sentencing Commission to set sufficiently stringent sentencing guideline ranges for defendants convicted of intellectual property offenses to deter these crimes.  Technological developments and the emergence of the National Information Infrastructure in this country and the Global Information Infrastructure worldwide hold enormous promise and present significant challenges for protecting creative works. Increasing accessibility and affordability of information and entertainment services are important goals that oftentimes require prudent balancing of public and private interests. In the area of creative rights, that balance has rested on encouraging creativity by ensuring rights that reward it while encouraging its public availability.  I look forward to continuing to work with the Department of Justice and other interested parties to make any necessary refinements to this bill to insure that we have struck the appropriate balance.  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:          Criminal Copyright Improvement Act of 1995--Summary       Sec. 1. Short Title.--The Act may be cited as the      ``Criminal Copyright Improvement Act of 1995.''       Sec. 2. Criminal Infringement of Copyrights.--The bill adds      a new definition for ``financial gain'' to 17 U.S.C.      Sec. 101, and      amends the criminal copyright infringement provisions in titles 17 and      18. The bill also ensures that victims of criminal copyright      infringement have an opportunity to provide victim impact      statements to the court about the impact of the offense.      Finally, the bill directs the Sentencing Commission to ensure      guideline ranges are sufficiently stringent to deter criminal      infringement of intellectual property rights, and provide for      consideration of the retail value and quantity of the      legitimate, infringed-upon items.       (a) Definition of Financial Gain. Current copyright law      provides criminal penalties when a copyright is willfully      infringed for purposes of ``commercial advantage or private      financial gain.'' The bill would add a definition of      ``financial gain.'' The bill would add a definition of      ``financial gain'' to the copyright law, 17 U.S.C. Sec. 101,      and clarify that this term means the ``receipt of anything of      value, including the receipt of other copyrighted works.''      This definition would make clear that ``financial gain''      includes bartering for, and the trading of, pirated software.       (b) Criminal Offenses. The requirement in criminal      copyright infringement actions under 17 U.S.C. Sec. 506(a)      that the defendant's willful copyright infringement be ``for      purpose of commercial advantage or private financial gain,''      has allowed serious incidents of copyright infringement to      escape successful criminal prosecution.       For example, in United States v. LaMacchia, 871 F. Supp.      535 (D. Mass. 1994), the defendant allegedly solicited users      of a computer bulletin board system on the Internet to submit      copies of copyrighted software programs for posting on the      system, and then encouraged users to download copies of the      illegally copied programs, resulting in an estimated loss of      revenue to the copyright holders of over one million dollars      over a six week period. Absent evidence of ``commercial      advantage or private financial gain,'' the defendant was      charged with conspiracy to violate the wire fraud statute, 18      U.S.C. Sec. 1343. The district court described the      defendant's conduct as ``heedlessly irresponsible, and at      worst as nihilistic, self-indulgent, and lacking in any      fundamental sense of values,'' but nevertheless dismissed the      indictment on the grounds that acts of copyright infringement      may not be prosecuted under the wire fraud statute.       The bill would add a new section 17 U.S.C. Sec. 506(a)(2)      to prohibit willfully infringing a copyright by reproducing      or distributing copyrighted material, which has a total      retail value of $5,000 or more. This monetary threshold,      combined with the scienter requirement, insures that merely      casual or careless conduct resulting in distribution of only      a few infringing copies would not be subject to criminal      prosecution. Criminal charges would only apply to willful      infringements resulting in a significant level of harm to the      copyright holder's rights. De minimis violations would not be      covered.       By contrast to the offense in 17 U.S.C. Sec. 506(a)(1),      which requires that 10 or more copies be made during a 180-     day period for a felony penalty, the new proposed offense in      Sec. 506(a)(2), does not contain a numerical threshold or      requisite time period during which the infringement must      occur. Instead, criminal sanctions would attach under      Sec. 506(a)(2) if only a single copy were made of a      copyrighted work with a total retail value of over $5,000.      The criminal offense would be a misdemeanor if the total      retail value of the infringed-upon items was between $5,000      and $10,000, and a felony if the total retail value was over      $10,000.       Court decisions have indicated that intangible property,      such as intellectual property rights, may not be protected      under traditional theft or fraud statutes. See Dowling v.      United States, 473 U.S. 207 (1985) (``bootleg'' phonorecords      that infringed copyrights not subject to interstate      transportation of stolen property statute); United States v.      Brown, 925 F.2d 1301, 1308 (10th Cir. 1991) (intangible      property such as source code not protected by interstate      transportation of stolen property statute); United States v.      LaMacchia, 871 F. Supp. 535 (D. Mass. 1994) (violation of      copyright holder's rights cannot be prosecuted under wire      fraud theory). The copyright statute may be the only remedy      available to protect copyrighted works, such as computer      programs, from infringement by electronic copying. This is      exceptionally important because a copyright attaches,      automatically, when an original work is fixed in a tangible      medium. Thus, any work embodying source code or any other      literary work may be protected against unauthorized      reproduction by uploading or downloading, if at all, by the      copyright statute.       Under the bill, unauthorized reproduction or electronic      ``theft'' (which is, essentially, a reproduction and      distribution) of source code or other items worth $5,000 or      more are subject to criminal penalties, and the theft of more      valuable copyrighted material worth more than $10,000 is      punishable at felony level. In sum, since cases reflect that      intellectual property rights may not be protected by general      criminal statutes, the bill would amend the copyright law to      ensure such protection exists.       The offenses under Sec. 506(a)(1) and (a)(2) would overlap.      For example, someone selling 10 or more copies of a      copyrighted work may violate both provisions if the value of      those copyrighted works is $5,000 or more. The key, however,      is that the new provision in Sec. 506(a)(2) requires that the      infringement involve, at a minimum, $5,000, and felony      provisions do not attach until the value of the copyrighted      works reaches $10,000. By contrast, any offense, regardless      of value, involving private financial gain or commercial      advantage constitutes at least a misdemeanor, and the crime      reaches felony level under the bill once the retail value of      the copyrighted material exceeds $5,000.       The bill would also expressly prohibit willfully infringing      a copyright by ``assisting others'' in the reproduction or      distribution of an infringed work. This would make clear that      individuals who aid and abet a criminal copyright violation      could not escape criminal liability by claiming that they      were not responsible for the reproduction or distribution      because they merely enabled others to engage in such conduct.       (c) Limitation on Criminal Procedures. The bill would amend      17 U.S.C. Sec. 507(a) to extend the statute of limitations      for criminal copyright infringement actions from three to      five years. A five year statute of limitations is the norm      for violations of criminal laws under Title 18, including      those that relate to protecting intellectual property. See,      e.g., 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2319A (Unauthorized fixation of and      Trafficking in sound recordings) and Sec. 2320 (Trafficking      in counterfeiting goods or services).       (d) Criminal Infringement of a Copyright. The bill would      amend the penalty provisions in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2319 to      comport with the proposed amendments to 17 U.S.C.      Sec. 506(a), and would also add a new subsection providing      for a victim impact statement.       First, under current law, willful copyright infringement      for commercial advantage or private financial gain is a      felony punishable by up to five years' imprisonment only when      the offense consists of the reproduction or distribution      during a 180-day period of ten or more copies with a retail      value of over $2500. Willful infringements for commercial      advantage, which do not satisfy the monetary threshold or      quantity requirement during the statutory time period, are      misdemeanor offenses. The bill would modify the felony      penalty provision for willful copyright infringement for      commercial advantage or private financial gain to cover      reproductions or distributions ``by transmission'' and to      cover those individuals ``assisting others in such      reproduction or distribution.'' The bill would also change      the monetary threshold from $2,500 to $5,000.       Second, the bill would provide a new penalty in 18 U.S.C.      Sec. 2319(c) for the new offense in 17 U.S.C. Sec. 506(a)(2)      of willfully infringing a copyright by reproduction or      distribution of 1 or more copies of copyright works with a      total retail value of $5,000 or more. This new offense would      be punishable by a fine and up to 5 years' imprisonment if      the total retail value of the legitimate, infringed work      exceeded $10,000. If the value of the infringed work is      between $5000 and $10,000, the offense would be a misdemeanor      punishable by not more than 1 year and a fine.       The penalty structure under the bill is as follows:                                                                        ------------------------------------------------------------------------  Infringed work                                                              values          Under $5,000     $5,000-$10,000     Over $10,000  ------------------------------------------------------------------------Willful            Misdemeanor......

Sec.                                                         506(a)(1)].                                                            Willful            No criminal        Misdemeanor.....  Felony.          infringement by    liability.                                           reproduction or                                                         distribution of                                                         works with value                                                        over $5,000 for                                                         any reason,                                                             including                                                               commercial                                                              advantage/                                                              financial gain                                                          [17 U.S.C Sec.                                                          506(a)(2)].                                                            ------------------------------------------------------------------------       Third, the bill would add a provision to treat more harshly      recidivists who commit a second or subsequent felony offense      under 18 U.S.C. 2319(a), which refers to 17 U.S.C.      Sec. 506(a) Under the bill, such recidivists would be      punished by up to ten years' imprisonment and a fine.       Finally, the bill would add new subsection Sec. 2319(e),      requiring that victims of the offense, including producers      and sellers of legitimate, infringed-upon goods or services,      holders      of intellectual property rights and their legal      representatives, be given the opportunity to provide a      victim impact statement to the probation officer preparing      the presentence report. The bill directs that the      statement identify the victim of the offense and the      extent and scope of the injury and loss suffered,      including the estimated economic impact of the offense on      that victim.       (e) Unauthorized Fixation and Trafficking of Live Musical      Performances. The bill would add new subsection 18 U.S.C.      Sec. 2319A(d) requiring that victims of the offense,      including producers and sellers of legitimate, infringed-upon      goods or services, holders, of intellectual property rights      and their legal representatives, be given the opportunity to      provide a victim impact statement to the probation officer      preparing the presentence report. The bill directs that the      statement identify the victim of the offense and the extent      and scope of the injury and loss suffered, including the      estimated economic impact of the offense on that victim.       (f) Trafficking in Counterfeit Goods or Services. The bill      would add new subsection 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2320(d) requiring      that victims of the offense, including producers and sellers      of legitimate, infringed-upon goods or services, holders of      intellectual property rights and their legal representatives,      be given the opportunity to provide a victim impact statement      to the probation officer preparing the presentence report.      The bill directs that the statement identify the victim of      the offense and the extent and scope of the injury      and loss suffered, including the estimated economic impact of the      offense on that victim.       (g) Directive to Sentencing Commission. The Sentencing      Commission currently takes the view that criminal copyright      infringement and trademark counterfeiting are analogous to      fraud-related offenses, and that appropriate sentences are to      be calculated according to the retail value of the infringing      items, rather than of the legitimate copyrighted items which      are infringed. This may understate the harm. The bill would      direct the Sentencing Commission to ensure that applicable      guideline ranges for criminal copyright infringement and      violations of 18 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 2319, 2319A and 2320 are      sufficiently stringent to deter such crimes and provide for      consideration of the retail value and quantity of the      legitimate, infringed-upon items.                                 ______      By
