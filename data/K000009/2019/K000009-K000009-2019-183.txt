On April 22, 2019, the Easterseals will celebrate 100 years as America's first non-profit organization to serve individuals with disabilities and other special needs.  Once only focused on serving children with special needs, Easterseals expanded its mission in the 1940s to serve children and adults. For decades now, their innovative services opened the doors to assist seniors, veterans and individuals with autism.  The Easterseals had a tragic beginning. In 1907, a streetcar accident in Elyria, Ohio, took the lives of eight people because there was no local hospital to treat their injuries. One of the deceased was the 18-year-old son of Edgar F. Allen, who in his sorrow was inspired to raise the funds necessary to build a local hospital. 18 months later, the Elyria Memorial Hospital was built and opened with 32 beds.  Eight years after that, another Elyria hospital opened for ``crippled children.'' On April 22, 1919, Mr. Allen organized with civic leaders from Elyria, Cleveland, Sandusky, and Toledo, Ohio and Detroit, Michigan to form the Ohio Society for Crippled Children, the original name of the Easterseals.  May the festivities of this 100th anniversary year bring renewed faith and opportunity to those aided by Easterseal services. Through rehabilitation services, new and fulfilling life opportunities become possible.  Let us all take inspiration in the words of founder, Edgar F. Allen: ``Your life and mine shall be valued not by what we take . . . but by what we give.'' Congratulations to all associated with such an important organization.                          ____________________
