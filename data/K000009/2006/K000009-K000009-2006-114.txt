Chairman, I would just like to put on the record that the State of Ohio used to be one of the leading tomato-growing States in the Nation until subsidized western water, and we lost our industry to the West.  Now, Arizona is one of the most irrigated States in the country. You are draining water that is never going to come back. And yet I look at our part of the country that has to fight for such a small part of the market right now. I would just ask the gentleman, I would love to look at the type of subsidies that attend to your agriculture in Arizona from major government agencies that do not come to Ohio farmers.                              {time}  1945  We are trying to maintain a very small market share. Hydroponic production is one of the ways in which we are successfully doing it, but I would just beg for the gentleman to take a look at what has really happened to the movement of agriculture. One State in the Union now produces over half the fruits and vegetables in the country, most of it irrigated. Ohioans have a right to compete in this market.
