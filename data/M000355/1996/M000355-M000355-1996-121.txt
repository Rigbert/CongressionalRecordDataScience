 I think the Senator from Maine would agree with that.  I have been a little surprised the administration has not gotten interested in this issue, but I think they are getting more interested in the issue.  The point I was going to make before my friend from Maine stood up was what Secretary Christopher pointed out to me is it was discussed for an hour the other night at the ASEAN meeting. Previously, they acted like Burma was not there. Nobody talks about it. It is being forced on to the agenda, even in the part of the world that is least interested in doing anything about the regime, for all the obvious reasons. They have the biggest investment there.  So this is not going to go away, Mr. President. I don't know what is going to happen on the vote on the Cohen amendment, but it is not going to go away until SLORC goes away and until the results of the election in 1990 are honored.  I don't want to misrepresent at all the position of the administration on the Cohen proposal. All I can say is it is exactly what the administration and the National Security Council asked me to accept on Monday, but they will have to speak for themselves. This amendment, by the way, is not directed at the Clinton administration. The Bush administration was worse, from my point of view, on Burma than this administration has been. At least they discuss it occasionally.  So, Mr. President, let me just conclude this segment by saying I don't think we will be alone very long if we have the courage to take this step.  I yield the floor.
