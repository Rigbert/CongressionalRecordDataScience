Speaker, we have another bit of evidence on why free trade does not bring freedom.  The oil monarchy of Qatar wants to host the World Trade Organization talks next month, but yesterday the monarchy of Qatar condemned the actions of our brave soldiers who are fighting in Afghanistan in the war against terrorism.  Qatar's foreign minister said the following: the attacks against Afghanistan are unacceptable and we have condemned them. This same government two days after the September 11 attacks denied permission for America to use its airport facilities in the campaign against Osama bin Laden and the Taliban. Now the United States plans to send our top trade negotiators to this country for an international trade meeting?  Mr. Speaker, President Bush has said that in the war against terrorism every Nation must take sides, that each Nation must decide where it stands. The Government of Qatar made its decision yesterday, and Qatar is standing on the wrong side.  President Bush has no choice. He must not permit U.S. negotiators to attend the World Trade Organization ministerial in Qatar next month. There should be no Qatar round. Free trade should bring freedom.                          ____________________
