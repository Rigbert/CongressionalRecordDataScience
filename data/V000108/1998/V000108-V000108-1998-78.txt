Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise before you to congratulate one of Northwest Indiana's most noble, selfless, and dedicated individuals: Dr. Anthony S. Lenzo, of Crown Point, Indiana. On October 11, 1998, Dr. Lenzo will be honored by the Cesare Battisti Lodge #27, as this year's Member of the Year. In addition to his many years of service to the Lodge, he is being honored for his tireless efforts as a community leader.  The Cesare Battisti Lodge #27 has been honoring its most dedicated members since 1966. A lifelong member of the organization, Dr. Lenzo serves as an excellent role model for both members of the Cesare Battisti Lodge, and for the people of Indiana's First Congressional District. Not only has he maintained a lifelong membership with Lodge #27, Dr. Lenzo has been a lifelong leader of the Lodge. He is currently the financial secretary and the editor of the Lodge newspaper. As Walter Lippman said, ``The final test of a leader is that he leaves behind him in other men the conviction and the will to carry on.'' Dr. Lenzo's efforts in the community, in addition to his nationwide efforts for peace, have certainly inaugurated an enduring legacy. For many years, he has worked to have the United Nations designate a ``Weekend of Prayer, Meditation, and Thought on the Futility of War and the Desperate Need for Peace in the World.'' In his own words, ``It will be a thankful day when we can once again live in peace . . . peace in the world, peace within our nations, peace in our neighborhoods, peace in our streets.''  Since he began his campaign for peace, Dr. Lenzo has met with great success. He has received positive responses from former Secretary-General of the United Nations Boutros-Boutros Ghali, Pope John Paul II, and Elizabeth Taylor. Nearly all who hear Dr. Lenzo's plea for peace commend him on his campaign. I also commend Dr. Lenzo for his activism, leadership, and ardent dedication to a noble cause. This campaign is as poignant now as it was in January 1991 when I first called your attention to it. As members of NATO stand poised to initiate air strikes in Kosovo and Serbia, Dr. Lenzo's works remind us of the gravity of the actions they contemplate. As options are considered, his message to these nations is to keep the goal of peace in sight. Dr. Lenzo's suggestion that we step back and remember to whom we are accountable is as important now as it was then.  Mr. Speaker, Dr. Tony Lenzo is an inspiration to us all. I ask that you and my distinguished colleagues join me in commending Dr. Lenzo for not only his award as Cesare Battisti Lodge #27's Member of the Year, but also for his extraordinary campaign for world peace. His superhuman efforts and selfless dedication are an example for every citizen of the United States to emulate. Northwest Indiana is lucky indeed to have such a resident.                          ____________________
