 President, this amendment would put in place a regulation that would mean health care providers--not just doctors but anybody in a health care clinic or hospital--could refuse millions of women health care for critical services. It jeopardizes Federal family planning services, Medicaid, and title X, and it undermines State laws that guarantee women access to contraceptive services.  Health and Human Services has proposed to rescind this rule which the Bush administration published when their clock was running out.  This amendment puts ideology ahead of science and ahead of women's health care. Federal law already permits medical professionals to decline to assist in abortions based on their religious beliefs. But stopping this regulation will not change that. This amendment goes way too far and ignores the needs of patients and denies women reproductive health care services.  I encourage my colleagues to vote no.
