 Thus my observation that if we want to deal with the No. 1 issue in the country in the last week we are expected to be here, the appropriate thing to do is to stay on the subject.  Obviously, my friend from Oklahoma feels very strongly about this matter. He and the majority leader are likely to have this exchange again sometime down the road. The question for all of us is, what is the most essential thing to do for America right now?  The American people are asking us to do something about the price of gas at the pump. The way to do that is to stay on that subject at this particular moment, and the way to do that is to vote against cloture on getting off the subject and going to something else.
