 I wish to pay tribute to a 100-year tradition in my home State of Iowa . This past weekend, the Drake Relays in Des Moines, IA, celebrated a century of competition for the world's elite track and field athletes.  Schools and athletes from all over the country come to Des Moines each year to compete in this classic. The display put on by the Drake community every year brings alumni, Iowans, athletes, friends, and families together to cheer competitors in victory and defeat.  The Drake Relays has been creating memorable moments for 100 years. It is moments created by Jesse Owens, Michael Johnson, Carl Lewis, Jim Ryun, Gwen Torrence, and Iowa's very own Lolo Jones, Natasha Kaiser-Brown, Kevin Little, and Joey Woody. It is unknown athletes making their own mark in history and taking the first step toward fame far beyond the borders of Iowa. It is high school kids, like my son Robin, whose capstone moment of their athletic career was participating in the Drake Relays.  Anybody who has attended the Relays understands the marvel of this one-of-a-kind sporting event. For some it is the blue track that helps athletes run a little faster, jump a little longer and higher, and throw a little further. For others it is the fans filling every seat to cheer for the athletes who cross the finish line in first and for those who cross last. And for some it is the intense competition from the high school kids all the way to the top athletes in the world who are standing shoulder to shoulder waiting for their event.  Whatever it is, there is a reason fans and athletes alike keep coming back to the Drake Relays year after year.  Just as Jesse Owens said, ``There's something special about the Drake Relays.''  Congratulations to the Drake Relays on 100 years of ``America's Athletic Classic.''                          ____________________
