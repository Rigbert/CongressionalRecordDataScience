Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to the victims and heroes of September 11, 2001. Over the past year, this country has tried to come to terms with the tragedy we experienced on September 11th. Although I have written or spoken about that day many times, I have found that words often fail to describe the magnitude of that day. There are the haunting stories of loss and grief as well as stories of heroism and triumph. We learned about ourselves and our country that day and while we grieved for those we lost, we also cultivated a new sense of unity and patriotism. As a nation we renewed our belief in the American spirit and in the bravery of fellow Americans who would willingly risk their lives for a stranger. The stories of what ordinary men and women did under extraordinary circumstances continue to amaze me.  As we remember September 11, 2001, let us remember all the brave men and women who not only saved lives but saved our sense of brotherhood. Let us extend our prayers to all our brave men and women in the Armed Forces who right now are protecting our way of life and let us extend our deepest gratitude to our fire and police forces who have redefined the word `sacrifice'.                          ____________________
