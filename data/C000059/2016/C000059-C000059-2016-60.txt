Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman yielding to me. I do so for the purpose of speaking to this problem we have.  I certainly thank my colleague from Colorado for his willingness to work with the subcommittee in agreeing to withdraw the amendment later in this discussion. I fully understand his concerns regarding the Bureau of Land Management's research program for wild horses and burros.  I value wild horses and burros. They are certainly, as you mentioned, an iconic part of our history in the West. But we have a problem, and I think we can agree to that. Right now we are spending $80 million a year.
