Chairman, I have the text of House Resolution 367 before me, and the relevant part says each such amendment may be offered only in the order printed in the report, may be offered only by a Member designated in the report and shall be divided and controlled by the proponent and opponent. The words ``or a designee'' is not in the rule. It is not in the text of the summary provisions of the resolution in House Report 107-375, but is in a head note.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. House Resolution 367 says ``a Member designated in the report'' and House Report 107-375 designate ``the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Waters), or designee.'' Under those circumstances, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers) is recognized as a designee.  Does the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers) wish to withdraw his offering of the amendment as the designee of the gentlewoman from California?
