Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to my very dear friend, Dr. Roy Church. Dr. Church, who has faithfully and determinedly served our community as President of Lorain County Community College since 1987, recently announced he will retire June 30, 2016. Today, the community will honor him in a tribute to his remarkable tenure.  Like many retirements, Dr. Church's will be a bittersweet one. For the past 29 years we have relied on his bold leadership, thoughtful vision and unquestioned commitment to higher education--and while professionally he will certainly be missed, Dr. Church's legacy and more so friendship will remain a part of the fabric of our community forever.  Though Dr. Church refuses to take credit for much, his work ethic and sense of service began at an early age and was found in an unassuming place, far from academia. ``I milked cows morning and night for the first 18 years of my life'', Dr. Church once said. He was the youngest of six children growing up on a 230-acre dairy farm south of Syracuse, N.Y.  He attended college not far from there, graduating from State University of New York at Cortland and it was here where Dr. Church began his 45 year commitment to higher education. Not long after Dr. Church received his Master's Degree in education from St. Joseph College of Florida, where he taught health sciences, he was given opportunity to become the dean of students at only 25 years of age.  Soon after pursuing a doctorate in higher education administration from Florida Atlantic University, Dr. Church's meteoric rise through the world of higher education continued. From dean of academic affairs at Broward Community College in Fort Lauderdale to vice president and chief academic officer of St. Petersburg College and eventually and thankfully landing him in Lorain County, Ohio as the fifth President of our community's college, in 1987.  Back then, LCCC was a straight-forward, conventional community college of 5,000 students, offering associate degrees in basic coursework, in a few disciplines. Today, it is one of the top schools of its kind in the country and is a leader in innovation, entrepreneurship, and higher education. It didn't take long for Dr. Church to see the connection between a higher education and good jobs, understanding the need to not only prepare and train students for their future, but to also help foster entrepreneurship that create good-paying jobs.  It was through Dr. Church's vision and leadership that LCCC helped launch innovative and ground breaking initiatives such as the nationally recognized University Partnership Program, that provides four-year and graduate degree programs from local universities or Early College that allows for high school students to earn college credit.  Other creative initiatives include the Innovation Alliance, an effort to improve access to science, technology, engineering and math degrees and GLIDE (the Great Lakes Innovation and Development Enterprise), the county'stechnology incubator, which to date has awarded more than $28 million to 44 companies, the FabLab, an innovative ``makerspace'' and the SMART Center for Microsystems and sensor technology.  Since Dr. Church's time at LCCC, its transformation is and has been ahead of its time. In President Obama's last visit to LCCC--he visited the college twice--he spoke of the need for community colleges to become community career centers, so people who are looking for a new job or a better-paying job can learn the skills that businesses need right now. That is what Dr. Church has done: he has helped create and lead one of the nation's premiere institutions, always with a root and focus on the student and academics, but mindful of its true role and responsibility. ``As the community's college, we serve all . . . students, companies, organizations, residents,'' Dr. Church once said. ``We are a resource for the entire community.''  It is difficult to estimate how many lives Dr. Church has touched--how many single mothers relying on an affordable education to provide a better life for their children--how many laid-off steelworkers who were retrained to once again have an opportunity to work--how many companies and business startups that created new and good-paying jobs--how many first generation college students were given the opportunity to climb out of poverty?  Mr. Speaker, it is my distinct honor and pleasure today, to pay tribute to a visionary leader and community partner, Dr. Roy Church, and join the tens of thousands who thank him for his service and commitment to our community.                          ____________________
