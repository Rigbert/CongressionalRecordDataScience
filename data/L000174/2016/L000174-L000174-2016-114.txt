President, Vermonters needn't look far to see evidence of the deep French roots running through our State. From towns such as Montpelier and Isle La Motte, to the apt naming of Vert Mont, the Green Mountain State, generations of Vermonters were raised in homes where the native language was not English, but French. Deep ties to our neighbors to the north in Canada continue this rich culture in Vermont communities today.  It is no wonder then that I have such strong memories of stories about the ``Merci Train'' in Vermont. In the aftermath of World War II, Vermonters, like people across the country, rallied together to provide supplies for war-torn communities throughout France and Italy. Vermonters sent food and other gifts, through Burlington and Rutland, down to Boston, where they became part of ``the Friendship Train,'' a convoy of rail cars that traveled through France as part of one of the more remarkable humanitarian efforts after World War II.  I well remember my mother and father bringing my older brother and my youngest sister and me to see it. As children, we may not have fully understood what it meant, but for years thereafter, I would go past it, being more and more aware. As a Montpelier native, I join with everybody else with in having pride having that the Merci Train was there.  The Merci Train was France's response, a year later, thanking Americans for their support. Filled with trinkets from French citizens, crafts made by school aged children, and other items, cars from the Merci Train traveled to each State. One arrived in Vermont on February 10, 1949. Its arrival was heralded by the playing of our national anthem, as well as the French revolutionary hymn ``La Marseillaise'' by the Montpelier High School Band. Its contents, sincere expressions of appreciation from French families, were unpacked and distributed to Vermonters.  While the Merci Train's freight represented the gratitude of a nation, the railroad car itself held the history of two World Wars. Displayed behind the Vermont Supreme Court in Montpelier for a number of years, the car originally served as a railroad boxcar to haul military cargo. Often referred to as ``40 and 8s,'' in reference to their 40-man or 8-horse capacities, the cars regularly transported American soldiers throughout Europe. Upon the car's arrival in Vermont, it was displayed temporarily behind Vermont's Supreme Court building, where it remained until the 1950s. Removed to the Vermont State Police headquarters, it faced deterioration. A movement in the 1980s--with the support of veterans, private companies, the Vermont National Guard, and ``40 and 8'' enthusiasts--led to the car's restoration. Today it remains preserved and on display at the Vermont National Guard Library and Museum, a fitting tribute to the strong ties between Vermont and France and another window into the fascinating history on which our great State is built.  I ask unanimous consent that the May 30 article from the Times Argus, ``The Merci Train in Vermont,'' by Paul Heller, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                  [From the Times Argus, May 30, 2016]                       The Merci Train in Vermont                            (By Paul Heller)       Local radio celebrity Bob Bannon was master of ceremonies      as 500 Vermonters gathered at the railroad station in      Montpelier to receive a remarkable gift from the people of      France.       The present was an antique boxcar filled with gifts from      ordinary French citizens--a way of saying ``thank you'' or      ``Merci'' for American assistance during and after World War      II.       A similar gift had been presented to each of the 48 states      with an additional one for Washington, D.C. The convoy had      been dubbed the ``Merci Train,'' and the old railroad cars      known as ``40 and 8s'' were carried to their destinations by      rail.       The one that arrived in Montpelier on February 10, 1949,      had been delivered on an American railroad flatcar and was      opened in a ceremony that had started with a ``Vermont      Welcomes France'' breakfast. Later, at the train station, the      Montpelier High School band played ``The Star Spangled      Banner'' and ``La Marseillaise.'' The Montpelier V.F.W. post      provided a color guard carrying the flags of the U.S.,      France, and Canada.       Officially known as ``Le Train de la Reconnaissance de      Francaise,'' the ``Merci Train'' was a response to the U.S.      railroad convoy a year earlier that had made a similar trip      the other way.       That 1947 version was called ``The Friendship Train'' and      had made stops at various large U.S. cities where the cars      were filled with food and other gifts from ordinary Americans      to offer relief to war-ravaged France and Italy. The      Friendship Train was the inspiration of nationally syndicated      columnist Drew Pearson, who led the humanitarian effort that      put individual Americans in a direct charitable relationship      with their counterparts in France.       It is estimated that relief supplies valued at $40,000,000      were sent to France and Italy in this fashion. Although the      Friendship Train did not come to Vermont for donations, the      Burlington Free Press was careful to assert that the Green      Mountain State was worthy of this gift from France.       Many Vermonters may feel that the Merci Train, bearing      gifts from the French people for the people of Vermont, is      entirely a one-way transaction. They remember that the      Friendship Train, which went from coast to coast picking up      food gifts for the hungry people of Italy and France, did not      come to Vermont.       Thus it might appear that Vermont is being thanked for      something it didn't do. But while the train did not come      here, some Vermonters made their contributions just the same.      Food gifts from different parts of the state were sent      through Burlington and Rutland down to Boston, where they      made up part of the Friendship Train.       Of course, many Vermonters served in the armed forces to      help secure an Allied victory in Europe. France, recognizing      the sacrifices of all Americans to save their republic, gave      a similar gift to each state in the union.       The Vermont car was unpacked and gifts distributed by Earl      Newton, director of the Vermont Historical Society, who was      sensitive to the need for equity. Vermont legislators took      token gifts back to their towns and many items, when      appropriate, were given to high school French classes.       The gifts were sincere expressions of appreciation such as      small knickknacks that a French family might own. There were      many pieces made by French schoolchildren who also included      toys and dolls in the shipment.       Vermont Governor Gibson, reported the Burlington Free      Press, accepted the car for Vermont and said ``the gifts it      contained were great in spiritual value and that the people      of Vermont would accept them in that sense.'' He added, ``the      gifts would be accepted in a spirit of humility and      friendship and that the people of Vermont would continue to      march shoulder to shoulder with the people of France so that      liberty, peace, and freedom might continue for all time.''       Many of the gifts included letters and drawings from French      schoolchildren, and they were clearly intended for children      in the United States. The letters were often addressed,      ``Chers petits amies d'Amerique . . .'' (Dear little friends      of America). These gifts received in Montpelier were mostly      sent to museums and schools throughout the state.       While the gifts were mostly sentimental tokens of      friendship, it was the railroad car itself that was to prove      to be the most unique and lasting legacy of the ``Merci      Train.'' The old railroad car, small by modern standards, was      informally referred to as a ``40 and 8.''       Manuel Conley's history of the specialized cars noted,      ``During two wars they served France as dual purpose railroad      boxcars hauling the military cargoes stenciled on their sides      ``HOMMES 40 CHEVAUX 8''. A more precise colloquialism might      have been ``40 or 8'' as the designation referred to the      cars' capacity to carry 40 men or eight horses in an era when      the horse-cavalry was an essential part of a military force.       During the First World War American doughboys were carried      to the front in just such cars and veterans of the Great War      had vivid memories of that unique mode of transport.      According to Conley, Americans were alternately enchanted and      disgusted, intrigued and infuriated by the little dual-     purpose cars. Sometimes they were just confused.       In ``The Doughboys: The story of the AEF,'' Laurence      Stallings tells of one sergeant who reported to his leader:      ``I got all my 40 artillerymen in the boxcar, lieutenant. But      if you try to pull eight of our horses in, somebody's gonna      be trampled to death!''       Conley notes that the cars had been updated for their new      purpose in the ``Merci Train.'' ``All had been repaired,      freshly painted, and decorated with plaques bearing the coats      of arms of the 40 provinces of France. Across their sides,      upon tricolored     bands, was printed the name of the enterprise for which they      stood: on one side `Train de la Reconnaisance Francaise' and      on the other `Gratitude Train.'''       The French citizens embraced the idea of thanking America      for its sacrifice and generosity and they scoured the      countryside for 40 and 8s that could be reconditioned as      gifts to each state in America.       ``By the end of 1948 the boxcars were filled to capacity.      The train carrying over two hundred and fifty tons of      gratitude was pulled to the port of Le Havre for shipment to      America.'' The cars were loaded on a freighter bound for      Weehawken, New Jersey. Upon arrival, the cars, with a wheel      base eight inches wider than standard U.S. tracks, were      loaded on flatcars for delivery to their final destinations.       Vermont's Merci car first arrived in Vermont at Brattleboro      on February 9, 1949 at 11 in the morning. It was received in      Montpelier the following day at 8 a.m. with an official      ceremony at 10 ``with Gov. Gibson and other officials      participating.''       When Earl Newton unpacked the cargo, he compiled a detailed      inventory on a legal pad. His original notes, in a file at      the Vermont Historical Society, are still quite legible. A      casual perusal of the list of gifts Mr. Newton distributed      include 39 dolls, various decorated cloth wallets, stockings,      thank-you cards, pencil drawings, watercolors, ornamental      fans, toy cars, guns, pencil boxes, puppets, doilies,      photographs, and painted ceramic souvenirs.       Antique French currency in the form of bank notes was      included as well as a sampling of Confederate Bank notes from      the U.S. Civil War. A representative sampling of some of the      gifts may be seen at the Vermont Historical Society.       The most interesting item from the Merci Train is the old      railroad car itself that was displayed on temporary rails      behind the Supreme Court building at 111 State St. in      Montpelier. It remained there until 1953, according to      Vermont legislator John Finn, when it was transported to      Redstone, then the headquarters of the Vermont State Police,      to be used for storage.       With no shelter or maintenance, the car began to      deteriorate, and the once brightly painted Provincial crests      began to disappear in the harsh weather. When asked, a stingy      Vermont Legislature would not appropriate $10,000 for a      shelter, and by 1968 the car had been moved to Steamtown, a      Vermont railroad museum in Bellows Falls. Funds promised for      restoration never materialized, and Finn noted it again was      used for ``a storage bin, rotting where it stood.''       But then, Melvin Hilliker of St. Albans came across the old      car at the train museum. Hilliker, a member of the American      Legion, was also a member of a group of Legionnaires who were      dedicated to the history of the ``40 and 8s.'' He enlisted      his cohorts to save Vermont's Merci Car by taking it to St.      Albans for restoration. St. Albans, a famous old railroad      town, seemed to be the perfect destination for the neglected      relic.       Finn and company lobbied members of the Vermont Legislature      for permission to take the car to St. Albans. For Finn, it      was a relatively convenient task, as he had just been elected      to represent St. Albans in the Vermont House.       After much cajoling, Steamtown released the historic      boxcar. At first, moving it seemed an insurmountable problem,      but the Miller Construction Company of Windsor generously      moved it to the St. Albans CVRR roundhouse in June of 1983.       The ``40 and 8'' enthusiasts of St. Albans raised funds to      restore the car, and with the assistance of the Vermont      National Guard, it was moved to St. Albans' Switchyard      Shopping Center for a rededication and display.       The history buffs who witnessed the dedication on June 7,      1984, undoubtedly believed the antique railroad car would      rest at the Switchyard permanently. However, that was not to      be. In just over 10 years time the members of the St. Albans      American Legion realized they did not have the means to      preserve the antique rail car and, in 1995, with the help of      the Vermont Office of Historic Preservation, the old 40 and 8      was moved to the Military History Museum at Camp Johnson in      Colchester. Under the aegis of the Vermont National Guard,      the museum features the Merci Train car as the centerpiece of      its World War One exhibit.       Lovingly restored and displayed, the old car may be boarded      by visitors who can imagine what it must have been like to be      an American doughboy carried to the front with 39 companions,      and then what it looked like in 1949 when it pulled into      Montpelier, laden with gifts from a thankful France.       While Vermonters have the good fortune of being able to      visit their car from the Merci Train, residents of some of      the other New England states are not as lucky.       A 1984 report indicated that the Connecticut car was      destroyed by fire in the 1950s, the whereabouts of the      Massachusetts car was unknown, and Maine's was in disrepair      with most of the painted decorations removed. In 1999 the      Rhode Island car was discovered in a junkyard, but now      resides in The Museum of Work and Culture in Woonsocket.       In northern New England, New Hampshire (in Manchester) and      Vermont have provided shelter for their 40 and 8s and      preserved their legacy of sacrifice and gratitude. One may      view the car at the Vermont National Guard Library and      Museum, which is open Tuesday through Friday from 10 a.m. to      4 p.m. There is no charge for admission.                          ____________________
