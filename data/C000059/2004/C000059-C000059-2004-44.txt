Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor Stephen K. Goya for his 31 years of dedicated service with the California Department of Corrections, Parole and Community Services. Mr. Goya is an example of the hard work and a commitment to excellence shown by California's Corrections Officers. He will be honored by the Department of Corrections on October 29, 2004 in the city of Brea, California.  Stephen K. Goya began his career as a Parole Agent I with the Department of Corrections, Parole and Community Services Division on October 10, 1977. Prior to that, he worked as a Probation Officer for the Orange County Probation Department. He was promoted to Parole Agent II/Supervisor in January 1983. He then further advanced his career with the Department of Corrections as a Parole Agent III Unit Supervisor in October 1985 and in 1987, he was promoted to Parole Administrator I. In December 1992, Mr. Goya was once again promoted to Parole Administrator II Level. In that classification, Mr. Goya functioned as the Operations Manager for the Parole Division in Sacramento as well as the Deputy Regional Administrator in Region IV Headquarters. Mr. Goya's current classification is that of Regional Parole Administrator over Region IV. Mr. Goya was promoted to Regional Parole Administrator CEA III Level on January 20, 1998. Region IV is comprised of five different counties (Orange, San Diego, Imperial, San Bernardino, Riverside), 51 field units, 21 office locations and over 742 parole staff.  We rely upon our Corrections, Parole and Community Services Officers to keep our community safe and monitor those who are making their way back into society. Stephen K. Goya has worked tirelessly for over three decades to lead these Officers in their mission. His efforts have improved life in Southern California. Stephen K. Goya has earned my many thanks and I wish him great success in all his future endeavors.                          ____________________
