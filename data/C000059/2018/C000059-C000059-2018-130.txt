Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to former California Transportation Committee Commissioner and my dear friend, Robert A. Wolf, who passed away on Sunday, October 21, 2018. Bob served the people of California and Riverside County in many ways throughout his life and he will be deeply missed.  Bob was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, before being raised in Riverside County. After graduating from Ramona High School, Bob went to the College of the Desert to earn his degree. Bob served as an Army combat medic during the Vietnam War. For his bravery and lifesaving actions he received 11 decorations, many for valor. After the war, Bob began his business career as a partner with his father-in-law Hans Kirschsieper at Germania Construction Corporation. Bob played an important role shaping Riverside County and specialized in job creating projects that resonated harmoniously with the communities in which they are situated. Bob's dedication to the redevelopment of March Air Force Base in Riverside, California led to a project that will have economic benefits long into the future.  Throughout his life, Bob made public service a priority and served on a host of local boards and commissions, including the Riverside County Flood Control Commission, the Moreno Valley Planning Commission, and the Riverside County Planning Commission. Bob was also appointed to a number of positions with the State of California, including Undersecretary, Business, Transportation and Housing Agency, and to the California Transportation Commission. Always an advocate for solutions to our public policy challenges, Bob was an active member of organizations like the Valley Group and the Moreno Valley Chamber of Commerce. In recognition for Bob's many contributions to his community, he received a long list of honors and recognitions throughout his distinguished life.  Bob is survived by the love of his life Helga Kirschsieper Wolf, his children Shawna and Kevin; grandchildren Theodore, Parker, Brayden, Laynie, Alyssa, Kaitlyn and Lucas. I want to extend my heartfelt condolences to the entire Wolf family, his friends, and everyone who had the pleasure of knowing him. Although Bob may be gone, the many contributions he made in Riverside County will have a lasting impact.                          ____________________
