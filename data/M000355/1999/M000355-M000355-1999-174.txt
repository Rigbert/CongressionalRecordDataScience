 President, I rise today to express may great concern and dismay at President Clinton's decision to offer clemency to sixteen convicted terrorists. These individuals were members of the FALN, the Armed Forced for National Liberation, which uses violence and terror to further its cause of making Puerto Rico an independent nation. As a result of their involvement in a series of terrorist bomb attacks on United States soil, these individuals have been convicted of very serious offenses.  Terrorism is a deplorable act. In recent years we have seen tragic attacks on our embassies overseas, and hideous murders in Oklahoma City and the World Trade Center. This harvest of death and suffering is what terrorism is about. By releasing these terrorists President Clinton has made a terrible mistake. For years our message to terrorist has been simple: ``If you attack, maim, and kill Americans, the United States will hunt you down and punish you. We do not forget, and we will bring you to justice.'' Now the President is saying that we will forget, and that justice can give way to other considerations. That is the wrong thing to do.  Mr. Gilbert Gallegos, the president of the Fraternal Order of Police, which represents the Americans on the front lines of the war on terrorism, has eloquently condemned President Clinton's actions. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter from Mr. Gallegos to President Clinton be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                      Grand Lodge,                                    Fraternal Order of Police,                                 Albuquerque, NM, August 18, 1999.     Hon. William Jefferson Clinton,     President of the United States,     The White House,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. President: I am writing this letter on behalf of      the more than 283,000 members of the Fraternal Order of      Police to express our vehement opposition to your offer of      clemency to sixteen convicted felons involved with a wave of      terrorist bomb attacks on U.S. soil from 1974-83. I would      also like to express my own personal confusion and anger at      your decision.       Your offer of clemency would immediately release eleven      convicted felons who conspired as members of the FALN to      plant and explode bombs at U.S. political and military      targets. The remaining five would have their criminal fines      waived and only two would serve any additional time. These      attacks killed six people, wounded dozens and maimed three      New York City police officers: Detective Anthony S. Senft      lost an eye and a finger, Detective Richard Pastorella was      blinded and Officer Rocco Pascarella lost his leg.       Your claim that none of these people were involved in any      deaths is patently false. As members of the terrorist      organization that was planting these bombs, all of them are      accessories to the killings as a result of the bomb attacks.      Two of the persons to whom you have offered clemency were      convicted of a $7.5 million armored truck robbery, which      undoubtedly financed the FALN's 130 bomb attacks.       These are not Puerto Rican patriots, these are convicted      felons who are guilty of waging a war of terror against      Americans on American soil to accomplish their political      objectives. Why are you rewarding their efforts?       I can only assume you are again pandering for some      political purpose. This time, Mr. President, it must stop      before it begins.       The ``human rights advocates'' who are so concerned about      the plight of these killers have never shed a tear for the      victims. These ``human rights advocates'' are the same people      and organizations who maintain that the United States      routinely abuses the rights of its citizens and who issue      reports stating that our state and local police officers are      nothing more than racist thugs who enjoy brutalizing      minorities. These ``human rights advocates'' are the same      people and organizations who clamor for the release for Mumia      Abu-Jamal, a convicted cop-killer, and raise money for his      defense.       I do not Know, Mr. President, how they decide which rights      to advocate and which to ignore, but it seems that murderers      and terrorists are more entitled to them than victims. Do not      offer clemency to sixteen convicted felons to placate ``human      rights advocates.''       I would also strongly urge you to reject any inclination or      polling data that indicates this will generate sympathy for      you or for a Democratic presidential candidate among      Hispanic-Americans. As an Hispanic-American myself, I can      assure you that releasing violent convicted felons before      they have served their full sentences and to waive tens of      thousands of dollars in criminal fines, is no way to appeal      to racial pride.       I sincerely hope, Mr. President, that this ill-conceived      notion is consigned to the pile reserved for horrendously bad      ideas. Many of the best accomplishments of your presidency      stemmed from your commitment to law enforcement and to police      officers.       This aberration would surely eclipse all we have done to      date to keep America safe. Police officers around the      country, including me, have stood side by side with you in      fighting violent crime and supporting your community policing      initiatives. Caving into these advocates is a slap in the      face.       I look forward to hearing from you about this matter.           Sincerely,                                              Gilbert G. Gallegos,                                               National President.
