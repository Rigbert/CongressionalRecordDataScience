Speaker, I want to thank my good friend, the gentlewoman from New York, for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, someplace I read in the Bible, ``Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me; for of such is the kingdom of heaven''--or it could have read the beloved community or the beloved Nation.  Mr. Speaker, at this moment, at this hour, we have a moral obligation, a mission, and a mandate to do the right thing, the humane thing. Today, hundreds and thousands of our children--innocent little children--need our help. They need our support. They are running away from violence, from rape, from hunger. They are searching for a better life.  The time has arrived, Mr. Speaker. We can wait no longer. We have reached a tipping point, and now, we have a choice, a choice to do what is right, what is just, what is fair. Where are our hearts? Where are our souls? We cannot simply turn our backs on these little children and do nothing.  In the final analysis, we are one people, one family, one House. It doesn't matter whether you are Black, White, Asian American, Native American, or Latino. There is no such thing as an illegal human being.  History will not be kind to us if we fail to do what is right, what is just. We must pass bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform, and we must pass it now.
