Chairman, I would simply state to the gentleman that that is correct. The amount that was included in our bill was passed unanimously by our subcommittee. It was also passed in full committee and its intention is that the transition subsidy payments would require that farmers be engaged in the production of commodities or conserving purposes in order to receive assistance.  So the answer to the gentleman's question is yes.
