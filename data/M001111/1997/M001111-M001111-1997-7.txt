 President, I rise to join a number of my colleagues in speaking briefly about one of the most important issues that will come before the Senate next year in the second session of the 105th Congress.  In late September, President Clinton submitted the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty to the Senate for ratification. The President's transmission statement includes the following:       The Conclusion of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty      is a signal event in the history of arms control. The subject      of the treaty is one that has been under consideration by the      international community for     nearly 40 years, and the significance of the conclusion of      negotiations and the signature to date of more than 140      states cannot be overestimated. The Treaty creates an      absolute prohibition against the conduct of nuclear weapon      test explosions or any other nuclear explosion anywhere. . .      . The Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty is of singular      significance to the continuing efforts to stem nuclear      proliferation and strengthen regional and global stability.      Its conclusion marks the achievement of the highest priority      item on the international arms control and nonproliferation      agenda.  I commend the President for his leadership on this issue. I look forward to working closely and in a bipartisan fashion to secure prompt ratification of the CTBT. I will do absolutely everything I can to support the passage of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. I expect a spirited debate on the CTBT including vigorous opposition from some who continue to believe in nuclear expansion and experimentation.  Several Senate hearings have recently been held and I urge the body to move forward in a timely and deliberative manner early in 1998. As a member of the Appropriations Energy and Water subcommittee with funding responsibility for nuclear weapons activities including stockpile stewardship, I look forward to actively participating in Senate consideration of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.  Mr. President, at this point, I ask that a brief titled, ``Ten Reasons for a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty,'' be printed in the Record. This information was prepared by a nongovernmental organization in support of CTBT ratification.  The material follows:       Ten Reasons for a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.  1. the ctbt would guard against the renewal of the nuclear arms race       The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty would limit the ability      of nuclear weapons states to build new nuclear weapons by      prohibiting ``any nuclear weapon test explosions and all      other nuclear explosions.'' The ban on nuclear explosions      would severely impede the development of new, sophisticated      nuclear weapons by the existing nuclear powers. While      countries could build advanced, new types of nuclear weapons      designs without nuclear explosive testing, they will lack the      high confidence that the weapons will work as designed. Thus,      the Treaty can impede a nuclear arms buildup by five declared      and three undeclared nuclear weapon states.          2. The CTBT would curb nuclear weapons proliferation       Under the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, ``threshold''      states would be prevented from carrying out the types of      tests required to field a modern nuclear arsenal. While a      country could develop nuclear weapons for the first time      without conducting nuclear explosions, the bomb design would      be fare from optimal in size and weight and its nuclear      explosive power would remain uncertain. The CTBT is therefore      vital to preventing the spread of nuclear weapons to      additional states, where these weapons could destabilize      international security.   3. The CTBT would strengthen the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty       The conclusion of the CTBT is a key element in the global      bargain that led to the signing and the extension of the      Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. in May 1995, non-nuclear      states agreed to extend that Treaty in May 1995 with the      understanding that Article VI measures in the original      treaty--like the CTBT--would be implemented. At the May 1995      NPT extension conference, all nations agreed to ``The      completion by the Conference on Disarmament of the      negotiations on a universal and internationally and      effectively verifiable Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty      no later than 1996.'' Ratification of the CTBT would further      legitimize U.S. non-proliferation efforts and lay the basis      for universal enforcement of the CTBT, even against the few      nations that may not sign.    4. Nuclear testing is not necessary to maintain the safety and                     reliability of the U.S. arsenal       The U.S. has a solid and proven warhead surveillance and      maintenance program to preserve the safety and reliability of      the U.S. nuclear deterrent without nuclear test explosions      and this program is being augmented through the Science-Based      Stockpile Stewardship Program (SBSS). Although some of the      projects that are part of the SBSS program are not essential      to the maintenance of the stockpile, many objective experts--     both critics and supporters of the program--agree that the      program can ensure the safety and reliability of the U.S.      nuclear stockpile without resorting to nuclear explosive      testing.       All operational U.S. nuclear weapons are already ``one-     point safe'' against accidental detonation of the warhead's      high explosives, making even low-yield nuclear explosions,      known as ``hydronuclear'' tests unnecessary. in addition, the      nuclear warhead designs of operational U.s. nuclear weapons      incorporate additional modern safety features. Since      instituting a new annual warhead safety and reliability      certification process in 1995, U.S. nuclear weapons have been      twice certified without nuclear test explosions.                 5. The CTBT is effectively verifiable       The CTBT would put into place an extensive, global array of      170 seismic monitoring stations, 80 radionuclide monitoring      stations, 11 hydroacoustic monitoring stations, and 60      infrasound monitoring stations to detect and deter possible      nuclear test explosions. Monitoring capabilities would be      especially sensitive at and around the established nuclear      test sites. With this monitoring system, the CTBT would--with      high confidence--be able to detect nuclear test explosions      that are militarily significant. In addition, the CTBT      would provide an additional deterrent against potential      test ban violations by establishing on-site inspection      (OSI) rights that could allow detection of the radioactive      gases leaking from an underground nuclear test.    6. the ctbt would substantially enhance current u.s. monitoring                               capabilities       Whether or not the CTBT is ratified, U.S. intelligence      agencies will be tasked with monitoring nuclear weapons      programs of the nuclear powers and the efforts of non-nuclear      states and groups to attain nuclear weapons. The Treaty will      make that task easier by establishing a far-reaching      international monitoring system across the globe that would      augment existing national intelligence tools. Clearly, U.S.      intelligence capabilities to detect nuclear tests and nuclear      weapons development programs would be far better with the      CTBT   7. the ctbt would enhance the international norm against nuclear                                 testing       If the five declared nuclear weapon states ratify the      Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, it will strengthen the global      norm against testing and weapons development that helps make      the nuclear ``have-not'' nations far less inclined to develop      nuclear weapons. The U.S. has not tested a nuclear weapon      since 1992 when Congress passed and President Bush signed the      Hatfield-Exon-Mitchell legislation establishing a moratorium      on nuclear testing. This law, which remains in effect, says      that the U.S. may not conduct a nuclear test explosion unless      another nation conducts a test. CTBT ratification would help      bring other nations in line with U.S. policy.  8. the ctbt is supported by a large majority of the american people       The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is supported by a large      majority of the American people. U.S. public support for a      nuclear weapons test ban has remained consistently high since      the early days of the Cold War. The most recent poll,      conducted in September 1997 by the Mellman Group, revealed      that 70 percent of Americans support United States      ratification of a nuclear test an treaty.  9. the ctbt is the longest-sought initiative to help reduce nuclear                             weapons dangers       The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty marks an historic      achievement pursued by Presidents since Dwight D. Eisenhower.      For forty years, Presidents and activists have worked for an      end to nuclear testing. Previous negotiations have been      hindered by international incidents, the failure to      compromise at key times, and most importantly, the political      dynamics of the Cold War nuclear arms race itself.      Ratification of the CTBT would mark an important milestone in      the effort to end the nuclear arms race.      10. The ctbt would protect human health and the environment       Since 1945, six nations have conducted 2,046 nuclear test      explosions--an average of one test every nine days. These      tests spread dangerous levels of radioactive fallout downwind      and into the global atmosphere. A 1997 National Cancer      Institute Study estimates that fallout from only 90 U.S.      nuclear test will likely cause 10,000--75,000 additional      thyroid cancers in the U.S. Underground testing also poses      environmental hazards: each blast spreads highly radioactive      material underground; many underground nuclear explosions      have vented radioactive gases. The Energy Department reports      that 114 of the 723 U.S. nuclear tests since 1963 released      radioactive material into the atmosphere.                          ____________________
