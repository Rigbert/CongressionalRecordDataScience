President, tonight we voted unanimously to confirm four district court nominees: William Hayes and John Houston to be U.S. District Judges for the Southern District of California, Robert Clive Jones to be a U.S. District Judge for the District of Nevada, and Phillip Figa to be a U.S. District Judge for the District of Colorado.  I commend the Republican leadership for finally bringing the nominations of William Hayes and John Houston of California to the floor. These two nominees will be filling vacancies on the busiest district court in the nation. The two seats which these men will fill have been created to address the growing crisis to the border court in San Diego--the federal court with the highest caseload per judge in the nation. It is too bad that the Republican leadership chose to move nominees from Oklahoma and Texas ahead of these California nominees who are desperately needed by the people of the Southern District of California due to the high caseload of that court.  I would also note that the way in which these nominees have come forth should be used as a model for the White House to emulate in other States and circuits. Senator Diane Feinstein and Senator Barbara Boxer worked hard to establish a bipartisan commission in California which has recommended these individuals for the Southern District of California. I am happy to be able to join the two California Senators in confirming these two new judges.  At the conclusion of the confirmation votes tonight, a total of 64 judicial nominees of President Bush will be confirmed this year. Adding that to the 100 confirmations during 17 months of the Democratic majority in the Senate, 164 of President Bush's judicial nominees have been confirmed thus far. This number of confirmations, 164, is significantly higher than Republicans allowed by the third year of President Clinton's second term, the most recent presidential term, when they allowed 135 judicial nominees of that president to be appointed from 1997 through the end of 1999.  It also should be noted that when I became chair of the Judiciary Committee on July 10, 2001, the Democrats inherited 110 vacant seats in the Federal judiciary. In the 17 months of Democratic control, we significantly reduced the vacancy rate by confirming 100 of President Bush's judicial nominees. Today, there are only 41 vacancies on the Federal courts. This is the lowest level reached in 13 years. Had we not created 15 new seats this year, that number would be even lower--down to 26.  In just the past week, Senate Democrats have worked with the Republicans to confirm 10 district court judges and 1 circuit court judge. There are a lot of accusations of delay being thrown around but the truth is in these plain numbers. With more full-time Federal judges on the bench today than any other time in U.S. history, the confirmation process is moving forward and judges are being confirmed expeditiously with support from Democrats on the Judiciary Committee and in the full Senate.                          ____________________
