Speaker, reclaiming my time, let us assume the substitute is germane. Will we be allowed the opportunity to offer a germane substitute?  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman would yield, again, I would defer that kind of decision to the Committee on Rules; but, obviously, in most cases that I can remember a tax bill, there have been substitutes to the tax bills as long as they are germane.
