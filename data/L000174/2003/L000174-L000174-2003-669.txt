Will noted in 1993, one of the key attributes of the Senate is the venerable tradition of extended debate and deliberations. In fact, not until 1917 was there even a provision in the Senate rules to allow for cloture, a procedure by which the Senate acts to cut off debate. The Senate first adopted the cloture rule in 1917. At that time, cloture was limited to and could only be sought on legislative matters. The cloture rule was extended in 1949 to include measures and matters, which includes judicial nominations. Thus, prior to 1949, there was no mechanism to limit debate on nominations, and in fact, disputes over nominations--to the few hundred seats in the federal judiciary--were handled and resolved by Senators behind closed doors.  Earlier in this debate today, one Senator indicated that all prior Supreme Court nominees had been given votes. I will just name a few judicial nominees who were not acted upon by the Senate earlier in American history: John M. Read, nominated by President Tyler on February 7, 1845; Edward Bradford, nominated by President Fillmore on August 16, 1852; Henry Stanbery, nominated by President Andrew Johnson on April 16, 1866; and Stanley Mathews, nominated by President Hayes on January 26, 1881. The facts are that many judicial or executive nominations were defeated in the Senate by inaction or by the threat of a filibuster over the years.  Republicans resurrected and amplified those tactics in the years 1995-2001 to defeat more than 50 of President Clinton's judicial nominees and to delay for years the confirmation of many others. In 1999, only 22 percent of President Clinton's circuit court nominees were confirmed. That was the first time in recent memory that a circuit court nominee was substantially more likely not to be confirmed than to be confirmed. For all of 1999 and 2000, only 44 percent of President Clinton's circuit court nominees were confirmed, making it more likely than not that his circuit court nominees would not be confirmed, unlike the nominees of the prior three Presidents, even during their last years in office. That is why vacancies on the circuit courts more than doubled from 16 in 1995 to 33 when the Senate reorganized in the summer of 2001. That is why this President has had so many circuit vacancies to fill, and he has shown little bipartisanship in his choices. In fact, rather than uniting people with his choices for lifetime appointments, he has sent forward a slate of circuit court nominees that has generated tremendous controversy and division.  In essence, until Republicans had a Republican President, Republicans interpreted the Advice and Consent Clause of the Constitution to allow a handful of anonymous Republican Senators to prevent an ``up or down'' vote by the full Senate on scores of qualified and moderate, mainstream judicial nominees of President Clinton. Now, when Democratic Senators have expressed genuine concerns about the lack of information regarding Mr. Estrada and have made a well-founded request to see his writings as a public servant, Republicans claim it is wrong and unconstitutional for Senators to act in accordance with Senate rules and tradition and their longstanding role as a check and balance on the President's appointment power.  The disregard for rules and traditions is especially unfortunate when what is at stake in judicial nominations are lifetime appointment for judges who will have the power to change how the Constitution is interpreted and whether civil rights, environmental protections, privacy and our fundamental freedoms will be upheld. With respect to the Estrada nomination, what is at stake is a seat on the second highest court in the country and the swing vote on that important court.  Most of the decisions issued by the D.C. Circuit in the nearly 1,400 appeals filed per year are final because the Supreme Court now takes fewer than 100 cases from all over the country each year. This court has special jurisdiction over cases involving the rights of working Americans as well as the right to a cleaner environment. This is a court where federal regulations will be upheld or overturned, where privacy rights will either be retained or lost, and where thousands of individuals will have their final appeal in matters that affect their financial future, their health, their lives and their liberty.  This is a court that has vacant seats due to anonymous Republicans blocking the last two nominees to this court by a Democratic President. Those nominees had outstanding legal credentials and qualifications but during President Clinton's last term, the Republican-controlled Senate would not proceed to an up or down vote on either of them.  The word ``filibuster'' derives from the Dutch word for piracy, or taking property that does not belong to you. Under that ordinary definition, it would be accurate to say that at least two of the vacancies on the D.C. Circuit, for which Republicans blocked qualified nominees, were filibustered, as well. Republicans, who exploited every procedural rule and practice to block scores of Clinton nominees anonymously from ever receiving an up or down vote, now want to change the rules midstream, to their partisan advantage, again so that all of their nominees get votes as quickly as possible. The whole reason this President has so many circuit vacancies to fill is because this was the booty of their piracy, their filibustering of judicial seats that arose during the Clinton Administration while they prevented votes on that President's qualified nominees.  For example, a Mexican-American circuit court nominee of President Clinton, Judge Richard Paez, was forced to wait more than 1,500 days to be confirmed. Even after the Republican filibuster was broken by a cloture vote to end debate, many Republicans joined an unsuccessful motion to indefinitely postpone his nomination. None of the more than 30 Republicans who voted against cloture in connection with that nomination or who voted in favor of Senator Sessions unprecedented motion ``to indefinitely postpone'' the vote on Judge Paez's nomination, which had been pending for more than 1,500 days, should beheard to complain if Democratic Senators seek more information about this President's nominees before proceeding to a vote for a lifetime appointment.  Senator Bob Smith, a straight talker from New Hampshire, outlined the Senate's history of filibusters of judicial nominees and said:       Don't pontificate on the floor and tell me that somehow I      am violating the Constitution . . . by blocking a judge or      filibustering a judge that I don't think deserves to be on      the court. That is my responsibility. That is my advise-and-     consent role, and I intend to exercise it.  Thus, the Republicans' claim that Democrats are taking ``unprecedented'' action regarding the circuit court nomination of Mr. Estrada--much like the bogus White House claim that our request for Mr. Estrada's work while paid by taxpayers was ``unprecedented''--is simply untrue. Republicans' desire to rewrite their own history is wrong. They should come clean and tell the truth to the American people about their past practices on nominations. They cannot change the plain facts to fit their current argument and purposes.  Back in 2000, Senator Hatch candidly admitted after cloture was invoked on the Paez nomination and Senator Sessions made his unprecedented motion to indefinitely postpone any vote on that judicial nomination that Judge Paez's nomination had been filibustered. He said:       Indeed, I must confess to being somewhat baffled that,      after a filibuster is cut off by cloture, the Senate could      still delay a final vote on a nomination. A parliamentary      ruling to this effect means that, after today, our cloture      rule is further weakened.  Republicans should not have come to the floor and told the American people over the last month that Democratic Senators had done something unprecedented in debating and opposing the Estrada nomination. They themselves did it quite recently and have done it repeatedly. Let us be honest about this and straight with the American people. Given the time allotted for today's debate, I cannot discuss them all but I will include in the record some of the other examples of Republican filibusters of presidential nominations from the nomination of Justice Abe Fortas to be Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court through the nominations of Stephen G. Breyer, now Justice Breyer, to the First Circuit; Rosemary Barkett to the 11th Circuit; H. Lee Sarokin to the 3rd Circuit; and Marsha Berzon and Richard Paez to the 9th Circuit.  Even more frequent during the years from 1995 through 2001, when Republicans controlled the Senate majority, were Republican efforts to defeat President Clinton's judicial nominees through inaction and anonymous holds for which no Republican Senator could be held accountable. Republicans held up almost 80 judicial nominees who were not acted upon during the Congress in which President Clinton first nominated them, Republicans eventually defeated more than 50 judicial nominees without a recorded Senate vote of any kind, just by refusing to proceed with hearings and Committee votes due to the anonymous acts of one or more Republicans.  Beyond the question of judicial nominees, Republicans also filibustered President Clinton's nomination of Dr. Henry Foster to become Surgeon General of the United States. This was an Executive Branch nominee that Republicans filibustered successfully in spite of two cloture votes in 1995. Dr. David Satcher's subsequent nomination also required cloture but he was successfully confirmed.  Other executive branch nominees who were filibustered by Republicans included Walter Dellinger, whose name has been invoked with approval by Republicans during the debate on the Estrada nomination. Mr. Dellinger was nominated to be Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel and two cloture petitions were required to be filed and both were rejected by Republicans. In this case we were able finally to obtain a confirmation vote after significant efforts and Mr. Dellinger was confirmed to that position with 34 votes against him. He was never allowed to be a confirmed Solicitor General because Republicans had made clear their opposition to him.  In addition, in 1993, Republicans objected to State Department nominations and even the nomination of Janet Napolitano to serve as the U.S. Attorney for Arizona, resulting in cloture petitions. In 1994, Sam Brown was nominated to be an Ambassador. After three cloture petitions were filed, his nomination was returned to President Clinton without Senate action. This was another successful filibuster by Republicans, and this was to a short-term appointment to serve in the Executive Branch, not to a lifetime appointment. Also in 1994, Derek Shearer was nominated to be an Ambassador and it took two cloture petitions to get to a vote before he was confirmed. In 1994, Ricki Tigert was nominated to chair the FDIC and it took two cloture petitions to get to a vote and confirmation of that executive nomination.  In addition, some remember Republican unwillingness to allow a Senate vote on the nomination of Bill Lann Lee to serve as the Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice. He told the Judiciary Committee that he would follow the law and enforce the law. He was the choice of the President to serve in that President's administration, but Republicans would not accord him an up or down vote before the United States Senate.  Republicans now claim that extended debate on this nomination is somehow unprecedented. I would point out that we have had a lot of extended debates and cloture votes over the last decade. I lost count of the number of times we had to vote on cloture when President Clinton was making nominations. This chart shows some of the Republican filibusters of nominations, leaving out their filibusters of legislation.  So when Republican Senators now talk about the Senate Executive Calendar and presidential nominees, it must be remembered that they recently filibustered several nominees and they succeeded in blocking many nominees by cloture votes and through anonymous holds. Here is a more complete list of recent Republican filibusters:                   REPUBLICAN FILIBUSTERS OF NOMINEES------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                Cloture  Year                   Nominee and position                  petitions                                                                 filed------------------------------------------------------------------------  1968   Abe Fortas, Supreme Court...........................         *1  1980   William Lubbers, NLRB...............................          3  1980   Don Zimmerman, NLRB.................................          3  1980   Stephen Breyer, 1st Circuit.........................          2  1987   Melissa Wells, Ambassador...........................          1  1987   William Verity, Commerce............................          1  1993   Walter Dellinger, Justice...........................          2  1993   Five State Department Nominees......................          2  1993   Janet Napolitano, Justice...........................          1  1994   Larry Lawrence, Ambassador..........................          1  1994   Rosemary Barkett, 11th Circuit......................          1  1994   Sam Brown, Ambassador...............................         *3  1994   Derek Shearer, Ambassador...........................          2  1994   Ricki Tigert, FDIC..................................          2  1994   H.

Some of these filibusters occurred when the Republicans were in the minority--as with Senator Helms' filibuster of a State Department appointee of President Reagan, and some were while Republicans were in the majority--as with the filibuster of Judge Paez's nomination.  Notwithstanding the recent Republican efforts to filibuster that Hispanic circuit court nominee and their failure to give hearings or votes to three other Hispanic circuit court nominees of President Clinton in addition to other nominees, Republicans have come to this floor and made unfounded attacks against Democrats who have expressed concerns about Mr. Estrada's nomination. It appears the Senate Republican majority, at the direction of the White House, chose to extend this debate because political operatives hope to use it to falsely paint those who were not to be steamrollered as somehow anti-Hispanic. The Republican's approach of crass partisanship regarding this nomination----
