 President, the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee is on the cusp of the accomplishment of his career. This comprehensive tax reform will make a huge difference for America. I wish to commend him for the efforts that have gotten us this far.  We have heard members of the Finance Committee speaking to the bill that has been presented to our conference. This is going to be an extraordinary accomplishment, not only for the American people but for the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Portman). The Senator from Louisiana.
