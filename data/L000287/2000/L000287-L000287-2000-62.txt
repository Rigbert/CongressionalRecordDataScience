Mr. Speaker, I submit for the Congressional Record the attached statement by the American Jewish Committee, which appeared in The New York Times on October 10, 2000.                   Assuming Responsibility for Peace       After the dead have been buried, the sirens silenced, and      the rubble swept from streets where rioters rampaged, what      lessons will have been learned from these recent days of      bloody confrontation between Palestinians and Israelis?       Two are essential: When mobs are incited to violence by      Palestinian media and political and religious leaders, chaos      ensues. And when Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation      breaks down because Palestinian police and militiamen join in      the mayhem and turn their guns on Israelis, the level of      conflict crosses a terrible threshold, and the toll of      suffering soars.       We grieve for the victims of the senseless violence that      has erupted in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza. We pray for      the safe return of the Israeli soldiers kidnapped by      Hezbollah marauders who stole across the international border      from Lebanon.       We reel from the desecration and of destruction of Joseph's      Tomb, a holy place, on the Sabbath, by a Palestinian mob and      the murder of a pious Jew trying to save sacred Torah      scrolls.       We yearn for the peace that will end for both peoples this      cycle of needless pain.       With Israel and the Palestinian tantalizingly close to      agreement in talks aimed at resolving their bitter conflict,      these days of violence fomented by the Palestinians needn't      have happened.       Innocent blood needn't have been spilled.       It wouldn't have--if Palestinian political and religious      leaders had not deliberately overblown a visit by an Israel      politician to Jersusalem's Temple Mount, Judaism's holiest      site, and launched a furious campaign of attacks on Israeli      civilians and soldiers.       It wouldn't have--if a sermon during Friday prayers at Al-     Aqsa mosque hadn't called on the Muslim faithful to      ``eradicate the Jews from Palestine'' provoking assaults on      Jewish worshippers at the Western Wall and eliciting a      defensive response by Israel.       It wouldn't have--if the Palestinian Authority hadn't      emptied its schools, where Israelis' status as the enemy is      continually taught, so that children could be bused directly      to confrontations with Israeli forces and into harm's way.       It wouldn't have--if Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat's      Fatah lieutenants in Gaza and the West Bank hadn't ordered      waves of armed strikes by paramilitary forces against Israeli      targets.       It wouldn't have--if Palestinian Authority radio and      television hadn't bombarded the airwaves day after day with      calls to rise up against Israel.       Finally, the conflict that engulfed Israelis and      Palestinians wouldn't have happened if Chairman Arafat had      assumed that responsibility of leadership and acted to calm      rather than inflame his people.       In the end, there can be no other path for Israel and      Palestinians than the path of negotiated peace, based on      compromise and the need to bring their conflict to an end.       Acceptable alternatives simply do not exist. For the      Palestinians and for Arab leadership across the Middle East,      there is no choice but to grasp the long-outstretched hand of      Israel, and assuming responsibility for peace.
