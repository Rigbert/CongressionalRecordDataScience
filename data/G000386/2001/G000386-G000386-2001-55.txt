 I have talked to Senator Lott, and he said since he spoke this afternoon perhaps Senator Nickles would like to speak. So I hope Senator Nickles or somebody else from our leadership can come and speak. If they do not, I will be glad to do it for them, but right now I will take 5 minutes.  Madam President, over the last several days, we have heard about how this process of getting to a stimulus package started with a set of principles that presumably both Republicans and Democrats on the budget process, as well as the finance process, have agreed to.  Democratic Senators have particularly been reminding us of this process of having a stimulus package agreed to with a whole set of principles. They have been reminding us of this, and they have particularly been reminding us as they criticize the House bill on the stimulus. They also used it to criticize a proposal I released a few weeks ago that represented the thinking of the Republican caucus.  As is often the case, not every principle fits everything they want to talk about, and so what one of the principal proponents of the bill that is before the Senate--and that is the Democratic caucus bill--has failed to mention is that none of the stimulus provisions should be industry specific.  It seems that adhering to principle is in the eye of the beholder because the bill that came out of the Finance Committee and is before us now as modified is laden with industry-specific provisions, contrary to one of the principles that has been talked about in the stimulus package that is agreed to.  We have specific measures in this bill before us targeted to Amtrak, to broad band, as well as specific agricultural crops and even bison, if one can believe it. We have an incredible expansion of the work opportunity tax credit. I have supported this tax credit which was meant to help welfare recipients find work, but in the Finance Committee bill before us this credit has been grotesquely distorted to give this tax credit to companies in New York investment firms and banks who hire millionaire stockbrokers and lawyers.  Can you believe that? Tax credits for millionaires; that is what the Democrat bill stands for.  Another principle Democrats have emphasized is these measures should be temporary, and they insist any tax measures cannot be more than 1 year long, but we have all kinds of spending measures in this mix that will have long-term impact. We also have a bond provision in the Democrat plan that the taxpayers will be paying for not 1 year but over 30 years. If that does not establish a double standard, I do not know what does.  We have a Washington Post editorial that is on a chart behind me. I am not going to go into detail about reading the whole article, but the headline is ``Meet Patriotic Pork.'' The editorial argues that Members are cloaking their underlying agenda under the name of patriotism and in the fight against terrorism. The editorial criticizes the House bill, which I also agree goes too far, but the editorial goes on to say that ``the Senators who larded this bill in committee ought to be ashamed of themselves.''  Madam President, that kind of says it in a nutshell. My objective is to work to make this bill a product of which we will not be ashamed; we will have a product of which neither Democrats nor Republicans will be ashamed. I know we will have a product of which the chairman of the committee, Senator Baucus, will not be ashamed. And I will be for it.  We need to get that process going. We need to do whatever it takes to make sure this bill will accomplish our goals, then, of helping the economy and the American people. Right now, it is obvious it does neither and our country deserves better. So this partisan, pork-ridden, lobbyist-written bill needs to be stopped, and we will stop it. Once this happens, then as things go in the Senate, reasonable heads will prevail, and we can sit down and work out a bipartisan compromise that meets the greatest needs of the Senators and we can vote for it.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a statement of position of administration policy.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                Executive Office of the President,                              Office of Management and Budget,                                Washington, DC, November 14, 2001.     Statement of Administration Policy     H.R. 3090--Economic Recovery and Assistance for American          Workers Act of 2001       The Administration opposes passage of H.R. 3090 as reported      by the Senate Finance Committee. The Administration believes      that it is crucial for Congress to quickly pass a stimulus      bill that will help get the economy going again following the      terrorist attacks of September 11th. This bill in its present      form will not accomplish this goal.       Instead of providing broad-based tax relief to restore      economic growth, this bill is an assembly of provisions that      do not provide immediate economic stimulus and are not      appropriate to this bill. For instance, $5 billion is set      aside for agricultural programs, including payments for bison      meat, and more than $4 billion is directed to tax credit      bonds for Amtrak.       Furthermore, some of the proposals in H.R. 3090 as reported      by the Senate Finance Committee would require at least six      months to one year to take effect due to their unprecedented      nature, the need for new Federal regulations, and the      requirement for new health insurance authorizations from      State legislatures. Proposals that effectively start next      summer and purportedly end next winter will neither provide      immediate assistance for displaced workers nor rapid stimulus      for the economy. Indeed, economic growth could suffer      substantially as a result of these provisions. In contrast to      the President's proposal to give prompt aid to displaced      workers and provide broad-based tax relief that will speed      their reemployment, this bill's unprecedented expansion of      unemployment insurance and the new health care entitlements      would likely increase unemployment by hundreds of thousands      of workers next year.       These provisions have one feature in common however: each      is likely to permanently expand the size and scope of the      Federal government and its control over programs, such as      unemployment insurance, that have always been under State      purview.       The Administration also notes that the proposed expansion      of the work opportunity tax credit is duplicative since the      Administration has decided it will direct $700 million in      Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds to New York to      aid businesses affected by the terrorist attacks. The      Administration's decision was the result of consultations      with both New York State and city officials.       The Administration is opposed to efforts to attach      additional discretionary spending to the bill. The      Administration and Congress agreed to limit discretionary      spending to $686 billion and to provide $40 billion for the      emergency response to the terrorist attacks. These funds are      more than adequate to meet foreseeable needs. This agreement      should be upheld.       The Administration urges the Senate to work together across      party lines to pass a responsible economic stimulus package      that will provide an immediate boost to the economy. The      President believes that the best way to retain and create      jobs is through tax relief that improves incentives to work      and invest while restoring consumer and business confidence.      The President has set out the following four principles for      achieving these goals:       Accelerating marginal income tax rate reductions to provide      more money for consumers to spend and for entrepreneurs and      small businesses to retain and create more jobs;       Giving relief to low and moderate income workers to put      more money back in their pickets;       Providing partial expensing to encourage businesses to      invest and make new purchases; and       Eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax, which,      if unchecked, imposes job-killing higher taxes during an      economic downturn.       The President has also called for swift action to help      dislocated workers, through extensions of unemployment      benefits and health care assistance programs that can be      implemented without delay.       Unlike the version of H.R. 3090 reported by the Senate      Finance Committee, the President's framework would boost the      economy, help displaced workers get back to work quickly, and      create several hundred thousand more jobs. Accordingly, the      Administration urges the Senate to reject the Finance      Committee approach and instead to work in a bipartisan manner      to craft an economic stimulus package that reflects the      President's principles and encompasses provisions that will      provide an immediate and effective stimulus to the Nation's      economy.                         pay-as-you-go scoring       Any law that would reduce receipts or increase direct      spending is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirements of the      Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act.      Accordingly, H.R. 3090, or any substitute amendment in lieu      thereof that would reduce revenues or increase direct      spending, will be subject to the pay-as-you-go requirements.      OMB's scoring estimates are under development. The      Administration will work with Congress to ensure that any      unintended sequester of spending does not occur under current      law or the enactment of any other proposals that meet the      President's objectives.
