Speaker, news stories about fundraising during the 1996 Presidential campaign focused increasing national attention on the overwhelming need for campaign finance reform, and particularly the role of foreign money in U.S. campaigns.  The problem indeed is money. During the 1996 election, candidates for all Federal offices spent approximately $1.6 billion. That's ``B,'' as in billion. The pressure to raise huge sums of money is so intense that some candidates from both parties, apparently have started looking abroad for new sources of campaign contributions.  Since 1990, no matter which party controlled Congress, I have sponsored legislation that would ban foreign contributions to candidates for Federal office. Today, I'm reintroducing the Ethics in Foreign Lobbying Act of 1997.  My bill has three major points:  First, only U.S. citizens could contribute to Federal campaigns.  Federal law already purports to prohibit direct or indirect contributions by foreign nationals in U.S. elections. In fact, section 441e of the Federal Election Campaign Act [FECA] states:       It shall be unlawful for a foreign national directly or      through any other person to make any contributions of money      or any other thing of value, or to promise expressly or      impliedly to make any such contribution, in connection with      an election to any political office or in connection with any      primary election, convention or caucus held to select      candidates for any political office; or for any person to      solicit, accept, or receive any such contribution from a      foreign national.  This provision was enacted in response to longstanding congressional concern over foreign influence in American elections. Though this language appears to be locktight, many loopholes permit foreign influence on U.S. elections, many foreign entities are not covered by the statute, and there is a lack of enforcement of the law. Congress must strengthen and make sure the law is fully enforced.  Second, foreign-controlled companies would be prohibited from contributing to Federal elections through the PAC's of their U.S. subsidiaries.  My bill would prohibit contributions from PAC's sponsored by corporations that are more than 50-percent foreign owned, as well as contributions from PAC's sponsored by trade associations that derive 50 percent or more of their operating funds from foreign corporations.  Foreign citizens are already prohibited from contributing to U.S. political campaigns. Yet, every year foreign interests spend millions of dollars to influence the American political process. This money often comes in the form of political action committee contributions from foreign-controlled corporations or their trade associations. Just as foreign individuals are prohibited from contributing to U.S. campaigns, so should be PAC's that are controlled by foreign corporations and trade associations, for, in fact, under U.S. law, corporations are considered persons.  Due to a loophole in the FECA, American subsidiaries of foreign-owned companies may operate PAC's--the only restriction being that the PAC cannot solicit funds from foreign nationals or permit them to be involved in the policymaking decisions of the PAC. Consequently, many of the world's largest foreign multinational corporations and financial institutions contribute to U.S. campaigns through their U.S.-based subsidiaries. Through the creation of these foreign-sponsored PAC's, foreign companies can thus assert their influence on the U.S. election process--and on U.S. policy.  Consequently, administration of the FECA law has created a confusing system whereby it is illegal for individual foreign nationals to make political contributions, yet legal for foreign-controlled or foreign-owned corporations, subsidiaries, and trade associations to contribute, expend funds, and influence U.S. elections. The Federal Election Commission [FEC] through its advisory opinions has twice voted to exempt PAC's representing U.S. subsidiaries of foreign-owned or controlled corporations, as long as the PAC's are funded and operated by Americans. The FEC has asked Congress to enact legislation clarifying this issue, but Congress, to date, has refused to do so.  Third, contributors would be required to disclose the percentage of foreign ownership.  The data collection and clearinghouse responsibilities section of my bill is one of its most important aspects, because of the current difficulty in identifying the activities of foreign nationals and corporations. The FEC has no coherent system for tracking the millions of dollars spent by foreign interests and their PAC's on lobbying the U.S. Government. The current, disjointed data collection system provides a veil of secrecy over how and where foreign interests spend their money.  My bill would make this mysterious and inadequate process both more transparent and more accountable--without requiring new reporting. My bill would merely add an extra line to the statement of organization that is currently required by the FEC. PAC's controlled by corporations would be required to state the percentage that the corporations are foreign-owned, and PAC's sponsored by trade associations would be required to state the percentage of their operating fund that is derived from foreign-owned corporations. In addition, it would require that all data collected by Federal agencies on foreign campaign contributions and foreign agents, as well as any testimony before the Congress regarding the interests of a foreign principal, be sent to the FEC.  Most important, my bill would make the disclosure of related expenditures available and visible at a central source by creating a clearinghouse for data that is currently collected, but is scattered among various Government agencies, including the FEC and the Department of Justice.  In establishing a clearinghouse, we would create a greatly needed central point for collecting information. Most of the information is already available, but it is housed in a myriad of Federal agencies and offices. Bringing the information together under one roof will provide the Government, the Congress, and the public with improved access to the data. The timing requirement for reporting conforms with the quarterly reports required in the 1946 Foreign Lobbying Act. The reporting requirementsplace the burden of reporting the percent of foreign ownership on the PAC's themselves, with penalties for noncompliance.  The United States is one of very few countries that allows foreign interests to contribute to its campaigns. Most of our major trading competitors--for example, China, Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, and Mexico--all strictly forbid foreign campaign contributions. There is no reason why the United States should be any different.  In the interest of protecting our sovereignty and maintaining a political system that reflects the will of the American people, the United States since 1938 has attempted to restrain the ability of foreign governments, individuals, organizations, and corporate entities to influence our domestic political system. By amendment, first to the FARA and later to the Federal Election Campaign Act [FECA], the United States has sought to prevent campaign contributions and expenditures by foreign interests.  There is no reason to allow foreign money to influence our elections or permit foreign interests to buy access to our elected lawmakers and thereby put their imprint on public policy in this country.  Mr. Speaker, clearly the time for campaign finance reform has come. Our system needs to be fixed. We must eliminate foreign money from our political system once and for all and regain sovereignty in our election system, which is the cornerstone of our democracy.  This time Congress must act and must get it right.                          ____________________
