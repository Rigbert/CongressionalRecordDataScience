 President, of course, none of what the majority leader listed has been offered. Not a single consent to allow any of those votes has been offered. That is the point of this vote.  In order to deal with energy--the No. 1 issue in America--we need to have an open process, such as on the Energy bills of 2007 and 2005, where all of the amendments relative and important to this issue have a chance to be considered here in the Senate. None of that has been offered.  The only way it will be offered is to vote ``no'' on getting off this subject and staying on the No. 1 subject in America, open up the process, and allow amendments on all of the issues the majority leader referred to and move forward. That is the way we legislate in the Senate.
