Congress finds that--       (1) the populations of all but 1 species of rhinoceros, and      the tiger, have significantly declined in recent years and      continue to decline;       (2) these species of rhinoceros and tiger are listed as      endangered species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973      (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) and listed on Appendix I of the      Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of      Wild Fauna and Flora, signed on March 3, 1973 (27 UST 1087;      TIAS 8249) (referred to in this title as ``CITES'');       (3) the Parties to CITES have adopted several resolutions--       (A) relating to the conservation of tigers (Conf. 9.13      (Rev.)) and rhinoceroses (Conf. 9.14), urging Parties to      CITES to implement legislation to reduce illegal trade in      parts and products of the species; and       (B) relating to trade in readily recognizable parts and      products of the species (Conf. 9.6), and trade in traditional      medicines (Conf. 10.19), recommending that Parties ensure      that their legislation controls trade in those parts and      derivatives, and in medicines purporting to contain them;       (4) a primary cause of the decline in the populations of      tiger and most rhinoceros species is the poaching of the      species for use of their parts and products in traditional      medicines;       (5) there are insufficient legal mechanisms enabling the      United States Fish and Wildlife Service to interdict products      that are labeled or advertised as containing substances      derived from rhinoceros or tiger species and prosecute the      merchandisers for sale or display of those products; and       (6) legislation is required to ensure that--       (A) products containing, or labeled or advertised as      containing, rhinoceros parts or tiger parts are prohibited      from importation into, or exportation from, the United      States; and       (B) efforts are made to educate persons regarding      alternatives for traditional medicine products, the      illegality of products containing, or labeled or advertised      as containing, rhinoceros parts and tiger parts, and the need      to conserve rhinoceros and tiger species generally.
