You do not see that when you go into a securities office or an investment bank on Wall Street. There is not any kind of taxpayer backup of the gambling, professional gambling in a sense, that is done through those investment banks.  What I find really reprehensible about this proposal is that those individuals who chose to gamble, they knew what they were doing. Now whether they explained it to the people who used those institutions to place their money in private instruments, that is another question. But we have no obligation by the taxpayers of this country to prop up the investment banks of this country or the world.
