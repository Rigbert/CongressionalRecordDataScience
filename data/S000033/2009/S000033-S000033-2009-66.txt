 President, as a result of the greed, the recklessness, and the illegal behavior of a handful of executives on Wall Street, we are in the midst of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. Millions of Americans from one end of this country to the other have lost their jobs, they have lost their homes, they have lost their savings, they have lost their ability to send their kids to college, and they have lost their hope. In fact, just this morning, we have learned that the official unemployment rate is now a staggering 10.2 percent--the highest in over 26 years.  Since the recession began in December of 2007, 8.2 million Americans have lost their jobs and the unemployment rate has more than doubled. In total, today 15.7 million Americans are officially unemployed; another 9.3 million are working part time--they want to work 40 hours a week, but they are only working part time; and 2.2 million workers have given up looking for work altogether. When you add those three factors together--official unemployment, people who have given up looking for work, and people working part time who want to work full time--what you are left with is an incredible 17.5 percent of the American workforce unemployed or underemployed--27 million Americans. And when we go out and we find that people are angry or hurt or depressed, that is one of the reasons.  Over a year has gone by since Congress--against my vote--passed the $700 billion bailout for Wall Street.
