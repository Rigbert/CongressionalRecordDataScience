 President, I urge my colleagues to oppose the Feingold amendment. Simply put, this amendment mandates withdrawal from Iraq within 90 days, notwithstanding the substantial progress that even the harshest critics acknowledge is occurring there. Further, it cuts off funds for those troops in 9 months. We have taken this vote three times already this year. That is three times we voted on this this year. It has failed on a bipartisan basis each time, and with good reason.  I urge my colleagues to oppose the Feingold amendment one more time.
