As you may know, National Nurses' Week is celebrated from May 6 through 12. Nurses play a crucial role in our health care system. The need for attention to detail, medical expertise, time management, critical thinking, and compassion shape a vocation that is more than a career. Professional nurses make enduring investments in their patients' lives.  Nursing is the largest health care occupation, with over 2.5 million nurses nationwide. In my State of Oklahoma, there are over 25,000 registered nurses alone. Nurses are found in a wide variety of settings, including hospitals, doctors' offices, schools, nursing homes, community clinics, and even the battlefield. Nurses do more than treat wounds and assist doctors. They help us all, regardless of age or standing, from the tiniest premature baby to the senior who has a life full of memories. They comfort those in pain, ease children's fears, educate students, attend deliveries, and offer assurance to worried parents. Nurses are trained to take care of the whole patient, sick or healthy.  It is no coincidence that the last day of National Nurses' Week, May 12, is also the birthday of Florence Nightingale, the founder of the modern nursing profession. Her work set an example of commitment to patients that can be seen and felt even today. The skill, dedication, and strength of our nurses are too often overlooked. Quality of life has increased for many Oklahomans, myself included, as a result of a nurse's actions and care. Nursing is among the noblest professions.  Madam President, I ask that you join me today in honoring nurses both in Oklahoma and all across the Nation.                          ____________________
