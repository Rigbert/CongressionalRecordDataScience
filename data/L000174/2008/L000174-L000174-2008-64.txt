President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee amendments be withdrawn; that a Leahy substitute amendment, which is at the desk, be agreed to; the bill, as amended, be read a third time and passed; the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate; and any statements related to the bill be printed in the Record.
