Speaker, I rise today to honor the Town of Winchester, one of the oldest communities in Riverside County. On October 5, 2013, the town will celebrate its 125th anniversary. Winchester has a rich and colorful past, and will continue to contribute to the landscape, diversity and history of our county and the State of California.  Settlers came to Winchester in the late 1800s for its warm weather and open space abounding with potential for growth. Rich and fertile farm lands and natural resources kept the early settlers in Pleasant Valley and helped create the thriving community it is today. The Angelo Domenigoni and Gaudenzio Garbini families first settled in the area in 1879.  These early settlers established a town site, which they named Winchester, after the widow of Horace Winchester, Mrs. Amy Winchester. Shortly thereafter, in 1880, the first post office was established, and original settler, Angelo Domenigoni appointed the first Postmaster. Soon, other families including the Patterson, Rice, and Haslam clans joined the community. These early families agreed that a Methodist Church should be established, and after much support from the town, in 1887 a church was built at the site of Rock House.  In pursuit of establishing a town of likeminded people, landowners Amy Winchester, Elizabeth Rice, Dennis O'Leary and Reverend J.G. Miller hired T.M. Parsons to draw a map of their proposed town site, which was submitted to the County of San Diego on January 23, 1888, and is still used to this day. In 1893, the County of Riverside was formed and Winchester became a census-designated place of the new community. F.L. Loveland of Winchester was given the honor of serving as the first supervisor for Riverside County.  The citizens of Winchester continued to make significant contributions to the county throughout its development. In 1896, F.T. Lindenberger of Winchester was elected to the California State Assembly. Mr. Lindenberger had been a long standing fixture within the town, owning a farm known as ``Olive Green,'' located at the cross of Lindenberger and Newport roads. Dr. Charles S. Dickson, M.D., the neighborhood doctor, became one of the first Coroners of Riverside County in 1898. From 1890 to 1929, Tilla Patterson Hudson served as a station agent for the Santa Fe Railroad. Concurrently, Ms. Hudson served as a Wells Fargo agent from 1890 to 1919, making her the longest serving female Wells Fargo agent in California.  I salute the community of Winchester on their 125th anniversary, a community that has significantly contributed to the active, historical, and thriving nature of Riverside County. Though small in size, it has added mightily to the county and state in which it resides. I am honored to represent Winchester in the House of Representatives and look forward to continuing to serve its residents as the Member of Congress for the 42nd District of California.                          ____________________
