Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, this House passed H.R. 3783, the Surface Transportation Extension Act of 2004, which provide for a 4-month extension of the highway construction, highway safety, transit, motor carrier and surface transportation research programs.  This bill provides for a 2-month extension, and includes the best provisions of the House bill and also some provisions sought by the other body. This bill is a bipartisan effort.  I hope this breaks the logjam that is currently in place. I can say to the gentleman from Minnesota, he and I know we should have had the 4 months, but the other body is insisting on 2 months. We made it as clean as possible, and they insisted on 2 months. So now we can possibly get this logjam finished so we can finish this legislation that is crucially important.  I do thank the gentleman for his cooperation on this issue. I am sorry we kept everybody here late tonight; but I cannot run the other body, as much as I would like to. Now we have to get this done so we do not stop our highway programs.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleague to help me out and pass this legislation that is badly needed.
