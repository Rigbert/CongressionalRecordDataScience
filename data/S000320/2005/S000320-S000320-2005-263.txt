 President, I rise in opposition to the amendment offered by my colleague from Minnesota, Senator Dayton. Basically, he has offered an amendment to create a Federal usury law. While I understand and appreciate the good intentions of my colleague, I cannot support what amounts to Federal price controls. This is a mode of regulation from a bygone day.  Price controls are a failed experiment that often hurt those who they are intended to help. Even if the price control envisioned in this amendment was never triggered, it would set a very bad precedent.  Credit underwriting is the assessment of the risk. Interest rates are intended to reflect the risk of a particular credit. They have to.  While I appreciate my colleague's concerns, I fear that his amendment will result in credit becoming less accessible to more Americans. Market forces are the best regulator of prices. As chairman of the Banking Committee, which has jurisdiction over consumer credit and price controls, I must oppose this amendment and encourage my colleagues to do so. We are going to have some hearings on similar matters in the Banking Committee, and I hope Senator Dayton would work with us in that regard.
