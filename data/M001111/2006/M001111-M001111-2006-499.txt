 President, I am very proud to be in the Senate today to support the Senator from Hawaii, Senator Akaka, in offering this amendment, the current pending business regarding adding additional funds for our veterans who have served us so honorably overseas every day in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Can the Senator yield to another Senator?
