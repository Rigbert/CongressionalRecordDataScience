Madam Chairman, just to respond again, it is a very unuseful fiction. The diplomatic fiction sometimes has a place. I do not like it. I like absolute honesty, transparency, everything on the table when dealing with something.  That is why Ambassador Lilley's testimony was so compelling. He said, you are going to go to Kamchang-Ri and you are not going to see anything. They have had sufficient time to move everything out.  For the gentleman from New York (Mr. Ackerman), my good friend, to raise it as an example of some kind of compliance, I think misleads, however unintentionally he is doing that.
