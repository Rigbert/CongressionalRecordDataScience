The Senator from Arizona has been most helpful in trying to help this along, to get the antinepotism bill up, but also have the time to do the Fletcher nomination.  What I understand the Senator from Mississippi and the Senator from Arizona want to do is to get something locked in so we can take care of both those.  There were some who wanted a rollcall vote on the nepotism bill. Is the distinguished leader saying it would be easier for his scheduling if there was not one? I came to this conversation late; I apologize.
