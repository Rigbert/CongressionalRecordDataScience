President, I note again there has been an objection.  I would only state that I don't see how anyone could consider what I have proposed to be a partisan issue. I and our colleague from Arkansas, Senator Cotton--a military veteran--have joined in an effort, which I would just say to the Senators who are on the floor, is going to be one of the great threats of our time.  We know that hostile foreign actors are going to target the personal accounts and devices of government officials. Russia clearly demonstrated the opportunities for meddling in the last election. Now, we know that those opportunities are going to grow exponentially in the days and months ahead. So I only want to pass on that I think this is regrettable, and there has been an objection, and I just hope we will be able to pass this bill before more people are hacked and their stolen data is exploited by hostile foreign actors.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
