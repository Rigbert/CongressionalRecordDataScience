Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to introduce H.R. 3013, a bill to amend the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act to allow shareholders common stock to be transferred to adopted Alaska native children and their descendants and for other purposes.  This bill is very similar to H.R. 2803, however, the Alaska Federation of Natives and the Department of the Interior have agreed to delete Section 7, the Partial Section Selections from the original bill. Other provisions in the bill contains revised language recommended by the Department of the Interior to address some of their concerns.  Again, Mr. Speaker, I am introducing H.R. 3013 with language revision changes to three provisions of H.R. 2803. This is to allow our Committee to hold a hearing next Wednesday on a new and expanded version of H.R. 2803 which reflects changes recommended by the Alaska Federation of Natives and the Department of the Interior.                          ____________________
