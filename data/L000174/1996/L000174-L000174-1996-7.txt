President, one of the most egregious differences between the immigration bill passed by the Senate many months ago and the bill now thrust on us for final passage is the permanent and nationwide waiver of our environmental laws for border control activities.  Like most of the American public, I am fed up with attacks on our important environmental laws. Failing to gut the Endangered Species Act and the National Environmental Policy Act, some Members of Congress have resorted to backdoor stealth attacks on these laws. Now Republicans include a gratuitous attach on our wildlife and ecosystems through, of all things, an immigration bill.  The nationwide scope of the environmental waivers in the immigration bill reaches far and beyond the goals of strong immigration control. By exempting all road construction, bridge construction, and barrier construction along the entire U.S. border from the Endangered Species Act, the waiver will permanently weaken national and international wildlife conservation.  Like many provisions in the immigration bill, this provision was inserted during the Republican-only House-Senate conference, and now the bill grants a permanent and nationwide waiver of the National Environmental Policy Act, the fundamental charter of our environmental protection.  Claims that the Endangered Species Act or the National Environmental Policy Act delay or stop the INS from controlling illegal immigration are wholly unsubstantiated. These laws should not be waived or exempted without full congressional consideration, hearings and public debate, and need not be waived in these circumstances.  Simply put, the ESA requires all Federal agencies to avoid adverse impacts on endangered and threatened species. Immigration and Naturalization Service staff are not biology experts. When the INS makes plans to build a road through a remote border area on public lands they consult with the Fish and Wildlife Service biologists to ensure that their plans are ecologically sound. For instance, when INS wanted to build a border bridge in Texas, biologists asked them to minimize impact on nearby wetlands by lifting the bridge out of the flood plain 2 feet. That was all that it took.  Consultation with the Fish and Wildlife Service is painless--it usually costs little in time or money to the INS, but it can mean the difference between recovery and extinction for a border species like the Sonoran Pronghorn antelope or the ocelot, an endangered cat.  The Fish and Wildlife Service has consulted with Federal agencies over 195,000 times in the last 16 years. Only 0.05 percent of those projects have been withdrawn or canceled because of the ESA. The ESA is flexible enough to accommodate even emergency situations and Fish and Wildlife biologists can review an INS construction project in a matter of hours when necessary.  The National Environmental Policy Act, signed by President Nixon in 1969, requires INS to give taxpayers a chance to review and comment on the environmental impacts of INS projects. Republicans now want to shortchange citizen's opportunities to participate in decisionmaking affecting their communities. NEPA also requires INS to examine reasonable alternatives to a project before investing taxpayer funds.  It is also flexible enough to accommodate emergency situations. For example, Bureau of Land Management recently requested an expedited NEPA review to build roads and a helicopter landing pad near the border area. It seems that high illegal alien use and high forest fire risk required quick action. The NEPA review was completed within 24 hours and the road construction took place immediately.  In a September 16 letter, Janet Reno, Bruce Babbitt, and Katie McGinty stated their unequivocal opposition to these waivers in the immigration bill. They know, as I do, that granting future Attorneys General the ability to sidestep important environmental laws will mean disaster for our Nation's environmental integrity.  The administration is currently negotiating environmental agreements with Canada and Mexico, and the passage of these waivers could undermine the future of these agreements. How can we possibly expect Mexico to take actions to protect their ecosystems on one side of the border when we so flagrantly disregard the laws protecting our own natural heritage?  I object to the immigration bill because it differs so wildly from the bill we passed earlier this year. The stealth environmental waivers in this bill are unnecessary, unjustified, and mean-spirited. They will harm our children's right to inherit an environmentally-sound nation and set a terrible precedent for environmental waivers.                               division d
