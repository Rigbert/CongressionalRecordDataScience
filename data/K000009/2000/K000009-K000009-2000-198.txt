Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Brown) for coming to the floor, and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell), and I would say that I have a sinking feeling that the Republican leadership of this House is about to call a point of order against our amendment and not permit us to pass a program to help American workers who are going to lose their jobs to China.  I think that is unconscionable. I have the greatest respect for the gentleman who chairs this particular subcommittee, but I know that the leadership of his party approached me prior to this vote and asked if I was really going to offer that amendment. I said, yes, we are.  I would ask the American people to know what is about to happen here. We need to help America's workers who are going to lose their jobs to China.                             Point of Order  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. Does the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Porter) insist on his point of order?
