 Snowe, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Specter, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Bayh, Ms. Stabenow, and Mr. Feingold) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:                              S. Res. 598       Whereas scientists estimate that approximately \1/10\ of      the world's known biological diversity is currently in danger      of extinction, including at least \1/4\ of all mammals, \1/3\      of all primates, \1/3\ of all amphibians, and \1/8\ of all      birds;       Whereas scientists have concluded that the initial stages      of a major worldwide extinction event are occurring now and      have estimated that by the end of the 21st century as much as      \2/3\ of the world's plant and animal species could be in      danger of extinction;       Whereas scientists estimate that approximately \3/4\ of the      world's terrestrial plant and animal species reside in whole      or in part in developing nations, where in many cases poor      management of natural resources has exacerbated the threat of      extinction to many species and directly harmed local      communities;       Whereas, in addition to producing 20 percent of the world's      carbon emissions, unsustainable forestry practices and      illegal logging operations have led to the destruction of      vast areas of forested land around the world, which, in turn,      has led to species loss, increased flooding, erosion, insect      infestations, and higher incidences of malaria and other      infectious diseases;       Whereas the degradation of the marine environment and      unsustainable fishing practices in many parts of the world      have led to dramatic declines of many fish and other marine      species;       Whereas the introduction of invasive species threatens      natural habitats;       Whereas scientists have concluded that many species could      face an increased risk of extinction from global climate      change;       Whereas sound natural resource management and the      conservation of species and habitats are vital to alleviating      poverty for many communities in developing countries that      depend on these resources for their livelihoods, food,      medicinal compounds, housing material, and other necessities;       Whereas there are significant risks to the global and      national economies from the destruction of natural resources      around the world and the valuable services they provide, such      as water and air purification, soil fertility and erosion      control, flood and drought mitigation, protection from storm      surges, and the sequestration of carbon;       Whereas human encroachment into natural ecosystems      increases opportunities for the emergence and transmission of      new animal-borne diseases that could cause high levels of      human mortality and affect major global industries including      travel, trade, tourism, food production, and finance;       Whereas loss of species can jeopardize important future      pharmaceutical discoveries, given that more than \1/4\ of all      medicinal drugs possess active ingredients from wild species      and that at least \1/2\ of the most prescribed medicines in      the United States are derived from natural compounds;       Whereas natural pollinators and the opportunities of wild      and domesticated crossbreeding are vital to world and United      States agriculture;       Whereas poverty aggravated by natural resource degradation      contributes to political instability, ethnic and sectarian      conflict, and the social conditions that can fuel increased      violence and terrorism;       Whereas the extinction of plant and animal species raises      profound ethical questions, and many religious traditions      call upon human beings to act as good stewards of the Earth;       Whereas opportunities for sustainably managing natural      resources and conserving viable populations of species and      their habitats rapidly diminish every year;       Whereas a substantial body of academic and field research      has identified global strategies and market based approaches      for better managing natural resources and protecting      biological diversity;       Whereas strategic large-scale and site-specific habitat      conservation could help to buffer the impacts of climate      change on endangered species and human communities;       Whereas an effective international conservation effort that      ensures the use of natural resources on a sustainable basis      and prevents the worst predicted extinction scenarios from      unfolding will require commitment and action from all      nations; and       Whereas the United States's traditional role in confronting      international challenges, protecting the environment,      expanding opportunities for people, and articulating a moral      vision for global action gives the Nation the opportunity to      lead an international conservation effort: Now, therefore, be      it       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--       (1) the Government should make full use of Federal laws,      regulations and policies, diplomatic agreements, and other      appropriate mechanisms to--       (A) identify global conservation goals that help ensure the      sustainable use of natural resources and protect biological      diversity in terrestrial and marine environments of      developing countries;       (B) focus international conservation efforts on natural      areas that are important biodiversity conservation priorities      and for which there is a good likelihood of success;       (C) raise the international profile of the debate by      putting the issue of rapidly declining global biodiversity      and poor natural resource management on the agenda of major      international decision-making bodies;       (D) work with other donor nations to increase funding and      other support for global conservation strategies that focus      on achieving each of the goals identified in subparagraphs      (A) through (C); and       (E) achieve meaningful progress in the next 5 years toward      the goals identified in subparagraphs (A) through (C);       (2) the United States should use diplomatic mechanisms,      relevant international institutions and agreements, and other      appropriate mechanisms to lead other nations toward the     goals and actions identified in paragraph (1); and       (3) the efforts of Federal agencies should reflect a      recognition of the extreme urgency of the problem and      recognize that opportunities for increased conservation are      rapidly dwindling, by annually providing to the appropriate      Committees of Congress progress reports and action plans with      regard to the goals and activities identified in paragraphs      (1) and (2).
