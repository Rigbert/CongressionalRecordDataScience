 President, the GreenLane Maritime Security Cargo Act does five things.  First of all, it creates tough new standards for all of our cargo. Today, we don't have any standards for cargo security.  Second, it creates the GreenLane, which provides an even higher level of security. Companies have the option to follow those higher standards of the GreenLane, and their cargo--those companies which agree to that--will be tracked and monitored from the moment it leaves a factory floor overseas until it reaches the United States. We will know where that cargo has been, we will know every person who has touched it, and we will know if it has been tampered with.
