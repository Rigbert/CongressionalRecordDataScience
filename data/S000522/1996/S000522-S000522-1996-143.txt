Mr. Chairman, if the gentleman will yield, I thank the gentleman from Florida for expressing these concerns. It is clearly not the intent of this bill to preclude new Border Patrol agents from serving in coastal States with a high incidence of illegal entry into the United States. I recognize the serious nature of the illegal immigration problems facing Florida and the importance of maintaining a strong Border Patrol presence in that State. I can assure the gentleman that I will be supportive of his efforts to prevent a further degradation of Florida's Border Patrol.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
