  I rise in support of the fiscal year 2002 Transportation appropriations conference report before the Senate this morning. While I do not support every item, policy, program, or initiative in the conference report or statement of managers, I do support the package reported overwhelmingly from the conference committee and as just described by the Senator from Washington.  This is the first year the Senator from Washington is chair of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, and I believe that she has accounted herself well on this bill. This is a balanced bill.  Clearly, the Mexican truck issue reflects that balanced approach. I believe that the Senator from Washington did an admirable job of managing this issue through a lengthy debate on the Senate floor and through the conference committee negotiations with the House and the administration.
