Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I intend to withdraw the amendment after a brief discussion due to an understanding with the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Bonilla) to look for funds for the celebration of the centennial anniversary of National 4-H as we move toward conference.  Also, I do this out of respect for the National 4-H leadership that has committed not to have those funds come at the expense of existing extension programs which are already stretched.                              {time}  1145  Our amendment would provide funding pursuant to an authorization that was approved by the House 2 weeks ago when we voted for S. 657, the National 4-H Program Centennial Initiative. The centennial will occur next year, but planning obviously needs to begin immediately. In fact, the President signed the relevant legislation yesterday. That measure was a companion bill to H.R. 1388, introduced by the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Ganske). That measure authorized $5 million for the National 4-H Council, with the expectation that those funds would be matched by private contributions, and it also assumed the Secretary could use the Fund for Rural America to finance some of the operations. However, there is money for neither of these options in the bill.  Now, I think every American has been touched in some way by 4-H. It operates in over 3,000 counties in each of our States and provides truly constructive opportunities to young men and women in both rural and urban areas. Just the fact that this magnificent organization has existed for a century is something all Americans can truly celebrate.  But should this appropriation bill move forward without at least beginning to address the funding issue, there is the risk that the support for the centennial initiative would come too late. The amount today that is in my amendment, $500,000, is only one-tenth of the amount that is necessary, but it would get the activity going and demonstrates we are serious about full support.  Over the coming months, between now and the final conference on the bill, proponents will be in a position to work to identify the right amount of resources needed for the program and to secure additional funds for this bill. While today's amendment suggests that $500,000 out of existing extension funds could be used, the long-term intention is to obtain an increase for extension to finance the activity.  So, Mr. Chairman, in withdrawing this amendment, let me just say that this Member, and I think the entire membership of the House, in voting for this centennial celebration, would want to assure the success of all activities related to it. The planning that must begin this year and all the celebrations in the year 2002, will touch thousands and thousands of lives of young people in our communities and all the good works that they do. The 4-H deserve the full support of this Congress, and we look forward to working with the chairman as we move toward conference.
