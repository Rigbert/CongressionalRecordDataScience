Mr. Speaker, I am introducing today a bill which would terminate the United States arms embargo applicable to the Government of Bosnia-Herzegovina.  The situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina today is dismal. After three winters of war, there is still no end in sight. The contact group plan of last summer, which had been offered with a 2-week deadline for an unconditional response, has been held open indefinitely to the Bosnian Serbs to accept. The Bosnians, who accepted the plan on time and without condition, have watched the international community subsequently ease sanctions on Serbia, despite the fact that it was Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic that instigated this conflict and sustains the aggressors who rejected the plan. The Bosnians have heard our Secretary of State explain how the contact group formed to respond to the Bosnian conflict is somehow more important than the conflict itself, and that preserving NATO is more important than meeting the challenges Europe faces today.  Meanwhile, the Bosnians feel the human suffering and the injustice of continuing conflict. That is their reward for working with the international community, human suffering, and injustice.  The problem we now confront in Bosnia-Herzegovina is quite straightforward. The Serb militants occupy over 70 percent of Bosnia-Herzegovina, while the contact group settlement grants the Serbs 49 percent of the country. Mr. Speaker, the international community has absolutely no plan for getting the Serbs to relinquish control of and return that one-third of the territory they seized by force.  Yes, the contact group countries meet with each other, with the Bosnians, with the Serb militants. They convene additional conferences to bring the sides together. We have seen this for nearly 3 years, a farcical display of resolve in contrast to the horrible tragedy on the ground. This approach has not worked, and there is no reason to believe it will now.  As many have said from the beginning, a unilateral lifting of the arms embargo on Bosnia-Herzegovina is a last option. Until now, the international community, including the United States, has not taken genuine action to enforce U.N. Security Council resolutions regarding Bosnia-Herzegovina, despite having the authority to do so. It has not intervened to stop Serb aggression with punitive air strikes or other measures, despite the fact that the genocidal nature of this aggression should have compelled us legally and morally to do so. And the United States has not sought--really and formally sought--a multilateral lifting of the arms embargo on Bosnia-Herzegovina, despite that U.N. member's inherent right to its own self-defense. Absent these other measures, Mr. Speaker, we have no other recourse than at least to lift the U.S. arms embargo on Bosnia-Herzegovina.  Of course, until such time that this bill is passed and its provisions go into effect, President Clinton can seek to make the lifting of the embargo a multilateral action at the United Nations. He can also take other decisive steps to compel the Bosnian Serb militants to accept the contact group plan. But time is running out. The present course is untenable, and to support its continuation--even implicitly by our own inaction--would be irresponsible.  It is therefore my hope, Mr. Speaker, that the Clinton administration will take the time they are now using to defeat congressional efforts to lift the embargo, and use it instead to get others to agree to what we all would prefer, a multilateral lifting. After all, it was 2 years ago last Friday that Secretary of State Christopher, unveiling the administration's Bosnia policy, lamented the fact that the West had repeatedly missed earlier opportunities to effectively address the conflict and prevent it from deepening. The Secretary said: ``Our conscience revolts at the idea of passively accepting such brutality. It tests our commitment to the nurturing of democracy.'' Recognizing the implications of the Bosnian crisis he warned, ``The world's response to the violence in the former Yugoslavia is an early and crucial test of how it will address the concerns of ethnic and religious minorities in the post-cold-war world.''  One year ago, in the aftermath of the market place massacre in Sarajevo, President Clinton himself echoed this view when he said, ``This century teaches us that America cannot afford to ignore conflicts in Europe. And in this case, our Nation has distinct interests.'' He concluded, ``While the cold war may be over, the world is still full of dangers and the world still looks to America for leadership.'' And let us not forget his inaugural address, when he vowed that, ``When our vital interests are challenged or the will and conscience of the international community is defied, we will act, with peaceful diplomacy whenever possible, with force when necessary.''  Let the Congress be clearly understood, the issue of Bosnia's survival is important and must be addressed. It is a bipartisan issue, where the most conservative and the most liberal share a common outrage over the inhumanity that has been allowed to take place in that country.  This applies as well to the Senate, where Senators Dole and Lieberman have already introduced an identical bill. I hope, Mr. Speaker, for the opportunity to move on this legislation quickly, and today I am joined by the ranking minority member of the Helsinki Commission, Mr. Hoyer, Commission members, Mr. Markey, Mr. Wolf, Mr. Cardin, and Mr. Bonior, Ms. Molinari, Mr. Royce, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Rohrabacher, Mr. Moran, and Mr. Wynn.                          ____________________
