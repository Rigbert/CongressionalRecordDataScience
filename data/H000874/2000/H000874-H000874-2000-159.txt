Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, I have worked on HIDTA since we created the HIDTAs back in the 1980s. I am a very enthusiastic supporter of HIDTAs. For those of my colleagues who may not be specifically knowledgeable of HIDTA, HIDTA is a High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area. We adopted the premise of HIDTAs in the drug reform bill in which we adopted the Office of National Drug Control Policy and the director, who is affectionately referred to as the Drug Czar. We did so in an effort to ensure that we had coordination not only among Federal agencies in fighting the drug problem and securing our communities from the scourge of drugs, but we did so for the purposes of ensuring that we had coordination of our assets that are deployed by the Federal, State and local governments. In fact, in my opinion, the biggest benefit in HIDTA is not the money, although the money is important, and it funds the intelligence effort that all levels can access so in that respect, it is critically important. But its greatest contribution, in my opinion, is the coordination between Federal, State and local law enforcement that it has brought.  Mr. Chairman, it needs more money. Very frankly, I could support a sum greater than the gentleman from Louisiana offers in his amendment for adding to HIDTA.
