 President, I rise today to recognize Ardis Dumett for her 20 years of service to the U.S. Senate and the people of Washington State. Ardis has served on my staff for the last 16 years of her distinguished public career. For 4 years prior to her service in my office, she worked for the revered Senator Henry ``Scoop'' Jackson. On January 20, Ardis retired from my office. We are sad to see her go and hope that she enjoys her well-earned retirement.  Throughout her career, Ardis has been a thoughtful and dedicated public servant. Initially, as my constituent services director, she led by example in her commitment and compassion to the constituents of Washington State. Covering immigration and environmental casework, she ensured the people of my State were well served by their Federal Government.  As the director of special projects in my Seattle office, she worked on numerous issues on my behalf over the years, ranging from the environment and emergency response to tribes and the transfer of military property. She worked tirelessly to guarantee that our State's people and communities received a fair process--and often a successful outcome--when working with Federal agencies. Over the years I have received many notes from constituents thanking me for Ardis' diligent work.  I would like to thank Ardis for her years of service to me and the people of Washington State. Her career is a tremendous example of public service; and her dedication to her work is truly appreciated. I wish her all the best in her future endeavors.                          ____________________
