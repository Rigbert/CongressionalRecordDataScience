There will be suspension votes so that we do not have a lot of controversy.  I will say, however, as the gentleman well knows, that Monday will be a very important day because General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker will be on Capitol Hill on the House side testifying on their report to the Congress and to the American people with respect to their analysis of the present situation in Iraq and the present situation of our troops and the security and stability of that country.  So it will be a very important day, but the gentleman is correct, we will not be scheduling other than suspension votes for that Monday, and there will be no votes on Tuesday in recognition of the funeral and that so many Members will be attending the funeral.
