Under this amendment, we could not touch an online retailer that is wholly overseas shipping into the United States with UPS. We could not touch them.  What the Senator from North Dakota is talking about is obviously foreign corporations, people with physical presence. But if you are wholly overseas, an online Internet retailer shipping into this country, you get a free ride under this legislation. That is why it is going to create an incentive to take American jobs from here and locate overseas where they get a free ride.
