 The FSC bill, there has been a lot of talk about the FSC bill. Can the leader tell me when we might anticipate a FSC bill being on the floor or being marked up in committee?  Mr. DeLAY. If the gentleman will yield further, as we are doing this colloquy, the Speaker is contemplating how we can accommodate the ranking member of the Committee on Ways and Means who is going with the Speaker over the weekend for the D-Day celebration. I think we have at least tentatively worked out a schedule whereby the Committee on Ways and Means could do their markup on Wednesday or Thursday and have the bill on the floor the first of the week following.
