 President, I rise today in opposition to the conference report on the National Highway Systems bill. As my colleagues know, I am a strong supporter of infrastructure development, and am an especially strong supporter of the transportation infrastructure provided for in this bill which is so vital to my State. I appreciate the hard work of the Senators from Virginia, Rhode Island, and Montana, and I want to thank them and their staffs for their work in the difficult crafting of this legislation.  This conference report will provide California with $569 million in much needed and long overdue Federal highway funding for essential transportation projects. Unfortunately, however, the public safety measures included in the legislation compel me to oppose this conference report.  My specific concerns are with the repeal of the 55 miles per hour speed limit for automobiles, the lack of a national speed limit for trucks, and the repeal of Federal motorcycle helmet laws.                     repeal of national speed limit  According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, one third of all fatal crashes are speed related, and 1,000 people are killed every month in speed-related crashes.  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration predicts elimination of the national speed limit on nonrural interstates and noninterstate roads will increase deaths by 4,750 annually at a cost of $15-$19 billion in additional insurance costs. This amounts to an increase of $2 billion per year in California.  Almost 25 percent of all accidents in California are speed related. In California, the Highway Patrol reports that in 1994 there were 436 fatal accidents and 48,877 injuries that were speed related.                         speed limit for trucks  During initial consideration of this bill, Senator Reid offered an amendment to retain a national speed limit on trucks. I supported this amendment because, according to the California Highway Patrol, the State of California has seen a steady reduction in the number accidents, injuries and fatalities relating to accidents involving trucks since 1989.  In 1989, 647 people lost their lives and 17,703 people were injured in California as a result of 12,159 truck-related accidents.  By 1994, 451 people were killed and 13,512 injured in California as a result of 9,225 truck-related accidents.  I look forward to working with the administration and my colleagues in the Senate to address the growing problems associated with making these big rigs safe.                        motorcycle helmet repeal  Since enactment of California's motorcycle helmet law in 1992, the California Highway Patrol estimates that motorcycle fatalities have decreased by 41 percent and motorcycle injuries have decreased by 35 percent. I believe helmets save lives, and our Nation's highways will be a little less safe for all of us without their use.  In closing, let me say that I cannot support legislation that will very likely put greater numbers of traveling public at risk. Were this only an infrastructure bill, it would very likely have my support. Only time can tell if my concerns will be realized. If they are, I hope this body will take immediate action to remediate some of the changes this bill makes.
