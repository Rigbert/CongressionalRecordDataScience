Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding to me.  Mr. Chair, the amendment that I offer aims to expand the Department of Defense's authority to work with the Coast Guard on youth science, technology, engineering, and math programs.  For several years, I have worked closely with the U.S. Coast Guard to engage on youth STEM programs. Earlier this year, the Coast Guard came to me and acknowledged that to continue our efforts, they needed new authority and advice.
