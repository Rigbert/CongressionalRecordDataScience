Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, this is a very historical moment, one that is long overdue. In debate on the rule, there were some statements made that I think should be clarified before I go into the full text of my presentation today, why I support this legislation.  The Northern Marianas were mentioned and other territories were mentioned, and how they came into this great united part of our United States, even as territories are separate governments. But, for instance, the Northern Marianas, the Government of the United States and the Government of the Northern Marianas will consult regularly on all matters affecting the relationship between them. At the request of either government, and not less frequently than every 10 years there shall be an additional consultation taken.  Mr. Chairman, over 100 years ago, this Congress was passionately discussing the 400-year-old colonial grip that Spain had on the islands adjacent to and south of Florida. Just over 2 weeks earlier, on February 15, 266 American servicemen lost their lives in Havana harbor with the explosion of the United States warship, the Maine.                              {time}  1215  The monument to these gallant mean stands highest above all else in Arlington National Monument. Many others lost their lives in the ensuing Spanish-American War amid the cries of ``Remember the Maine.'' But why?  This Congress declared war and sent Americans in harm's way in the defense of the sacred ideal: self-determination. America won the war, and assumed sovereignty over Cuba, Puerto Rico, and some of Spain's Pacific possessions. All but one are no longer territories. Only Puerto Rico still stands, after 100 years, a territory.  Mr. Chairman, Congress promptly delivered on its promise of self-determination to the people of Cuba by providing for a process which permitted Cuba to become a separate sovereign after a few brief years.  In contrast, the Rough Rider who had charged up San Juan Hill to ensure the United States' victory in the Caribbean had become President of the United States and urged Congress to grant United States citizenship to the people of Puerto Rico in his 1905 State of the Union address. Quote, ``I earnestly advocate the adoption of legislation which will explicitly confer American citizenship on all citizens of Puerto Rico. There is, in my judgment, no excuse for the failure to do this.''  I believe President Teddy Roosevelt's words are even more true today to this bill as when he spoke them in 1905.  Our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico, now numbering some 4 million, have been loyal to this Nation and have valiantly fought in every major conflict. We have all benefited in ways that cannot be calculated from the bravery, the loyalty, and the patriotism of over 200,000 Americans from Puerto Rico who have served in our Nation's Armed Forces.  It is clear that a heavy price has been paid by Puerto Rico for this country, which has yet to fully deliver on the promise of the U.S. General Miles when he landed in Puerto Rico 100 years ago this year:  ``In the continuation of the war against the Kingdom of Spain by the people of the United States, in the cause of freedom, justice and humanity, their military forces have come to occupy the island of Puerto Rico. They come bearing the flag of freedom. They bring you the encouraging strength of a Nation of free people whose greatest power consists of justice and humanity for all those who live in their community. The principal objective will be to give the people of your beautiful island the largest extent of freedom possible. We have not come to wage war, but to bring protection, not just for you but for your property, in order to promote your prosperity and in order to obtain for you the privileges and the blessings of our government. It is not our purpose to interfere with any of the laws and customs present that are wise and beneficial.''  The Congress provided Puerto Rico with increasing levels of self-government for the first half of this century, culminating with the authorization in 1950 for the process of a development of a local constitutional government.  By 1952, Congress conditionally approved a draft constitution submitted by the legislature of Puerto Rico. After those changes were made by Puerto Rico, the new constitutional government of the territory became effective under the name declared by the constitutional convention as the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.  The establishment of local constitutional self-government did not alter Congress' constitutional responsibility under the Territorial Clause for Puerto Rico. However, it was under the first years of the commonwealth that President Eisenhower established the Eisenhower Doctrine regarding Puerto Rico which is still in effect today and is reflected in the United States-Puerto Rico Political Status Act.  After the local constitutional government of Puerto Rico was established, Puerto Rico was removed from the United Nations' decolonization list, prompting questions as to whether Puerto Rico was still a territory under the sovereignty of the United States and subject to the authority of Congress. President Eisenhower, a Republican, acted decisively by sending a message to the United Nations that he recommended that the United States Congress grant Puerto Rico separate sovereignty if requested by the Puerto Ricans through the legislature of Puerto Rico.  While the legislature has never petitioned for separate sovereignty, the legislature sent joint resolutions to Congress in 1993, 1994, and 1997 requesting congressional action. Keep that in mind, because I have heard time and again that the Congress, by doing this, is dictating to the Puerto Rican people. But the legislature sent to this Congress in 1993, 1994, 1997 requesting congressional action to define the political status and establish a process to resolve, establish the process to resolve Puerto Rico's political status dilemma.  Although in recent years the Puerto Rican legislature formally requested the Congress to resolve Puerto Rico's political status, U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico had been advocating action for over a decade. I remember the submission to Congress in 1985 to 1987 of over 350,000 individually signed petitions for full citizenship rights. This incredible grassroots effort was led by Dr. Miriam Ramirez of the nonprofit, nonpartisan civic organization, Puerto Ricans in Civic Action.  Mr. Chairman I believe this initiative influenced the then president of the Senate to include in his first State of the Union address as President on February 9, 1989, the following request: ``I've long believed the people of Puerto Rico should have their right to determine their own political future. Personally, I strongly favor statehood. But I urge the Congress to take the necessary steps to allow the people to decide in a referendum.''  Mr. Chairman, about the same time as President Bush requested Congress authorize a political status referendum in Puerto Rico, the three presidents of the three principal political status parties in Puerto Rico asked Congress to help resolve Puerto Rico's political status, as Puerto Rico has never been formally consulted as to their choice of ultimate political status.  While Congress has yet to formally respond to the request of the President, the leaders of Puerto Rico, and the petitions of the Americans in Puerto Rico, this bill will do just what has been asked by the people of Puerto Rico in numerous years and numerous times by the president of the Senate, by the Presidents in the past in their platforms.  The United States-Puerto Rico Political Status Act, H.R. 856, establishes in Federal law for the first time a process to resolve Puerto Rico's political status. I remind my colleagues it will not happen overnight, regardless of what we do here today. This is just a process that will take place.  My colleague who was speaking on the rule said that the public is not aware of this action today. May I remind my colleagues that if we were to pass this bill today, and I hope we do pass this bill today, it must be passed by the Senate and the people of Puerto Rico must also pass it in 1998. It comes back to the Congress in 1999, and by 1999 we again in Congress must act. We must pass a bill approving the transitional stage. Then it goes back to the people of Puerto Rico. And, by the way, the start of the transition period begins in the year 2000.  But this more than anything else is a bill that establishes the right to determine for the first time in 100 years their self-determination. It is a fair and balanced process that has been developed with an enormous amount of input. Mr. Chairman, I resent certain Members saying that this has not been fair. We asked all of those people involved, all three parties, to submit what their definition should be in this bill. We have in my substitute recognized commonwealth. We recognize independence. We set forth a process which will create a State.  Mr. Chairman, if it does become a State, I am one of the few people, along with the gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. Abercrombie) that has gone through this process.  I have heard some statements here today about English language only. When Alaska became a State, that was not a requirement. We had 52 different dialects in Alaska. People speak English. They also speak many other languages. It was not a requirement. Hawaii has two official languages. They have English and Hawaiian. New Mexico has two official languages, English and Spanish.  The concept of the amendments that will be offered to this bill, especially the amendment of the gentleman from New York (Mr. Solomon), he is mygood friend and we talk about what good friends we are, it is a poison pill amendment. America is a melting pot. It is a group of people coming together under one flag. We all speak different languages at different times. Some of us are more fortunate to speak more than one language, but we must always recognize the cohesive part of the United States, and that is being an American. English will come. But to pick out one part of this bill and to say this is a requirement before it ever happens is a poison pill amendment to this legislation.  Let us talk about history again. This is the last territory of the greatest democracy, America. A territory where no one has a true voice, although our government does an excellent job, but there are approximately 4 million Puerto Ricans that have one voice that cannot vote. This is not America as I know it. This is an America that talks one thing and walks another thing. This is an America that is saying, if Members do not accept this legislation, ``no'' to who I think are some of the greatest Americans that have ever served in our armed forces and are proud to be Americans but do not have the representation that they need.  This legislation is just the beginning. It is one small step of many steps. It is a step for freedom, it is a small step for justice, it is a small step for America. But collectively it is a great stride for democracy and for justice.  This legislation should pass. The amendment of the gentleman from New York (Mr. Solomon) should be defeated. We should go forth and show the people of America, show the people of Puerto Rico, that our hearts are true, so that the rest of the world will follow the example of the great United States and free their territories and free the people so they can have self-determination. This is what this bill does, and that is all it does.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
