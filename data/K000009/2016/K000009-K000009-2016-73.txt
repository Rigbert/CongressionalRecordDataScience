Chairman, I don't have a copy of the amendment in front of me, but from what I have listened to the gentleman, it sounds like discrimination in the guise of religious freedom, and I would hope that isn't what the gentleman intends.  I have just been given language: ``None of the funds made available by this Act shall be used in contravention of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.''  I don't have full confidence that the equal protection of the laws for thefaith-based community are fully considered in this amendment, and I would have to oppose the gentleman's amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
