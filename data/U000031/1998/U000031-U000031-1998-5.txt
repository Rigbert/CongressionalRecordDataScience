 I would just note for the previous speaker who is opposing the bill that the CRS, Congressional Research estimates will mean at least $1.9 million more than under the current law for all school districts in Connecticut, averaging about $9,300 per school.  Madam Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from New Mexico (Mrs. Wilson), whose school districts in this State would receive at least $2.3 million more under the Dollars to the Classroom act, averaging again $9,300 more per school and $425 per classroom.
