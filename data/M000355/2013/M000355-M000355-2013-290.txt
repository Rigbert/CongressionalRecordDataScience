 President, I rise today to recognize a distinguished Kentuckian, a pillar of the Louisville community and a fixture at the University of Louisville, and a very good friend of mine. Dr. Larry D. Tyler is a professor of engineering fundamentals, and this year he celebrates 50 years of service with UofL's J.B. Speed School of Engineering.  Dr. Tyler earned his original appointment at UofL as an engineering instructor in 1963. He received tenure in 1970. He has taught more than 30 different courses in the fields of engineering mathematics and mechanical, industrial, chemical, and civil engineering. He has created innovative instructional methodologies for core engineering mathematics courses, including early detection of prerequisite weaknesses.  Dr. Tyler has earned all of his degrees at the University of Louisville: his undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering, a master's in mathematics, a master's of mechanical engineering, and a Ph.D. in engineering and physics. Along the way he has been published in peer-review journals and presented at international conferences on engineering design and automation. He won the Speed School's Outstanding Teacher Award in 1975, 1980, and 1983, the University Faculty Favorite Award in 2007, the Speed School Alumni Outstanding Teaching Award in 2007, the University of Louisville's Distinguished Teaching Award in 2008, and the Departmental Professor of the Year Award in 2012.  Larry has served as a faculty advisor to many fraternity student chapters, and here I should mention that Larry and I are old friends. Not only did we attend UofL together as undergraduates, we were both members of Phi Tau fraternity together; in fact, we were in the same pledge class. So I've had the pleasure of seeing Larry grow into the incredibly accomplished and respected professor that we knew he was always meant to be.  Larry, it has been a privilege to walk alongside you for these many years. I know that we both care deeply about our wonderful hometown of Louisville, and we have both dedicated our careersto serving the people of Louisville and giving back to this city by our own contribution. On this occasion to celebrate your success, I say, well done.  Larry's teaching philosophy is to be both student- and content-centered, in order to instill the qualities of desire, determination, and dedication in his students because, as he says, ``success in any endeavor requires all three.'' The life and career of Dr. Tyler is certainly proof that if you have those three qualities, you can go very far.  Mr. President, I would ask my U.S. Senate colleagues to join me in recognizing the accomplishments of Dr. Larry D. Tyler, and congratulating him upon his 50 years of successful service with UofL's J.B. Speed School of Engineering. I hope he continues to lead our university and our city onward and upward for many years to come.                          ____________________
