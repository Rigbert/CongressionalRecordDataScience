 We begin by making more progress on the President's nominees. Later today, we will vote to advance the nomination of President Trump's choice to serve as Deputy Secretary at the Department of the Treasury, Justin Muzinich. This nomination was reported favorably by our colleagues on the Finance Committee earlier this year. Chairman Hatch has characterized the nominee as ``qualified, competent, and ready to get to work.''  As we speak, of course, Mr. Muzinich is already serving as senior counselor to Secretary Mnuchin. He is drawing on years of experience in financial management and putting that experience to work through public service. The nominee holds an MBA from Harvard Business School and a JD from Yale. He has a distinguished record in the private sector and as an instructor at Columbia Business School.  As the Treasury Department continues its work implementing the new Tax Code, developing foreign sanctions, and in a variety of other important areas, it is more important than ever that the Deputy Secretary position be filled; therefore, I would urge each of my colleagues to join me in voting to fill that vacancy with this well-qualified nominee as we advance his nomination later today.  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
