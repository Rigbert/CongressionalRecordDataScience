The Constitution specifically prohibits that. You say it is not reducing, but of course it is. If you say we are shut down 5 days, take whatever percentage 5 days of the President's annual salary is, you withhold it--you are not going to give it back when the government comes back into service--you have decreased his salary.  I am not suggesting not doing it for the Congress, but I don't see how--I am not sure what kind of example we set if we pass a piece of legislation which on the face of it violates the Constitution. I am not talking about Members of Congress. As I said, the last time we had a shutdown I took whatever was my amount and added it to the thousands and thousands of dollars I give every year to charity. I added it to that. But in this case, you go against article 2 by decreasing the President's salary.
