 President, I agree with Senator Simon's interest in encouraging the Bridgestone-Firestone management and labor to return to the bargaining table.  [[Page S560]] Bridgestone-Firestone is the largest manufacturing employer in Polk County. The recent developments surrounding this 6-month strike are very unfortunate for all concerned. I am a strong supporter of the collective bargaining process, and although companies have the right to replace strikers during an economic strike, it is a tragic decision for the workers and their families. It is not helpful for our economy, and frankly, for that matter, the company.  I am deeply concerned about the workers and their families, and therefore have written a letter to the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service urging them to redouble their efforts and find possible alternatives to bring company and union officials together to bring this dispute to a satisfactory conclusion. Others may want to do the same.  However, as I have voted against all other amendments to the congressional coverage bill, I will vote against this resolution as well. The congressional coverage bill is not the appropriate vehicle.
