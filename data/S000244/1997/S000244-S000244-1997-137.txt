Speaker, I rise in earnest support of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. I thank the chairman of the Constitution Subcommittee, Mr. Candy, for yielding and for his dedication to this cause. It is regrettable the President vetoed this bill, but thankfully, Mr. Candy, along with Chairman Hyde, have continued the fight and today we again have the opportunity to present our case to the American people and to appeal directly to the President to reconsider his misguided position.  The President's veto of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act is indefensible and his reason for vetoing the bill does not hold up under scrutiny. The President claims this abortion procedures is the ``only way,'' for women with certain prenatal complications to avoid serious physical damage, including the ability to bear further children. If this is accurate, then why is partial-birth abortion not taught in a single medical residency program anywhere in the United States? Why has no peer-reviewed medical research ever endorsed it?  The fact is a partial-birth abortion is never necessary to preserve the health or future fertility of the mother. However, you do not have to take my word for it. Former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop has stated he believes the President was ``mislead by his medical advisors on what is fact and what is fiction in reference to late-term abortions.'' Dr. Koop concluded that there was no way he could twist his mind to see that a partial-birth abortion is a medical necessity for the mother. Hundreds of other doctors have come forward to reiterate Dr. Koop's position. The sad and dangerous fact is the partial-birth abortion procedure itself is very risky and poses a significant threat to the pregnant woman's health and fertility.  The difference between a partial-birth abortion and homicide is a mere 3 inches. A Congress, President, and society that strives for civility and decency should not tolerate such barbarism.
