 President, today I commend Chuck Mack for his contributions to the labor movement in California and his remarkable 47 years as a Teamster.  Chuck began his career as a Teamster in 1962 and has spent every year since working on behalf of his fellow union members, organizing and ensuring fair treatment and benefits for all.  First elected to a representative position in 1966, he worked as a business agent until 1971 when he briefly moved to Sacramento to lobby the legislature as part of the Teamsters Public Affairs Council.  Returning to the East Bay in 1971, Chuck successfully ran for the position of secretary-treasurer of Local 70, a position he has maintained ever since, which represents 5,000 members in Alameda County.  He was elected to the joint council in 1972, and became president of the council, which represents 55,000 members in San Francisco, in 1982. In 1996, Chuck was elected western region vice president. And, in 2003, he was appointed director of the Teamsters Port Division.  Chuck's responsibilities and leadership roles have steadily increased over the last four decades.  I know him to be a passionate, thoughtful, and committed advocate for all workers.  Whether through his efforts to protect the environment in port communities or preserve wages and benefits for truck drivers, Chuck Mack has always put the needs of his fellow Teamsters first.  Chuck will be stepping down from his Teamsters positions at Local 70, Joint Council 7, and the International Union at the end of this month.  Chuck is now moving on to another significant challenge as he becomes cochair of the Western Conference of Teamsters Pension Trust.  I wish him the very best in this new endeavor and offer my heartfelt and sincere congratulations for a job well done representing Teamsters in the bay area and across northern California for the last four decades.                          ____________________
