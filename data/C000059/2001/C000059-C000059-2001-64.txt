Speaker, today I speak with great pride to commend and praise two magnificent Americans--men who unselfishly made a career of serving their country, in times of peace and war, one in the United States Air Force and the other in the United States Navy. On November 20, 2000 I had the honor of emceeing an event where the names of these native sons--both born in my Congressional district of Riverside, California--were inscribed on the Mission Inn Fliers' Wall. The men of whom I speak so highly and hold in such esteem are Lieutenant General William F. Pitts, U.S. Air Force, and Rear Admiral Allen E. Hill, U.S. Navy.  On March 26, 1934, the first wing ceremony of the Mission Inn Fliers' Wall took place and established a tradition that recognizes great aviators and contributors of aviation. For the ceremony a pair of copper wings, bearing the name of the date that the flier visited the Mission Inn, is attached to the wall of the St. Francis Chapel--The International Shrine of Aviators. A 20th century phenomenon, man's taking to the sky can be recognized by any visitor to the Fliers' Wall today, we have all seen incredible events in air or space in our individual lifetimes. I was proud to witness Lt. General William F. Pitts and Rear Admiral Allen E. Hill place their wings among the 141 presently on the wall--the wings of pioneers and heros--taking their place of honor among the great birdmen of history.  Lt. General William Pitts gave over 36 years to his country in the United States Air Force commanding a broad array of units from a bombardment squadron to the sixth Allied Tactical Air Force in NATO at Izmir, Turkey. In World War II he flew B-29 aircraft striking at the Japanese Empire from Pacific bases on 25 missions. He completed his service at March Air Force Base (now March Air Reserve Base) in 1975 as the Commanding General of the Fifteenth Air Force, Strategic Air Command. The Fifteenth Air Force was responsible for the Strategic Air Command operations in the Western United States and Alaska with a mixed force of reconnaissance, bomber aircraft and missiles that supported the national strategic deterrence mission.  Lt. General William Pitts has received numerous decorations and awards during his service that include the Distinguished Service Medal, Legion of Merit with one oak leaf cluster, Distinguished Flying Cross with one oak leaf cluster, Air Medal with three oak leaf clusters, Air Force Commendation Medal, Purple Heart and others.  Rear Admiral Allen E. Hill made a career in the United States Navy serving as a carrier aviator, where he participated in five combat cruises and flew over 400 combat missions. In fact, he was twice deployed to Korea flying F-9/F-2 Panthers and, during his first combat cruise, he and three other pilots participated in the first all jet and highest aerial engagement in the history of air warfare. He retired only after accomplishing his objective of institutionalizing the tactical training of Naval officersresponsible for Battle Group operations, through his opportunity to establish in Washington, DC, an office of Director of Tactical Readiness. In that position he was the first Admiral to be completely responsible for Naval Warfare Doctrine, the tactical training of Fleet Commanders and Battle Group Commanders, and the Assessment of Warfare Readiness.  Rear Admiral Allen E. Hill has been awarded over fifty personal combat decorations, including the Distinguished Service Medal, Four Distinguished Flying Crosses, the Purple Heart, three Legion of Merit awards, the Korean War Presidential Commendation, two Bronze Stars with ``V'' clasps for valor in combat and many others.  Mr. Speaker, it is with pride that I bring the story of these two men to my colleagues. The Mission Inn Fliers' Wall recognizes the role aviation has had in America's fight for freedom and democracy. To Lt. General William Pitts and Rear Admiral Allen Hill I would like to say ``God Bless You'' and ``God Bless America''--without them, and all of our service men and women, America would not be the strong and healthy democracy it is today.                          ____________________
