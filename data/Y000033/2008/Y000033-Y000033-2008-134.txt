Madam Speaker, I submit the following:  Bill Number: H.R. 5658, Army, RDT, Line 177, PE # 0305208A (Distributed Common Ground/Surface Systems).  Legal name and address of entity receiving earmark: Army Battle Command Battle Laboratory, Mr. Jason Denno, Deputy Director, Ft. Huachuca.  Description of how the money will be spent and why the use of federal taxpayer funding is justified: (BRAMA-E) is a critical decision and training aid for commanders and operators to use in support of military operations on urbanized terrain (MOUT). BRAMA is an integrated collection, planning, and course of action system. It integrates existing US Army developed blast modeling software with a state of the art 4D (Lat, Long, Alt, and Time) visualization front end. It is used by the Army to simulate blast analysis and vulnerability assessments.  BRAMA provides decision support for anti-terrorism/force protection (AT/FP) and critical infrastructure protection (CIP). BRAMA is a royalty-free tool and requires minimal training. It leverages previous US Army and US Air Force--force/facility protection R efforts. Starting in 2007, the BRAMA capability--along with training--has been provided to active duty Army, Homeland Security and National Guard representatives from 7 states. The US Army CONOPS for Force Protection highlights the need for a Capabilities Based Assessment (CBA) tool. Additionally, user feedback post-delivery on BRAMA specifically asks for enhancements on the speed at which facility data can he generated and visualized. Research conducted by the Army in 2006 and 2007 has identified a candidate commercial technology that can be integrated into the BRAMA baseline to meet the CONOPS and speed up the collection process.  BRAMA has demonstrated its usefulness to commanders, planners, and security forces by employing full-dimensional display technology to visualize, analyze and remediate blast effects generated by DoD-approved blast models. BRAMA-E will extend that capability by simplifying the case of use and helping the Army meet its goal to field a unit level Capabilities Based Assessment (CBA) tool.  Description of matching funds: Not Applicable.  Authorized Amount: $4,000,000.  Project Name: Blast and Damage Assessment Risk Analysis and Mitigation Application--Enhancements (BRAMA-E).  Funding Source: Army, RDT, Line 177, PE # 0305208A (Distributed Common Ground/Surface Systems).  Detailed Finance Plan: $200,000 Systems Engineering; $200,000 Immersive Camera Systems; $400,000 Automate Dense Urban Environment Creation from Immersive Media; $600,000 GIS Database and Blast Analysis Integration; $500,000 Develop User Interface Workflow for Plume Modeling with GIS; $1,000,000 Plume Dispersion Model Integration and Plume Analysis; $600,000 Advanced Blast Analysis support for DoD and Homeland Security; $250,000 Base Data Collection and Delivery; $250,000 Training Sessions, Support, and Webinars.                          ____________________
