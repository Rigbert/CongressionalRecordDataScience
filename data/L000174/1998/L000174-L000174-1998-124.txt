President, I rise to pay tribute to the life work of Dr. Mariafranca Morselli.  In 1964, it was our good fortune that Dr. Morselli joined the Maple Research team at the University of Vermont. She has been a family friend and an informal advisor to me for decades.  Her research has considerably helped the Maple Syrup Industry to improve production methods and the quality and maple products. This work has been invaluable to my home state.  Vermont is the largest producer of maple syrup in the United States. There are approximately 2000 sugarmakers in the state and the industry provides about 4000 jobs in Vermont. Maple sugaring is critical to maintaining the beauty of the working landscape of Vermont, providing added income to help family farms stay in business.  We take great pride in the worldwide acclaim for the quality and taste of Vermont maple products.  Dr. Morselli is a pioneer. She received her doctoral degree in Natural Sciences and Botany from the University of Milan, Italy in 1946, and taught in a college in Milan. After working in both Italy and the United States, she settled in Vermont to continue her research.  In 1983, she was the first woman to received the Outstanding Service Award in research by the North American Maple Syrup Council. In 1988, she received three awards, each time as the first female recipient: the Research Service Award from the International Maple Syrup Institute; the Maple Syrup Person of the Year Award from the Vermont Maple Industry; and the Maple Syrup Producer of the Year Award from the Vermont Maple SugarMakers' Association. In 1991, Dr. Morselli was the first woman to be inducted into the American Maple Hall of Fame.  She also volunteers her time in activities related to improving education at all levels for women in math and science. She has been appointed to the Governor's Commission on Women and to the Vermont Developmental Disabilities Council. In recognition of her commitment to the role of women in academia, upon her retirement from the University of Vermont, students and colleagues established ``The Mariafranca Morselli Leadership Award.'' The award is given yearly to an undergraduate woman who has made special contribution as a scholar and in advancing equity for women.  Mariafranca has incredible energy. In fact, in 1985, the Burlington Professional Women honored her as one of Vermont's Most Exciting Women.  She never slows down. Earlier this month, Governor Dean of Vermont appointed Dr. Morselli to the state Affirmative Action Council.  I applaud her tireless efforts to improve the world in which we live. I am proud to call Dr. Mariafranca Morselli my friend. I also want to mention how much her friendship meant to my late mother, Alba Leahy. My mother always enjoyed her conversation with Dr. Morselli. She especially enjoyed them because she could use her native tongue, Italian.  I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of my remarks an article from the Burlington Free Press be included in the Congressional Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:            [From the Burlington Free Press, Sept. 7, 1998]                  Scientist Continues Activist Duties           Dean appoints retired educator to advisory council                            (By Susan Green)       As the sole female on the faculty of the University of      Vermont's botany department for almost 25 years, Mariafranca      Morselli was determined to give her gender a boost.       Gov. Howard Dean has appointed the South Burlington      resident to the Affirmative Action Council, a 15-member      advisory board that examines issues of equal opportunity for      minorities in the state.       ``She's a tremendous asset,'' Dean said of the 75-year old      Morselli, who is a native of Italy. ``I recognize her      important efforts to advance women in the field of science.''       The Milan-born educator also advanced Vermont's maples for      more than two decades, from 1964 through 1988, as a research      professor familiar with the trees and the people who tap      them. After she retired from teaching, Morselli continued her      involvement with the industry through projects for the North      American Maple Syrup Council. In 1991, she became the only      woman ever elected to the National Maple Museum Hall of Fame.       ``When I first started, I felt quite humble,'' she said of      her foray into the largely male world of maple production.      ``Vermonters did not pay much attention to a scientist who is      a woman who came from another country. But I was working for      them and got their trust.''       During an otherwise privileged childhood, Morselli adopted      a feminist perspective because her mother was ``a society      belle who imparted a stern sense of duty in life and work,''      she said.       With her husband-to-be, Mario, she came to the United      States just after World War II. Although not romantically      attached at the time, they both taught at an Illinois      college: His field was chemistry, before he turned to writing      about military history; hers were zoology and botany.       The couple moved to Italy and married in 1949. They      returned to America eight years later, living in New York and      skiing in Stowe.       The purchase of a Danville farm in 1959 provided the      impetus for the Morsellis to make Vermont their full-time      home in the early 1960's. They have three grown daughters,      including state archaeologist Giovanna Peebles, and four      grandchildren.       Morselli, who is chairwoman of the American Association of      University Women's public policy committee and serves as      environmental coordinator for the League of Women Voters, is      constantly on the go. In her spacious condo near Kennedy      Drive, the phone keeps ringing and the fax is always humming.       ``I have tremendous energy,'' she said, referring to her      extensive community service. ``I think it comes from my      Yankee/northern Italian stock.''       The other clue to Morselli's activism might be her sense of      free will. ``I always told my students, `You are your      destiny,' '' she said.       Beyond that, ``I love my work. I love my husband. I love my      family. Love has been the motif of my life.''                          ____________________
