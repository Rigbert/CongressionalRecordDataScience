Mr. Speaker, on behalf of America's 25 million veterans, I am introducing H.R. 5250, the Veterans Health Care Funding Guarantee Act of 2002, alongwith my friend and the Ranking Member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Mr. Evans, that would change funding of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system from discretionary to mandatory spending.  We are introducing this bill in recognition of the continually frustrating annual struggles to obtain sufficient funding to provide access to quality care for the nation's veterans in VA health care facilities. The current discretionary appropriations process subjects these veterans' health care needs--needs of the heroes who won the Battle of the Bulge, endured as prisoners of war in Bataan and Corregidor and survived human-wave assaults in the frozen Chosin Reservoir--to annual health funding competition with federal highway funding and sewage treatment projects. This reality alone vividly illustrates the inherent weakness in the discretionary appropriations process for VA health care and the need to reform it.  Mr. Speaker, 2 years ago, we passed TRICARE for Life, a new program to guarantee lifelong health care for military retirees and their families. I was proud to support that program for hundreds of thousands of military families, who are now assured of free health care services sponsored entirely by the government. The bill we are introducing today would extend the same kind of guarantee to the remainder of America's veterans, to assure their continued access to the VA health care system.  H.R. 5250 would establish a formula to fund the VA health care account directly from the U.S. Treasury with a method similar to that used by Congress to provide funding for TRICARE for Life. Veterans' disability compensation payments are already funded through mandatory formulas, and our legislation would apply the same priority to meeting the health care needs of our veterans.  The bill we are introducing today would establish a base funding year, calculate the average cost for a veteran using VA health care, and then index the cost for inflation. Multiplying this average cost by the number of veterans who are enrolled each year on July 1st, would determine the funding allotment for the Veterans Health Administration for the next fiscal year.  It should be noted that H.R. 5250 would neither take away the Secretary's power to manage the VA health care system nor to curtail the Secretary's control of enrollments in VA. And unlike TRICARE for Life, it would not extend benefits to family members of veterans.  Mr. Speaker, for at least the past five years, veterans' usage of VA health care services surpassed Administration estimates. Just this past week, we received a revised workload estimate for FY 2003 from VA showing an increase of 500,000 veteran patients; and that's on top of the 700,000 increase in patients estimated in the budget submission made only five months ago. VA now estimates that there will be 4.9 million unique veteran patients in FY 2003, versus the 3.7 million veterans that had been projected one year ago for FY 2002--a 31.5-percent increase overall.  Mr. Speaker, the continuing rise in demand for VA health care services is driven by many factors, including the growth of new and convenient VA community-based outpatient clinics, improved safety and quality of care, as well as available prescription drug benefits. VA has increasingly become a supplier of prescription drugs to veterans, particularly for senior veterans.  Further evidence of the urgent funding needs of VA health care comes from a new report issued this month by VA measuring the amount of time veterans are waiting for medical services. According to VA's report, there are at least 300,000 veterans waiting for medical appointments, half of whom are waiting 6 months or more; and the other half having no appointment at all. This is the first attempt to measure a situation about which we have all heard from our constituents, and we suspect that the scale of the problem is actually greater, since this estimate only counts those veterans already enrolled in the VA health care system.  Mr. Speaker, we have a sacred obligation to ensure that our nation's veterans receive the honors and benefits that they have earned through their service to this nation. In the past decade, more and more veterans have turned to the Department of Veterans Affairs for medical services, particularly World War II and Korean War veterans. We have attempted to meet our obligation to them by passing record VA budgets for two years in a row. As our colleagues may recall, the House-approved budget resolution for fiscal year 2003 contained a substantial $2.6 billion increase in the funding of medical care for our nation's veterans.  However, the demand for services continues to outpace the supply of federal funding of VA health care. In the supplemental appropriations bill we passed, Congress included $417 million for additional health care funding to try to meet the current year's shortfall, and that was based upon the older workload estimates.  Mr. Speaker, it is becoming increasingly clear that Congress needs to look at new methods and sources for veterans' health care funding, and the Committee on Veterans' Affairs has been seeking additional ways to match resources to the growing demand. Working with the Committee on Armed Services, we attached an amendment to the Department of Defense (DOD) authorization bill that would seek to increase health care resources sharing between the DOD and VA health care systems, and we hope it will see final passage this year. Also we have sought to increase third-party collections through the VA Medical Care Collections Fund with more aggressive oversight and legislative improvements.  In addition, earlier this month the Committee examined ways to improve coordination and allocation of resources between Medicare and VA, since about half of the veterans receiving VA health services are also Medicare-eligible. Yet, despite all of these efforts, VA continues to struggle each year to provide all the funds needed for the tasks it faces in caring for millions of frail, elderly veterans.  Mr. Speaker, with the introduction of H.R. 5250 we hope to begin an important debate on the future of veterans' health care and its funding needs. We will shortly request Administration views on the bill, and cost information from the Congressional Budget Office. We intend to meet with colleagues on both the Committees on the Budget and on Appropriations to obtain their views; and it goes without saying that we will be consulting with veterans organizations in the months ahead in order to learn whether this approach or a combination of other changes will solve this vexing problem confronting America's veterans and the health care system serving them.  We urge all our colleagues to examine H.R. 5250 and work with us to find a means to provide dependable, stable and sustained funding for the health care needs of veterans of our armed forces. They deserve no less from a grateful nation.                          ____________________
