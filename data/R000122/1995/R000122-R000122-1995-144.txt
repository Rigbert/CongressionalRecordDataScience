Chairman, I was one of two Democrats to support H.R. 956 during its consideration by the Judiciary Committee.  I support product liability reform and I support the core principles of the original H.R. 10/H.R. 956.                       A cap on punitive damages  We need to bring certainty and proportionality to the process. Everyone agrees that some awards are totally out of proportion to the harm done. The cost of insuring for this uncertainty is part of the litigation tax that drives up costs for all consumers.  Proportionate, not joint, liability for de minimis tortfeasors. This is a necessary reform: defendants who are peripherally responsible should not be handed the entire bill for someone else's wrongdoing just because they may have deep pockets.                          A statute of repose  Manufacturers should not be sued for a product that is still being used long past its useful life. And they deserve protection against suits that result from misuse or alteration of their products.  However, this bill has been distorted by the adoption of a series of floor amendments and the failure of the Rules Committee to allow consideration of amendments that would have, in my opinion, improved the bill.  For example, an amendment by Mr. Berman of California that would have provided relief from joint liability for de minimis tortfeasors while retaining liability for highly culpable wrongdoers was not allowed to be offered, in spite of the fact that this amendment received bipartisan support in the Judiciary Committee. As it stands now, the bill offers protection not only to de minimis tortfeasors but to serious wrongdoers who are 80 or 90 percent responsible for an injury.  But it is really the adoption of several floor amendments that vastly expand the scope of the bill that prevent me from being able to [[Page E625]] support the bill in its final form. These amendments were adopted without the benefit of hearings and careful deliberation and may have many unforseen and unintended consequences.  For example, the bill now preempts State laws that impose punitive damages on drunk drivers and sexual predators, among others. It also will enable clever wrongdoers to escape punitive damages. For example, the manufacturers of the drug Zomax reported adverse reactions to the FDA as required to gain an exemption from punitive damages under one of the floor amendments; then, before the FDA could act, they intentionally dumped their inventory on the market, causing 14 deaths and 400 allergic reactions. I do not believe this is the type of behavior we should shield from punishment. Finally, because of the way the caps are structured, the bill disadvantages children, seniors, women, and middle income working Americans who are injured. A high income executive who is injured by a Ford Pinto would receive a far higher share of the damages allowed under State law than a child or a senior citizen injured by the same product. I do not believe these are the results my constituents are looking for when they ask for litigation reform. Although I support tort reform, I believe this bill needs improvement.  I hope that the final conference report will return to the sound principles of the original bill, and embrace true product liability reform. If it does, I intend to support it.  However, at this time I do not believe that this bill is worthy of support. I voted in favor of a projob creation bill in committee that became, on the House floor, a bill that tilts the court system against people of modest means, and includes several anticonsumer provisions.                          ____________________
