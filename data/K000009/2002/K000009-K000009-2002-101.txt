Speaker, I submit the following article.                [From the New York Times, Apr. 3, 2002]                             The Hard Truth                        (By Thomas L. Friedman)       A terrible disaster is in the making in the Middle East.      What Osama bin Laden failed to achieve on Sept. 11 is now      being unleashed by the Israeli-Palestinian war in the West      Bank: a clash of civilizations.       In the wake of repeated suicide bombings, it is no surprise      that the Israeli Army has gone on the offensive in the West      Bank. Any other nation would have done the same. But Ariel      Sharon's operation will succeed only if it is designed to      make the Israeli-occupied territories safe for Israel to      leave as soon as possible. Israel's goal must be a withdrawal      from these areas captured in the 1967 war; otherwise it will      never know a day's peace, and it will undermine every      legitimate U.S. effort to fight terrorism around the globe.       What I fear, though, is that Mr. Sharon wants to get rid of      Mr. Arafat in order to keep Israeli West Bank settlements,      not to create the conditions for them to be withdrawn.       President Bush needs to be careful that America doesn't get      sucked into something very dangerous here. Mr. Bush has      rightly condemned Palestinian suicide bombing as beyond the      pale, but he is not making clear that Israel's war against      this terrorism has to be accompanied by a real plan for      getting out of the territories.       Why? Because President Bush, like all the other key      players, doesn't want to face the central dilemma in this      conflict--which is that while Israel must get out of the West      Bank and Gaza, the Palestinians cannot, at this moment, be      trusted to run those territories on their own, without making      them a base of future operations against Israel. That means      some outside power has to come in to secure the borders, and      the only trusted powers would be the U.S. or NATO.       Palestinians who use suicide bombers to blow up Israelis at      a Passover meal and then declare ``Just end the occupation      and everything will be fine'' are not believable. No Israeli      in his right mind would trust Yasir Arafat, who has used      suicide bombers when it suited his purposes, not to do the      same thing if he got the West Bank back and some of his      people started demanding Tel Aviv.       ``The only solution is a new U.N. mandate for U.S. and NATO      troops to supervise the gradual emergence of a Palestinian      state--after a phased Israeli withdrawal--and then to control      its borders,'' says the Middle East expert Stephen P. Cohen.       People say that U.S. troops there would be shot at like      U.S. troops in Beirut. I disagree. U.S. troops that are the      midwife of a Palestinian state and supervise a return of      Muslim sovereignty over the holy mosques in Jerusalem would      be the key to solving all the contradictions of U.S. policy      in the Middle East, not new targets.       The Arab leaders don't want to face this hard fact either,      because most are illegitimate, unelected autocrats who are      afraid of ever speaking the truth in public to the      Palestinians. The Arab leaders are a disingenuous as Mr.      Sharon; he says ending ``terrorism'' alone will bring peace      to the occupied terrorities, and the Arab leaders say ending      ``the occupation'' alone will end all terrorism.       Like Mr. Sharon, the Arab leaders need to face facts--that      while the occupation needs to end, they independently need to      address issues like suicide terrorism in the name of Islam.      As Malaysia's prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, courageously      just declared about suicide bombing: ``Bitter and angry      though we may be, we must demonstrate to the world that      Muslims are rational people when fighting for our rights, and      do not resort to acts of terror.''       If Arab leaders have only the moral courage to draw lines      around Israel's behavior, but no moral courage to decry the      utterly corrupt and inept Palestinian leadership or the      depravity of suicide bombers in the name of Islam, then we're      going nowhere.       The other people who have not wanted to face facts are the      feckless American Jewish leaders, fundamentalist Christians      and neoconservatives who together have helped make it      impossible for anyone in the U.S. administration to talk      seriously about halting Israeli settlement-building without      being accused of being anti-Israel. Their collaboration has      helped prolong a colonial Israeli occupation that now      threatens the entire Zionist enterprise.       So there you have it. Either leaders of good will get      together and acknowledge that Israel can't stay in the      territories but can't just pick up and leave, without a U.S.-     NATO force helping Palestinians oversee their state, or Osama      wins--and the war of civilizations will be coming to a      theater near you.                               ____________________
