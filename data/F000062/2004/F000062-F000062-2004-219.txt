 President, this is an amendment from myself and Senators Kyl, Bingaman, Hutchison, Kennedy, Cornyn, Boxer, Domenici, Clinton, McCain, Schumer, Graham, Lautenberg, Cantwell, Corzine, Feingold, and Edwards. It has to do with the State criminal assistance program for illegal aliens. We have tried to get floor time and have been unable to do so.
