 President, in 1819, a group of citizens petitioned the Kentucky General Assembly for a charter to create a new liberal arts college. The result was Centre College--a remarkable institution named for its proximate location in the geographic center of the Commonwealth. So committed was the legislature to the success of this school that it placed some of the State's most important citizens in charge of its board of trustees. Kentucky's first Governor, Isaac Shelby, served as its chair, and Dr. Ephraim McDowell--a pioneer in abdominal surgical techniques whose statue is on permanent display here in the Capitol--also served on the board.  From this august beginning, Centre College matured into a nationally recognized educational institution that focuses its mission on the success of its students. As their motto indicates, every student can expect a personal education and extraordinary success. It is not surprising, then, that Centre alumni include two Vice Presidents, one Chief Justice and one Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, 13 U.S. Senators, 43 U.S. Representatives, 11 Governors--as well as 3 alumni currently serving on my staff. Indeed, Centre College has been a proving ground for generations of men and women whom have gone on to become leaders in a variety of fields.  More recently, under the steady hand of its president, Dr. John Roush, Centre College broke onto the national stage in 2000 when it hosted the Vice-Presidential debate between Dick Cheney and our colleague Joe Lieberman of Connecticut.  When you consider the fact that it also holds a national record in annual alumni contributions, it is little wonder that Forbes magazine recently named Centre College as the top college in the South for a second year in a row. As the article begins, ``If you're accepted to be a student at the best college in the South, you are guaranteed an internship, the opportunity to study abroad and graduation within four years--or the school will pay for an additional year of tuition-free study.''  So it is with great pride that I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the students, faculty, staff, and alumni of Centre College in Danville, KY.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the relevant portion of the Forbes article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows:                 [From Forbes Magazine, Nov. 12, 2010]                     The Best Colleges in the South                          (By Jacquelyn Smith)       If you're accepted to be a student at the best college in      the South, you are guaranteed an internship, the opportunity      to study abroad and graduation within four years--or the      school will pay for an additional year of tuition-free study.       The benefits of attending the best college in the South      don't even stop when you receive your diploma. Within 10      months of graduation, 98% of the college's students, on      average, are employed or engaged in advanced study. Upon      graduating you become part of the nation's most loyal and      generous group of alumni.       Located in the heart of Kentucky, Centre College has 1,197      undergraduate students and more than 100 faculty members, 98%      of whom hold the highest degrees in their fields.       ``My time at Centre has been highlighted by the professors      and mentors who have guided me and the unique experiences      I've taken part in,'' says Paul Adams, a 21-year-old senior      from Chicago.       In the last decade alone, Centre produced 17 Fulbright      scholars, five Goldwater scholars, two Rhodes scholars and a      Truman scholar. Its alumni include two U.S. vice presidents,      a chief justice of the United States, 13 U.S. senators and 43      U.S. representatives.       ``The education is intense and challenging, but also      supportive,'' says the college's communications director,      Mike Norris. ``We have students saying, `I've found myself      doing things at Centre that I would have never even aspired      to do.' Our students achieve beyond what they ever thought      possible.''       More than 85 percent of Centre's students study abroad, and      to emphasize its commitment to global citizenship, the      college recently implemented a program that provides a free      passport to all first-year students who don't already have      one.       ``Even though we're just a small college in Kentucky,      Centre students are doing great things--studying abroad in      Mexico, China, England, France, Spain, Vietnam, Israel,      Africa, the Bahamas and many more places worldwide, taking on      the challenges of society in our classrooms and across      campus, and generally making a difference,'' says Elizabeth      Trollinger, a 21-year-old senior from Kentucky. ``Centre is a      place where we are given countless chances to become active      members of our society and community, and we know we'll be      able to effectively use the knowledge and skills we acquire      in our four years here, no matter what comes after Centre.''       Over the last 25 years, Centre alumni have led the nation      in loyalty, in terms of the percentage of graduates who make      financial donations each year. ``The entire Centre community      seems to be knit together by two strands,'' Adams says, ``a      firm commitment to a meaningful education and an unwavering      passion for Centre herself. And for the     past three years, I've found myself happily woven into her      fabric.''       Centre is also the 24th best college in America overall,      according to Forbes and the Center for College Affordability      and Productivity's ranking of America's Best Colleges, which      was published in August. The list ranks U.S. undergraduate      institutions by the quality of the education they provide,      the experiences of their students, the amount of debt      students graduate with and how much they achieve. To      determine the best schools in the South, we narrowed that      list according to the regional divisions used by the U.S.      Census Bureau; that means schools in the South are located in      Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, the District of Columbia,      Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi,      North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas,      Virginia and West Virginia.                          ____________________
