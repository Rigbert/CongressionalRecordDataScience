President, I am pleased today to join with my colleagues, Senators Cleland and Kerry, in introducing legislation that will bring the resources of SBA's Women's Business Center program much closer to those seeking this help as they work to start their own businesses. This bill does more than recognize the contributions that women make as business owners. This bill tangibly supports and encourages more women to become entrepreneurs.  The Office of Women's Business Ownership recently released a report to Congress on the success of Women's Business Centers. This report officially confirms what we already informally know: Women are interested in owning their own businesses, and women appreciate the targeted help the Centers offer that relates directly to the unique opportunities and challenges that women face in creating a business. While existing Small Business Administration offices and Small Business Development Centers help women entrepreneurs, this report found that more than three-fourths of the women who have turned to a Women's Business Center appreciate its special focus. SBA offices and SBDCs do not have the resources available to offer the same kind of help.  Our legislation will supply resources needed to establish a Women's Business Center in each of the fifty states, including in my home state of Vermont. Passage of this bill would give women in Vermont and in other states direct access to information on financing, marketing and managing their own business ventures. Under the provisions of this bill, Vermonters would have access to the wide range of resources that already are available to citizens in 36 other states.  The bill will also extend additional resources for the online Women's Business Center. This resource, located at www.onlinewbc.org, provides assistance to women who are unable to travel long distances to Centers. With this online resource, women have access to much of the same information that is available at the Centers, and they can ask questions of specialists, all with the click of a mouse. Our bill would enable the Center to expand its online services to women in business.  Even without the resources of a Women's Business Center, Vermont is a leader in women-owned businesses. The number of women entrepreneurs in Vermont has almost doubled over the last ten years. Women now own more than thirty-eight percent of all businesses in Vermont, which is above the national average of thirty-six percent. Women also employ thirty percent of Vermont's workers, which also exceeds the national average.  Women have faced unique obstacles and challenges in starting and growing businesses. Some obstacles have been lowered in recent years, and we can all hope that this progress will continue. One step we can take to promote continued progress is by bringing the resources of Women's Business Centers to more women entrepreneurs. We must encourage more Vermont women to tap into this incredible growth. An SBA Women's Business Center in Vermont will do just that by providing women with the framework and support necessary to thrive and excel as business owners.                                 ______                                       By
