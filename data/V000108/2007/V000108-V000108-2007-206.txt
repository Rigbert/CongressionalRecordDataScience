Margaret (Marge) Drewniak. I can truly say that Marge is one of Northwest Indiana's most dedicated, distinguished, and honorable citizens. She is one of the most involved citizens that I have ever known, especially when it comes to her service to the people of Whiting, Indiana. For the past 37 years, Marge has been a constant fixture in Whiting, fully committed in her various capacities as a public servant. Most notably, Marge has served as the Clerk-Treasurer for the City of Whiting for the past 26 years. Though Marge has decided not to run for re- election, her efforts over the course of her tenure, and the impact she has had on the city and the people of Whiting will forever be remembered. To honor Marge, a reception will be held at the Knights of Columbus Hall in Whiting, Indiana, on Saturday, November 10, 2007.  One of 3 children, Margaret Kotyuk was born to Frank and Emma (Mitro) Kotyuk in Whiting, Indiana. A lifelong resident of Whiting, Marge attended the Whiting public schools. Upon her graduation, prior to beginning her career as a public servant, Marge was employed as a bookkeeper. Undoubtedly, it was during that time that Marge developed the skills that would be critical in her role as clerk-treasurer.  Marge began her career in the public sector in Whiting in 1970, where she served in various capacities within several departments under former Mayor Frank Harangody. In 1974, she was named deputy clerk-treasurer, a position she held until 1981, when she was appointed to complete the term of the late clerk-treasurer, Mary Jancek. This began Marge's 26-year tenure as Whiting's clerk-treasurer. During that time, she worked with four mayors: Frank Harangody, Joseph Grenchik, Robert Bercik, and current Mayor Joseph Stahura. Marge also served as a precinct vice-committeeperson and volunteered countless hours for the Whiting Democratic Precinct Organization during her tenure.  In her capacity as clerk-treasurer, Marge has been a member of many organizations throughout the years, including: the Indiana League of Municipal Clerks and Treasurers, the International Institute of Municipal Clerks and Treasurers, the Municipal Treasurers' Association of the United States and Canada, the Government Finance Officers Association, and the Indiana Association of Cities and Towns. Outside her elected position, Marge iswell-known to be an active member in several organizations within the Whiting community, including: the Whiting-Robertsdale Chamber of Commerce, the Knights of Columbus Wives Club, the Daughters of Isabella, the Whiting-Robertsdale Historical Society, the Sacred Heart Rosary Society, and the Friends of the Library.  While Marge's everyday presence will be missed at Whiting City Hall, she will now have a chance to spend more time to those closest to her--her family. A loving wife, mother, and grandmother, Marge's commitment to her community is surpassed only by her love for her family. Marge and her loving husband, Henry, have been married for an astonishing 55 years. With Marge's retirement, they plan to spend as much time as possible with their 3 children: Nancy (Michael) Pappas, James (Martha) Drewniak, and Ron (Lisa) Drewniak, and their adoring grandchildren: Brian and Kelly Pappas and Eric and Scott Drewniak.  Madam Speaker, Marge Drewniak has selflessly given her time and efforts to the people of Whiting, Indiana, throughout her years of service. At this time, I ask that you and all of my distinguished colleagues join me in commending her for her lifetime of service and dedication, and I ask that you join me in wishing her the best of health and happiness in the years to come.                          ____________________
