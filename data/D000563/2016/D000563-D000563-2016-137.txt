President, I want to take a few minutes to thank Thomas Vanden Berk for his extraordinary service to the city of Chicago. Tom has spent 40 years devoted to one cause: improving the lives of Chicago's most vulnerable by working with children and families who have been abused, neglected, and traumatized. Earlier this year, Tom announced he would be retiring as chief executive officer of the Uhlich Children's Advantage network, UCAN.  In 1987, when Tom joined UCAN, it was a small shelter housing 50 boys and girls, operating under a $1.7 million budget and on the verge of closing. Under Tom's direction, UCAN grew into a multifaceted and financially sound shelter focusing on child welfare programs, violence prevention, and strategies for combating gun violence. Today UCAN is a leading child welfare organization in Chicago with a new $41 million campus providing a full continuum of over 30 programs, servicing more than 10,000 people every year.  Tom's been the recipient of numerous awards, including the ``Friend of Child'' award from the Illinois Council on Training; Peace Leader Award from the Illinois Council for the Prevention of Violence; and the Council for Healthand Human Service Ministries Executive of the Year award.  Through Tom's creative leadership and hard work, UCAN has become a vital sanctuary for young people, providing security and healing for those who have suffered trauma. Over the last 29 years, Tom has built UCAN on one simple, but powerful premise: ``Kids raised in violence are traumatized and trauma can be healed.'' Tom knows trauma better than most. As a young boy, his father, a part-time janitor at their church, was killed when a boiler he was repairing exploded. And on April 25, 1992, when kids barged into a party and started shooting, Tom lost his 15-year-old son. After the shooting, one thing became clear: ``these were kids with absurdly easy access to guns.'' So Tom asked himself, ``What am I going to do with this anger?'' What he has done is become a leading voice and advocate in the campaign to reduce gun violence. Tom understands that it is not just a criminal justice issue; it is a public health crisis.  After his son's death, Tom realized that many of the troubled, neglected, and abused children that he spent his career working with had been traumatized by gun violence in their homes and community. His work through UCAN began to reflect that reality. He founded HELP for Survivors, a support group for parents who have lost loved ones to gun violence. Tom also became a founding member of the Bell Campaign, known today as the Million Mom March, which formed an alliance with the Brady Campaign in 2001. In 2002, Tom was named the Join Together Hero, which recognizes true leaders of the gun violence prevention movement. And in 2007, he received the Citizens Advocacy Award from the Illinois Council against Handgun Violence.  When asked to reflect on his career, Tom remains focused on the problems facing the community: not enough beds for impoverished kids who endure violence, a ridiculously high number of shootings, effective gun laws blocked by the National Rifle Association, and on and on. He says, ``I can't sit here and say, `Oh, my God, I've done wonderful things and its better.' '' We have a long way to go and progress is hard, but no one can deny the difference Tom has made.  Just listen to those that know Tom and UCAN best--young people like Tatiara, who came to UCAN in 2012 through the Family Works program. Here is what she said: ``UCAN takes you under their wing. You are not just another number but you are your own person. They really care about you. It's like you're part of a family.'' Or take Alexis, a 23-year-old mother, whose daughter Aliyah was born premature with multiple complications including Down's syndrome, a tethered spinal cord, and a heart defect. Here is what she said: ``I would recommend UCAN because if you need something or need to get somewhere they will find the answer. I would be lost without them.'' Alexis and Aliyah are 1 of more than 100 families that UCAN's High-Risk Infant Program provides preventive and supportive services to every year. These are just a couple of the countless success stories.  I have visited UCAN and met the children it serves. Their stories are inspiring. And I am thankful that UCAN is making a difference in the lives of so many young people in Illinois. So on behalf of all those UCAN has served during Tom Vanden Berk's tenure, I want to tell him he has done wonderful things, and because of his passion and dedication, people's lives have gotten better.  Fortunately for Chicago, Tom isn't going far. Later this summer, he will transition to CEO emeritus and will continue to fundraise and advocate for UCAN and the children and families it serves. I want to congratulate Thomas Vanden Berk on his distinguished career and thank him for all he has done--and all he will continue to do. Illinois and the country are grateful for his service.                          ____________________
