 President, the budget resolution before us today provides the first major increase in defense spending since 1985.  And I voted for it. I support the increase for National defense. In the past, I have opposed increases in the defense budget. Now, I don't. My colleagues must be wondering why. My colleagues may be thinking that the Senator from Iowa has flip-flopped on defense.  I would like to explain my position.  I support this year's defense increase for one reason and one reason only.  The Budget Committee is calling for financial management reforms at the Department of Defense (DOD). The committee is telling DOD to bring its accounting practices up to accepted standards, so it can produce ``auditable'' financial statements within two years.  In a nutshell, the Committee is telling DOD to do what DOD is already required to do under the law.  If those words were not in the Committee report, I would be standing here with an amendment in my hand to cut the DOD budget.  Fortunately, that's not necessary.  I would like to thank my friend from New Mexico, Senator Domenici--the Committee Chairman--for placing those important words in the report.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the language entitled ``The Need for DOD Financial Reforms'' printed in the Record. It appears on pages 25 to 29 of the report.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                        A. Spending by Function                     Function 050: National Defense                            Function Summary        Approve modifications to existing DoD financial      management programs and policies to redress the failure of      the Defense Department, as noted by GAO,1 to meet      the goals of the Chief Financial Officers Act and, thereby,      to produce auditable financial statements for each military      service and major DoD component by the year 2000. The      Committee's concerns regarding this important issue are      stated at greater length at the end of the description of      this budget function.---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \1\ See High Risk Series: An Update, U.S. General Accounting      Office, GAO/HR-99-1, January 1999, pp. 82-94, and Major      Management Challenges and Program Risks: Department of      Defense, U.S. General Accounting Office, GAO/OGC-99-5,      January, 1999.---------------------------------------------------------------------------     The need for DoD financial reforms       The Committee is concerned about the longstanding breakdown      of discipline in financial management at the Department of      Defense. Reports by the DoD Inspector General and General      Accounting Office consistently show that DoD's financial      accounts and inventories are vulnerable to theft and abuse.      These vulnerabilities persist for two reasons: (1) internal      controls are weak or nonexistent; and (2) financial      transactions are not accurately recorded in the books of      account--as they occur. While some progress has been made to      improve the financial accounting systems within DoD, it      remains a fact that DoD does not observe the age-old      principles of separation of duties and double-entry      bookkeeping, and attempts to make critical bookkeeping      entries weeks, months, and even years after the fact. These      unprofessional practices have produced billions of dollars of      unreconciled financial mismatches, leaving the department's      books of account inaccurate and unreliable.       The Committee believes that these deficiencies must be      corrected.       Under the Government Management Reform Act (GMRA) of 1994,      which expanded the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act of      1990, the DoD Inspector General is required to audit DoD's      financial statements, and the General Accounting Office is      required to audit the government's consolidated financial      statements. This is done annually. Unfortunately, each year      the DoD audit agencies issue a disclaimer of opinion. In      layman's terms, this means they could not audit the books.      And there is nothing on the drawing board to suggest that a      ``clean'' audit opinion is feasible in the foreseeable      future. DoD has lost control of the money at the transaction      level. With no control at the transaction level, it is      physically impossible to roll up all the numbers into a top-     line financial statement that can stand up to audit scrutiny.      The numbers do not add up. DoD resorts to ``unsupported      adjustments'' and multi-billion dollar ``plug'' figures to      force the books into balance. The IG and GAO reject these      practices as unacceptable.       Even though DoD's efforts to prepare an auditable financial      statement have been unsuccessful so far, the Committee      believes that the annual CFO audits constitute a very      authoritative and independent assessment of the department's      financial management procedures. They function like a      critical indicator or barometer. They help to pinpoint the      underlying weaknesses in DoD's bookkeeping procedures. The      Committee believes that DoD must move in a decisive way to      correct these problems. So long as DoD continues to ignore      them, the vast audit effort dedicated to the financial      statements will continue to result in disclaimers of      opinion--an overall indictment of DoD's financial management      operations.       For these reasons, a plan that is designed to bring the      Defense Department into compliance with the CFO and GMRA Acts      would be supported by the Committee. These reforms would      position DoD to prepare auditable financial statements within      two years. The main ingredients of such a plan follow:       (1) Double-entry Bookkeeping: The preparation of reliable      financial statements is literally impossible without double-     entry bookkeeping. A standard accounting procedure in the      western world for centuries, double-entry bookkeeping records      both the debits and credits appropriate to each transaction.      A cash purchase of an asset would add the value of that asset      to the inventory balanced by the reduction in cash. If DoD      did this for each transaction, the books would ``balance,''      that is, debits would equal credits, the books would      accurately reflect the cost of operations, and the taxpayers      would be assured that something of value was actually      received for the money spent. Under current law, the military      services are supposed to have ``asset management systems'' in      place today that would provide an accurate and complete      accounting for the quantity, cost and location of all      inventory items. No such system is in existence, however. DoD      must adopt a double-entry bookkeeping system in order to      generate reliable financial statements.       (2) Recording Transactions Promptly: Financial transactions      must be accurately recorded in the books of account--as they      occur. Under current DoD policies, billions of dollars of      transactions are not posted until long after the fact, if      ever. In many cases, it takes DoD weeks, months, and even      years to make necessary accounting entries. In other      documented cases, DoD policies authorize the posting of      transactions to the wrong accounts with the idea of avoiding      negative liquidated obligations or correcting errors at      ``contract close-out'' years later. Attempting to reconcile      contracts with payment records years after-the-fact usually      proves to be a futile and very costly task. As long as the      department's books of account fail to accurately reflect      obligations and expenditures, Congress can not be sure that      DoD is spending the money as specified in law or that costs      reflected in DoD's financial statements are accurate. DoD      must record all transactions in the books of account      immediately--as they occur.       (3) Transaction-driven General Ledger: To help ensure      reliable financial management     information, Congress passed the Federal Financial Management      Improvement Act of 1996 (FFMIA). This law required all      federal agencies to activate a Standard General Ledger at the      transaction level that complied with accepted accounting      standards. According to GAO, DoD's financial systems are non-     compliant with the FFMIA requirements.2---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \2\ See GAO-AIMD-98-268, Financial Management: Federal      Financial Management Improvement Act Results for Fiscal Year      1997, US General Accounting Office, September 1998,      Washington, D.C.---------------------------------------------------------------------------       Had DoD implemented the required Standard General Ledger      chart of accounts, as other agencies have, practiced double-     entry bookkeeping, and recorded transactions promptly and      accurately, all transactions should naturally roll up through      subsidiary accounts into general ledger accounts.       Moreover, if DoD accounting systems were up to accepted      standards, auditors could verify the accuracy of the general      ledger accounts by tracing the accumulation of costs back      down to the original entries for each transaction. This, in      turn, should provide a management accounting system that has      integrity--one the taxpayers deserve and one that is      necessary for completion of reliable financial statements. A      transaction-driven general ledger would be a powerful      management tool for evaluating DoD's financial performance.      While DoD has general ledger accounts, they lack integrity      because of massive gaps and the use of ``plug'' figures.      Transactions are simply not recorded in the books of account      in a timely and accurate manner. Given these continuing      shortcomings, it is impossible to follow the audit trail back      down to each original transaction. Until this problem is      remedied, and DoD develops reliable controls and integrated      financial management systems, DoD financial information will      be unreliable and its financial statements will be      unauditable.       (4) Separation of Duties: Organizational and functional      independence must be achieved at each major step in the cycle      of transactions. This key internal control helps to detect      and prevent theft, inhibits collusive fraud and offers      greater efficiencies in organizations that are large enough      to accommodate specialized operations. For instance, if truly      independent entities perform the separate functions of store-     keeping or warehousing and accounting for stores      transactions, fraud in either function could be discovered by      comparing what the store keepers show as on hand to what      accounting records show was purchased, used, and should be on      hand. With adequate separation of duties, successful fraud      would require collusion by not only the store-keepers and      accountants but also by organizationally independent managers      of those separate functional areas. IG and GAO reports      repeatedly show that DoD does not consistently adhere to the      age-old principle of real separation of duties--both      organizationally and functionally.       Last year, the GAO uncovered a prime example of how DoD      does not observe the separation of duties doctrine. The      Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS), which performs      disbursing and accounting functions for the entire      department, is authorized to routinely alter remit addresses      on checks. A remit address is the address to which a check is      sent. Allowing DFAS to alter remit addresses is a violation      of the separation of duties principle that leaves the door      open to fraud. The office that processes bills for payment      should never be allowed to change a remit address on a check.      Such changes should be made through an independent      verification process. Remit addresses should be tightly      controlled in a central registry and only altered at request      of the vendor--in writing.       (5) Accountability: The DoD CFO and the Financial Managers      (FM's) for each of the three military services have been      granted the full spectrum of authority under the law.      However, these four officials appear to have delegated much      of their authority for payment and accounting to DFAS, which      disburses over $22 billion a month and employs about 20,000      persons.       Despite the authority that has been passed down the chain      of command to DFAS, this organization does not exist--at      least in law. There is no specific provision in the U.S. Code      granting such authority to DFAS. The Committee fears that the      military services could use DFAS as a bureaucratic mechanism      to deflect responsibility for ongoing financial      mismanagement. DFAS can be blamed, but there is no      accountability. In fact, there is nothing in law that      requires personal financial accountability anywhere in DoD--     from the top CFO down to the lowest technician at DFAS. Even      DoD disbursing officials have been exempted from the law that      makes all other government disbursing officials ``pecuniarily      liable'' for erroneous or fraudulent payments.       If no one at DoD is held accountable for the continuing      pattern of financial mismanagement and ``unclean'' CFO audit      opinions, then the department may never succeed in producing      reliable financial statements.       The CFO and service FM's may delegate authority to DFAS but      not personal responsibility. The service FM's must police      those to whom they have delegated authority, but the final      responsibility resides in their offices with them. They alone      should be held accountable for the completion of reliable      financial statements.       These goals should be achieved with the financial statement      for 2000. The 1998 statements are under review at the present      time. If the IG and GAO identify deficiencies that preclude      the completion of a satisfactory financial statement for 1998      and 1999, then the FM's should be responsible for making the      necessary adjustments and corrections.       The Committee fully supports actions in Congress to achieve      these five financial management initiatives because they are      specifically designed to bring the department into compliance      with the CFO and FFMIA Acts and to lead to the preparation of      reliable financial statements. In the months ahead, it is      expected that these initiatives will be converted into a      legislative reform package and introduced before      consideration of the 2000 defense authorization bill or other      appropriate legislation. The Committee intends to work      closely with the Armed Services Committee and other      appropriate committees of Congress to enact legislation that      addresses in a meaningful manner the goals articulated here.
