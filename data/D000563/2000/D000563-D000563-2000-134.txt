HATCH. I only have a limited period of time, so I have to finish my remarks.  Second, we should expedite INS review of petitions by family members of citizens. Let's face it, the INS is in a mess right now, and it could be reformed to expedite the processing of legal immigrants.  Third, we should restore the right of persons allowed amnesty back in 1986 to have their claims adjudicated.  These three changes in law, in contrast to what is proposed today by our friends on the other side, would be real Latino fairness. It would reward those who have followed the law and played by the rules.  So this is where we are. The vote we are about to have on suspending the rules is a ``have it both ways'' vote. My colleagues voted overwhelmingly for cloture yesterday--including almost all Democrats and all Republicans. The last time I looked, cloture meant the inability to consider nongermane amendments.  Today, many of these same persons who voted for cloture are voting to suspend the results of that vote and allow debate on this unrelated measure. Tomorrow, they will probably vote for cloture again.  So on Tuesday, the high-tech community gets its vote. On Wednesday, many of the same group vote to undo their vote, and on Thursday they vote with high tech again. Oh, it is confusing when you are trying to have it both ways.  I hope no one will be fooled by what is happening. I urge my colleagues to oppose suspending the rules, which is an extraordinary procedural move aimed at playing politics.  I am told that this procedure of suspending the rules has not been used since 1982. I do not believe it has ever been used in this manner for crass political purposes and maneuvering. I hope it will be overwhelmingly rejected. I hope that, once again, we will vote for cloture on this bill.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the Chamber of Commerce dated September 26, 2000, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                     U.S. Chamber of Commerce,                               Washington, DC, September 26, 2000.       To Members of the United States Senate: On behalf of the      U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the world's largest business      federation representing more than three million businesses      and organizations of every size, sector, and region, I wish      to clarify our position with regard to the current debate on      the H-1B legislation and proposals unrelated to that      legislation concerning legalization of certain workers      already in the United States. During this afternoon's debate      on this issue, there have been misleading statements as to      the Chamber's position on provisions relating to updating the      registry date, restoring section 245(i), and adjustments for      certain Central Americans.       While the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, as part of the      Essential Worker Immigration Coalition, has expressed its      general support for these concepts, it strongly opposes      efforts to amend the pending H-1B legislation with these      provisions. These are completely separate issues and must be      considered separately.           Sincerely,                                                  R. Bruce Josten.
