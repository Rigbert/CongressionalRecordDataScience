President, I rise today to remember a fallen son of Oklahoma who died while defending his Nation, SSG Lance M. Chase.  Staff Sergeant Chase grew up in Midwest City Oklahoma and graduated from Midwest City High School in 1991 after playing football there. He was also an avid fisherman and fan of NASCAR. Before joining the Army in 1995, Staff Sergeant Chase spent 20 months working for the Oklahoma City Sheriff's Office as a detention officer alongside his father who is a Reserve officer and member of the sheriff's bomb squad.  Staff Sergeant Chase was assigned to 1st Battalion, 12th Infantry Regiment, 4th Infantry Division at Fort Hood Texas. There he trained other soldiers on how to maintain and move M1A2 Abrams tanks and was an honored marksman. After returning from his first tour of duty in Iraq, he got involved with efforts sending books and hygiene products to the Iraqi people. He told his wife Kristen that his biggest joy was seeing Iraqi children returning to their local schools.  Before Staff Sergeant Chase went to Iraq, he told his two sons--Brett, who is 11 years old, and Trevor, who is 9 years old, that he would rather fight this type of terrorist war on their soil than to fight it on our own soil where his children would be in danger. Staff Sergeant Chase was in his second tour of duty in Iraq on January 23, 2006, when his M1A2 Abrams tank was hit by an improvised explosive device in Baghdad, Iraq. He was 32 years old. SSG Chase clearly understood our mission in Iraq and felt that he had helped to make the lives of the Iraqi people better. Staff Sergeant Lance M. Chase deserves to be remembered for the fine soldier that he was and the sacrifice that he made for us.                      Staff Sergeant John G. Doles  Mr. President, I wish to honor a brave soldier from Oklahoma who gave his life in service of this Nation. SSG John Doles of the U.S. Army embodies the spirit and values that have protected this country's freedom and continue to spread hope to the far corners of the world.  Sergeant Doles was an ``all-American kid'' he grew up in Chelsea, OK, riding horses and playing football. Sergeant Doles joined the Army in 2000 and attended Airborne School at Fort Benning, GA. He went on to become a Ranger and told his father that this was what he wanted to do with his life because he loved his country.  Sergeant Doles was also a devoted family man. He left behind a wife, Heather, and two children, Logan and Breanna. After his tour in Afghanistan, he planned to reenlist and become an instructor at the Army Ranger Camp at Fort Benning, GA, so he could be closer to his family.  Sergeant Doles was no stranger to the hazards of duty. He participated in one of the largest combat jumps since World War II. His unit parachuted into northern Iraq in March of 2003 with the ``Red Devils.'' This major operation assisted in the swift liberation of Iraq. Sergeant Doles was a squad leader of about a dozen soldiers with the 1st Battalion, 508th Infantry Regiment, part of the 173rd Airborne Brigade. On Friday September 30, 2005, he was killed in an ambush in Shah Wali, Afghanistan. He was 29 years old.  Sergeant Doles gave his utmost to his family and his country. He has left behind many who saw firsthand what a true hero he was. As a son of Oklahoma and a fine example of what this country stands for, Staff Sergeant Doles deserves our honor and remembrance.                  Private First Class Travis J. Grigg  Mr. President, I rise today to honor the memory of a remarkable man. PFC Travis J. Grigg was an Oklahoman through-and-through: a hard worker,dedicated, friendly, and a lover of his family and country. Those who knew him best remembered him as athletic and caring more about others than himself. He graduated from Inola High School, of Inola, OK, in 1999 and was a starter on the football, basketball, and baseball teams. He entered the U.S. Army in 2004, proudly serving his Nation in Iraq for about a year.  According to his family, Private First Class Grigg found his niche in the Army. He was a team player and a responsible man who once commented, ``I feel like we're helping some people over here.'' He was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 320th Field Artillery Regiment, 101st Airborne Division. He joined the Army to earn money for college to become a teacher and football coach, but after joining, he decided that he wanted to become a firefighter like his father.  November 15, 2005, in Taji, Iraq, Private First Class Grigg was one of four individuals in a HMMWV that was hit when an improvised explosive device detonated. Tragically he, along with four other soldiers, did not survive the incident. He was 24 years old.  Private First Class Grigg will be missed by his father, four sisters, and two brothers. His sacrifice will not soon be forgotten by them his friends, his fellow soldiers, or by his country. I ask that we take this time to honor his name and his life.               Petty Officer Second Class Brian K. Joplin  Mr. President, I rise today to honor the memory of a son of Oklahoma, Petty Officer Brian K. Joplin.  Petty Officer Joplin grew up in Hugo, OK and was assigned to Helicopter Mine Countermeasures Squadron 15, based at the Naval Air Station in Corpus Christi, TX. He was an aviation machinist and was known as a mechanic whose talent was second to none. Petty Officer Joplin was always willing to donate his time to his friends and neighbors. He spent his Memorial Day weekend of 2005 repairing and certifying a vintage B-25 Mitchell Bomber that was very much like the one his grandfather flew in World War II.  Petty Officer Joplin was deployed to Iraq in June of 2005. On Tuesday October 4, 2005, he was on a training mission when he fell from his MH-53 Sea Dragon helicopter and was killed. He was 32 years old.  Petty Officer Joplin is survived by his wife of 12 years, Belinda, and his daughters, Tori and Alicia. They will always remember a loving husband and father who had a great sense of humor, patience, and forgiveness and our thoughts are with them. We remember Petty Officer Joplin for his service, dedication, and love of his country, and at the same time, we recognize his valor and commitment. He will not be forgotten. It is because of men like Petty Officer Joplin that I am proud to be a part of this great country. He was a special soldier, a true Oklahoman, and a true American.                  Private First Class David J. Martin  Mr. President, I rise to pay homage to Army PFC David J. Martin, who gave the ultimate sacrifice for his country with his life. Although he was only 21 years old, Private First Class Marshall was a dedicated defender of America and knew the value of freedom and the sacrifices freedom sometimes demands. For his service, I am proud to honor him on the Senate floor today.  Private First Class Martin was a member of the Second Battalion, 502nd Infantry Regiment, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, of the 101st Airborne Division. A native Oklahoman from Edmond, Private First Class Martin was one of four sons of Richard and Janet Martin. Private First Class Martin's mother is the president of the Edmond and North Oklahoma City Chapter of the Blue Star Mothers, a support group for mothers whose children are in the military and also send care packages to our soldiers in Iraq. We hold her in our prayers as all of her sons are serving our country in some way. Private First Class Martin's younger brother, Daniel, also enlisted last year, and his older brothers, Neil and Andrew, are police officers in Edmond, OK.  After graduating from Edmond North High School in 2002, Private First Class Martin briefly attended the University of Central Oklahoma and was a member of the ROTC unit there before enlisting in the Army. He earned an Army Achievement Medal during his training in Fort Benning, GA, for being an outstanding leader.  Private First Class Martin had only been in Iraq for a month when he was tragically killed. On October 31, 2005, the humvee he and three other fellow soldiers were riding in was struck by an improvised explosive device in Al Mahmudiyah, Iraq. I ask that the U.S. Senate now pay tribute to PFC David Martin, a man who knew the true meaning of service and sacrifice. I am proud of him and proud of his demonstrated commitment to winning the freedom of those he did not know. We will not forget this Oklahoman hero, this American patriot--PFC David Martin.                    First Sergeant Tobias C. Meister  Mr. President, I stand today to honor the memory of a brave American who gave his life defending the Nation. He felt a call to serve his country, to be part of something bigger than himself, and ultimately he paid the highest price. First Sergeant Tobias C. Meister, of Jenks, OK, was assigned to the Army's 321st Civil Affairs Brigade which was deployed to Afghanistan.  First Sergeant Meister was born in Remsen, Iowa and joined the Iowa National Guard in 1992, 2 years prior to graduating from Ramsen-Union Community High School in Iowa. He was an infantryman before transferring to the Reserves in 1998 and attending the University of Texas at San Antonio. There he earned a business degree and later took a job in Tulsa, OK, with the oil and gas firm Horizon Natural Resources.  First Sergeant Meister was an accomplished martial artist who was undefeated as a kickboxer. Those who fought against him knew immediately he was a fierce competitor. One of his opponents said that Meister weighed about ``165 pounds and you knew 100 pounds of it was heart if you saw him fight.'' He loved martial arts and the discipline that it required.  First Sergeant Meister was a drill sergeant and had been named the Army Reserve's Drill Sergeant of the Year in 2002. In 2004, he decided to join those he had been training for combat. On December 28, 2005 in Asadabad, Afghanistan, he was killed at the age of 30 during combat patrol operations when an improvised explosive device was detonated near his humvee.  First Sergeant Meister gave his life for the freedom of millions of Americans and also for the peace and prosperity of the Afghani people crippled by a totalitarian regime. He is survived by his wife Alicia and 18-month-old son Will. The loss of this exemplary husband, father, and soldier is a loss we all feel; our thoughts and prayers are especially with his family and friends. He knew that he and his fellow soldiers were fighting to protect America, to keep their Nation safe. It is for men like First Sergeant Meister that I am proud to be a part of this great country. He was a special soldier, a special man, and a defender of our freedom.                   Technical Sergeant Jason L. Norton  Mr. President, I rise today to honor the memory of a man who paid the last full measure for the protection of our freedom. TSgt Jason L. Norton was from Miami, OK, and was assigned to the 3rd Security Forces Squadron at Elmendorf Air Force Base in Alaska serving as a patrol and security officer training police canines. He had been deployed to Iraq in November of 2005.  Technical Sergeant Norton joined the Air Force in 1992 after graduating from Miami High School in 1991, where he played football and wrestled. His Air Force career took him to many different places. He was known as smart, easy to talk to, and always willing to share what he knew with others. He earned 17 medals, including an Air Force Commendation Medal, 4 Air Force Achievement Awards, and 2 Air Force Expeditionary Service Medals. He enjoyed his time in Alaska, earning a reputation as a great Alaskan hunter while also providing his time as a father figure to children who needed one.  For Technical Sergeant Norton, family was everything. Even though he was stationed 4,000 miles away in Alaska, he made a point to return home often to see his family. He met his wife Cristina while he was serving at Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma, and they have two children, a daughter, Rebecca, who is 8 years old, and a son Dalton, who is 7. He has been described as a great father who showed an equal devotion to his lifelong friends. Once he traveled back to Oklahoma from Alaska to attend the funeral for thewife of a longtime friend who had died of cancer.  On January 22, 2006, TSgt Jason L. Norton's vehicle struck an improvised explosive device while conducting a convoy escort in the vicinity of Taji, Iraq. He was 32 years old, and the Air Force posthumously awarded him the Bronze Star and Purple Heart. Mr. President, we have lost a shining example of dedication, service, and sacrifice for others and should never forget the sacrifice of TSgt Jason L. Norton.                    Army Specialist Joshua M. Pearce  Mr. President, I rise today to remember a young man from Oklahoma, Army SPC Joshua M. Pearce, who knew what it meant to be a soldier and was willing to pay the ultimate price for our freedom.  Specialist Pearce was from Guymon, OK, and was a baseball pitcher on the Guymon High School baseball team who was voted ``Life of the Party'' and ``Best Looking'' by his senior classmates in 2003. He always wanted to be a soldier, so he enlisted in the Army right after graduation, joining his older brother, Jeremy, in the Armed Forces. Specialist Pearce was described by friends and family alike as a person who always made everybody in the room smile.  Specialist Pearce was deployed to Iraq as a part of the 2nd Battalion, 1st Infantry Regiment, 172nd Stryker Brigade Combat Team that is stationed at Fort Wainwright, AK. Over the 6 months he served in Iraq, he talked to his mother, Becky Hilliard, through e-mail, telephone, or instant messaging on a daily basis. In an open letter he wrote on September 11, 2005, Specialist Pearce stated that ``I am not here to kill someone; I am here to help as many as I can live a better life. If killing some people to save the life of a fellow soldier happens to fall in the agenda, so be it. We drive down the streets of these little towns and see little children on the corners bare-footed asking for water, food, or whatever they can get.'' He told his sister, Heidi Barncastle, that ``he was doing this so his nephews didn't have to.''  Specialist Pearce was riding in his Stryker military vehicle on February 26, 2006 near Mosul, Iraq, when it was hit with an improvised explosive device. He was 21 years old. Specialist Pearce did not want his friends and family to mourn his loss should he die. He was doing what he always wanted to do and believed in the mission that he was on. Mr. President, we will not forget this Oklahoma hero and American patriot, SPC Joshua M. Pearce, who died doing something that he loved.               Private First Class Joshua Francis Powers  Mr. President, I rise today to honor one of Oklahoma's brave soldiers who has given us the last full measure to protect our freedom. PFC Joshua Francis Powers' sacrifice for his country should never be forgotten.  Private First Class Powers was from Skiatook, OK. He joined the Army in July of 2005, 1 month after earning his GED. He was remembered as an even-tempered soul who had varied interests from collecting swords and knives, making soap for senior citizens, fishing, and just simply hitting golf balls out into the pasture to occupy his time. He had a penchant for reading, sewing, playing video games, and often served as a peacemaker between his brothers, Michael and Jonathan. He was also a devout son who would often fix his mother Patrica's frozen pipes before he was asked to.  Private First Class Powers was assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 592nd Infantry Regiment, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 101st Airborne Division at Fort Campbell, KY. After joining the Army, he was worried that his dog, Spunky, who had been his pet since he was in kindergarten, would die of old age before he got home. Private First Class Powers had been in Iraq for only 2\1/2\ weeks before he died of noncombat related injuries. He was 21 years old. Mr. President, we should always remember those who served the way PFC Joshua Francis Powers served and sacrificed for our freedom.                       Corporal Jeffry A. Rogers  Mr. President, I wish to honor a true hero who, on November 16, 2005, gave his life while serving in Iraq. Cpl Jeffry Alan Rogers is an example of the selfless dedication that is essential to maintaining this country's freedom.  Corporal Rogers was from Oklahoma City and attended Putnam City North High School. He was one of six from the class of 2002 who enlisted in the military after graduating. He insisted on enlisting in the Marines after witnessing the horrors of September 11 saying, ``We have to keep our world safe. We have to protect our people.''  Corporal Rogers became an outstanding marine assigned to F. Company, 2nd Battalion, 1st Marine Division in Camp Pendleton, CA. His high test scores earned him an invitation to join the security forces and a $50,000 scholarship. He suggested to his parents that they build a house with the money that they had saved for his college education, and he even designed the house where his family now lives in Yukon, OK.  Corporal Rogers is remembered as a courteous and loving man who always said the little things that mean a lot to people. His commanders fondly recall how he invested into those under him and helped them set goals.  In his last letter to his parents, he quoted John 15:13 saying ``Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.'' Mr. President, Cpl Jeffry Rogers indeed demonstrated this deepest love. At 21 years of age, he put aside his own safety, volunteering to serve in the most dangerous of professions. He gave everything, and his sacrifice will be remembered by friends, family, and all of us who are profoundly indebted to him.                 Technical Sergeant Patrick L. Shannon  Mr. President, I rise today to honor a son of Oklahoma who after over 37 years has finally returned home. TSgt Patrick L. Shannon was serving his country in the Vietnam War when he was declared missing in action in 1968 after the radar site he and 18 other servicemen were operating in Laos was attacked by North Vietnamese commandos. We now know that Technical Sergeant Shannon did not survive the attack. He was 30 years old.  Technical Sergeant Shannon was from Owasso, OK, and was operating a radar installation Lima Site 85 atop the Pha Thi Mountain in the Houaphan Province in Laos, which was approximately 13 miles south of the border with North Vietnam. Lima Site 85 was helping to direct U.S. bombing missions of key targets in North Vietnam. On the morning of March 11, 1968, the site was overrun by North Vietnamese commandos. Only 7 of the 19 servicemen survived the attack, and the United States later bombed the site for 4 days to destroy the equipment that was left behind. North Vietnamese soldiers later threw the bodies of the dead servicemen off a cliff because the rocky ground did not permit a burial. This is where the remains of Technical Sergeant Shannon were found.  Technical Sergeant Shannon finally came home last year. A DNA sample from his sister helped to positively identify Technical Sergeant Shannon and bring closure to his family who had wondered what had really happened to him on that fateful day. His youngest child, Paula Wallace, said that her father ``would be happy to be back in America.'' Mr. President, I, too, am happy that TSgt Patrick L. Shannon has finally returned home after answering his country's call to arms.                 Sergeant First Class Brandon K. Sneed  Mr. President, I wish to honor a brave soldier from Oklahoma who gave the last full measure to protect our freedom. SFC Brandon Sneed of the U.S. Army embodied the spirit of service and the values that make this country what it is today.  Sergeant Sneed was a great soldier. He joined soon after graduating from high school in 1990. As he rose through the ranks, he developed a reputation of dependability. He was serving as a field medic with Bravo Company in the 1st Battalion, 30th Infantry Regiment attached to the 69th Armor Regiment serving in Iraq.  Sergeant Sneed was no stranger to the hazards of duty. He would routinely go under fire to retrieve wounded soldiers. His second tour in Iraq was scheduled to end in December of last year.  Sergeant Sneed was also a family man. He married his wife Lori in 1994, and they had three children, Christopher, Brandee, and Brandon, Jr. His family had just moved into a new home. Sergeant Sneed met his wife while they both served their first tour in the Army together; they had plans to open a rehabilitation facility upon his retirement from the Army.  On October 10, 2005, Sergeant Sneed was killed while attempting to rescuean injured soldier when his Bradley Fighting Vehicle was destroyed by a roadside bomb. This occurred near Ramadi in Iraq's Anbar province. He was 33 years old. He had a strong sense of duty, work ethic, and a caring heart. He was devoted to his family, his country, and gave the highest sacrifice to his soldiers. Sergeant First Class Sneed deserves our honor and remembrance.                        Corporal Joshua J. Ware  Mr. President, I wish to honor one of this country's fallen warriors, a young man that comes from my home State of Oklahoma. Marine Cpl Joshua J. Ware was serving the cause of freedom in Iraq when he paid the ultimate price.  Corporal Ware was born in Lawton, OK. He played football and baseball and ran track at Roland High School. In 2002, 1 year before he graduated, he signed up for the Marine Corps and enlisted just 5 days after graduating from High School and just 2 days after his birthday.  Corporal Ware was serving in Iraq with F Company, 2nd, Battalion, 1st Marine Division, and bravely fought in the second battle of Fallujah. He was on his second tour of duty in Iraq on November 16, 2005, when he was killed as a result of enemy small arms fire in Ubaydi, Iraq. He was 20 years old and was the first Comanche or Kiowa to die in combat since 1968.  Many are left behind who are proud and grieved at his sacrifice. Corporal Ware is survived by his parents, three brothers, and one sister.  The loss of Corporal Ware is one that will continue to be felt as the years pass. He gave more than was required, in life and in the sacrifice of his death. He gave up his own well-being, putting himself in harm's way, and demonstrated courage that demands our recognition. I hope to express our gratefulness for his sacrifice with these simple words and honor him before the Senate today.                          ____________________
