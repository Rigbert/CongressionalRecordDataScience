 Our Republican friends raise important issues and I think good issues and they talk about values, and values, in fact, are a very important part of what human life is. Life is not just dollars and cents; it goes deeper than that. But I have to raise the question about what kind of value system are we operating under when the very wealthiest people become wealthier, when we see a growth of billionaires at exactly the same time as we see more children in America who are hungry. What about those values? I yield to my friend.
