I asked the question of my Democratic colleague, Senator Rockefeller, which I would ask of you. In that Senate Intelligence Committee report relative to the alleged meeting in Prague involving Mohammad Atta, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence report says thatno such meeting occurred. I would like to ask the Senator from Kansas this: When the Vice President was asked on Sunday on ``Meet the Press'' by Mr. Russert the following question: ``And the meeting with Atta did not occur?'' he replied, ``We don't know,'' is that statement by the Vice President consistent with the report that you signed and issued to the public on the previous Friday?
