Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I support, clearly, the gentleman from Ohio's (Mr. Ney) motion and congratulate him for bringing this matter to the floor in such a timely fashion.  For 5 months, Mr. Speaker, more than 130 men and women of the District of Columbia National Guard stood watch here at the Capitol complex alongside our own Capitol Police. They superbly assisted the Capitol Police in the discharge of their principal duty, which is to enable Congress to operate securely in the discharge of its constitutional responsibilities.  With the support of the National Guard Bureau and the Department of Defense, the men and women of the District of Columbia Guard helped make it possible for Congress to continue its work. For that, all Members are thankful.  The men and women of the Guard also enabled our Capitol Police to have some measure of much needed rest and relief. Even with the Guard's help, Capitol Police officers worked 12-hour shifts during the last 7 months, most for 6 days a week. I hope all the Members heard that because it is not appropriate that we allow that to continue. It is not appropriate for our security. It is not appropriate for the safety of our men and women in the Capitol Police. It is not appropriate for their families.  Fortunately, that grueling schedule has somewhat subsided. It doubtless would have been even more demanding, however, without the assistance of the diligent, dedicated Guardsmen and -women, and for that, as I said, we are most thankful.  Mr. Speaker, the men and women of the District of Columbia Guard distinguished themselves in this undertaking. They discharged this extraordinary duty with diligence, professionalism, dedication and good humor. I will include at this point in the Record a complete list of their names.

They brought honor upon themselves as individuals and upon the District of Columbia and the National Guard. They also brought honor upon this Capitol, managed in a very efficient, effective, secure way.  The National Guard, of course, is a cornerstone of our national defense establishment, and these men and women represented it well. We greatly appreciate the willingness of men and women from every walk of life to serve when needed, at home and abroad, to help keep this Nation free and secure.  The National Guardsmen and -women who served here at the Capitol have now resumed their normal duties. They certainly deserve the salute of this House. This resolution, Mr. Speaker, commends the Guard, the Guard Bureau, and the Defense Department for a job well done. It records their contribution to the security of our democracy.  I note that this resolution resembles one introduced by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Davis) on April 10. The fact that multiple resolutions have been introduced demonstrates the affection and gratitude Members have for the men and women whom we met and who served our Nation and our Capitol.  Mr. Speaker, I urge every Member to support this motion, as I am sure they will.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
