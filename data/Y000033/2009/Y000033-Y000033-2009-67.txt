Madam Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to an Alaskan Pioneer and father of modern-day Anchorage. Former long-term Anchorage Mayor George Murray Sullivan, 87, died September 23, 2009, surrounded by his family. A lifelong Alaskan, Sullivan was born on March 31, 1922, raised in Valdez, Alaska, where his father Harvey was the U.S. District Marshal and mother Viola was the first woman mayor in Alaska.  Sullivan's life and leadership spanned the territorial days of Alaska through statehood. In the 1920s, the Sullivans lived in Valdez, a busy town in the first two decades of the 20th century that supported a bowling alley, several breweries, a dam and hydroelectric plant, the seat of the Territory of Alaska's Third Judicial District, a public library, hospital, and public school system. George had a wonderful life as a kid in Valdez, playing many sports, engaging in school activities, and helping at the family store.  During World War II, Anchorage's population exploded from around 8,000 to more than 43,000. In July, 1944, George was drafted into the U.S. Army for two years and was stationed at Adak in the Aleutian Islands. He married the love of his life, Margaret Eagan Sullivan, on December 30, 1947, and moved to Nenana. George was the U.S. deputy marshal and Margaret was the U.S. commissioner. Aptly, George would catch the criminals and Margaret would try them. In 1955, he was elected to the Fairbanks City Council. George took a job in management with Consolidated Freightways and in 1959 moved the family to Anchorage, where he lived for the next 50 years. From 1964 to 1965, George served in the Alaska Legislature, after being appointed by Governor Bill Egan to fill a vacancy, and soon after was elected to the Anchorage City Council. In 1967, he ran a successful race to become Anchorage mayor, a position he would hold for 15 years. In 1975, voters approved the unification of Anchorage's city and borough governments and elected George its mayor. The creation of the Municipality of Anchorage was an incredible undertaking. As mayor, George successful merged the duplicative departments, boards, and utilities into one government.  Statehood in 1958 brought change but it was the oil boom that provided the resources for Anchorage to blossom into a modern day city. George and his administration had a vision of what Anchorage could become and were entrusted to direct the streaming State oil revenues toward improving and enhancing the city's quality of life for its residents. George helped secure State funding for the construction of the Egan Civic and Convention Center, Loussac Library, the Alaska Center for the Performing Arts, and the Sullivan Sports Arena. This moved Anchorage into being a modem and vibrant community.  George finished as Mayor of Anchorage in 1982. For the past many years since, George has remained active in the community and state boards up until his illness in 2008. Through the years he was active on the Enstar board, AWWU, state PERS board, Anchorage Senior Center Endowment, TOTE Advisory Board, Military Advisory Board, Anchorage Wellness Court Alumni Group, Alaska Heart Association, Boys and Girls Clubs, and many more. He was always willing to lend a helping hand to make Anchorage a little better for those less fortunate or in need. He had a strong faith in the Roman Catholic Church and often assisted at Mass and in the church's organizations. He was a member of the Elks Club, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and the Pioneers of Alaska.  George had an incredible love for the community and worked on many projects to enhance the quality of life for all who called Anchorage home. He was a true public servant and visionary who strived to make Anchorage a better community for future generations while he was mayor and during his retirement.  George was a great Alaskan. George was my friend.                          ____________________
