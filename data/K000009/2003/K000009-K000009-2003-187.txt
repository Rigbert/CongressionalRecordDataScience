Speaker, I submit the following for the Record.                  (By David Johnston and James Risen)       A draft report by the joint Congressional committee looking      into the Sept. 11 attacks has concluded that the F.B.I. and      the C.I.A., in their investigations, did not aggressively      pursue leads that might have linked the terrorists to Saudi      Arabia, senior government officials said today.       The report charged among other things that the authorities      had failed to investigate the possibility that two of the      hijackers, Saudis named Khalid al-Midhar and Nawaq Alhazmi,      received Saudi money from two Saudi men they met with in      California in the year before the attacks. The committee's      preliminary findings, which also accuse the Saudi government      of a lack of cooperation with American investigators, have      caused a bitter behind-the-scenes dispute between the panel's      staff and officials at the F.B.I. and the C.I.A. At each      agency, officials have disagreed with draft findings, saying      investigators vigorously pursued all available information      related to Saudi Arabia.       Fifteen of the 19 hijackers were Saudi citizens, but little      is known about their backgrounds and how they were recruited      for the attacks. Most of the Saudis were part of a group that      investigators refer to as the ``muscle.'' These were men      recruited late in the planning for the operation, not as      pilots, but as an unskilled security force for the hijacking      operation. Their job was to keep passengers at bay as the      planes were commandeered and flown to their intended targets.       In a rebuttal report sent to the committee in recent days,      the F.B.I. has tried to disprove several specific allegations      by the committee. One of them was about Mr. Midhar and Mr.      Alhazmi, who lived in Sand Diego a year before the attacks.       While in California, the two met with Omar al-Bayoumi and      Osama Bassnan, each of whom was receiving financial support      from the Saudi government. The men were receiving stipends,      although officials said it was not exactly clear what kind.      The committee staff concluded in its draft findings that      investigators should have followed up on the meetings of the      four men to determine whether there might have been a Saudi      link to the hijacking plot.       The F.B.I. is still investigating how much financial      support, if any, was provided by Mr. Bayoumi and Mr. Bassnan      to the two men who later turned out to be hijackers. The      bureau is also looking into whether senior Saudi officials in      the United States may have played some role in distributing      funds to Mr. Bayoumi and Mr. Bassnan.       Today, the F.B.I. said in a statement that it had      ``aggressively pursued investigative leads regarding      terrorist support and activity.'' It added that Mr. Bayoumi      and Mr. Bassnan had both been charged with visa fraud after      the attacks.       But by that time, Mr. Bayoumi was already in Britain, where      he was temporarily detained and then released because visa      fraud was not an extraditable offense. The F.B.I. statement      did not say where the two men were now or clarify the status      of the cases against them.       Although the disagreement has not been publicly disclosed      until now, the debate over possible Saudi connections raises      a very sensitive political issue for the Bush administration.      Saudi Arabia is the largest oil producer in the world and one      of the United States' closest and most important allies in      the Persian Gulf at a time when the administration is      preparing for a possible war with Iraq.       In its report to the committee, the F.B.I. said that it was      no uncommon for Saudis in the United States to receive      financial support from their government and that an inquiry      into the two me after the attacks had failed to produce      evidence that they had any link to the Sept. 11 plot. A      C.I.A. spokesman declined to comment about the joint      inquiry's investigation of the Saudi matter.       Counterterrorism officials have said Mr. Midhar and Mr.      Alhazmi had paid for more of their expenses with cash, which      has made the investigation more difficult. They have also      denied finding any evidence that funds for the attacks were      channeled through Saudi Arabia or that the Riyadh government      had any connection to the hijackers.       It remains unclear whether the draft conclusions about      Saudi Arabia will be included in the joint committee's final      report, which is to be completed in December in classified      form. An edited version is not expected to be made public      until next year, officials said.       The Bush administration has sought to maintain close ties      with Riyadh even as investigators examining the backgrounds      of the hijackers have complained that they have received      little cooperation from the Saudi government.       Investigators have yet to determine how the Saudi hijackers      were selected for the plot, who chose them or whether they      had help inside Saudi Arabia. Some American officials have      theorized that Mr. Midhar and Mr. Alhazmi may have returned      to Saudi Arabia from the United States to pick the Saudi      hijackers, but investigators have no firm conclusions.       For their part, Saudi officials have said that they have      assisted in important aspects of the investigation--for      instance, providing confirmation of the identities of the      Saudi hijackers. The officials have also said the hijackers'      anti-American extremism did not represent mainstream thinking      in the kingdom, even though some American officials have long      regarded Islamic militancy as a serious problem that could      destabilize the authoritarian government.       The tension between the joint inquiry staff and the F.B.I.      and C.I.A. is the latest to evolve from the inquiry into      lapses by intelligence and law enforcement agencies related      to the Sept. 11 attacks. In a series of interim reports      released during committee hearings in recent months, the      joint panel had repeatedly criticized the performance of the      two agencies.       Those sometimes scathing reports prompted officials at both      the F.B.I. and the C.I.A.,     including the director of central intelligence, George J.      Tenet, to criticize the joint panel's methods. Officials have      complained that it reached conclusions based on scant      evidence and that it took evidence out of context.       The joint committee has already held at least one closed      hearing on the F.B.I.'s relationship with a San Diego      informer, the landlord of Mr. Midhar and Mr. Alhazmi a year      before the attacks. The informer's role has become important      because his former tenants are the hijackers who have come      under the most intense scrutiny in the joint inquiry.       Mr. Midhar and Mr. Alhazmi, who were aboard the American      Airlines plane that crashed into the Pentagon, were      identified as Qaeda operatives by the C.I.A. in January 2001.      But the C.I.A. did not ask the State Department to place      their names on a watch list intended to prevent entry into      the United States until late August. By then, they were both      in the country. The C.I.A. sent information about the two men      to the F.B.I. in late August, but by then there was little      time left for the bureau to track them down.       The committee investigating the hijackers was also told by      a retired F.B.I. agent who was the bureau's contact with the      San Diego informer that he might have uncovered a hint of the      plot through his informer network if the C.I.A. had provided      the F.B.I. with more information earlier about the two men.      http://www.nytimes.com                          ____________________
