President, I am going to yield to the majority leader when he comes to the floor, which could be momentarily. But I would like to, if I may, in morning business, address an issue which I think goes to the heart and soul of what the Senate is all about. One hundred men and women come together in this Senate, two from each State, to be part of a rich tradition in the history of this country, part of a national debate about the issues that are timely and important. It is an opportunity for the American people, through us, to have a voice and actually speak to these issues.  Unfortunately, time and again, this voice has been silenced, delayed by tactics from the minority side of the aisle.  I see the majority leader is here. I am going to yield to him at this point. I know he wanted to make the opening statement in morning business.  I yield to the majority leader.                          ____________________
