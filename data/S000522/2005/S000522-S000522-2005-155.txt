Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Chairman, we appreciate the concern of the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Eshoo) and the gentleman from California (Mr. Cardoza), and for their strong statements here. The problem of the Chaldo-Assyrians has been brought to the attention of the committee. The committee has brought these concerns to the attention of the administration.  I have met with people myself who have expressed concerns about this, and believe that they should not get short shrift when it comes to U.S. foreign aid and efforts being made in Iraq. The administration has prepared materials attempting to show it has been fair and inclusive in its distribution of assistance, but this amendment puts every one of us on guard that we need to watch this very carefully to make sure that they are not shown the door or in any way denied the kind of assistance that we are capable of offering and I think we are obligated to provide to them. I appreciate the gentlewoman's amendment.  The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Eshoo).  The amendment was agreed to.  The Acting CHAIRMAN. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 33 printed in part B of House Report 109-175.                Amendment No. 33 Offered by Mr. Fossella
