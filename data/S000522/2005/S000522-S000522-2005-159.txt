Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, first of all, I want to thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Reyes) for his very compassionate and important amendment. It should be supported, and the majority on this side of the aisle supports it.  Since 1993, almost 400 women and girls have been murdered and more than 70 remain missing in Ciudad Juarez in Mexico. This commonsense amendment simply seeks to provide congressional authority and funding to the Secretary of State to make independent technical and forensic expertise available to the families of these young women and girls.  The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Reyes) represents, as we know, the El Paso area across the border from this area. His amendment extends a helping hand to these grieving families. I want to commend the gentleman for his compassion in offering this amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
