Speaker, I thank the gentleman. I realize the problems of doing that; but many of our Members, particularly those who come fromfar away, are concerned about traveling on that Wednesday, as the gentleman knows, which makes it problematic because we will have to be very late Thursday. We will obviously accommodate what the majority believes it is going to do.  In that regard, last week, we had thought we probably, or might, be in tomorrow. We are not going to be in tomorrow. Can the majority leader give us a view on what might be the status of next Friday? I yield to my friend.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. At this point we believe that we can complete the legislation we have scheduled for next week by Thursday night of next week. However, however, given the still fluid situation in the gulf coast area, we are not yet prepared to cancel the session next Friday.
