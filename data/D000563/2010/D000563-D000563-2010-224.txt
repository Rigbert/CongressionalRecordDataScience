President, I wish to say a few words about an extraordinary man, a friend of mine, who died this week in Carterville, IL. Dan Callahan was the head baseball coach at Southern Illinois University at Carbondale for the last 16 years. He died Monday at the age of 52.  Dan Callahan was not only a good coach, he was a great man. His conduct on and off the field inspired just about everybody who ever met him.  Dan died of neurotropic melanoma, a very rare and very serious form of skin cancer. His struggle with cancer began almost 5 years ago when he detected a little black spot on his lower lip. The spot was successfully removed, but the cancer remained and grew.  After receiving his diagnosis, Dan Callahan silently endured the rigors of his treatment while continuing to coach his baseball team. In the 2007, 2008 seasons there were times he probably should have stayed home because he was too weak to do much but sit in the dugout, but he came to work and he came to that ball yard every day. He didn't miss a single game.  The next season Dan endured more intense treatment, including a surgery that removed part of his right jaw. It was only then that he went public with his illness. Eventually, the cancer cost Dan not only his job but the sight in his right eye and the hearing in his right ear. But it didn't stop the coach. The losses damaged his depth perception and hearing. But if Dan Callahan, once a pitcher in his own right, wasn't able to throw a fastball with quite the same speed and control, he taught his players an even more important lesson: how to push through adversity.  The chemo and surgery forced him to miss all of his team's road trip games during the 2009 season, and that bothered him even more than the cancer. He believed a coach should be with his players. Somehow, this past season--his last season--Dan was able to be on the bench for nearly every game. He considered that a great victory, and it was.  The president of Southern Illinois University, Glen Poshard, a former Congressman, said about Danny Callahan: ``As far as I'm concerned, he was the face of courage.''  The Missouri Valley Conference recognized that fact a year ago when it awarded Dan Callahan its ``Most Courageous Award,'' an award that honors those who have demonstrated unusual courage in the face of personal illness, adversity, or tragedy. In announcing Dan's selection, the Missouri Valley Conference Commissioner Doug Elgin said:       Dan Callahan personifies professionalism in the face of      personal adversity, and he's been an inspiration to his      baseball student-athletes, and really all those who know him.      We feel honored to be able to recognize him.  Dan had a great sense of humor. He used to joke that he led the league in one category: surgeries. In fact, he leaves a rich record of athletic achievement. In 22 seasons as an NCAA Division I head coach, Dan Callahan compiled an impressive record of 595 wins and 695 losses, and 442 of those nearly 600 victories were at Southern Illinois, making him the second winningest coach in SIU's history.  Dan Callahan was one of just five coaches in Missouri Valley Conference history to win over 200 league games. In his time at Carbondale, he produced 23 Major League draft picks and 19 First-Team All-MVC selections.  Baseball was Dan's lifelong love and passion. As an athlete, he pitched two seasons at the University of New Orleans, two at Quincy College, from which he graduated. After college, he pitched professionally in both the San Diego Padres and Seattle Mariners' organizations.  His first coaching job was in my hometown at Springfield High School, his alma mater. He also coached at Eastern University for 5 years before heading down to Carbondale.  Last October, Dan began chemotherapy. His doctors prescribed a three-drug cocktail that includes Avastin, one of a new generation of anticancer drugs that works by preventing the growth of new blood vessels that support tumors. Avastin can buy time and a better quality of life for the people with advanced cancer, but it is very expensive. In Dan's case, it cost $13,686 a treatment--about $100,000 a year.  Unfortunately, Dan's health insurance company, the largest health insurer in America, a company that had paid for surgery to remove the initial spot from his lip and the second surgery to remove part of his jaw, refused to pay for the Avastin. The chemo drug was FDA-approved and something of a wonder drug in treating advanced colon, lung, breast, and other cancers. But the insurance company said its use to treat cancers like Dan's was experimental so they wouldn't cover it.  With the support of family and friends, Dan and his wife Stacy found $27,000 to pay for the first two treatments. Washington University in St. Louis provided another $50,000; that bought him four more treatments. Through all the chemo and radiation treatments and all the painful surgeries, Dan Callahan never complained. He was never bitter and he never felt sorry for himself. But he worried about other people and other families who needed expensive drugs and couldn't afford them. Dan thought it was unfair that patients could be denied treatment that could extend and maybe even save their lives simply because of the drug's high price. We talked about that last year while the Senate was debating America's broken health care system. I thought about Dan Callahan when I voted for the Affordable Health Care Act.  In his prime, Dan Callahan stood 6 feet 4 and weighed 225 pounds. The cancer took its toll. The last couple of months were rough. He spent most of them at Barnes Hospital in St. Louis. A little more than a week ago, he told his doctors he needed to take a break so he could attend a Thanksgiving get-together with his team. He went home for hospice care and died 3 days later surrounded by the people he loved.  I offer my deepest condolences to Stacy, Dan's wife of 21 years, and their daughters Alexa and Carly, and his parents Ann and Gene. Gene and Ann are my closest friends and I have known Dan since he was 9 years old. I also wish to say to Sherry and Lynn, his sisters, he couldn't have come from a better family. My thoughts are also with the student-athletes whom Dan coached and inspired over the years. Dan's passing is a deep loss for so many people.  On Monday, Dan is going to have a send-off. It is going to be at the baseball diamond. Dan's family and his SIU family are hosting a celebration of his life at the SIU baseball diamond where he spent so many years. There will be a party afterwards with hot wings and beer. The invitation says, ``Please dress casually. No suits. No ties.'' That is exactly what Dan would have wanted.  Jim Ruppert, the sports editor for my hometown newspaper, the State Journal Register in Springfield, was also Dan Callahan's brother-in-law. In his column the day after Dan died he said:       When the official scorer in the sky makes his final ruling,      he will say Dan Callahan lost his nearly 5-year battle with      cancer Monday afternoon at his home in Carterville. But the      52-year-old Callahan was a baseball guy who went down      swinging, battling the dreaded disease to the bottom of the      ninth inning.  Dan Callahan coached the sport he loved, and it is a unique sport. It is one of the few team sports that has no timeclock. Baseball is only over when it is over, and that is the way life is too. At the end of his life, Dan Callahan still sits in that dugout and with a watchful coach's eye, he scans the field and sees hundreds of young men whose lives he touched, players and families who will never forget him. He taught them more than baseball. He taught them about life and courage, about themselves and their relationships with others.  I have known Dan all his life. I consider it a blessing to have counted him as a friend. Lou Gehrig, when he learned of his illness, said he was still the luckiest man on the face of the Earth. Dan Callahan felt the same way about himself and for the same reasons. Whether he was the luckiest man on Earth, I don't know, but I do know that all of us who had the good fortune to know Dan Callahan were lucky. We were inspired by his courage and his dignity and we will miss him.                 Congratulating Stan ``The Man'' Musial  This is another baseball-themed speech which I didn't expect to give on the floor of the Senate, but today is a happy day for me.  I grew up in East Saint Louis, IL. I learned about God and church, but the only god I was sure of played for the St. Louis Cardinals and his name was Stan Musial. The first baseball glove I ever owned was a Rawlings leather glove that had Stan Musial's name written on the edge of it. I used to do what kids my age did. We would wrap rubberbands around the glove with the baseball in it to get that pocket just right and then we would pull that ball out and we would rub it with Glovolium, some kind of oil concoction that we thought made it supple and made it easier to catch the ball. I rubbed that oil on my glove so hard so many times I was the only one who would still read his name on that glove. I kept it forever until my wife said, What are you doing with this old thing, and I said it was my prized possession when I was about 10 years old, and it still is.  The good news is that my feelings for Stan Musial are shared by the President of the United States. He may be a Chicago White Sox fan, but he knows a great champion when he sees one. That is why the announcement today that Stan ``The Man'' Musial is going to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom makes me feel so good.  The one thing about Stan that I found so interesting is here was one of the most public figures in baseball of his time and I never heard a negative word about him, not about his professional life or his public life. He served this country not only as a hero on the baseball diamond, but he left his team to serve in the military. He went back as the Presiding Officer did--to entertain the troops and serve as well. He cared about this country. He was a champion on and off the baseball field.  After playing 22 seasons in Major League Baseball for the St. Louis Cardinals from 1941 to 1963, Musial was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1969. Over that time, he compiled a lifetime batting average of .331--how about that--with 3,630 hits, 475 home runs, and 1,951 RBIs, appearing in 23 World Series games and 24 All-Star games. He is one of only three players to have run over 6,000 bases in his career, right behind Hank Aaron and Willie Mays.  A sign of his great sportsmanship, Stan was never once ejected during his career spanning more than 3,000 games. Both in and out of a Cardinal uniform, Stan exemplifies the values of sportsmanship, discipline, hard work, grace, consistency, excellence, and humility. He is truly deserving of this Medal of Freedom.  Let me say a word about my colleague Claire McCaskill. No one has worked harder to impress upon the White House how important this Presidential Medal of Freedom is, not only to Stan Musial but Cardinal fans alike and those of us who think he is one of the greatest Americans. I salute Claire McCaskill's dogged determination to convince the White House the President is well served by awarding this man an honor for his life on the baseball diamond and off the diamond, and serving this country in so many ways.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
