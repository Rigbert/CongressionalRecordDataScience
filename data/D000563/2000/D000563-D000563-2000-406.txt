Senator Leahy has been a leader not just in terms of the Democratic side but in terms of the Senate, to make certain that although a handful of Members have come to the floor to consider a matter of this gravity, he has been here day in and day out.  My question to him goes to a point he has made so eloquently today in his statement and before. It is about the nature of this amendment. Is it true that this proposed constitutional amendment before us is longer in length, has more words in it, than the entire first 10 amendments to the Constitution known as the Bill of Rights?
