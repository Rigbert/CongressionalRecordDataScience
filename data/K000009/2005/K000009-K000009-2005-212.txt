Speaker, I join my colleagues in congratulating the people of Ukraine on their free and fair election that elevated Victor Yushchenko to the office of President. I have joined my colleagues in extending an invitation to President Yushchenko to address the Congress.  Just days before the elections, I traveled to Ukraine for the ninth time. On November 21, Ukraine held a run-off election for the office of President between Victor Yushchenko and Victor Yanukovych. International observers immediately found widespread fraud and declared the election invalid. Immediately following these events, supporters of the opposition party took to the streets to demand a recount or a new vote in what has been dubbed the ``Orange Revolution.''
