 President, I want to make sure everybody understands what has been objected to. The provision that was in the bill has been in there for 2 months. Everybody had a chance to read it. It came out of committee unanimously. No one objected to proceeding to it on the floor.  I just offered the minority an opportunity for a simple up-or-down vote to strike the provision they recently discovered, and they have objected to it.  Senator Cornyn, Senator Grassley, and a number of others of you have worked very hard on this extremely important legislation. I brought it to the floor the other day, open for amendment, but we have not been able to offer any amendments because the minority doesn't want to have an open amendment process and is insisting on trying to kill this important bill because of a provision they claim somehow they missed. After its being in there for 2 months, they now suddenly find it offensive.  So where we are is we are still on the bill, and we are going to pass this bill, I assure you. I want to assure Senators Cornyn, Grassley, and all the people out in America who have been clamoring for this bill--and I might ask Senator Cornyn, how many groups are there that are supporting this measure?
