Speaker, I rise today with my colleague, the gentleman from Hawaii [Mr. Abercrombie], in reintroducing the Veterans' Cemetery Protection Act. Whenever a young man or woman decides to enter the military, they do so voluntarily in order to protect our country and guard against the uncertainties of the world. Sometimes they make the ultimate sacrifice. Over 1 million Americans have died fighting in our country's wars. That is why it sickens me when I hear of hooligans desecrating our national cemeteries.  In 1996, Riverside National Cemetery, the second largest cemetery in this country, next only to Arlington, fell prey to vandals who stole bronze markers from 128 graves. On April 19, vandals spray-painted racist and profane words on the cemetery walls of the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Hawaii. Enough is enough. The Veterans' Cemetery Protection Act would stiffen criminal penalties for theft and malicious vandalism at national cemeteries. I wish to thank the gentleman from Arizona [Mr. Stump] of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, the gentleman from California [Mr. Bono], the gentleman from California [Mr. Royce], and many others who have come forward to support this bill.  Being so close to Memorial Day, I invite my colleagues to become original cosponsors of this measure as a small gift to our Nation's veterans.                          ____________________
