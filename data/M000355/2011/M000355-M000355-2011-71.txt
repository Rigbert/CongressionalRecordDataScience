 President, it is certainly the case the majority leader can always have the last word, but I would say, with all due respect to my friend, he just made another campaign speech.  I think what the American people would like to see us do is actually pass something together that will become law--pass something together that will become law. That is how to get an accomplishment out of the U.S. Constitution. That is how to send something to the President.  We know how to work together to make things happen. We have done that in the past. All I am suggesting is that the exercise we are going to have later today has nothing to do with making law and making a difference. It is about making a point. We both know how to do that. We both know how to make points and make laws. What we are doing later today is not about making laws.  I am told by staff I need to move to proceed to S. 1786.
