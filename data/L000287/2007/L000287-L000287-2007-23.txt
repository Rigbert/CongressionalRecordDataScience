Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of greater energy efficiency. I read an article recently about the residents of Gudda, a small village in India, who are harnessing the Sun's power to bring light into their homes when the Sun sets. This tiny village has nothing; no power lines to bring electricity, no real roads for vehicles to bring food and supplies, water is scarce, and yet this village has easily succeeded to make use of alternative energy. Gudda has shown that being green is easy and can be done by anyone!  The time has come for America to lead the world in the fight against climate change and in protecting our environment. We must not delay as we move toward energy independence.  Alternative energy means new jobs for Americans, lower energy costs and more technology that we can export to other countries. This legislation does more than fight global warming and protect our environment, it will strengthen our economy and make the United States the leader in providing alternative energy.  Let's show the world that the United States cares about global warming and is willing to do something about it. Let's show the world that our talent and technology will improve lives around the world. Let's vote for this bill today.
