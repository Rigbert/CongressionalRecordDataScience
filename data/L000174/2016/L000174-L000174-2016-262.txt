President, I had planned to be in the Senate Judiciary Committee today, debating and pushing for passage of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, or CARA. Unfortunately, the markup was postponed. I wish it had not been. So I hope next week we can make progress on this important bill. We have a need for this legislation, and we also need the money for it. Senator Shaheen has an emergency supplemental appropriations bill. These are actually both urgent matters.  States such as mine, Vermont, and our neighboring State of New Hampshire have been deeply affected by this wave of addiction. The media has covered this very personal and ravaging epidemic as never before. We have seen a transformation in how we talk about this issue and the need for solutions. It used to be that if you had a drug problem, they would bring in the police to straighten it out. We have removed the stigma of drug addiction, but we need more than talk. I have visited many of these communities. They are devastated by this epidemic and need resources for prevention and treatment. It is time for Congress to act.  For years I have been convening field hearings and sitting at kitchen tables, listening to Vermonters discuss innovative approaches to confront drug abuse and related crimes. I have also sat at kitchen tables and listened to tragic stories about a member of the family who had been hit with opioid addiction. What I have heard in the meetings I have had with the police, doctors, family members, faith community, and educators is that we cannot arrest or jail our way out of this problem. We have lost the war on drugs--if we were ever winning it--because we relied primarily on unnecessarily harsh sentencing laws.  I spent 8 years in law enforcement, and I know that law enforcement practices will always play an important role. That is why I have worked to secure funding for State-led, anti-heroin task forces. But if we want to find lasting solutions to these problems, we have to identify and support effectiveprevention, treatment, and recovery programs. CARA does just that. This legislation would support innovative, evidence-based solutions--best practices that are already showing great progress in States like mine.  We need to do all we can to prevent and treat the abuse of prescription opioids. I have pushed for years to have the FDA promote safer alternatives to powerful prescription pain killers and to remove from the market the older, less safe drugs. The FDA's announcement to expand access to abuse-deterrent formulations of these powerful drugs is a step in the right direction in response to my concerns, but the FDA can and must do more.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the April 28, 2014, Leahy-Blumenthal letter to the FDA Commissioner.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                                   Washington, DC, April 28, 2014.     Hon. Margaret A. Hamburg,     Commissioner, Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring,          MD.       Dear Commissioner Hamburg: We are writing to urge the      expedited review of New Drug Applications for abuse-deterrent      formulations of single-entity hydrocodone products. Zohydro      ER was the first pure hydrocodone product to receive FDA      market approval. The drug was approved despite lacking any      abuse-deterrent properties and over strong objections from      the FDA's own independent advisory committee. We share the      concerns of the many governors and state attorneys general      who believe this powerful drug is all but certain to      exacerbate our nation's addiction to opioid analgesics, which      results in tens of thousands of overdose deaths each year.       Given their potency and ease of abuse, we have little doubt      that pure opioid products may lead more Americans to      addiction, some even to heroin. The FDA has already      recognized the heightened risks of overdose and death with      Zohydro ER, even at recommended doses. Drug developers      continue to seek regulatory approval for other easy to abuse      opioids, such as Moxduo IR. To the extent that pure opioid      products fill a necessary niche in responsible pain      management practices, the FDA must now take all available      measures to ensure that patients are soon provided safer      alternatives. This process begins by prioritizing review of      abuse-deterrent formulations. Such formulations are much more      difficult to crush or dissolve, two preferred methods of      abuse.       As safer, abuse-deterrent opioids are approved, the FDA      should act swiftly to remove any older, less safe versions.      In the past, it has taken up to three years for the FDA to      ban products that lack abuse-deterrent properties when a      safer equivalent exists. Americans should not have to wait      this long with Zohydro ER.       We also request that the FDA brief our staff on your plans      to monitor the use of Zohydro ER, including what metrics will      be used to potentially reevaluate its status as an approved      drug if widespread problems develop. We also ask that you      share your planned efforts to curb prescription drug abuse      generally, including the development and approval of      effective non-opioid painkillers that may finally break the      cycle of opioid addiction. Each year, the opioid epidemic      seeps into more communities and takes more lives. We are      eager to learn how we can assist the FDA to finally get ahead      of this scourge.       Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. We look      forward to hearing from you.           Sincerely,     Richard Blumenthal,       U.S. Senator.     Patrick J. Leahy,       U.S. Senator.
