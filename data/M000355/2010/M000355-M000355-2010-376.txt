 President, this morning, we received the administration's budget for the next fiscal year. While there are plenty of issues raised by this budget, the fundamentals are clear: this budget is more of the same--more spending, more taxes and more debt.  I think everyone can agree that last year's budget spent too much. With the trillion-dollar stimulus bill and massive increases in optional spending, the administration and Democrats in Congress simply spent too much and took us into record territory. But the administration assured us that it was an anomaly--that we just needed to get through the year and then we would get serious about our spending in 2010. Fiscal hawks on the other side of the aisle told us the same thing every time we raised the issue.  But now they have produced yet another massive budget filled with even more spending than last year's record totals.
