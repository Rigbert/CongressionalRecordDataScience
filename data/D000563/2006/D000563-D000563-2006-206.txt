President, I would like the Senator from West Virginia to clarify one point, if he might. We have two bodies of information. One is part of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence report--unclassified, public knowledge. We have another body of information which is classified. I would like to ask the Senator from West Virginia strictly about the first.
