It wasn't in manufacturing, as you probably know, when it was originally adopted because it was not perceived that the oil companies were in manufacturing as the bill contemplated to be.  Then you thought the oil companies weren't doing well enough, and so you wanted to add that provision and you added it under Republican leadership.

And very frankly, I don't think the American public thinks that the oil companies will go out of business if we don't give them this tax incentive.
