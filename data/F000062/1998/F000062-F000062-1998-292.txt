 President, this is a rush to judgment on one of the most fundamental issues of the 20th century. Mr. President, this is not renaming National Airport Ronald Reagan Airport.  Mr. President, I submit respectfully to the distinguished Senators on the other side of the aisle that this is a major debate that has scientific implications, moral implications and ethical implications. It is a debate, also, that involves one of the most difficult areas of science involving human genetics, with a vocabulary and a lexicon that is not understood by the great bulk of the American people and certainly not by many of us in the U.S. Senate.  Both the Bond-Frist bill and the Feinstein-Kennedy bill dealing with the subject of human cloning were introduced less than 48 hours ago--48 hours. No hearings have been held on either bill, no floor debate has been held on either bill. The medical community, the research community, patients with currently incurable diseases whose cure we might affect by both of these bills have barely read the bills, much less analyzed them.  As a matter of fact, the letters are now beginning to pour in. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a 9-page statement of the Biotechnology Industry Organization regarding legislation introduced to ban human cloning and a letter to Senator Mack from the American Association for Cancer Research.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:    Statement of the Biotechnology Industry Organization Regarding               Legislation Introduced To Ban Human Cloning       The Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO) believes that      it is both unsafe and unethical to even attempt to clone a      human being. BIO strongly supported the review of this issue      by the National Bioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC) and the      moratorium on cloning imposed by President Clinton. We      believe that the FDA has clear authority and jurisdiction and      will, as they have stated, prohibit any attempt to clone a      human being.       BIO is concerned about the scope and impact of legislation      introduced to make it a crime with a ten year prison sentence      to conduct biomedical research which may or may not have any      relevance to the cloning of a human being. We are very      concerned about the rushed process to pass legislation on      this complex subject and the possibilities for unintended      consequences. The scientific and legal issues with respect to      any legislation regarding biomedical research are exceedingly      technical, and a hastily drafted bill could advertently and      inadvertently damage biomedical research on deadly and      disabling diseases.       The Senate needs to adhere to the standard for doctors,      ``first, do no harm.'' Biomedical research into deadly and      disabling diseases is far too important to rush to enact      legislation which would unequivocally undermine promising      research and therapies. The Senate should be extremely      cautious before it starts sending scientists to jail when the      purpose of their research meets the highest moral and ethical      standards and holds such promise for relieving human      suffering.           analysis of pending bills and the science at risk       Several bills have been introduced in the Senate regarding      human cloning. They vary widely in focus and precision. The      three principal bills are S. 368, S. 1599, and S. 1602 and we      have analyzed each of them here.       The first bill introduced by Senator Bond last year, S.      368, is one of the better drafted bills introduced in either      body. It uses reasonably accurate terms to describe the      applicable science and limits Federal funding for the cloning      of a human being.       The new bill introduced by Senator Bond, S. 1599, would      impose a ten year prison sentence for any individual for the      act of ``producing an embryo (including a preimplantation      embryo)'' through the use of a specified technology,      ``somatic cell nuclear transfer,'' even if the production of      such an embryo is for purposes unrelated to the cloning of a      human being and even if the embryo does not contain nuclear      DNA which is identical to that of an existing or previously      existing human being (cloning). The bill goes beyond the      issue of cloning to make it a crime to use somatic cell      nuclear transfer of a nucleus derived from normal sexual      union of an egg and sperm, which is obviously not cloning. It      would also make it a crime to conduct some research seeking      to generate stem cells to treat a wide range of deadly and      disabling diseases, treatments which have nothing whatever to      do with human cloning.\1\---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \1\ An identical bill has been introduced by Senator Lott as      S. 1601 and this may be the bill which is called up for the      Senate debate.---------------------------------------------------------------------------       The third bill, introduced by Senator Feinstein, S. 1602,      would impose heavy civil fines for any entity that would      ``implant or attempt to implant the product of somatic cell      nuclear transfer into a woman's uterus . . .'' This sharply      focuses the bill on an attempt to clone a human being and      would not imperil biomedical research.                 impact of bills on stem cell research       The current bill introduced by Senator Bond would, because      it goes well beyond the issue of human cloning, imperil      promising biomedical research, including research to generate      stem cells. Instead of focusing on cloning, it makes it a      crime to zygote or embryo through the use of a new      technology, somatic cell nuclear transfer, even if the use of      this technology is essential for the generation of stem cells      to treat disease and where there is no intention or attempts      through use of this technology to clone a human being.      Basically the current bill would make it a crime to conduct      research if it could possibly be related to the cloning of a      human being even if it is not, in fact, conducted for that      purpose.       This approach in S. 1599 goes beyond the issue of human      cloning and would outlaw some research to create stem cells,      including stem cells for the following types of treatments:      cardiac muscle cells to treat heart attack victims and      degenerative heart disease; skin cells to treat burn victims;      spinal cord neuron cells for treatment of spinal cord trauma      and paralysis; neural cells for treating those suffering from      neurodegenerative diseases; pancreas cells to treat diabetes;      blood cells to treat cancer anemia, and immunodeficiencies;      neural cells to treat Parkinson's, Huntington's and      Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS); cells for use in genetic      therapy to treat 5,000 genetic diseases, including Cystic      Fibrosis, Tay-Sachs Disease, schizophrenia, depression,      and other diseases; blood vessel endothelial cells for      treating atherosclerosis; liver cells for liver diseases      including hepatitis and cirrhosis; cartilage cells for      treating of osteoarthritis; bone cells for treatment of      osteoporosis; myoblast cells for the treatment of Muscular      Dystrophy; respiratory epithelial cells for the treatment      of Cystic Fibrosis and lung cancer; adrenal cortex cells      for the treatment of Addison's disease; retinal pigment      epithelial cells for age-related macular degeneration;      modified cells for treatment of various genetic diseases;      and other cells for use in the diagnosis, treatment and      prevention of other deadly or disabling diseases or other      medical conditions.       To be precise, the current bill introduced by Senator Bond,      S. 1599, would make it a crime to generate stem cells, for      the above uses, where somatic cell nuclear transfer      technology is used. It would not ban stem cell research where      the stem cell is generated without the use of somatic cell      nuclear transfer. It is not possible to say how much of this      promising research will or might involve the use of somatic      cell nuclear transfer. As described below, the bill would      clearly ban the generation of any stem cells     ``customized'' to an individual where somatic cell nuclear      transfer must be used.       This stem cell technology is exciting and potentially      revolutionary. Scientists are developing a new approach for      treating human diseases that doesn't depend on drugs like      antibiotics, but on living cells that can differentiate into      blood, skin, heart, or brain cells and can potentially treat      various cancers, spinal cord injuries, and heart disease. For      example, this stem cell research has the potential to develop      and improve cancer treatments by gaining a more complete      understanding of cell division and growth and the process of      metastasis. This could also lead to a variety of cancer      treatment advances.       The type of cells that make up most of the human body are      differentiated, meaning that they have already achieved some      sort of specialized function such as blood, skin, heart or      brain cells. The precursor cells that led to differentiated      cells come from an embryo. The cells are called stem cells      because functions stem from them like the growth of a plant.      Stem cells have the capacity for self-renewal, meaning that      they can reproduce more of themselves, and differentiation,      meaning that they can specialize into a variety of cell types      with different functions. In the last decade, scientists      studying mice and other laboratory animals have discovered      new powerful approaches involving cultured stem cells.      Studies of these cells obtained from a mouse's stem cells      show they are capable of differentiating, in vitro or in vivo      into a wide variety of specialized cell types. Stem cells      have been derived by culturing cells of non-human primates.      Promising efforts to obtain human stem cells have also      recently been reported.       Stem cell research has been hailed as the ``[most]      tantalizing of all'' research in this field, because adults      do not have many stem cells. Most adult cells are fully      differentiated into their proper functions. When      differentiated cells are damaged, such as damage to cardiac      muscle from a heart attack, the adult cells do not have the      ability to regenerate. If stem cells could be derived from      human sources and induced to differentiate in vitro, they      could potentially be used for transplantation and tissue      repair.       Using heart attacks as an example, we might be able to      replace damaged cardiac cells, with healthy stem cells, that      could differentiate into cardiac muscle. Research using these      stem cells could lead to the development of ``universal donor      cells,'' and could be an invaluable benefit to patients. Stem      cell therapy could also make it possible to store tissue      reserves that would give health care providers a new and      virtually endless supply of the cells listed above. The use      of stem cells to create these therapies would lead to great      medical advances. We have to be sure that this legislation      concerning human cloning would not in any way obstruct this      vital research.             Bond Bill Application to Non-Identical Nucleus       The purpose of a bill to ban human cloning is supposedly to      ban the cloning of an individual and the essence of this is      the duplication of the DNA of one individual in another. The      term ``somatic cell,'' however, is not limited in the current      Bond bill to somatic cells with DNA which is the same as that      of an existing or previously existing human being. If it is      not limited to cases where the DNA is identical, human      cloning is--by definition--not involved.       The current Bond bill goes beyond cloning because it does      not define the term ``somatic cell'' or limit to cases where      the DNA is identical. It only defines the term ``somatic cell      nuclear transfer,'' but it does not define the term ``somatic      cell.'' We need a brief glossary of terms to define what      constitutes a ``somatic cell.''       ``Zygote'' means a single celled egg with two sets (a      diploid set) of chromosomes as normally derived by      fertilization;       ``Egg'' and ``oocyte'' mean the female gamete;       ``Gamete'' means a mature male or female reproductive cell      with one set (a haploid) set of chromosomes;       ``Sperm'' means the male gamete;       ``Somatic cell'' means a cell of the body, other than a      cell that is a gamete, having two sets (a diploid set) of      chromosomes.       So a ``somatic cell'' is any cell of the body other than a      gamete, and it includes a fertilized egg. This means that the      current Bond bill would make it a crime to use somatic cell      nuclear transfer even in cases where the somatic cell      contains a nucleus derived from sexual reproduction, which is      obviously not cloning. This means that even though the      nucleus is not a clone, the current Bond bill makes it a      Federal crime to create it. This means that the current Bond      bill goes beyond the issue of cloning.       Because of this coverage of all ``somatic cells'' the      current Bond bill would make it a crime for doctors to use a      currently effective treatment for mitochondrial disease.      In this treatment women who have the disease have an      extreme and tragic form of infertility. The disease is a      disease of the mitochondria, which is an essential element      of any egg. The treatment for this disease involves the      use of a fertilized nucleus which is transferred through      the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer to an egg from      which the nucleus has been removed. The new egg is a      fresh, undiseased egg. The current Bond bill would make a      crime to provide this treatment even though the nucleus      which is transferred is the product of fertilization, no      cloning.                         customized stem cells       If the current Bond bill was limited to sometic cells with      nuclear DNA identical to that of an existing or previously      existing human being, i.e., to a cloned nucleus, it would      make it a Federal crime to conduct one especially promising      type of stem cell research, into generating ``customized''      stem cells.       A researcher or doctor might want to create a human zygote      with DNA identical to that of an existing or previously      existing person through the use of somatic cell nuclear      transfer, the act prohibited in the bill, in order to create      a customized stem cell line to treat the individual from whom      the DNA was extracted. By using the same DNA, the stem cell      therapy would more likely to compatible with, and not be      rejected by, the person for whom the therapy is created. By      starting with the patient's own nuclear DNA, the therapy is,      in effect, custom made for that person. It is like taking the      patients blood prior to surgery so that it can be infused      into the patient during surgery (avoiding the possibility of      contamination by the use of blood of another person).       Because the current Bond bill makes it a crime to use the      technology--somatic cell nuclear transfer--it would make it a      crime to develop a therapy with the equivalent of the      patient's personal monogram on it a customized treatment      based on their own nuclear DNA.       Because the bill introduced by Senator Feinstein requires      the implantation of an embryo, it does not curtail stem cell      research, and the bill provides that the transfer nucleus      must be that of an ``existing or previously existing human      child or adult,'' precisely the limitation not present in the      current Bond bill. None of the issues we have raised      regarding the current Bond bill apply to the Feinstein bill,      which is narrowly focuses on the act of cloning, or      attempting to clone an individual.                     Protecting biomedical research       The current Bond bill and the Feinstein bill both contain      clauses for the protection of biomedical research. There is a      critical difference between them.       At the press conference announcing introduction of his bill      Senator Bond distributed a document entitled ``Current      Research Untouched by the Bond/Frist/Gregg Legislation.'' The      title of this document was followed by a list of such      research, including ``In Vitro Fertilization,'' ``Stem Cell      Research,'' ``Gene Therapy,'' ``Cloning of Cells, Tissues,      Animals and Plants,'' ``Cancer,'' ``Diabetes,'' ``Birth      Defects,'' ``Arthritis,'' ``Organ Failure,'' ``Genetic      Disease,'' ``Severe Skin Burns,'' ``Multiple Sclerosis,''      ``Muscular Dystrophy,'' ``Spinal Cord Injuries,''      ``Alzheimer's Disease,'' ``Parkinson's Disease, and ``Lou      Gehrig's Disease''. Unfortunately, the title is followed by a      critical qualification, an asterisk. The asterisk      qualification states, ``The current Bond bill would not      prohibit any of this research, even embryo research, as long      as it did not involve the use of a very specific technique      (somatic cell nuclear transfer) to create a live cloned human      embryo.''       In the ways described above this asterisk qualification      acknowledges that the bill would, in fact, make it a crime to      conduct some types of stem cell research and other research.      Given the importance of the asterisk, the document's title      the list of supposedly protected research could be considered      misleading. The document should more accurately have been      entitled ``Only Some Research Regarding the Following      Diseases is Outlawed.''       The current Bond bill contains a Section 5 entitled      ``Unrestricted Scientific Research.'' This section provides      that ``Nothing in this Act (or an amendment made by this Act      shall be construed to restrict areas of scientific research      that are not specifically prohibited by this Act (or      amendments).'' This provision is circular. It states that the      bill does what it does and does not do what it does not do.      The provision does nothing to modify the prohibitions on      research and does nothing to protect ``scientific research.''       In contrast the Feinstein bill includes a provision      regarding ``Protected Research and Practices'' which provides      that ``Nothing in this section shall be construed to restrict      areas of biomedical and agriculture research or practices not      expressly prohibited in this section, including research or      practices that involve the use of--(1) somatic cell nuclear      transfer or other cloning technologies to clone molecules,      DNA, cells, and tissues; (2) mitochondrial, cytoplasmic or      gene therapy; or (3) somatic cell nuclear transfer techniques      to create nonhuman animals.'' This is a ``savings'' clause      with meaning and content. Its reference to the cloning of      ``cells'' and to ``mitrochondrial'' therapy are laudatory and      meaningful.          NBAC Recommendation and Clinton Administration Bill       The National Bioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC) cautioned      that poorly crafted legislation to ban human cloning may put      at risk biomedical research on the following types of      diseases and conditions: ``Regeneration and repair of      diseased or damaged human tissues and organs'' (NBAC report      at 29); ``assisted reproduction'' (NBAC report at 29);      ``leukemia, liver failure, heart and kidney disease'' (NBAC      report at 30); and ``bone marrow stem cells, liver cells, or      pancreatic beta-cells (which product insulin) for      transplantation'' (NBAC report at 30). The Clinton      Administration proposed law, like the Feinstein bill, avoids      the peril identified by     NBAC and focuses only on the issue of human cloning and does      not imperil biomedical research.                         sunset and preemption       NBAC proposed that any law include both sunset review and      preemption provisions.       Regarding a sunset review provision, NBAC stated in its      report: ``It is notoriously difficult to draft legislation at      any particular moment that can serve to both exploit and      govern the rapid and unpredictable advances of science. Some      mechanism, therefore, such as a sunset provision, is      absolutely needed to ensure an opportunity to re-examine any      judgment made today about the implications of somatic cell      nuclear transfer cloning of human beings. As scientific      information accumulates and public discussion continues, a      new judgment may develop and we, as a society, need to retain      the flexibility to adjust our course in this manner. A sunset      provision . . . ensures that the question of cloning will be      revisited by the legislature in the future, when scientific      and medical questions have been clarified, possible uses have      been identified, and public discussion of the deeper moral      concerns about this practice have matured.'' NBAC report at      101.       President Clinton has proposed a five year sunset in his      bill. The Feinstein bill includes a ten year sunset and the      current Bond bill includes no sunset review.       BIO supports inclusion of a sunset review provision, but      the most important issue is whether the terms of the      prohibition in any law focuses only on the issue of human      cloning. A sunset review provision will not undo the damaged      which a poorly crafted, over broad law would do to biomedical      research prior to the sunset date.       The Feinstein bill, but not the current Bond bill, includes      a clause which preempts inconsistent state laws. NBAC      strongly supported a preemption of state laws: ``The      advantage to federal legislation--as opposed to state-by-     state laws--lies primarily in its comprehensive coverage and      clarity. . . . Besides ensuring interstate uniformity, a      federal law would relieve the need to rely on the cooperation      of diverse medical and scientific societies, or the actions      of diverse IRBs, to achieve the policy objective. As an      additional benefit, federal legislation could displace the      varied state legislative efforts now ongoing, some of which      suffer from ambiguous drafting that could inadvertently      prohibit the important cellular and molecular cloning      research described . . . in this report.'' NBAC report at      100.       Numerous bills introduced in state legislatures, some of      which are very poorly crafted and over broad.       BIO supports inclusion of a preemption clause. Again, the      key issue is whether the prohibition in any law focuses only      on the issue of human cloning and does not imperil biomedical      research. A poorly drafted, over broad Federal law which      preempts state laws might do even more damage.                        nbac role and commission       NBAC performed a public service with its quick and      thoughtful analysis of the human cloning issue. The current      Bond bill would set up an entirely new body to review the      human cloning issue rather than rerefer the issue back to      NBAC for further review. NBAC is well qualified and      positioned to perform this function and it may be wasteful      and expensive to establish another body to perform this      ongoing review. The Feinstein bill calls on NBAC to conduct      the reviews.                                  ____                                          American Association for                                        Cancer Research, Inc.,                               Philadelphia, PA, February 4, 1998.     Hon. Connie Mack,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Mack: Medical research, conducted in the      United States over the last 20 years, has opened up      tremendous opportunities to make progress against many      devastating diseases. The scientific community does not      desire to make human beings, or modify or genetically mark      any portion of our population. However, to deny the      application of molecular biology, made possible through the      use of cloning technologies, to patients who could be      benefited would be a great injustice.       A litany of beneficial applications of cloning technology      was enumerated in this weeks TIME Magazine. Several of these      applications are at the core of cutting-edge cancer research,      and there are many more potential benefits that are unknown      at this time. These applications, as well as any future      progress, would be eliminated by broad legislation setting      back progress and potential in our conquest to develop      effective approaches to the prevention, detection, and      treatment of cancer.       The American Association for Cancer Research (AACR), with      over 14,000 members, is the largest professional organization      of basic and clinical cancer researchers in the world.      Founded in 1907, its mission is to prevent, treat, and cure      cancer through research, scientific programs, and education.      To accomplish these important goals it is essential that      scientists vigorously pursue all promising lines of      investigations against cancer.       The AACR feels strongly that an ethical and just compromise      can be reached that will protect the public and the      scientific community from the irresponsible application of      cloning technology while permitting meaningful and ethical      research to move forward. The medical and cancer research      community feels that the present rush to enact legislation      without proper consideration or deliberation is a serious      mistake, and the unfortunate result would be irresponsible      legislation.       As scientists we clearly see the tremendous advantages of      cloning technology as well as its potential problems, which      we, also, have reason to fear if it is applied in an      unreasonable manner.       The AACR, therefore, appeals to all Members of Congress to      establish and honor a moratorium of at least 45 days on      enacting any legislation until definitions and implications      of legislation can be determined in a more reasonable and      thoughtful manner, and in an open and public process. This      would be a service to humanity, science, and millions of      individuals who are now suffering, or will suffer in the      future, from catastrophic and crippling diseases such as      cancer. We appeal to all members of Congress to give this      important moral and scientific issue very careful      consideration and deliberation. Clearly a rush to judgment on      this complex issue could be a major setback for cancer and      medical research.           Sincerely,                                                 Donald S. Coffey,                                                        President.
