 President, I rise today to pay tribute to Bill Greely on the occasion of his retirement. My good friend Bill served as assistant manager and general manager of the Keeneland Association for 14 years, and is now stepping down from his successful 13-year post as the Association's president.  Bill is a true horseman. He grew up in the Keeneland community, and began spending time at the horse track when he was a small child. Bill began taking on responsibilities at the horse track when he was just seven years old, and has worked in almost every aspect of horse racing in tracks around the country--but it is clear that Bill has always been partial to Keeneland. In 1972, after years of moving around the country from track to track, he finally got his chance to return to his hometown, working at the track he loved.  Bill's long-time affiliation with Keeneland and love of horse racing made him an ideal candidate to manage the track and eventually become president. Bill's knowledge of the horse industry prepared him for his leadership role at Keeneland, and enabled him to make Keeneland one of the nation's premiere horse tracks. During his time at Keeneland, Bill updated the track's betting options, improved the grandstands and grounds, and brought Keeneland to a level of growth that will be hard to exceed or even match.  Keeneland would not be what it is today without Bill's leadership and guidance over the last 27 years--and Bill would not be where he is today without the love and support of his family. His wife Norma, and their children Sean, Kevin and Kara, endured numerous moves before they finally settled down in Lexington, and they have helped sustain Bill during his demanding career at Keeneland. A third generation horseman, Bill has seen first-hand what it takes to simultaneously work the track and raise a family--and he has happy, successful children to prove he made it work.  Thank you, Bill, for putting so much of yourself into Keeneland to make it a better place for others. Your hard work and successes have become your legacy, and will continue to impact the entire horse industry for years to come. My colleagues join me in congratulating you on a job well done, and wish you all the best as you enter this new stage in life.                          ____________________
