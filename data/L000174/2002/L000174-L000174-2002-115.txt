President, I thank the distinguished majority leader for moving to the Department of Justice Authorization Act. This is the first one in 21 years. I note for my friend from South Dakota and my friend from Nevada, this passed the House of Representatives 400 to 4. The conferees, Republicans and Democrats, endorsed it unanimously. It should be able to pass, I hope, easily here.  I spoke at some length yesterday about all the items that law enforcement has asked for in this bill.  I know the distinguished Senator from Louisiana is waiting to speak. I will take only a few seconds. I wish to emphasize again, this is legislation that passed 400 to 4 in the other body. It has been endorsed across the political spectrum--law enforcement, antiterrorist groups, schools, those small towns in rural America facing drug problems. They are all looking for the adoption of this conference report.  The high-tech industry is looking for the passage of the Madrid Protocol which is in the bill.  There are 20 new judge positions. Actually, we were trying to get these authorized during the last 6 years ofPresident Clinton's term, and they were blocked. Now with President Bush in office, I put the same 20 in to show bipartisanship. They are back in there and should be passed. President Bush can nominate the people for these positions. I cannot believe either side would hold us up.  I hope we will have a consent agreement for a limited amount of debate at some point and then go to a vote.
