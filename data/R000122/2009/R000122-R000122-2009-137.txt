President, my amendment would focus on the issue I think we are all concerned about, and it would be a counterpoint to Senator Vitter's amendment, and that would be the administration of the Troubled Asset Relieve Program. My amendment would create a reserve fund, which would focus the remaining resources in the TARP fund on supporting small businesses, saving homeowners from foreclosure, helping the bond market, and making credit more widely available. It would also strengthen the oversight entities, the Special Inspector General, the Congressional Oversight Panel, and the Government Accountability Office.  Senator Vitter's amendment purports to take back the money by striking certain functions, such as function 370. But that function also has the funding for the FHA, the Rural Housing Program, and the Small Business Administration. In effect, we will not be taking away the TARP money, we will be challenging these other programs to find funds.  I urge adoption of my amendment and the rejection of Senator Vitter's amendment.
