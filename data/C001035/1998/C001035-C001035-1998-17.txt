I am concerned about the burden that the CRA imposes on our small community banks. It is my understanding, however, based on the representations of the chairman and a letter from the administration, that if this amendment is adopted, it will lead to the veto of this legislation, which I strongly support.  So I find myself in a real quandary. I support the amendment of the Senator from Alabama, yet I strongly support the underlying bill and do not want to jeopardize it being signed into law.  Could the distinguished chairman give me assurances that he is willing to work with me, with the Senator from Alabama, and others who are concerned about easing this burden on our small banks?  Mr. D'AMATO. I not only give that assurance to you, but to all of my colleagues in the Senate and the House. I think we can do a better job ensuring that small community banks have the ability to compete. We will address some of the requirements that are placed upon them that preclude them from using chapter S corporations in the bill Senator Allard has introduced. And while we are at it, we will review some of the regulatory requirements for reporting as required by CRA and we will look for ways to diminish the burdens these requirements place on banks that have exemplary CRA records.  That would be the absolute priority of this Senator, starting now. We will begin with holding hearings, and from the information we gather, we will craft and seek the support of legislation. Certainly I think next year we will be able to come forth and pass, in both Houses, and get signed into law, the kind of relief that does not jeopardize the legitimate use of CRA but, by the same token, does not compromise those institutions that are doing a good job.  I believe my colleagues on the Democratic side would join with us in that effort, but not here, not now, without study and careful craftsmanship.  Again, I understand the need to make these reforms.
