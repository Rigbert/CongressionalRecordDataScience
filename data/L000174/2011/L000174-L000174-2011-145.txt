President, one of the great treasures of Vermont is Howard Frank Mosher. Mr. Mosher is a writer who knows and understands Vermont, and in books like ``Where The Rivers Flow North,'' he makes any Vermonter know they are home.  A recent article in The Burlington Free Press by Sally Pollak speaks to the man he is, and I would like to take this opportunity to share this with the Senate.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record, the article to which I referred.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                    [From the Burlington Free Press]                    All Roads Lead to Kingdom County                           (By Sally Pollak)       (Vermont author Howard Frank Mosher has lived in the      Northeast Kingdom since 1964 and the region is character-like      in his books. Free Press Staff Writer Sally Pollak and Free      Press photographer Glenn Russell spent a day traveling the      roads in the north country with Mosher, listening to his      stories and discovering his sense of place.)       Irasburg--The tan Nissan rolling down the dirt road in      Brownington came to a slow stop, and the man behind the wheel      surveyed the shallows and grooves of mud in front of him. The      place he wanted to go was on the far side of the mud pit, and      up a small hill that curved out of sight.       Two men with trucks were on the other side of the mud      ravine. The Nissan driver left his car to approach the men. I      was in the     back seat of the Nissan. Glenn Russell, a Free Press      photographer, had the front seat.       Through the window, we watched the three locals talk mud,      and discussed if we'd try to forge the muddy road if we were      driving. No way, I said.       Glenn said he might if he were Howard Frank Mosher, our      tour guide that day. Mosher knows the people and trucks      around here; he can always get a tow.       Mosher, meanwhile, had made another arrangement.       If he couldn't get to the other side of the mud, where      Margery Moore, 91, his longtime friend lives, then Moore      would come to him. One of the men Mosher had been talking to      was her son, Michael; he'd pick up his mother in his truck      and drive her through the mud to Mosher.       While we waited for Moore to arrive, Mosher, 68, told us      stories. Delightful and engaging tales--warm and humorous,      with a north country bite. The kind of stories you might read      in his Kingdom County novels.       And now here we were, deep in the Northeast Kingdom on      Moore Lane in Brownington, waiting to meet a woman of Mohawk      ancestry, whom Mosher got to know 47 years ago, his first      year in the Kingdom.       She showed up in a big blue rig to say hello. Her son      lifted her from his truck and helped her into a wheelchair.      Moore greeted Mosher with a hug.       He gave her a copy of his most recent novel, ``Walking to      Gatlinburg.'' After some talking, we headed back to the      Nissan.       Michael Moore called to us as we walked to the car: ``Don't      let Howard lead you astray out here!''       To read Mosher is to be led, if not astray, then away--to a      place that is, at once, invented and familiar, enchanted and      real, made-up and true.       The truth can be found in Mosher's evocation of the place      he calls Kingdom County, a rugged, rural border landscape      where people scratch out hardscrabble livings, go without      spring, learn to read the woods and rivers, build strong      allegiances and cast a wary eye on newcomers. Mosher's county      and the characters who inhabit it are informed by and created      from the landscape and people around him: He uses for his      material a place that is distinct and fascinating, yet one      that's been changing--maybe merging with outer and other      regions--even as Mosher put pen to paper: making it last.       In Mosher's 1999 novel, ``The Fall of the Year,'' the      book's central figure, Father George Lecoeur, is writing ``A      Short History of Kingdom Common.'' Mosher, too, is the author      of a history of the Kingdom--his history is contained in the      thousands of pages that make up his 11 books.       The words Mosher uses to describe ``A Short History,'' can      be applied to his own work. They are narrated by Frank      Bennett, Father George's adopted son, as Frank settles down      to read the history: ``I could hear Father George's voice in      my head, hear its slightly speculative, wry resonance. And at      that moment, whatever else I still did not understand about      the events of the past summer, I realized that long after the      passing of the hill farms and the big woods and Kingdom      Common as we had known it, these stories would remain: a      golden legacy, to me and to the village, from Father      George.''                            A special place       Mosher and his wife, Phillis, a retired teacher and school      counselor, have lived in the Northeast Kingdom since 1964. It      is where they raised their two children, Jake and Annie.      Advertisement I was like a kid in the backseat on a recent      drive to the hot spots of Mosher's adopted home turf.       The kid thing involved a surprise and recurring attack of      carsickness: no fun! On the upside, it meant that as a      passenger of Mosher's, even a newcomer from Burlington, I was      given a free pass to the Kingdom, embraced by the old timers      on Moore Lane.       Like a kid who (still) believes in the grownups up front, I      saw the world through the eyes and observations of the      driver--which thankfully transcended my own hazy vision. As      we pulled out of the driveway of his Irasburg home, not far      from the town green, Mosher enticed us. First stop, he said,      was a place he'd had an ``epiphany.''       What and where it was, we'd find out when we arrived at the      scene: Orleans' sleepy main street. This is going to be a fun      trip, I thought. Anyone who can have an epiphany in downtown      Orleans, is the right person to ride with.       The street was deserted the day Mosher steered his      grandfather's Super 88 Oldsmobile into town. He and Phillis,      farm kids from upstate New York barely in their 20s, were in      Orleans to interview for teaching jobs.       The Kingdom quiet was busted that day by two rough-looking      drunks in fisticuffs, fighting their way down the otherwise      empty street. Mosher rolled down his window to speak a      sentence that revealed the budding wordsmith within: ``Could      one of you gentlemen please tell me how to get to the high      school?''       We'll do you one better, promised the brawlers. We'll take      you there. With a welcome from Mosher, they climbed into the      backseat of the Oldsmobile and directed the teaching recruits      to the school.       ``I was beginning to get the idea we had come to a special      place,'' Mosher said. Just how special, was soon to be      revealed: After the gentlemen disembarked from Mosher's car,      Phillis turned around to peek at the two. She saw they had      started punching each other again, and suggested Mosher take      a look.       ``Well, honey,'' she said. ``Welcome to the Christly      Kingdom.''                   Reciting Frost at a covered bridge       Kingdomy words like Christly--if there's another word like      Christly--were flowing from the front seat, sprinkling my way      that day.       Gool, Glenn said. What is that word?       It's a dam, Mosher said.       At least he thinks it is, and that's how he uses it. He      picked it up from the locals many years ago; people talk      about taking a walk to the gool after supper.       What about carcajou? Glenn asked.       ``Wolverine,'' Mosher replied.       We talked about poems and poets and novels and writing that      day in the car--and outside it, too.       At a covered bridge in Coventry, which Mosher noted with      appreciation was set afire after it received historic      designation, we talked about Kingdom colors and seasons,      poised for change. The novelist recited a poem by Robert      Frost: Nature's first green is gold, Her hardest hue to hold.     Her early leaf's a flower; But only so an hour.     Then leaf subsides to leaf.     So Eden sank to grief, So dawn goes down to day.     Nothing gold can stay.       Switching tenor and tone, Mosher launched into a story of a      Depression era whiskey runner and friend who, fleeing the      law, missed the curve at the bridge and wound up in the      river. He hid in the river while the feds passed by on the      bridge above, satisfied his thirst, and finally made his way      to Barre.       Stories like these, which Mosher heard from Kingdom old-     timers and which still give him a kick, persuaded Mosher he      had found his living and writing place. (``Imagine if      Faulkner got here first,'' he said.)                       Wise people of the Kingdom       Mosher found, in the woods and village, not just stories,      but wisdom and guidance and important friendship--in      particular from two people. As a pair, the two are as      improbable as Mosher's talking turtle or spire-climbing      tomboy.       James Hayford, who died in 1993 at age 79, was a      Montpelier-born poet who settled in Orleans, where he had a      teaching career. Hayford studied poetry with Robert Frost at      Amherst College, and captured the life of his village in      verse.       The memory of meeting Hayford, at a teachers' party in      Orleans, is as vivid as the day his kids were born, Mosher      said. Hayford, a scholar of Vermont, assured Mosher he would      find his voice as a novelist.       Frost had assured Hayford he would find his poet's voice,      Mosher said.       From Moore, a close friend, he heard real life stories of      traveling in a boxcar with a menagerie of animals, of cooking      in a lumber camp and waitressing in a dance hall. He heard a      different voice assure him he'd find his way.       After her first marriage fell apart, Moore allowed herself      to cry only after her sow's 13th--and final--piglet was born.       ``Margie, my girl,'' she said to herself. ``What have you      done with your life?''       ``And she told me that right when I was trying to figure      out what to do with mine,'' Mosher said.       In their ways, characterized by a fierce independence of      mind, Hayford and Moore are among the great people he has      known, geniuses to some degree, Mosher said.       ``They could've gone anywhere, done anything and been      anything including president of the United States,'' Mosher      said.       ``What they wanted to do was live in the Northeast      Kingdom.''       Mosher spoke wise words of his own that day from the front      seat. After asking if we'd like to stop for lunch at      McDonald's--holy moley! McDonald's in the land of the      localvores and I'm carsick!--Mosher said something I've      passed on to my daughter.       He told Glenn and me he's never known a person who pursued      an interest in the arts and regretted it.       But he could think of many people who turned away from      artistic interests and talents, and did.                         Go back while you can       Teachers' pay wasn't so great in Orleans back in 1964,      Mosher discovered not long after the drunk brawlers guided      him to the school. By then, however, he'd had his first      Kingdom epiphany--and that was clearly worth something.       Still, the working plan was to teach a few years, save      money and go to graduate school. Was it possible on a salary      of $4,100, and less than that for Phillis? Sensing hesitation      from the teaching recruits from upstate New York, the      superintendent asked the couple if they fished. When they      answered yes, he took them to the Barton River.       The trout were jumping that spring day, making their way up      river.       ``I looked at Phillis, she looked at me,'' Mosher said. The      sight of the fish jumping the falls persuaded them to move to      Orleans. They accepted the teaching jobs, and taught for a      few years before moving to California, where Mosher planned      to get his master's of fine arts in writing. He scrapped that      plan after eight days, long enough for a truck driver to pull      up to the Moshers' car at Hollywood and Vine in L.A., and      deliver a message on seeing their green license plates. ``I'm      from Vermont, too,'' the trucker driver     said. ``Go back while you still can.'' The stories Mosher      wanted to tell were rich and ready and far from Hollywood and      Vine. ``I cut myself off from all my material before I      understood it well enough to write about it,'' Mosher said.      They headed home; Mosher to write, Phillis to teach. ``We      knew right away we had found a gold mine of stories,'' Mosher      said. ``And we found out nobody had written them. I couldn't      believe it. It took me 15 years or so to begin to figure out      how to do it.''       Much of his first novel, ``Disappearances,'' was written in      the library/opera house in Derby Line, a granite and brick      building that straddles the U.S.-Canada border. Mosher would      place half his chair in the U.S., and half in the foreign      country, when he wrote. He sometimes got such a kick from his      own work, he created a disturbance. Or so the librarian      thought. ``I would burst into gales of laughter with each new      outrageous passage,'' Mosher recalled. `` ` Mr. Mosher,' he      was warned, if you can't control yourself, we will have to      ask you to leave.' ''                     Keep the kids out of the mill       Talking in hushed library tones in the dual nation reading      room where he wrote Disappearances,'' Mosher said he was      amusing himself during the writing of the book. ``But I was      also in a state of desperation,'' he said. ``There's a degree      of desperation about the writing.''       Decades later, Mosher is amused by the response to      ``Disappearances'' of Wallace Stegner, the famous novelist      who lived in Greensboro. Stegner read Mosher's book to write      a possible blurb for the cover.       Stegner, the story goes, didn't get too far before      crumpling up the manuscript and throwing it in the fire,      announcing: ``This book is a hymn to irresponsibility.''       ``I didn't know enough to use it,'' Mosher said.       Mosher drove us past the place in Irasburg that would serve      as a springboard for perhaps his best known story: the house      where a black minister was living in the summer of 1968, when      his home was shot at. The racial shooting, which came to be      called the Irasburg Affair, informed Mosher's 1989 novel, ``A      Stranger in the Kingdom.''       We visited, too, a place that will figure in the book      Mosher is writing. His forthcoming novel also has a black man      as a central character: Alexander Twilight, believed to be      the first black person in the country to graduate from      college (Middlebury, 1823).       We walked outside the wonderful stone schoolhouse,      reminiscent of the Middlebury campus, Twilight designed and      built on a quiet plateau in Brownington. Twilight was      principal of the school, and a minister and state legislator.       ``He had a dream,'' Mosher said of Twilight.       ``There's no doubt about it.''       When the Moshers started teaching in Orleans, they were      instructed by the district superintendent to ``keep the kids      out of the mill.'' The administrator was referring to the      Ethan Allen furniture factory, which appears in Mosher's      novels as American Heritage.       Mosher, whose first apartment was next to the mill, said he      heard the words ``keep the kids out of the mill; keep the      kids out of the mill'' rise in rhythmic chant from the      plant's vents outside his window.       It is unlikely the long-ago superintendent, issuing that      directive, had in mind the manner by which Mosher would      fulfill the mandate. But any Kingdom kid who has found his      way to Mosher's novels, is transported to a place that is      true to the mill, and the river nearby, yet worlds apart and      away.                          ____________________
