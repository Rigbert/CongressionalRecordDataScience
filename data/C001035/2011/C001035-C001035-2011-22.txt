President, I rise today to join Senator Mikulski in submitting a resolution honoring the 100th anniversary of Girl Scouting. In March of 2012, the Girl Scouts of America will celebrate a century as the world's preeminent organization dedicated solely to helping young women develop the character and skills for future success.  The Girl Scouts have a tremendous history that should be celebrated and remembered. Since this organization was founded in 1912 in by Juliette Gordon Low, more than 50 million American girls have learned the values of integrity, leadership, and volunteerism. Today, there are more than 3.7 million members in 236,000 local troops throughout the United States and its territories, Girls Scouts has a global reach, with more than 10 million members in 145 countries. As the program continues to inspire, challenge, and empower young women across our Nation and around the world, its members are seeking to come together and recognize its 100th year of creating challenges, opportunities, and unforgettable memories.  In 2009, I introduced the Girl Scouts USA Centennial Commemorative Coin Act with Senator Mikulski. Our bill, which passed both the House and Senate unanimously and was signed into law by the President, directs the Secretary of the Treasury to mint commemorative silver-dollar coins, which will be issued in 2013. Proceeds from the coin sales will benefit the Girl Scouts Centennial Year activities and the preservation of the Juliette Gordon Low Birthplace so that future generations of Girl Scouts will be able to pay tribute to the history of this notable organization.  With more than 16,000 girl and adult members, Girl Scouts of Maine is my State's preeminent organization dedicated solely to girls, all girls, where, in an accepting and nurturing environment, girls build the character and skills for success that last a lifetime. I thoroughly enjoyed my years as a Girl Scout in my hometown of Caribou, ME, including the two summers I spent at Camp Natarswi, so it gives me great pleasure to join in celebrating this important anniversary. On behalf of Girl Scouts in Maine and across America, I am pleased to introduce this resolution in celebration of 100 years of Girl Scouting.                          ____________________
