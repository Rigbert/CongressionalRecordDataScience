Chairman, I would point out that while we are at the beginning, so to speak, of the production of the F-35, it has always inured to the benefit of this country to look to the future, to look at the next generation. And when it comes to an examination of technology and how it can be used in the defense of this Nation in the future, I don't think we should close that door.  We have a resurgence in China. We have a resurgence in Russia. We have problems in the Middle East. We ought not to be taking our oar, if you would, out of the water. And so we ought to continue down this road. We are not, by doing this initial research, instituting a billion or multibillion-dollar procurement program.  So I am opposed and would be happy to yield to the chairman of the subcommittee.                              {time}  1800
