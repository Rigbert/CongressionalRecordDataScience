President, let me ask the minority leader one last question about stem cell research. Before we adjourned, Senator Frist, the Republican leader, came to the floor and propounded a unanimous consent request to bring up this bill, H.R. 810, and two other bills related to the issues. We agreed on a bipartisan basis.  I ask my friend and colleague from the State of Nevada, has the Republican leader set this matter--this unanimous consent request for the stem cell research--to come before the Senate? Has he set it for the Senate calendar? Do we know if or when this is going to be called?
