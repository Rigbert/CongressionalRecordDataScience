 In the House of Representatives, whether it is a Republican majority or a Democratic majority, as long as they stick together, they can do anything they want to and they can ignore the minority. But in the Senate, where it takes a supermajority of 60 to get something done, whether there is a Republican or Democratic minority, that minority is protected.  Today, where we have 54 Democrats and 46 Republicans, nothing is going to get done unless it is done in a bipartisan consensus way, and that is why it is so very important we do not destroy that aspect of the uniqueness of the Senate.  I yield the floor.
