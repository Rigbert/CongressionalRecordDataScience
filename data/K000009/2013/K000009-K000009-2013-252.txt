Speaker, I have the distinct privilege of recognizing Jim Foster, who recently retired as Executive Director of the City Club of Cleveland. For twenty years, Mr. Foster provided strong and innovative leadership, building on the worldwide reputation of the City Club of Cleveland as ``the citadel of free speech.''  Jim Foster originally joined the City Club of Cleveland in 1993 as managing director and become executive director a year later. His involvement, however, was a continuation of a life and career spent in the Greater Cleveland community. Jim grew up in Shaker Heights, was an active member of the Air Force Reserve, and previously worked in city and county government.  As executive director, Jim continued the tradition of excellence of the City Club of Cleveland--the longest running continuous independent free speech forum in the country--in addressing the most salient issues while enacting necessary organizational changes to keep up, and ahead of, the time.  Displaying savvy leadership, Jim enhanced the club's media footprint on television and radio, secured the www.cityclub.org web address and built a website. As social media expanded, Jim kept the organization in front, providing all their forums via live stream, podcast, and archived on the Club's YouTube channel.  Throughout his tenure, Jim displayed a fervent commitment to free speech and the collegial exchange of ideas by pursuing speakers of national prominence and profound influence on a variety of topics, including politics, business, education, and health care. Speakers from all vantage points were hosted and subjected to the challenging but fair questions for which the City Club Forums are well-known. Just recently I worked with Jim to help bring Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi to the City Club for a luncheon address that was extremely well received.  I can confidently say that Jim fulfilled the Club's mission of being an exemplar of a democratic community.  As he enters retirement, I thank Jim for his immense dedication and excellence in serving the community. His character and career accomplishments epitomize what democracy and citizenship are about.  I join the City Club of Cleveland, its board of directors, the greater community, and friends and family in wishing Jim health and happiness in the years ahead. It is my privilege to honor Jim Foster.                          ____________________
