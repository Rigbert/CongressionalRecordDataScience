I want to acknowledge, our members on both sides of the aisle support more land acquisition funding, not less. That said, both sides of the aisle also recognize the maintenance backlog of our national parks is unacceptable.  In this bill we tried to balance the bipartisan support for land acquisition with bipartisan support for maintaining and improving the conditions of facilities we already own.  The gentleman from Arizona thinks we should direct a bit more to the National Park Service maintenance, and there is no debate that those needs are there.  Madam Chair, I support the amendment.  Ms. McCOLLUM. I believe I have the right to close, Madam Chair, so I reserve the balance of my time until closing.
