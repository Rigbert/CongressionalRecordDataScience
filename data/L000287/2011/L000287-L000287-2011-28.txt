Mr. Speaker, I rise today to reintroduce the Motorcoach Enhanced Safety Act.  Four years ago, a horrific accident occurred in my congressional district when a bus carrying the Bluffton University men's baseball team crashed on Interstate 75 in Atlanta, Georgia, en route to a tournament in Florida.  Twenty-nine people were injured on that terrible day, but seven others--Zachary Arend, David Betts, Scott Harmon, Cody Holp, Tyler Williams and Jean and Jerome Niemeyer died that terrible day. They were all treated at various hospitals--Atlanta Medical Center, Piedmont Hospital, and Grady Memorial Hospital.  The entire nation was shocked by the tragedy, and I was floored when my office received a phone call from one of the surgeons who treated the victims. Dr. Jeffrey Salomone, an Associate Professor of Surgery at Emory University School of Medicine, and Deputy Chief of Surgery at Grady Hospital was outraged. He felt that the injuries would have been less severe, and that more lives may have been saved had the victims not been ejected from the motorcoach bus. It was an accident that had been seen time and time again in emergency rooms across the country, and Dr. Salomone couldn't understand why the government had not acted.  Well last year, Congress almost did. The sponsors of the Senate-companion to this legislation--Sens. Sherrod Brown and Kay Bailey Hutchison--worked tirelessly to move the Motorcoach Enhanced Safety Act through the Committee process and onto the Floor. In the House, the Chairmen of both the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and the Energy and Commerce Committee expressed interest and empathy on this issue. Secretary LaHood coordinated discussion groups and drafted a preliminary proposal to address motorcoach safety.  Simply said, Mr. Speaker, Congress needs to act. This bill addresses the most common-sense of issues and has always enjoyed bipartisan support. The U.S. used to be a leader on safety and standards issues, but now we're falling behind. The proposals laid out in this legislation bring our nation's motorcoach industry into the 21st century. I hope that all my colleagues will cosponsor this important bill, and that the victims and their families will celebrate its signage into law this year.                          ____________________
