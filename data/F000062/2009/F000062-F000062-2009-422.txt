 President. I rise today with Senator Ensign to introduce legislation to ensure that Federal Title I education funds are targeted to help our Nation's neediest students learn.  Title I provides assistance to virtually every school district in the country, serving over 12.5 million children in low-income schools, including about 3 million California school children.  Although it has always been the intent of Congress for Title I funds to be used for academic instruction and instructional services, the Federal Government has never provided clear guidelines for how these important dollars should be used.  This lack of Federal guidance has become especially clear now, as States are struggling to comply with the Title I accountability standards established under ``No Child Left Behind''.  While State administrators of Title I are directed by law to meet these specific requirements, they have been given little guidance as to how to ensure that they are in compliance with the law.  I believe that the Federal Government is responsible for making this process as clear as possible to States and school districts.  This legislation would define Title I direct and indirect instructional services.  It would set a standard for the amount of Title I funds that can be used to achieve the academic and administrative objectives of this program.  It would ensure that the majority, 90 percent, of Title I funds are used to improve academic achievement by stipulating that a school district may not use more than 10 percent of these funds for administrative or indirect instructional services.  By setting a standard for the amount of funds that school districts can spend on administrative or indirect services, we ensure that the majority of Title I dollars are used by districts to help improve student academic achievement.  Furthermore, by defining direct and indirect services, all States can applythe same standards for how Title I funds are used nationwide.  Examples of permissible Direct Services are: employing teachers and other instructional personnel, including employee benefits; intervening and taking corrective actions to improve student achievement; purchasing instructional resources such as books, materials, computers, and other instructional equipment; developing and administering curriculum, educational materials and assessments.  Examples of Indirect Services limited to no more than 10 percent of Title I expenditures are: business services relating to administering the program; purchasing or providing facilities maintenance or janitorial, gardening, or landscaping services or the payment of utility costs; buying food and paying for travel to and attendance at conferences or meetings, except if necessary for professional development.  Current law on Title I is much too vague.  It says, ``a State or local educational agency shall use funds received under this part only to supplement the amount of funds that would, in the absence of such Federal funds, be made available from non-Federal sources for the education of pupils participating in programs assisted under this part, and not to supplant such funds.''  Basically, it says that Title I funds are to be used for the ``education of pupils.'' This is too ambiguous.  The U.S. Department of Education has given States a guidance document that explains how Title I funds can be used.  Under this guidance document, only two uses are specifically prohibited: construction or acquisition of real property; and payment to parents to attend a meeting or training session or to reimburse a parent for a salary lost due to attendance at a ``parental involvement'' meeting.  We should give the Department, States, and school districts clearer guidance in law.  During consideration of ``No Child Left Behind,'' I worked hard to get my bill defining appropriate Title I uses included in the Senate version of the bill.  Unfortunately, during conference consideration, that language was stripped out and in its place language was inserted directing the General Accounting Office to report on how States use their Title I funds.  In April 2003, GAO released the report that Congress directed them to submit on Title I Administrative Expenditures.  What GAO found is that while districts spent no more than 13 percent of Title I funds on administrative services, these findings were based on their own definition ``because there is no common definition on what constitutes administrative expenditures.''  Therefore, the accounting office could not precisely measure how much of schools' Title I funds were used for administration.  Because uses of Title I funds are not defined consistently throughout the States, the accounting office created its own definition by compiling aspects of State priorities to complete the report.  The very reason I worked to define how Title I funds should be used--to create consistency and distribution priority nationwide--became the definitive aspect preventing GAO from effectively drawing conclusions to their report.  The report highlights two concerns that I have with the lack of universal definitions in the Title I program: the lack of Federal guidance on effective uses of Title I funds; and the government's inability to accurately measure whether the academic needs of low-income students are being met.  This bill takes some strong steps by balancing the needs for States to retain Title I flexibility and providing them with the guidance needed to administer the program uniformly throughout the country.  My reasons for introducing this bill are two-fold: First, I believe that States must use their limited Federal Title I dollars for the fundamental purpose of providing academic instruction to help students learn.  Second, I believe that it is nearly impossible to achieve this fundamental purpose without providing a clear definition of what is considered an instructional service.  Federal funding is only about 8 percent of the total funding for elementary and secondary education and Title I is even a smaller percentage of total support for public schools.  That is why it is imperative to better focus Title I funds on academic instruction, teaching the fundamentals and helping disadvantaged children achieve.  It is critical that Federal guidance be provided to ensure that Title I funds go where they are needed most--improving the academic performance of low-income children.  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Recod.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 242       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
