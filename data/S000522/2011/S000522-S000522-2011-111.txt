Mr. Speaker, today I am pleased to pay tribute to Ron McNamara, and to thank him for 25 years of faithful and dedicated service to the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Helsinki Commission. Ron joined the staff of the Helsinki Commission on April 14, 1986, at a time when many OSCE countries suffered under Soviet repression and widespread violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms.  Ron's relationship with the Helsinki Commission actually precedes 1986, having served as the liaison to the Commission for the former Senator from New York, Alfonse D'Amato. Perhaps as a result of this experience, Ron got up to speed quickly. He was soon negotiating human rights and humanitarian issues at the Vienna Follow-Up Meeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, which is today the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, or OSCE. From late 1986 to 1989 he was stationed in Vienna and participated in this multilateral negotiation--progress in the respect of human rights in the Soviet Union and its East European allies had suddenly become possible. As part of the team that translated that potentiality into reality, Ron stayed on top of ever-changing developments, networked with our European allies on strategy, and pressed the one-party communist governments to adopt a new set of human rights commitments. When the Berlin Wall fell and multi-party elections were scheduled, Ron's diplomatic skills helped produce landmark documents which solidified democracy as the chosen form of government and clarified the understanding that a government's treatment of its citizens is not an internal matter but rather a legitimate concern to all. Ron was especially instrumental in negotiating new commitments in the area of cross-border human contacts, which led to greater freedom of movement for those previously denied permission to emigrate to reunite with their families or travel to visit family members.  Throughout the years, he has been deeply involved with preparations for the annual sessions of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly. He has served as a member of numerous U.S. delegations to various OSCE conferences and as an OSCE election observer in Georgia, Belarus, Ukraine, Russia and Azerbaijan. Ron also participated in Commission efforts to respond to the genocidal and other atrocities in Bosnia-Herzegovina. He was particularly active in legislative efforts to lift the arms embargo on that country, which had denied it the capacity to exercise its rights of self-defense in the face of Bosnian Serb aggression. Ron's portfolio has also included work with Turkey, Greece and Cyprus, religious liberty issues and combating anti-Semitism. A notable result of Ron's work was the willingness of the Turkish government to allow a more open dialogue on human rights and civil society in return for agreement on holding the 1999 OSCE Summit in Istanbul. In addition to his ongoing human rights work, Ron at times has had the Commission staff portfolio for security issues and for economic cooperation.  During 2001-2002, Ron served with distinction as Chief of Staff under the Chairmanship of Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell, and in both 1999-2000 and 2003-2004 served as Deputy Chief of Staff under my Chairmanship. I have often benefited from Ron's counsel and have always been impressed by his deep integrity. Since Senator Campbell's retirement, he has served in a variety of capacities, including International Policy Advisor. His knowledge and insight into the workings of the U.S. government and various OSCE institutions has proved invaluable to the work of the Commission. He is a man of great prudence and justice.  Mr. Speaker, as Chairman of the Helsinki Commission, I am very pleased to commend and thank Ron McNamara for his faithful, dedicated and tireless service to the Helsinki Commission and to the cause of human dignity and freedom.                          ____________________
