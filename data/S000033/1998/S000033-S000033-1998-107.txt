 Speaker, the time is now to end U.S. support for the Suharto dictatorship in Indonesia and to help that country move for democracy.  General Suharto is a dictator who has been in office for over 30 years and during that period has committed horrendous atrocities. Today his political opponents are in jail, they are being tortured, they are being kidnapped by the secret police.  Just the other day, six unarmed student protesters were shot down in cold blood. General Suharto is known not only for his brutality but for his corruption and greed. In a country where the average income is less than $20 a week, his family has amassed a fortune of over $30 billion.  Mr. Speaker, if the brave students of Indonesia are prepared to put their lives on the line to end the Suharto dictatorship, how can we ignore their cries for freedom? Let us end our support for Suharto now.                          ____________________
