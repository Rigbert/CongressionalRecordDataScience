We are hearing from the other side that this is just about how to pay for this necessary legislation to prevent the doubling of the interest rate. We have offered a compelling way to pay for it in terms of closing this egregious loophole. They have, as Senator Brown indicated, once again, put on the chopping block, if you will, preventive services for families across this country and potentially the most sensible way to begin to reduce our health care costs over time.  They have--when they have wanted to--completely ignored paying for things such as tax cuts. We have seen that. Just recently the House passed the so-called Small Business Tax Cut Act with no offsets. So to literally hold these students hostage to their unwillingness to bring the bill to the floor, to debate it vigorously--to vote on their proposal to pay for it and to vote on our proposal to pay for it--is, I think, unfortunate, if not unconscionable.  We have 45 days left.  With that, I yield the floor.
