 President, I think the place for me to start is where the Senator from California left off; that is, the impression that is left that this bill is going to confuse the seniors of America, and almost that the purpose of it might be to confuse seniors.  But let me make very clear to all the seniors who are listening, and everybody else who is listening, one of the keystones of this legislation is to say to the seniors of America: If you do not want to do anything, if you do not want anything to do with this, you do not have to have it. This is strictly voluntary.  For any senior in Iowa or California who comes to their respective Members of Congress and says: Congressman so and so, or Senator so and so, just leave my Medicare alone; I am satisfied, each of us can say to them: If you do not want to worry about all this that we are talking about--prescription drugs or anything new about Medicare--you do not have to because you can keep traditional Medicare as you have known it for the last 35 years. Just keep it as is, if you are satisfied with it.  But for those who might not be satisfied, we give them several options. They have a right to choose. They have a right to keep traditional Medicare with a prescription drug program that they can choose to go into, or they also have the right to choose a new Medicare--preferred provider organizations--that is very close to what baby boomers now have in the workplace. They can choose that with an integrated drug benefit plan.  So we are not trying to confuse anybody. We are trying to give seniors the right to choose. We are trying to give seniors who are totally satisfied with what they have right now an opportunity to just stay where they are right now. It is the right of seniors to choose.  I think I better be very clear because so much of the opposition to this bill today has come from the other side of the aisle, mostly Democratic Members of the Senate.  We are here today with a piece of legislation because over the years 2001 and 2002--after Senator Jeffords switched from being a Republican to being an independent and casting his lot with the Democrats, so they were a majority during the remainder of 2001 and all of 2002--there was an effort early on to develop a bipartisan approach to a drug benefit during the last Congress.  When that was developing, there was a fear that there might be a bipartisanbill reported out of the Senate Finance Committee, a year ago, and the then-majority leader, now the minority leader, Senator Daschle, decided that this was an issue that ought to be brought to the Senate floor, not worked out in committee.  Remember, you develop bipartisanship in the Senate in the committee. You do not do it very often here on the floor of the Senate. You build coalitions.  Remember, nothing gets done in the Senate that is not bipartisan--unlike the House of Representatives, where partisan things can be done--because, remember, the Senate of the United States is that only institution in our political system where minority rights are protected.  So a year ago, the then-majority party decided that this ought to be debated on the floor. But they also knew that it would be impossible to get the bipartisan majority that it takes to get things done. They gambled that they needed an issue for the last election rather than a product. They gambled on an issue that we would not do anything last year, and the way they maneuvered this, nothing was done because nothing in a partisan way, even by majority Democrats, can be produced out of this body that is not somewhat bipartisan.  Then there was an election, and they found out that issue did not work for them; that Republicans were put in a majority. This gave, in this new majority, in this new Congress, Senator Baucus and I, the top Democrat and the top Republican on the committee, an opportunity to do our magic and put together a bipartisan bill. That bill came to the Senate floor and was passed 76 to 21. It went to conference, and came out of conference in a bipartisan way. And we are here because the majority Republicans and some sensible Democrats want to produce a product and not have an issue for the next election. I happen to think, from the comments I have heard today--all the fault that can be found with this bipartisan product--that there are still too many people on the other side of the aisle who have not learned a lesson: No. 1, how do you get anything done in the Senate? It has to be bipartisan. And, No. 2, they did not learn from the mistakes of the last election when they thought they needed an issue. Do they think if it did not work in 2002, it is going to work in 2004?  So that is why we are where we are because there are Democrats who know that you do not get anything done in the Senate if there is not a bipartisan coalition. There are Republicans who have understood that for a long period of time.  So that is background to what I want to tell the people of America and my colleagues about why this bill should be adopted. During this process, I am going to correct some of the statements made by my colleagues so far today.  I want to correct what my colleague from Iowa said earlier about this bill's impact on rural America and on our State of Iowa in particular.  The rural health provisions of this bill go further and wider than any other legislation that this Congress has ever considered. It enjoys the strong support of the Nation's doctors and hospitals, and it is also strongly endorsed by the Iowa Medical Society and by the Iowa Hospital Association, two of the strongest advocates for rural equity in my State and my colleague's State.  I will read an excerpt from each and then ask unanimous consent that both letters be printed in the Record.  This is from the Iowa Medical Society president, Tom Evans, M.D.: ``[P]assage of the bill,'' meaning the bill before us, ``is critical for rural states like Iowa.'' ``He said: ``In addition to providing seniors with prescription drug coverage''--and I want to emphasize this part of his statement--``this legislation fixes many of the reimbursement issues that have unfairly penalized rural States. Congress must pass this legislation before the Thanksgiving [Day] recess.''  Now, I go to the Iowa Hospital Association, which in 2001 circulated statistics, already referred to, showing Iowa in last place in per-beneficiary spending. The Iowa Hospital Association: ``The Iowa Hospital Association strongly endorses passage of this legislation.'' ``In an evaluation of the per-beneficiary increase, this legislation provides Iowa hospitals with the second largest percentage increase per Medicare beneficiary of any state in the Union. This amounts to a per-beneficiary increase of $583, which is the thirteenth highest increase of any state in the Union.  Mr. President, beyond those quotes, I could give a lot of evidence, but I think those quotes speak volumes about our rural package. That package in this legislation speaks for itself. It brings real improvements and equitable payments to hospitals and doctors in Iowa and way beyond.  I ask unanimous consent to have these letters printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                     Iowa Hospital Association                                    Des Moines, IA, Nov. 20, 2003.     Hon. Charles Grassley,     U.S. Senator, Hart Senate Office Building Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Grassley: Congratulations in reaching an      agreement on a conference report that directly and      significantly impacts the issue of equity and fairness for      hospitals and physicians in rural America and particularly      for Iowa. Just this morning, the entire Iowa Hospital      Association Board was briefed on the impact of your Medicare      legislation and on a unanimous vote endorsed the pending      legislation.       In an evaluation of the per-beneficiary increase, this      legislation provides Iowa hospitals with the second largest      percentage increase per Medicare beneficiary of any state in      the Union. This amounts to a per-beneficiary increase of      $583, which is the thirteenth highest increase of any state      in the Union.       The Iowa Hospital Association strongly endorses passage of      this legislation and will today ask its entire membership to      weigh-in on behalf of the legislation with the entire      congressional delegation of Iowa in an effort to support your      work to achieve passage of this legislation before the      Thanksgiving holiday. It is our hope that when Congress      completes its work and you return to Iowa for the holidays,      that all Iowa providers will have an opportunity to      congratulate you for successful passage of this historic      legislation.           Sincerely,     Kimberly A. Russel,       IHA Board Chair.     Kirk Norris,       President/CEO.                                  ____   Iowa Medical Society Strongly Supports Passage of Medicare Reform                               Legislation       The Iowa Medical Society (IMS) announced today its strong      support for the Medicare Prescription Drug and Modernization      Act of 2003 conference report.       IMS President Tom Evans, MD, said passage of the bill is      critical for rural states like Iowa. ``In addition to      providing seniors with prescription drug coverage, this      legislation fixes many of the reimbursement issues that have      unfairly penalized rural states,'' he said. ``Congress must      pass this legislation before the Thanksgiving recess.''       Evans said the bill protects Iowans' access to physicians      by replacing a 4.5 percent payment cut scheduled for 2004      with two years of modest payment increases. The bill also      fixes a component of the reimbursement formula that deals      with geographic practice cost adjustors that causes huge      reimbursement swings from state to state.       ``If this legislation isn't passed, the American Medical      Association estimates that a 4.5 percent cut in reimbursement      will take $30 million away from Iowa's health care system in      2004,'' he said. ``Now add to this the fact that Iowa already      receives among the lowest payment rates in the country, and      you can see how Medicare is threatening our ability to care      for our patients.''       Evans also thanked Senator Charles Grassley for his work on      this bill as Chair of the Senate Finance Committee, and he      urged Iowa Senator Tom Harkin and Iowa's Congressional      Representatives to support the Medicare conference report.       The Iowa Medical Society is the professional association      representing over 4,600 MDs and DOs. The IMS core purpose is      to assure the highest quality health care in Iowa through its      role as physician and patient advocate.
