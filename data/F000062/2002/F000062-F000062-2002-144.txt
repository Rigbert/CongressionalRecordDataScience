 I would like to add to what the Senator has said. I am firmly in support of the Senator's amendment. I ask this question. She made the case about the health and environmental unknowns of ethanol. That was somewhat contested. She is absolutely right.  I ask the Senator if she knew about the EPA blue-ribbon panel on oxygenates which found ``ethanol may retard biodegradation and increase movement of benzene and other hydrocarbons around leaking tanks''?
