Speaker, I rise today to recognize an honor bestowed on a well-known Northwest Ohioan and friend, Mr. Art Edgerton. Along with four others, Art will be inducted this year into the National Association of Black Journalists Region VI Hall of Fame.  Art began his broadcast career in 1958, and since then has worked regularly in local media. He currently serves as the director of public and corporate relations with a large Northwest Ohio radio station. Committed to promoting African-Americans and disabled people in journalism, Art is the current president of the Northwest Ohio Black Media Association. In this capacity, he has been outspoken in articulating the need for fairness in the field of journalism for both African Americans and people with disabilities.  Among Art's many gifts is an exceptional musical talent. He studied at The Julliard School and the Philadelphia Conservatory of Music, and is a gifted pianist, organist, and percussionist. His talents are recognized far beyond Northwest Ohio, were he enjoys a loyal and enthusiastic following.  Art Edgerton has been a quiet, commanding presence in Northwest Ohio for decades. His counsel is appreciated by many. He brings a unique perspective and uncompromising dedication to everything he does. Long recognized for his work, Art's previous citations include: Handicapped American of the Year 1967, Ohio Governors Super Hall of Fame 1970, Winner of the Baldwin Talent Search 1981, Distinguished Service Award from the Toledo Ophthalmologists and Optometrists 1990, and State Media Award from the State of Ohio Optometric Association 1990. The Northwest Ohio Black Media Association has established a scholarship in his honor.  We in Northwest Ohio are very proud that Art Edgerton has been named to the National Association of Black Journalists Region VI Hall of Fame, for we believe that none deserves the accolade more than Art. As we congratulate him on this achievement we also offer a heartfelt thank you for his efforts, always conducted with courage, grace, and integrity. We are proud of him and for him.                          ____________________
