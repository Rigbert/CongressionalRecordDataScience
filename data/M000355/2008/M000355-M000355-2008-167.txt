 What I proposed to the majority leader and to the Senate--to which he objected, unfortunately--was that we proceed on this measure related to the subject that is most on the minds of the American people in a way entirely consistent with the way we have dealt with energy in the past when it wasn't the No. 1 issue in the country.  Last year when we were on an energy measure, the way we proceeded involved 15 days on the floor, it involved 16 rollcall votes and the adoption of 49 amendments. I say to my friend from Arizona, at that time gasoline was way too high, but it wasn't nearly as high as it is now. It was $3.06 a gallon; now it is about a dollar a gallon higher. That was in this Congress.  In 2005, when our party was in the majority, we passed an energy bill, and we spent 10 days on the floor. At that time gas was $2.26 a gallon. We had 19 rollcall votes, 57 amendments were adopted, and we passed the bill.  So if we were treating the subject of energy in a credible way consistent with Senate traditions in 2005 when it wasn't the No. 1 issue and in 2007 when it wasn't the No. 1 issue in the country, my thought is why in the world would we be trying to do something less than that--something that doesn't give all Senators, many of whom have good ideas to propose on both sides of the aisle, an opportunity to craft a proposal that gets at the No. 1 issue in the country. That is what my unanimous consent request would have allowed. I proffered it a while ago. It was objected to. It would have allowed us to have energy-related amendments only, I would say to my friend from Arizona, that we would rotate from side to side--a Republican amendment and then a Democratic amendment--and we wouldn't put a sort of arbitrary timeline on ending the discussion prematurely before we had dealt with the problem.
