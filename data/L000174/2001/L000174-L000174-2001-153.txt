I agree that this is a vital organization. GEF's work gets at many of the international environmental problems which simply cannot be fixed by the U.S. or any nation acting alone, such as global warming.  Poor nations which struggle to feed and clothe their people simply do not have the resources to devote to global environmental problems. Yet if we do not have a unified global approach to these problems, we have little hope of addressing them effectively. The GEF funds worthy projects in 160 countries.  Unfortunately, the United States has lagged behind in meeting our obligations to the GEF. Since 1994, twice the U.S. has pledged $107.5 million a year to GEF. We are now in the final year of the second replenishment, and our total arrears stand at $203.9 million. Our recommended appropriation this year will make only a small dent in that figure, but at least will not add to them.
