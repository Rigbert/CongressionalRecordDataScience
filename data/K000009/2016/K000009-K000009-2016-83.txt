Chair, I am opposed to the amendment as the provision interferes with the standard practice spanning administrations of both parties and raises potential constitutional concerns.  It is standard practice for agencies processing Freedom of Information Actrequests to confer with other executive branch entities with equities, including the White House, prior to releasing documents. Agencies refer documents to the White House just as they refer documents to other agencies.  The practice of agencies consulting with the White House prior to Freedom of Information Act requests regarding White House equities is longstanding, spanning administrations of both parties. The Reagan administration issued a memorandum in 1988 directing such consultation.  Finally, the provision could interfere with the President's ability to protect privileged information and thereby could raise constitutional concerns in some applications. This is just one more instance of the majority prioritizing message amendments rather than getting on with the hard work of legislating.  I oppose this amendment. It has no place on an appropriations bill and should be defeated.  I yield back the balance of my time.
