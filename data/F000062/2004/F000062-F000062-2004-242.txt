 We were told this would be later, at 3 o'clock, and then learned it would be 1 o'clock, and then it was noon. I was here so I could come down. Senator Warner, I believe, has not yet arrived, and would like to speak, as would Senator DeWine and Senator Schumer. It is a Monday. The time has essentially changed. So I would like to leave them time to be able to speak.
