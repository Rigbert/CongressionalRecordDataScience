Of course, each of us is convinced that we represent the best State in the Union, but in my case it happens to be true.  Valentine's Day is celebrated around the world with flowers, candy, and romance. It is also a time to reflect upon the places and the people we love. To me, this is an occasion to celebrate the State in which I was born, raised, and live--the great State of Maine.  People who know Maine share my love for its spectacular scenery--the rolling hills of Aroostook County, the rocky coast and the many harbors, the beautiful western mountains, the quiet forests, the beautiful rivers, and the pristine lakes.
