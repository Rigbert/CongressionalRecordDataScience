Both of us have had the opportunity to serve in public office. Both of us come from States that are small in population but large in the impact that women have had on our Nation's history. We are from States with rich histories of accomplishments by women of all backgrounds and cultures.  For example, the legendary Senator Margaret Chase Smith was the first woman in history to serve in both the U.S. House and the Senate.  Pauline Elizabeth Hopkins, who has been called the dean of African-American Women Writers, and who has been considered one of the most prolific black female writers in the beginning of the 1900s, was born in Portland, ME.  Mary Gabriel, of the Passamaquoddy Tribe, was a famous Native-American basket weaver, largely credited with reviving the art in the State of Maine.  Brenda Commander is the first woman to be elected as chief of Maine's Maliseet Indian Tribe.  Is the Senator from Alaska aware of similar accomplishments by Alaskan women?
