 Speaker, today, I recognize the outstanding work done by participants in my Student Congressional Town Meeting held this spring at the University of Vermont. These participants were part of a group of high school students from around Vermont who testified about the concerns they have as teenagers, and about what they would like to see government do regarding these concerns.                   FINANCIAL AID AND HIGHER EDUCATION           (By Candace Crosby and Kim Dickenson Apr. 8, 2002)       CANDACE CROSBY. As students preparing for college, we find      that the financial issue is becoming a larger problem      compared to what our parents had to pay for college tuition.      According to a VSAC representative, 70 to 80 percent of      students today need some type of financial aid. The rates for      tuition are high, but what's worse is that they are rising at      rate of about 5 percent a year all over the country.       What concerns us as future college students is how we will      be able to pay for the tuition, and tuition doesn't include      room and board and other expenses. We think that, today,      there is a lack of adequate financial aid for college-bound      students.       When preparing to pay for college, teens in Vermont turn to      VSAC--which is the Vermont Student Association Corporation--     for financial help. Of course, VSAC is a healthy program, but      are they able to give financial aid to all the students that      need it? No. Does VSAC have enough money to give scholarships      and grants to the teens that need it at the same increasing      rate that college tuition is rising? No.       We spoke to a representative from VSAC who gave us the      information that VSAC has increased their funds for      scholarships and financial aid, but has not been able to keep      up with the increasing tuition costs. Based on one of VSAC's      grants, the Vermont Incentive Grant, fulltime graduates can      get between $500 and $8,650 for one year to help pay for      college. The $8,650 is an extremely helpful amount of money      to receive, but not all the teens going to college will      receive this amount. Even if a student gets the minimum,      $500, it will not even begin to help for any student to pay      for their college education. It will only cover a few of the      books that students will need for their first year of      college.       KIM DICKENSON. Online at USNews.com, we searched for      college tuitions for various Vermont colleges. We looked up      the cost at Castleton State College, Lyndon State College,      UVM, Johnson State College, VTC and Southern Vermont College.      We found that the average tuition costs for these schools was      approximately $6,825. We found that the average room and      board add approximately $5,520 more to tuition. Together,      this amounts to $12,345. Even more interesting is that some      of the room-and-board costs are higher than the tuition      costs. At Castleton State College, tuition is $5,392, and      room and board is $5,530. $12,000 is a lot of money, even      with VSAC's help, but students leave colleges thousands of      dollars in debt.       What about students who want to go to college outside of      Vermont? These costs are astronomical, and the tuition alone      can be $20,000 or $30,000, because the students are not      residents of the state. How are students supposed to pay for      college without a lot of financial aid when they go to these      schools?       0 percent of Vermont students take out loans provided by      VSAC. We found a list of loans that could be borrowed from      VSAC, and the amounts ranged from $1,000 to $50,000. Even if      a student went to a college that had a tuition of $25,000 a      year, and they took out a loan to pay for the first two      years, they would have to pay back 73,615. The student pays      23,615 more dollars in interest. That is practically paying      for a third year of college.       We think that is a ridiculous amount. We thought of a few      solutions so that students can receive more financial aid and      won't have to have an enormous debt to pay back. The burden      of debt would decrease if funds for scholarships, grants and      other financial aid would be increased. We think the federal      and state governments should fund VSAC's financial aid      programs even more then they already do. This would enable      more students to receive money so that the financial burden      on families wouldn't be as great.                       THE RIGHTS OF THE ABENAKI       (By Evan Worth, Alan Blackman, Nicolette Baron, and Steph      Bernath April 8, 2002)       EVAN WORTH. We are doing the issue of Abenaki rights. And      as of now, they are not recognized as an Indian tribe. They      have been pushing, seeking federal recognition for the past      25 years, which is a criteria for federal recognition, which      they need to have been a continuous entity since 1900, they      need to have existed as a community since before 1900, there      needs to be a political influence throughout history, they      need a membership criteria and governing procedures, they      need roots before 1900, and they cannot be members of any      other type of group, and cannot be stripped of their status.       ALAN BLACKMAN. Vermont seems to have a very long-held      tradition in being first in giving people, specific groups of      people, rights--outlawing slavery, granting rights for all      men to vote, and, more recently, civil unions. I feel we      should continue this. And in doing this, it is another way      to, so to speak, take Vermont forward.       The main concern against this, particularly Governor Dean's      apprehension with granting them recognition is, casinos and      land claims. Chief April Rushlow has claimed on numerous      occasions that, quite frankly, they have higher concerns,      such as burial grounds and things of this nature. The main      reason they want this, what provoked this, actually, such a      strong pursuit of this, was kids being taunted at school for      being Abenaki, but not being recognized by the government.      What they want is essentially grants for education,      healthcare, things they couldn't get as of now. And I feel      that it is a good idea and it would be a step in the right      direction to grant them recognition.       NICOLETTE BARON. Some of the qualms that state government      has cited for not giving recognition to the Abenaki was extra      rights, aside from those already given to minorities, the      fact that it will lead to federal recognition, and they can      institute their own laws and have their own fish and wildlife      regulations that do not need to concur with the guidelines of      the state.       On the issue of the minorities, the minorities that are      around the nation and around the state are African-Americans      and Hispanics. While those groups do have an important part      in the history of this state and the nation, the Abenakis      were among the first inhabitants of this state, and they are      the only native American tribe that has not been recognized.       State recognition could lead to federal recognition, which      would give the Abenaki rights to make their own laws,      including those regarding fish and wildlife regulations. The      laws that they would make would most likely conform to the      Constitution of the United States, not go beyond that or not      be radical, which I think is what the state government is      concerned with. All laws would be to prohibit harm and to      make it, you know. And fishing and wildlife laws would be      based on the need to eat, and not hunting game, not game-     hunting. And being recognized as a tribe would allow them to      sell their wares, like basket weaving, which is a tradition      in the Abenaki, and to get better economic status for these      people. And it would give them rights with scholarships, and      that's really important, to send their kids to school.       STEPH BERNATH. What I find to be very disturbing about the      Abenaki struggle for recognition is the negativity exhibited      by the state department. I have yet to hear the      acknowledgement from the state department that something      positive may come out of the Abenaki getting the recognition      they obviously deserve. Nearly every argument brought forth      by the state of Vermont has been critical of what the tribe      may do once they receive recognition. It has been made clear      very many times that the Abenaki are not interested in      gambling or hurting Vermonters in any way. Chief April      Rushlow has clarified this one too many times.       The victims of this criticism, on the other hand, the      Abenaki, have openly acknowledged they are aware of what the      State Department fears may happen to those people who live on      Abenaki land if they are given     recognition. They have said that they are willing to work      with the people of Vermont, as they have done in years prior,      and stated that they have nothing to fear from the tribe.       The Abenaki are willing to work with the state of Vermont,      but it appears as if the state of Vermont is unwilling to      work with the Abenakis, the People of the Dawn, the people      who have lived in Vermont for thousands of years. It is time      that these people receive the recognition they deserve. The      state of Vermont must be willing to give them a chance to      prove who they are and what they stand for.       Chief April Rushlow has stated, ``We're the only race in      the United States who has to prove who we are.'' She was      right. Chief Rushlow also said, ``We're here when it is      convenient for the state of Vermont.'' Once again, Chief      Rushlow was right.                               ____________________
