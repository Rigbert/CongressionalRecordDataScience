President, I am pleased we will finally vote on the bipartisan amendment that Senator Inhofe and I have proposed. I thank the Commerce Committee chairman and ranking member.  Before we vote I would like to respond to some remarks made on the floor yesterday. The junior Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Coburn, expressed some concern with the portion of our amendment that makes an improvement to the Public Safety Officers Benefits Act. As I understand one of Senator Coburn's concerns, it is the belief that the PSOB improvement I propose exceeds Congress's proper role under the Constitution.  Section 8 of article 1 in the Constitution empowers Congress to provide for the ``general welfare'' of the United States. Supporting our first responders, and encouraging more Americans to serve their communities as first responders, who are our first line of national security, falls squarely within this clause.  Congress can and does legislate in many areas that support the general welfare of our Nation, whether providing funds to fight violent crime through joint law enforcement task forces, or providing disaster aid to the states following natural disasters. Congress has traditionally acted to support our Federal system through beneficial legislation for the states. I find it difficult to understand how supporting all of our Nation's first responders, on an equal basis, exceeds Congress's proper and traditional constitutional role.  According to my review, there have been 65 Federal cases concerning the PSOB program, and not one of them challenged its constitutionality. In 1986, the Supreme Court took up a case involving the PSOB program, which did not involve a constitutional challenge, and in fact invoked the Constitution's supremacy clause to hold that the Federal PSOB program's benefit could not be interfered with by any inconsistent state law.  Senators may disagree about the wisdom or necessity of legislating for the general welfare or in support of our first responders, but as a constitutional matter, Congress authority to enact programs like the Public Safety Officers Benefits Act is well established.  For over 30 years, since 1976, the Public Safety Officers Benefits Program has assisted the families of first responders lost in the line of duty, including local police, firefighters, and EMS technicians. This policy was enacted in part to encourage more Americans to serve their communities as police officers, firefighters, and paramedics. The importance of the services they provide is undeniable.  Senator Coburn also expressed concern that our amendment expanded Federal costs. So let me be clear on this point: while the estimated cost of this proposal is modest--less than $13 million over 10 years our--amendment is fully paid for through an included offset. Let me repeat that because I think there may be some confusion on this point--this amendment is completely paid for. It is deficit neutral and will have no budgetary impact given the included offset.  I also heard a concern about the fact that this amendment may not be germane to the underlying bill. If I am not mistaken, one of the very first amendments the Senate voted on, and for which Senator Coburn voted in favor and had no procedural objection that I am aware of, was an amendment to repeal the health care law. I do not think that amendment would be ruled germane. Nonetheless, in the spirit of moving the legislative process forward, the Senate voted on it.  Senator Inhofe and I have worked together to try to advance two proposals that are important to us, and which will both support our Nation's first responders and encourage volunteerism. I thank Senator Inhofe once again, and I urge all Senators to join us in support of this amendment.  I ask unanimous consent that letters of support for my amendment from the American Ambulance Association, the National Association of EMTs, the International Association of Fire Fighters, and the International Association of Fire Chiefs be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                American Ambulance                                                  Association,                               McLean, Virginia, February 4, 2011.     The Hon. Patrick Leahy,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: On behalf of the membership of the      American Ambulance Association (AAA), I am proud to convey      our strong support for Amendment No. 50 to the FAA Air      Transportation Modernization and Safety Improvement Act (S.      223). Your amendment would ensure that the survivors of      paramedics and emergency medical technicians who die in the      line of duty and who are employed by nonprofit ambulance      service agencies are eligible for death benefits under the      Public Safety Officers' Benefit program. It would also      provide much needed liability protection to volunteer pilots.       We greatly appreciate that the amendment is named after      Dale Long who lost his life in the line of duty in June of      2009. Dale was a certified paramedic and provided emergency      medical care to patients for nearly twenty five years, most      recently with the Bennington Rescue Squad. Just two months      prior to his death, Dale was recognized by the American      Ambulance Association as a Star of Life for his years of      dedicated service to patients. In 2010, Dale was honored by      the National EMS Memorial. Dale is deeply missed and we      greatly appreciate your efforts on his behalf and those of      thousands of paramedics and EMTs around the country.       The ambulance service agencies and EMS personnel which they      employ, just like the communities they serve, are unique.      Communities are served by governmental and non-profit      agencies and a large portion by for-profit agencies. There is      one characteristic, however, that is constant. When there is      an emergency, all EMS personnel, regardless of by whom they      are employed, put their lives on the line. We therefore      applaud your leadership to make EMS personnel employed by      nonprofit agencies eligible for public safety officer      benefits and encourage you to ensure that eventually all EMS      personnel are covered.       The AAA is the primary national trade association for      providers of emergency and non-emergency ambulance services.      The AAA is comprised of more than 600 ambulance service      operations which account for providing services to over 75      percent of the     U.S. population. AAA members include private, public, fire-     based, hospital-based and volunteer ambulance service      providers serving urban, suburban and rural areas. The AAA      was formed in 1979 in response to the need for improvements      in medical transportation and emergency medical services.       Again, we strongly support Amendment No. 50 to S. 223 and      greatly appreciate all of your efforts on the issue.           Sincerely,                                                 Steve Williamson,     President.                                  ____                                              National Association                             of Emergency Medical Technicians,                           Clinton, Mississippi, February 4, 2011.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy, The National Association of Emergency      Medical Technicians, NAEMT, strongly supports Amendment No.      50 to the FAA Air Transportation Modernization and Safety      Improvement Act (S. 223). In addition to providing liability      protection to volunteer pilots, your amendment would ensure      that the survivors of paramedics and emergency medical      technicians who die in the line of duty and who are employed      by nonprofit ambulance service agencies are eligible for      death benefits under the Public Safety Officers' Benefit      program. Your amendment would provide piece of mind to      thousands of emergency medical service, EMS, personnel and      their families including those of Dale Long.       The death in June of 2009 of Dale Long was a tragedy. Dale      was a certified paramedic and provided emergency medical care      to patients for nearly twenty five years and served with the      Bennington Rescue Squad for the last four of those years. In      1998, he was recognized as the Vermont Advanced Provider of      the Year. Dale will be deeply missed and we greatly      appreciate you honoring Dale by naming this vital amendment      after him.       The ambulance service agencies and EMS personnel which they      employ, just like the communities they serve, are unique.      Communities are served by governmental and non-profit      agencies and a large portion by for-profit agencies. There is      one characteristic, however, that is constant. When there is      an emergency, all EMS personnel, regardless of by whom they      are employed, are willing to put their lives on the line. We      very much appreciate your leadership to make EMS personnel      employed by nonprofit agencies eligible for federal death      benefits and encourage you to ensure that eventually all EMS      personnel are covered.       Again, we strongly support Amendment No. 50 to S. 223 and      thank you for all of your efforts on this issue.           Sincerely,                                                     Connie Meyer,     President, NAEMT.                                  ____                                         International Association                                             of Fire Fighters,                                                 February 7, 2011.     Hon. Patrick Leahy, Chairman,     Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: On behalf of the nation's nearly 300,000      professional fire fighters and emergency medical personnel, I      wish to express our support for the Dale Long Emergency      Medical Service Providers Protection Act, and urge the Senate      to adopt it as an amendment to the FAA reauthorization.       The legislation corrects an inequity in Public Safety      Officers Benefit, PSOB, by extending coverage to those      employees and volunteers of non-profit ambulance squads that      serve public agencies. Throughout the nation, many non-profit      entities serve as the principal 911 emergency responder for      their communities, and the emergency care providers who work      or volunteer for such agencies should be treated as public      safety officers. For example, Dale Long, the individual for      whom this legislation is named, served as a paramedic for the      Bennington Rescue       Squad, which is the designated 911 emergency response      agency for the town of Bennington, VT.       We believe your amendment fixes this oversight without      undermining the original purpose of the PSOB program to      provide assistance to the families of fallen public safety      officers. The amendment strikes, the appropriate balance, and      we urge the Senate's support.       Thank you for your consideration of the views of America's      professional fire fighters and emergency medical responders.           Sincerely,                                                   Barry Kasinitz,     Director of Governmental Affairs.                                  ____                                         International Association                                               of Fire Chiefs,                                    Fairfax, VA, February 8, 2011.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     Chairman, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Senate Office          Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Leahy: On behalf of the nearly 13,000 chief      fire and emergency officers of the International Association      of Fire Chiefs (IAFC), I would like to express our support      for your amendment to S. 223, FAA Air Transportation      Modernization and Safety Improvement Act, which would add the      ``Dale Long Emergency Medical Service Providers Protection      Act.'' This amendment strikes a proper balance between      providing for the families and loved ones of fallen non-     profit EMS personnel, and protecting the original intent of      the Public Safety Officers' Benefits (PSOB) program.       The amendment would afford previously excluded survivor      benefits through the U.S. Department of Justice's PSOB      program to the families and loved ones of fallen EMS      personnel who work or volunteer for a public or non-profit      rescue squad or ambulance crew that is officially authorized      or licensed to engage in rescue activity, and is officially      designated as a pre-hospital emergency medical response      agency.       Across the United States, many non-profits serve as the      principal 9-1-1 emergency medical responder for their      communities. These EMS personnel who work or volunteer for      such agencies should be treated as public safety officers      under the PSOB program. EMT specialist Dale R. Long, the      individual for whom this legislation is named, served as a      paramedic for the Bennington Rescue Squad, which is the      designated 9-1-1 emergency response agency for the town of      Bennington, Vermont.       Thank you for your continued support for America's public      safety community.           Sincerely,                                   Chief Jack Parow, MA, EFO, CFO,                              President and Chairman of the Board.
