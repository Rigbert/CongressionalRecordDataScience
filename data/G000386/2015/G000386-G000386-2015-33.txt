 President, I come to the floor because we are discussing ObamaCare on the reconciliation bill. Webster's dictionary defines the word ``success'' as the correct or desired result of an attempt. So I want to discuss the definition of the word ``success'' as we consider repeal of ObamaCare.  On the day the bill was signed into law, President Obama said the following:         Today we are affirming that essential truth, a truth every      generation is called to rediscover for itself, that we are      not a nation that scales back its aspirations.  Such grand words for where we are today with ObamaCare. Today the success of the law that now bears his name, ObamaCare, is defined in much more meager terms. Think of all we have been through to this point: the fight over the bill and the extreme legislative means used to pass it through the Congress; the Supreme Court decision that effectively repealed half of the law's coverage. Think of all the changes made to the law through regulation to make sure ObamaCare actually got launched--the postponing of the employer mandate, the postponing of lifetime limits. Think of the impact this law has had on our economy--people losing jobs, people losing the health insurance they currently have because if you like what you have, you may not be able to keep it.  Let's talk about that for a moment. ``If you like what you have, you can keep it.'' This was the promise the President made to the American people on at least 36 separate occasions. It is a great sound bite. It is easy to say. It rolls off the tongue. It is also not true. It was never true. It obviously was not true when the law was written. It was obviously not true when the first proposed regulation came out.  This is what I said on the Senate floor in September of 2010:       Only in the District of Columbia could you get away with      telling the people ``if you like what you have, you can keep      it,'' and then pass regulations 6 months later that do just      the opposite, and figure that people are going to ignore it.  It is not that I have some magic crystal ball. We all knew it. The administration certainly knew the day would come when millions of people would receive cancellation notices. My constituents clearly know that. I heard from many Iowans who found out the hard way that the President made a bunch of pie-in-the-sky promises that he knew he couldn't keep; constituents such as this one from Perry, IA, who wrote to me saying:       My husband and I are farmers. For nine years now we have      bought our own policy. To keep the cost affordable our plan      is a major medical plan with a very high deductible. We      recently received a letter that our plan was going away.      Effective January 1, 2014, it will be updated to comply with      the mandates of ObamaCare.       To manage the risks of much higher premiums, our insurance      company is asking us to cancel our current policy and sign on      at a higher rate effective December 31, 2013 or we could go      to the government exchange.       We did not get to keep our current policy. We did not get      to keep our lower rates. I now have to pay for coverage that      I do not want or will never use. We are not low income that      might qualify for assistance.       We are the small business owner that is trying to live the      American dream. I do not believe in large government that      wants to run my life.  From a constituent living in Mason City:       My wife and I are both 60 years old, and have been covered      by an excellent Wellmark Blue Cross Blue Shield policy for      several years. It is not through my employer. We selected the      plan because it had the features we wanted and needed . . .      our choice. And because we are healthy, we have a preferred      premium rate.       Yesterday, we got a call from our agent explaining that      since our plan is not grandfathered, it will need to be      replaced by the end of 2014. The current plan has a $5,000      deductible and the premium is $511 a month. The best option      going forward for us from Wellmark would cost $955 per month      (a modest 87 percent increase), and have a $10,000      deductible. And because we have been diligent and responsible      in saving for our upcoming retirement, we do not qualify for      any taxpayer-funded subsidies.  These are just two of many letters, emails, and phone calls I have received from Iowans.  Now the issue has turned to cost. Millions of people face rising premiums. The impact is real and undeniable.  Here is another from a constituent from Des Moines:       In 2013, I encountered some medical problems which caused      me to retire early. My spouse works as an adjunct instructor      . . . thus not qualifying for coverage. In 2014, with 4 part-     time jobs between us, we made $44,289 in Adjusted Gross      Income.       Our Obamacare insurance cost $968 per month and after      credits, we paid $478 per month or approximately 13 percent      of our Adjusted Gross Income. In 2015, our Adjusted Gross      Income will be approximately the same, however our Obamacare      insurance jumped to a premium of $1,028.82 and our cost to      $590.12.       The insurance company touted that premiums went up less      than 10 percent, but as you can see, my costs went up 23      percent. The impact to Adjusted Gross Income went to 16      percent, a 23 percent increase. I just received my 2016      premium estimate. Our Adjusted Gross Income is likely to be      the same. Our gross premium is scheduled to rise 36 percent      to nearly $1,400; our cost after the credit is jumping 63      percent and the impact to our Adjusted Gross Income is that      25 percent of our income will be spent on health insurance (a      56 percent increase).  Thousands of Iowans have contacted me asking what can be done. Now that we clearly see that what the President sold the American people was a bag of Washington's best gift-wrapped hot air. All the grandiose talk about the importance of this statute, and what we ultimately have is an optional Medicaid expansion with a glorified high-risk pool and a government portal that makes DMV look efficient.  Finally, I would be remiss if I didn't mention the co-op disaster. The first co-op to fall was Iowa's CoOportunity. CoOportunity enrolled the second most beneficiaries of any co-op in America. CoOportunity knew they were in trouble because they enrolled more than 100,000 people when they were planning for less than 20,000. CoOportunity was in contact with CMS and so was the State of Iowa. CMS chose not to further fund CoOportunity and CoOportunity has since been liquidated. American taxpayers have billions of dollars invested in these co-ops. The taxpayer only gets their money back when co-ops succeed. CMS's stewardship of this program has proven that CoOportunity was not an exception but unfortunately the rule as more and more co-ops have failed.  Americans deserve better. They voted for better. It is time to admit that ObamaCare has not achieved the correct or desired result of an attempt. It has not been a success by any measure, unless, of course, you lower your standard to the point that the mere act of keeping the doors open is a success. How sad is that for all we have been through.  Maybe, just maybe, it is time to admit that the massive restructuring has failed. Partisanship has failed. Perhaps it is time to sit down and consider commonsense, bipartisan steps that we could take to lower the cost and improve quality. Perhaps we could enact alternative reforms aimed at solving America's biggest health care problems, reforms like revising the Tax Code to help individuals who buy their own health insurance, allowing people to purchase health coverage across State lines and form risk pools in the individual market, expanding tax-free health savings accounts, making health care price and quality information more transparent, cracking down on frivolous medical malpractice lawsuits, using high-risk pools to insure folks with preexisting conditions, giving States more freedom to improve Medicaid, and using provider competition and consumer choice to bring down costs in Medicare and throughout the health care delivery system.  The American people need to know that this failed program is not the only answer and we are not scaling back our aspirations. With this vote this week, we once again demonstrate to the American people our willingness to not accept failure and to aim for better. That is what America is all about.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
