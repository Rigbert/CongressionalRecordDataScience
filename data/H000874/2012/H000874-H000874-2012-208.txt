 As I said, one concern we had on our side of the aisle was the riders, many of which we thought were inappropriate. They were adopted, but we did not favor them. The second was, of course, the level of funding. The Appropriations Committee clearly articulated very early in this process they thought the monies available to them under the Ryan constrictions on 302(a) were too low to meet some of the commitments that they had.  First of all, pursuant to what he says the Speaker wants to do and he wants to do, and I think we ought to do--we didn't always get that done lamentably--does the gentleman believe that we're going to have the time to bring each one of the appropriation bills to the floor between now and the August break so that the Senate might consider them and we might consider them individually, as opposed to in some omnibus piece of legislation?  I yield to my friend.
