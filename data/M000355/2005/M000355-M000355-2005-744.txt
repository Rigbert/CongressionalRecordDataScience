 President, I believe there is 15 minutes on the side of the opposition. I think I heard the junior Senator from Florida offer to divide the time with the senior Senator from Florida.  I will take a moment to propose a unanimous-consent request related to several amendments so we can stack these votes for the very near future.  I ask unanimous consent that following debate on the current amendment, the Dorgan amendment, that there then be 5 minutes for Senator Leahy and 5 minutes for Senator Coburn in relation to amendment No. 1241. I further ask unanimous consent that the Senate then proceed to a vote in relation to amendment No. 1242, which is the Coburn-Boxer amendment, on which we have already had debate, to be followed by a vote in relation to amendment No. 1241, which is the Coburn AID amendment, on which we have already had debate, to be followed by a vote in relation to the Dorgan amendment related to TV Marti.
