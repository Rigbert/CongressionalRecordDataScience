 President, today I am introducing a bill to help curtail abuses of government-issued credit cards throughout the Federal Government. I am pleased to join Representative Wilson who is introducing an identical measure in the House today and I thank him for his interest and work on this important issue. I am also very glad to have Senator Byrd co-sponsor my bill. He has been a staunch advocate for improved management of government credit programs and I have been honored to work with him on this issue in the past.  As many of my colleagues are aware, I have been working for several years to expose abuses of government purchase cards and travel cards, starting with the largest user of government charge cards, the Department of Defense. Working with the GAO, former subcommittee Chairman Horn in the House, and others, we have been able to uncover a disturbing number of instances where DOD-issued credit cards have been abused. When I say abused, I mean government credit cards were used to pay for everything from cars to Caribbean cruises.
