 President, I very much enjoyed Thomas Friedman's op-ed in today's New York Times entitled ``Land of Denial.'' I could not agree more with his assertion that Egypt can--and should--be doing more to be a leader in the Arab world.  Egypt is a land of missed opportunities, and it has forfeited its historical place in Middle Eastern history as a progressive and pluralistic country. Friedman points out that while other countries--Jordan, Bahrain, Qatar, and even Tunisia--have forged ahead with democratic, free press, and economic reforms, Egypt ``has been stagnating.''  I could not agree more with Friedman's assertion that ``[t]he intellectual air has gone stale in Egypt from too many years of controlled press and authoritarian politics.''  In the past, I have taken issue with Egypt's cold peace with Israel, its jailing of democracy advocates, its suspicious involvement with North Korean missiles and weapons technicians, and its reckless and irresponsible government-controlled press that fuels extremism on the streets of Cairo and throughout the Arab world.  It is not too late for President Hosni Mubarak to embark on a reform path that will ensure a stable and prosperous Egypt. It is in our interests--as well as those of the Egyptian people--that Mubarak invests in the development of functioning democratic institutions and political processes.  In the supplemental bill I carved out a portion of assistance provided in the Economic Support Fund account for the professional training of Egyptian and other Middle Eastern journalists. I did so because I firmly believe that a free and independent media in Egypt will contribute to our war against terrorism, peace in the region, and the political, legal, and economic development of that country.  The abuses of the government-controlled Egyptian press are legendary, and include personal attacks against Secretary of State Colin Powell and National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice. America has been repeatedly tarred and feathered, Israel vilified, and Hitler criticized for not killing all the Jews ``so that the world could sigh in relief without their evil and sins.''  Such inflammatory nonsense fuels ideological extremism that has repercussions on our shores and throughout the world.  Let me assure my colleagues that in my capacity as ranking member of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, I will continue to examine the assistance America provides to Egypt. I have already suggested to Secretary Powell that we reassess our assistance to Egypt to ensure that it effectively promotes critically needed reforms, and I look forward to working with the administration on this matter.                          ____________________
