Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my Republican colleagues to stop blocking action on the minimum wage. I have said it before and I will say it again here today: Raising the minimum wage is not just an economic issue, it is a moral issue. It is the right thing to do. The time is always right to do right.  The Republicans in Congress will do anything to deny hard-working people a small raise. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Majority Leader, I know you vowed to fight an increase in the minimum wage with every fiber in your being but you cannot fight the will of the American people forever. Now is the time to act. Now is the time, not tomorrow, not next week, but today. One thing is for sure. Come November, working people will remember.
