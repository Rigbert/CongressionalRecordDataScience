 President, reserving the right to object, I think it isperfectly apparent to everyone who is observing this process that these two issues are interconnected in terms of how we fairly go forward, and I think the point has been well made by the 49 Republican Senators over the last year or so that our rights are going to be respected; that we are going to move forward on bipartisan bills, such as both of these, in a way that is respectful to both sides, and as soon as we have an understanding about how we are going to go forward on the stimulus package, then we will be able to make progress on this bill. I am optimistic we are going to be able to do both.  Ironically, I share the goal of the majority leader, which is to finish both these issues this week. You would think that was not the case for all the sparring and finger-pointing that has gone on the past few days, but I have the same goal he does, to finish FISA and the stimulus package. Both of them, at the end of the day, are going to pass on a strong bipartisan basis. But the process for dealing with them is not irrelevant, and that is what we have been discussing off and on for the past couple days. Hopefully, we will make some progress and be able to get going on FISA later today.  For the moment, I object.
