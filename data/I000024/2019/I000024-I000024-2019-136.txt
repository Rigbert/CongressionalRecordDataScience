 For the past 3 months, Mr. Mann has assisted the committee and its members with high-priority work on the fiscal year 2020 National Defense Authorization Act, with a particular focus on issues relating to defense spending and the budget. His contributions to our committee's work have been significant and highly valued by our staff  On behalf of the Senate Committee on Armed Services, I thank Mr. Mann and wish him future success as he continues to support the U.S. Congress and its staff.                          ____________________
