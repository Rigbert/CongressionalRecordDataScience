Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 590, the Advanced Nuclear Technology Development Act of 2017.  This is a bipartisan bill. It passed in the last Congress as well. It was cosponsored and led by Congressmen Latta and McNerney. And it will help American innovators and entrepreneurs develop and license advanced nuclear technologies. The U.S. will require reliable, baseload, and affordable energy in decades to come, and nuclear power has to remain an integral part of our electricity generation portfolio.  Unfortunately, an outdated and rigid regulatory regime will stifle new nuclear technology development. This bill will help modernize the regulatory framework for the 21st century to be adaptive, technology inclusive, and certainly predictable.  Advanced nuclear technologies may provide breakthroughs in safety and efficiency over the existing fleet of nuclear power plants. Absent the proper regulatory framework, our nuclear scientists and industry will look to other parts of the world to construct game-changing nuclear technologies. So the U.S. has to remain a global leader to create and maintain highly-paying and highly-skilled jobs right here at home.  This bill is a step towards ensuring that the NRC has the necessary expertise and the resources to be able to review and license new technologies and reactor designs, while appropriately collaborating with the Department of Energy's nuclear energy research programs and the private sector. With the Federal Government, national labs, universities, and private industry all working together towards a common goal, the future of nuclear industry energy is certainly bright.  In the last Congress, as I mentioned at the beginning, this legislation passed unanimously out of the Energy and Commerce Committee and passed the House by a voice vote. I am pleased to support this legislation again, as part of our efforts to address burdensome regs that stifle economic growth and new technologies. I urge all of my colleagues to support it.  I reserve the balance of my time.         House of Representatives, Committee on Science, Space,            and Technology,                                 Washington, DC, January 23, 2017.     Hon. Greg Walden,     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of          Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing concerning H.R. 590, the      ``Advanced Nuclear Technology Development Act of 2017,''      which was introduced on January 20, 2017.       H.R. 590 contains provisions within the Committee on      Science, Space, and Technology's Rule X jurisdiction. In      order to expedite this bill for floor consideration, the      Committee on Science, Space, and Technology will forego      action on the bill. This is being done on the basis of our      mutual understanding that doing so will in no way diminish or      alter the jurisdiction of the Committee on Science, Space,      and Technology with respect to the appointment of conferees,      or to any future jurisdictional claim over the subject      matters contained in the bill or similar legislation.       I would appreciate your response to this letter confirming      this understanding, and would request that you include a copy      of this letter and your response in the Congressional Record      during the floor consideration of this bill. Thank you in      advance for your cooperation.           Sincerely,                                                      Lamar Smith,     Chairman.                                  ____                                         House of Representatives,                             Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                 Washington, DC, January 23, 2017.     Hon. Lamar Smith,     Chairman, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology,          Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Smith: Thank you for your letter concerning      H.R. 590, Advanced Nuclear Technology Development Act of      2017.       As you noted, H.R. 590 contains provisions within the      Committee on Science, Space, and Technology's Rule X      jurisdiction. I appreciate your willingness to forego action      on the bill in order to expedite this bill for floor      consideration. I agree that doing so will in no way diminish      or alter the jurisdiction of the Committee on Science, Space,      and Technology with respect to the appointment of conferees,      or to any future jurisdictional claim over the subject      matters contained in the bill or similar legislation.       I will place a copy of your letter and this response into      the Congressional Record during the Floor consideration of      this bill.           Sincerely,                                                      Greg Walden,                                                         Chairman.  Ms. DeGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 590, the Advanced Nuclear Technology Development Act of 2017, introduced by Representatives Latta and McNerney.  This bill would enhance coordination between the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Department of Energy by requiring them to enter into a memorandum of understanding on issues related to advanced nuclear reactor technology.  This is a worthy goal, as the chairman said, and is a commonsense way for the Federal Government to support the advanced nuclear power industry. Advanced nuclear technologies have the potential to generate power more safely and with less nuclear waste, which is why I believe the Federal Government should be supporting advancements in nuclear technology.  The bill also requires NRC to develop an advanced reactor regulatory framework to evaluate options to expedite advanced reactor licensing and to make it more predictable. NRC would have 1 year from the date of enactment to submit this plan to Congress. In developing the plan, NRC must also seek input from interested stakeholders, which I believe to be a crucial part of this process.  Nuclear energy must play a continued role in our country's clean energy future to enable us to reach our goals set forth in the Paris climate agreement. I believe the Advanced Nuclear Technology Development Act will enable the Federal Government to more efficiently evaluate and support these promising nuclear technologies, which can put us on a path towards greater reductions in carbon emissions.  I commend both Representatives Latta and McNerney for introducing this important legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support it.  Mr. Speaker, I don't believe we have any further speakers on this, so I yield back the balance of my time.
