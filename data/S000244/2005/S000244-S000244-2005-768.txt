Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 208) recognizing the 50th anniversary of Rosa Louise Parks' refusal to give up her seat on the bus and the subsequent desegregation of American society.  The Clerk read as follows:                            H. Con. Res. 208       Whereas most historians date the beginning of the modern-     day Civil Rights Movement in the United States to December 1,      1955;       Whereas December 1, 1955, is the date of Rosa Louise Parks'      refusal to give up her bus seat to a white man and her      subsequent arrest;       Whereas Rosa Louise Parks was born on February 4, 1913, as      Rosa Louise McCauley to James and Leona McCauley in Tuskegee,      Alabama;       Whereas Rosa Louise Parks was educated in Pine Level,      Alabama, until the age of 11, when she enrolled in the      Montgomery Industrial School for Girls and then went on to      attend the Alabama State Teachers College's High School;       Whereas on December 18, 1932, Rosa Louise McCauley married      Raymond Parks and the two settled in Montgomery, Alabama;       Whereas, together, Raymond and Rosa Parks worked in the      Montgomery, Alabama, branch of the National Association for      the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), where Raymond      served as an active member and Rosa served as a secretary and      youth leader;       Whereas on December 1, 1955, Rosa Louise Parks was arrested      for refusing to give up her seat in the ``colored'' section      of the bus to a white man on the orders of the bus driver      because the ``white'' section was full;       Whereas the arrest of Rosa Louise Parks led African      Americans and others to boycott the Montgomery city bus line      until the buses in Montgomery were desegregated;       Whereas the 381-day Montgomery bus boycott encouraged other      courageous people across the United States to organize in      protest and demand equal rights for all;       Whereas the fearless acts of civil disobedience displayed      by Rosa Louise Parks and others resulted in a legal action      challenging Montgomery's segregated public transportation      system which subsequently led to the United States Supreme      Court, on November 13, 1956, affirming a district court      decision that held that Montgomery segregation codes deny and      deprive African Americans of the equal protection of the laws      (352 U.S. 903);       Whereas, in the years following the Montgomery bus boycott,      Rosa Louise Parks moved to Detroit, Michigan, in 1957, and      continued her civil rights work through efforts that included      working in the office of Congressman John Conyers, Jr., from      1965 until 1988, and starting the Rosa and Raymond Parks      Institute for Self Development, a nonprofit 501(c)(3) that      motivates youth to reach their highest potential, in 1987;       Whereas Rosa Louise Parks has been commended for her work      in the realm of civil rights with such recognitions as the      NAACP's Springarn Medal in 1979, the Martin Luther King, Jr.,      Nonviolent Peace Prize in 1980, the Presidential Medal of      Freedom in 1996, and the Congressional Gold Medal in 1999;      and       Whereas in 2005, the year marking the 50th anniversary of      Rosa Louise Parks' refusal to give up her seat on the bus, we      recognize the courage, dignity, and determination displayed      by Rosa Louise Parks as she confronted injustice and      inequality: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate      concurring), That the Congress--       (1) recognizes and celebrates the 50th anniversary of Rosa      Louise Parks' refusal to give up her seat on the bus and the      subsequent desegregation of American society;       (2) encourages the people of the United States to recognize      and celebrate this anniversary and the subsequent legal      victories that sought to eradicate segregation in all of      American society; and       (3) endeavors to work with the same courage, dignity, and      determination exemplified by civil rights pioneer, Rosa      Louise Parks, to address modern-day inequalities and      injustice.
