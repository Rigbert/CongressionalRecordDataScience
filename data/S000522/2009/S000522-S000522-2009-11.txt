I thank Mr. Gohmert for his, again, very eloquent statement and for his logic, which is so important and sometimes lacking in this august body.  Let me also point out that we have a man who is going to speak next, Mark Souder. Truth in legislating is not a forgotten art, and when people say, as you pointed out, Mr. Gohmert, that the abortion funding in both the public option and in the program that establishes affordability credits couldn't be more clear, there's no ambiguity about it. There is some language that is very, very deceiving that leads people to think it's not in there. And then people say it. The President of the United States suggested that funding for abortion is not in his plan. And, frankly, assuming he was misled by perhaps staff, nothing could be further from the truth.  I would like to yield to a man who offered airtight pro-life language in the committee on which he serves, Education and Labor Committee, to speak, Mr. Souder.
