 President, I rise today to introduce a bill to provide urgently needed relief to federal district courts in California, Hawaii, Kansas, Nebraska, and Ohio.  This bill is supported by both Senators from all five of the States affected Senators Boxer and myself, Senators Brownback and Roberts, Senators Akaka and Inouye, Senators Nelson and Johanns, and Senators Brown and Voinovich.  The bill is identical to a bill passed by the Senate by unanimous consent last year. I hope that my colleagues will move expeditiously to consent to this bill once again.  The bill creates one new temporary judgeship in the Eastern District of California and one in the District of Nebraska, and it extends temporary judgeships in the District of Hawaii, the District of Kansas, and the Northern District of Ohio.  The bill has broad, bipartisan support because the relief it provides is sorely needed. All of these courts face overwhelming caseloads that are leading to judicial burnout and long delays in the administration of justice. The bill, put simply, provides assistance to districts that do not have enough judges to handle the work assigned to them.  I have been concerned about this problem in the Eastern District of California for many years now.  According to statistics provided by the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, the Eastern District's caseload burden is higher, on a sustained basis, than any other district in the country.  In 2008, the judges in the Eastern District handled 968 cases each. That is twice the number of cases that the Judicial Conference recommends. In fact, the Judicial Conference has recommended that Congress create a new judgeship in a district whenever a threshold of 430 cases per judge is reached.  A caseload burden of this magnitude is not only a problem for judges. The people who live in the district and other litigants who appear before the court are also affected.  Victims of crime are forced to endure long waiting periods to see justice done. Citizens find that they are unable to resolve their civil disputes promptly. And plaintiffs face extensive delays in getting damages or restitution for harms that they have suffered.  Currently, people who have cases in the Eastern District court are facing delays of approximately 42 months from filing to verdict. That is three and a half years--twice the national average for federal court delays. This kind of delay is simply unacceptable.  The delays are by no means the fault of the district judges either. By every measure, the judges in the Eastern District are among the most productive in the nation.  In 2008, each of the district's active judges completed 903 cases. In addition to this extraordinary effort, two of the five senior judges carry a full load.  One senior judge has explained that he has not reduced his workload for two reasons: ``[F]irst the district is so short of needed judges that it appears to me unjust to leave those who require a court either to resolve criminal cases or resolve their civil cases; second, I have felt great compassion for my colleagues who would be left with a still more unmanageable case load if I left or even cut down on my load.''  In California, the overwhelming burden on the Eastern District court is no secret. This past summer, the Chief Judge of the Ninth Circuit called on all judges in the Circuit--district and circuit judges alike--to volunteer to hear 15 cases in the Eastern District each. Although 84 federal judges generously stepped forward to relieve the District of more than 1,000 cases, thousands of cases remain pending.  The Eastern District of California should not be forced to rely on temporary assistance from judges from other districts. Each court needs enough judges to handle its caseload in a reasonably timely manner.  Although not sufficient, one temporary district judgeship would provide much needed relief to the hardworking judges of the Eastern District and the litigants who come before them. Based on last year's filings, one new judgeship would reduce the filings per judge from 968 to 572.  Congress has not authorized a new permanent judgeship for the district since 1978. In 1992, a temporary judgeship was authorized, but that judgeship expired in 2004. Last year, a bill that I co-sponsored--the Federal Judgeship Act of 2008--would have provided four new permanent judgeships, but that bill stalled before the full Senate after being favorably reported out of the Judiciary Committee.  This bill was introduced by Senator Leahy last year, and I want to thank him for all of his work on its behalf. The bill passed the Senate by unanimous consent. This year, the need is only greater, as caseloads have only increased.  I urge my colleagues to consent to this bill once again, and to do so in an expeditious manner.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 193       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. TEMPORARY JUDGESHIPS FOR DISTRICT COURTS.       (a) Additional Temporary Judgeships.--       (1) In general.--The President shall appoint, by and with      the advice and consent of the Senate--       (A) 1 additional district judge for the eastern district of      California; and       (B) 1 additional district judge for the district of      Nebraska.       (2) Vacancies not filled.--The first vacancy in the office      of district judge in each of the offices of district judge      authorized by this subsection, occurring 10 years or more      after the confirmation date of the judge named to fill the      temporary district judgeship created in the applicable      district by this subsection, shall not be filled.       (b) Extension of Certain Temporary Judgeships.--Section      203(c) of the Judicial Improvements Act of 1990 (Public Law      101-650; 28 U.S.C. 133 note) is amended--       (1) in the second sentence, by inserting ``the district of      Hawaii,'' after ``Pennsylvania,'';       (2) in the third sentence (relating to the district of      Kansas), by striking ``17 years'' and inserting ``26 years'';       (3) in the fifth sentence (relating to the northern      district of Ohio), by striking ``17 years'' and inserting      ``25 years''; and       (4) by inserting ``The first vacancy in the office of      district judge in the district of Hawaii occurring 20 years      or more after the confirmation date of the judge named to      fill the temporary judgeship created under this subsection      shall not be filled.'' after the sixth sentence.                                 ______                                       By
