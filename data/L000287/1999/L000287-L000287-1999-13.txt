Mr. Speaker, I rise today with great concern. I am deeply concerned that millions of Americans are without health care. I am concerned that parents cannot afford to take their sick children to see a doctor. Too many of us are more worried about insurance companies than patients' care. We are more concerned with managing liability than caring for those who are sick and weak.  This is not just, this is not right, this is not fair. Access to health care is a right.  Mr. Speaker, we need to pass a meaningful Patients' Bill of Rights. We need a bill that will hold insurance companies responsible. We need a bill that will give patients the right to sue in State courts.                              {time}  1615  We need to do what is right. Let us not jeopardize this remarkable opportunity we have worked so hard and so long to build. My colleagues, the people of America are counting on all of us.  Mr. Speaker, let us work together to pass one of the most important health care bills in our lifetime. Now is the time, not next year, not next month or next week, but now is the time to pass a Patients' Bill of Rights, without poison pills.  Let us do what is right. Do it for the American people. Do it for the 40 million without any health insurance, without health care. Pass this bill for the people. Pass the Dingell-Norwood bill.
