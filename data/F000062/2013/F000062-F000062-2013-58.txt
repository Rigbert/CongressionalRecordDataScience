  Ladies and gentlemen, tobacco is not just another crop. It is the largest preventable cause of cancer deaths in this country. Exactly 443,000 people die every year. It costs Medicaid an additional $22 billion.  In 2004 a special assessment of $9.6 billion was authorized to buy out tobacco farms in the United States. That has 1 more year to run.  We subsidize tobacco crop insurance. We should not. This country should become tobacco-free. It will save lives.  I urge you to support this amendment.
