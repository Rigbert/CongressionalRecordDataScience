Mr. Speaker, I offer an amendment to the preamble.  The Clerk read as follows:       Amendment to the preamble offered by Mr. Smith of New      Jersey:       Strike the preamble and insert the following:       Whereas on March 6, 2001, an explosion at the Fanglin      elementary school in the Jianxi province of the People's      Republic of China's killed at least 42 people, including 37      children;       Whereas the children, all between the ages of 9 and 11,      were being forced by elementary school officials to      manufacture fireworks when this tragedy occurred;       Whereas the parents of the deceased children report that      the mandatory labor, which involved mounting fuses and      detonators into large firecrackers, had been a daily practice      at the school for years;       Whereas this systematic exploitation of children in the      elementary school was not only known about but actually      organized by individuals holding official responsibilities      with the local Chinese Government; and       Whereas Chinese Prime Minister Zhu Rongji has taken the      important step of acknowledging these violations of      internationally recognized labor standards: Now, therefore,      be it
