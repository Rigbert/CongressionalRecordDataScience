 These violations include: extrajudicial killings, rape and other forms of violence persistently carried out by members of the armed forces, the continued use of torture, political arrests, forced and child labor, and systematic use of child soldiers.  While the Commission's action is welcomed, it is not enough. The United Nations Security Council must discuss and debate the immediate regional threats that country poses to its neighbors--whether from illicit narcotics, HIV/AIDS, trafficked and internally displaced persons, or refugees.  I am dismayed that both China and India reportedly objected to an ``unbalanced approach'' in the Commission's action against Burma.  In my view, India can--and should--play a catalytic role in fostering change in Burma. I would remind India that such objections serve only to tarnish its image as the world's largest democracy, and send the wrong message to Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, Nobel Peace Laureate and recipient of India's Jawaharlal Nehru Award for International Understanding. India should, as it did in the past, stand firmly with Burma's democrats and work to foster reconciliation between the National League for Democracy, ethnic nationalities and the illegal military junta.  On a separate matter, I want to recognize Ms. Cindy Chang in the State Department's Bureau of Legislative Affairs. Cindy works closely with the State/Foreign Operations Subcommittee, which I chair, and I want the Secretary of State to know how ably Cindy represents that Department's--and the President's--interests on the Hill. She is a star in that Bureau.                          ____________________[Page S3645]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                                 BURMA  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, the United Nations Human Rights Commission adopted a resolution expressing concern with the ``ongoing systematic violation of human rights'' of the Burmese people. These violations include: extrajudicial killings, rape and other forms of violence persistently carried out by members of the armed forces, the continued use of torture, political arrests, forced and child labor, and systematic use of child soldiers.  While the Commission's action is welcomed, it is not enough. The United Nations Security Council must discuss and debate the immediate regional threats that country poses to its neighbors--whether from illicit narcotics, HIV/AIDS, trafficked and internally displaced persons, or refugees.
