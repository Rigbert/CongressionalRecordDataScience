President, I am once again delighted to join my colleague, Senator Patty Murray, to introduce the Military and Veteran Caregiver Services Improvement Act of 2017. Our bill would greatly expand eligibility for VA caregiver support services by including veterans from all eras, allow veterans to transfer their post 9/11 GI bill benefits to their dependents, expand eligibility for the VA caregivers program to include a wider range of injuries that may have previously gone unrecognized, and provide crucial support for our Nation's caregivers themselves.  In 2014, my former colleague and friend, Senator Elizabeth Dole, commissioned a study by the RAND Corporation to learn more about the military caregiver population and explore common issues experienced by America's caregivers. The experts at RAND found that those caring for our servicemembers and veterans provide nearly $14 billion worth of unpaid services every year--an incredible cost that would otherwise be passed on to the Nation.  There are more than 5.5 million military caregivers in the United States, and of those, 1.1 million are caring for post-9/11 veterans. These are spouses, parents, children, and other loved ones who have voluntarily put their lives on hold to provide our returning servicemembers with a trusted continuum of care that could not be replicated without them. Many of them will provide this care for years, if not decades, to come.  Tragically, caring for those suffering from the scars of war takes an enormous toll. According to the RAND study, military caregivers face increased instances of mental and physical health problems, chronic absenteeism from work, deteriorating personal relationships, legal and financial troubles, and feelings of isolation. These difficulties are often more pronounced for post-9/11 military caregivers.  Our Nation owes America's veterans our deepest gratitude. Their sacrifices are often very visible. In many cases our veterans have earned medals or awards for their bravery that they can wear proudly on their chest. But our military and veteran caregivers truly are hidden heroes, serving alongside our veterans to provide the love, care, and support they need. Despite their enormous sacrifice, these hidden heroes often do not receive the awards and admiration. That does not mean that they don't deserve it. We must honor our commitment to veterans by answering the call to better support those caring for our wounded, ill, and injured warriors.  Our legislation would help strengthen the services offered to caregivers.The Military and Veteran Caregiver Services Improvement Act is an important step in helping those who have assumed the mantle of caring for the men and women who have served our Nation so honorably. I urge all of my colleagues to join Senator Murray and me in honoring and supporting our Nation's military caregivers.                                 ______                                       By
