 President, this need not be a lengthy debate. I would be more than happy to yield back whatever time I may have left if the Senator from South Carolina would like to do the same. We have been over this turf before.  I want to commend the Senator from South Carolina for understanding and realizing that all of the campaign finance reform bills we have dealt with in recent years have been unconstitutional. So at least the Senator from South Carolina understands that the proposals that have been kicking around here for the last 5 or 6 years clearly trash the first amendment.  But I would say where I differ with the Senator from South Carolina is not in his judgment about the fact that the campaign finance reform bills that we have dealt with were unconstitutional --and they clearly were--but the Senator now says we ought to amend the first amendment. We ought to change the first amendment to the Constitution for the first time in 200 years.  And by suggesting that, Mr. President, my good friend from South Carolina has managed to come up with a proposal that even Common Cause is against and the Washington Post is against. So we have two entities that have been in the forefront of calling for campaign finance reform. Common Cause, a leading outside interest group, special interest group, advocating a campaign finance reform, says amending the first amendment is a bad idea, so they oppose the Hollings proposal. And the Washington Post, which has clearly been interested in seeing a campaign finance reform bill, also opposes amending the first amendment.  So Mr. President, I would submit a letter of a few years back by Common Cause opposing the Hollings constitutional amendment and ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                 Common Cause,                                   Washington, DC, March 23, 1988.       Dear Senator: The Senate is expected to consider shortly      S.J. Res. 21, a proposed amendment to the Constitution to      give Congress the power to enact mandatory limits on      expenditures in campaigns. Common Cause urges you not to      support S.J. Res. 21.       The fundamental problems caused by the massive growth in      spending for congressional elections and by special interest      PAC giving demand effective and expeditious solution. The      Senate recently came within a handful of votes of achieving      this goal. For the first time since the Watergate period, a      majority of Senators went on record in support of      comprehensive campaign finance reform legislation, including      a system of spending limits for Senate races. It took an      obstructionist filibuster by a minority of Senators to block      the bill from going forward.       The Senate now stands within striking distance of enacting      comprehensive legislation to deal with the urgent problems      that confront the congressional campaign finance system. The      Senate should not walk away from or delay this effort. But      that is what will happen if the Senate chooses to pursue a      constitutional amendment, an inherently lengthy and time-     consuming process.       S.J. Res. 21, the proposed constitutional amendment, would      not establish expenditure limits in campaigns; it would only      empower the Congress to do so. Thus even if two-thirds of the      Senate and the House should pass S.J. Res. 21 and three-     quarters of the states were to ratify the amendment, it would      then still be necessary for the Senate and the House to pass      legislation to establish spending limits in congressional      campaigns.       Yet it is this very issue of whether there should be      spending limits in congressional       [[Page S2630]] campaigns that has been at the heart of the      recent legislative battle in the Senate. Opponents of S. 2,      the Senatorial Election Campaign Act, made very clear that      their principal objection was the establishment of any      spending limits in campaigns.       So even assuming a constitutional amendment were to be      ratified, after years of delay the Senate would find itself      right back where it is today--in a battle over whether there      should be spending limits in congressional campaigns. In the      interim, it is almost certain that nothing would have been      done to deal with the scandalous congressional campaign      finance system.       There are other serious questions that need to be      considered and addressed by anyone who is presently      considering supporting S.J. Res. 21.       For example, what are the implications if S.J. Res. 21      takes away from the federal courts any ability to determine      that particular expenditure limits enacted by Congress      discriminate against or otherwise violate the constitutional      rights of challengers?       What are the implications, if any, of narrowing by      constitutional amendment the First Amendment rights of      individuals as interpreted by the Supreme Court?       We believe that campaign finance reform legislation must      continue to be a top priority for the Senate as it has been      in the 100th Congress. If legislation is not passed this      year, it should be scheduled for early action in the Senate      and the House in 1989.       In conclusion, Common Cause strongly urges the Senate to      face up to its institutional responsibilities to reform the      disgraceful congressional campaign finance system. The Senate      should enact comprehensive legislation to establish a system      of campaign spending limits and aggregate PAC limits, instead      of pursuing a constitutional amendment that will delay      solving this fundamental problem for years and then still      leave Congress faced with the need to pass legislation to      limit campaign spending.           Sincerely,                                                  Fred Wertheimer,                                                        President.  Mr. McCONNELL. And also, an editorial in the Washington Post also opposing the Hollings constitutional amendment. I ask unanimous consent that the editorial be printed in the Record, as well.  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Washington Post, Apr. 6, 1988]                            Campaign Spinach       Sen. Ernest Hollings was not an admirer of S. 2, the sturdy      bill his fellow Democrats tried to pass to limit      congressional campaign spending by setting up a system of      partial public finance. He agreed to vote for cloture, to      break a Republican filibuster, only after Majority Leader      Robert Byrd agreed to bring up a Hollings constitutional      amendment if cloture failed. Mr. Byrd, having lost on S. 2,      is now about to do that.       Right now Congress can't just limit spending and be done      with it; the Supreme Court says such legislation would      violate the First Amendment. Limits can only be imposed      indirectly--for example, as a condition for receipt of public      campaign funds. The Hollings amendment would cut through this      thick spinach by authorizing Congress to impose limits      straightaway. The limits are enticing, but the constitutional      amendment is a bad idea. It would be an exception to the free      speech clause, and once that clause is breached for one      purpose, who is to say how many others may follow? As the      American Civil Liberties Union observed in opposing the      measure, about the last thing the country needs is ``a second      First Amendment.''       The free speech issue arises in almost any effort to      regulate campaigns, the fundamental area of free expression      on which all others depend. There has long been the feeling      in and out of Congress--which we emphatically share--that      congressional campaign spending is out of hand. Congress      tried in one of the Watergate reforms to limit both the      giving and the spending of campaign funds. The Supreme Court      in its Buckley v. Valeo decision in 1976 drew a rather      strained distinction between these two sides of the campaign      ledger. In a decision that let it keep a foot in both camps--     civil liberties and reform--it said Congress could limit      giving but not spending (except in the context of a system of      public finance). In the first case the court found that ``the      governmental interest in preventing corruption and the      appearance of corruption'' outweighed the free speech      considerations, while in the second case it did not.       Mr. Hollings would simplify the matter, but at considerable      cost. His amendment said, in a recent formulation: ``The      Congress may enact laws regulating the amounts of      contributions and expenditures intended to affect elections      to federal offices.'' But that's much too vague, and so are      rival amendments that have been proposed. Ask yourself what      expenditures of a certain kind in an election year are not      ``intended to affect'' the outcome? At a certain point in the      process, just about any public utterance is.       Nor would the Hollings amendment be a political solution to      the problem. Congress would still have to vote the limits,      and that is what the Senate balked at this time around.       As Buckley v. Valeo demonstrates, this is a messy area of      law. The competing values are important; they require a      balancing act. The Hollings amendment, in trying instead to      brush the problem aside, is less a solution than a dangerous      show. The Senate should vote it down.  Mr. McCONNELL. So, Mr. President, what the Senator from South Carolina is proposing here is that not only the Federal Government but State governments, reading from the amendment, ``have the power to set reasonable limits on expenditures made in support of or in opposition to the nomination or election of any person to Federal office.''  Now, Mr. President, it should not be a surprise to anyone that the American Civil Liberties Union also thinks this is a terrible idea. Not only do they think it is a terrible idea with regard to the power that would be granted to limit speech of candidates, the provision I just made reference to, which said ``in support of or in opposition to the nomination or election of any person to Federal office,'' but would also give to the Congress the power to do the following.  And, Mr. President, I read from an opinion of the American Civil Liberties Union, which says:  ``Finally, as an amendment subsequent to the First Amendment, the existing understandings about the protection of freedom of the press would also be changed''--freedom of the press would also be changed--``thereby empowering Congress to regulate what newspapers and broadcasters can do on behalf of the candidates they endorse or oppose. A candidate-centered editorial, as well as op-ed articles or commentary, are certainly expenditures in support of or in opposition to political candidates. The amendment, as its words make apparent,'' says the American Civil Liberties Union, ``would authorize Congress to set reasonable limits on the involvement of the media in campaigns when not strictly reporting the news. Such a result would be intolerable in a society that relishes a free press.''  So the proposal we have before us, Mr. President, first, amends the first amendment for the first time in history. And many people feel that is not a good idea; that the first amendment has served us well.  The second manages to draw the opposition of even the principal advocates of campaign finance reform, Common Cause and the Washington Post, and, also, Mr. President, even though this issue in the past was quite partisan--most Republicans opposing it, most Democrats supporting it--the following Senators on the other side of the aisle voted against this proposal when it was last offered in May 1993.  I want to commend those Senators publicly for respecting the first amendment, for agreeing--although they like the idea of a campaign finance reform bill--with Members that amending the Constitution of the United States, amending the first amendment for the first time in history, was a terrible idea. Senator Boxer agreed with that proposition, Senator Kerrey of Nebraska, Senator Kohl, Senator Leahy, Senator Mikulski, Senator Moynihan, Senator Pell, and Senator Rockefeller, all, even though I know they basically supported the various campaign finance reform bills proposed by those on the other side of the aisle, agreed with this Senator and the ACLU and Common Cause and the Washington Post that amending the first amendment to the U.S. Constitution for the first time in history was a terrible idea.  So, Mr. President, at the appropriate time I will be making a motion to table, and I hope that Senators will certainly agree that no matter how they may feel about passing some kind of campaign finance reform bill or another--and we certainly have had our differences on that issue--no matter how they may feel about that, it is not a good idea to amend the Constitution, to amend the first amendment to the Constitution for the first time in history.  Now, with regard to the Buckley case on the question of whether spending is speech, the Supreme Court was clear. My recollection was that eight out of nine members of the Supreme Court said spending is speech. So there is not any question that this is an amendment about speech. No matter whether some Senators wish spending were not speech or not, the Supreme Court has said that spending is speech. So no matter how much some Senators may  [[Page S2631]] wish that the Court had not said that, no matter how much some Senators wish the Buckley case was decided otherwise, the fact of the matter is the Supreme Court has said spending is speech.  So this amendment, Mr. President, is about amending the first amendment to the Constitution for the first time in history. So I hope that this will be defeated on a bipartisan basis, because it is really quite a terrible idea.  Mr. President, I will retain the remainder of my time should I need it, and I yield the floor at this point.
