Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, in response to the gentleman, I support the nonlethal research that was going on at that facility. That is good research. The gentleman's State does not draw hardly any funds from the lethal predator control program. In fact, out of the $10 million spent in the western United States, his State only took $106,000. So Washington is being progressive.  Mr. Chairman, I support the nonlethal, but that is not what this debate is about. The gentleman is off the point. This debate is about $10 million for ineffective, subsidized, indiscriminate lethal predator control, first response by Federal employees on private ranches for private profit. I do not know how to say it any more plainly than that.  It is not about developing alternatives. There is plenty of money left in the budget to develop alternatives. There is plenty of money left to develop the programs that the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur) reported. What we cut is $10 million, the subsidized funds, used for lethal predator control.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. Brown).  (
