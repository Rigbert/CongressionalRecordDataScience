Speaker, it is with deep sadness and great respect that I take this time to remember one of Northwest Indiana's most beloved citizens, former Hobart Mayor Margaret Kuchta. Mayor Kuchta, who was very much committed to making improvements within the City of Hobart and improving the quality of life for its residents, devoted a lifetime of service to her community. Margaret was very well known throughout Northwest Indiana and will truly be missed. Margaret passed away on Thursday, February 23, 2012, but her legacy will continue to live on in the hearts of those she served.  Margaret Kuchta's service in an official capacity began when she was elected clerk-treasurer for the City of Hobart, a position she held from 1976 to 1987. Margaret then served as Hobart's first elected female mayor from 1988 to 1991. Following her tenure as mayor, Mrs. Kuchta remained an active member of the community and later served as councilwoman for the fifth district from 1996 to 2000, as well as a member of the Hobart Township Board from 2002 to 2010. At the time of Mrs. Kuchta's election to the city council, she established her place in Hobart's history as the only person to hold all three elected offices: council member, clerk-treasurer, and mayor. Mrs. Kuchta was also a part of many other organizations and boards, dedicating her life to making a difference in the lives of others. Mrs. Kuchta is remembered as a great leader and committed volunteer, but many also recall her as a mentor and trusted political advisor.  When I began my public career I had few resources and minimal chances of success. Margaret did not care, and her encouragement, tireless effort, and strong public support in the face of great opposition is one reason I am able to address you today as a Member of Congress.  The kindness Margaret showed to me as a friend is illustrative of her caring heart and lifetime of devotion to improving the lives of others; sometimes very privately for one individual or family, sometimes very publically for many, but always selflessly. Each of us, our community, and our nation, are enriched because Margaret Kuchta walked among us.  Margaret is survived by her beloved sons: Robert, Richard, and Michael. She also leaves behind seven beautiful grandchildren, six great-grandchildren, and many other dear friends and family.  Mr. Speaker, I respectfully ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in remembering the great life of Mrs. Margaret Kuchta. Her dedication to the people of her community and the city of Hobart is inspirational and most worthy of our admiration and Northwest Indiana will forever be grateful for all that she has done.                          ____________________
