 President, reserving the right to object, let me just say that the spending bill that this has now been attached to may take months--into the fall or even into the winter months--before it is approved. The Zika virus isn't going to wait for the winter months. The mosquitoes are here now, and they will continue to move very rapidly across the country, as our leader has outlined before. So taking it out of this bill--it has now been approved by a number of Senators on a bipartisan basis--and moving it quickly to the House and getting it to the President's desk means they will have the resources as quickly as possible to deal with this and to begin to deal with this in a responsible way.  Secondly, let me just say that the request that the Senator from Texas has just broached means that we are going to have to fight over cuts--cuts to women, cuts to families, cuts to critical health care efforts in order to fight the Zika virus. That is objectionable. This is an emergency supplemental, as we agreed to yesterday, and it needs to move forward that way. So I object.
