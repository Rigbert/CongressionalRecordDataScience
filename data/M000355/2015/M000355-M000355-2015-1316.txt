 President, yesterday's House passage of the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act represents a vital ray of hope for the countless victims of modern slavery who need our help. Victims groups and advocates tell us that this human rights legislation would provide unprecedented support to domestic victims of trafficking. They urged Congress to pass it.  We can now say that we have passed it. We can now say that hope is on the way for the victims who suffer in the shadows. Unfortunately, the victims of modern-day slavery had to wait entirely too long for help.  Last Congress, the House of Representatives did its job by passing several pieces of legislation, but the Senate failed to bring any trafficking legislation to the floor.  As a new majority, Senate Republicans were determined to make this matter a priority. Senator Grassley promptly reported legislation out of the Judiciary Committee, and we quickly put it on the Senate floor.  As we all know by now, there was an unforeseen--to put it mildly--impediment to getting this bill done. But we were determined to see this legislation through to successful completion. Success was possible because the new majority kept its focus on facts, substance, and good policy for the people who remained our focus throughout the debate, and that is the victims of modern slavery.  I could not be more grateful to Senator Cornyn for his outstanding work on this issue. I thank the House for passing such an important human rights bill yesterday. Now I urge the President to sign this legislation from the new Congress as quickly as possible. The victims of such terrible abuse have had to wait entirely too long for Washington's help. Let's not make them wait a moment longer.                          ____________________
