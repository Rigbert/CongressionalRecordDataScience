President, the Burlington Free Press recently published a profile of Alan Newman, a habitual entrepreneur who has be the genius and force behind a number of companies established in and around Burlington, VT. Anyone who has met Alan is immediately embraced by his creative exuberance. That creativity combined with his unique vision and style create a special brew that has resulted in an incredible run of establishing successful companies.  I wish to recognize Alan for his accomplishments and I ask that a copy of the entire Burlington Free Press article be printed in the Record.                  [Burlington Free Press, Dec. 8, 2008]                          Alan Newman Opens Up                            (By Dan McLean)        South Burlington.--Alan Newman, co-founder and president      of Magic Hat Brewing Co., has helped create about a half-     dozen Vermont-based companies. During his decades of building      businesses, he has learned where he excels--and when he has      reached his limit.       ``My skill appears to be starting and growing businesses,''      including building a brand and a culture for the company,      Newman said. When businesses hit about $7.5 million in annual      revenue and reach about 50 employees, Newman says he has      arrived at his ``level of incompetence.''       Newman said he reached that modified Peter Principle with      Magic Hat about six years ago. Newman said if he remains at      the helm after a company has hit that threshold, ``the      organization starts to fall apart.''       ``We started having trouble shipping things that people had      ordered. Communication within staff starts to falter.      Planning doesn't happen properly,'' he said. ``As you hit a      certain size, you need a little more discipline. You need a      little more management. That's where I start not performing      well.''       ``I'm really an opportunity junkie,'' Newman said. ``I'm      very good at seeing opportunities and going for them . . .      but at some point you need to stop chasing every possibility      and focus on a plan.''       That's where Martin Kelly comes in. Kelly served as CEO of      Magic Hat and is now CEO of Magic Hat's parent company,      Independent Brewers United Inc., which was formed when Magic      Hat bought Seattle-based Pyramid Breweries Inc. last spring      for $35 million.       Newman said Kelly has been a crucial part of the operation      during the past few years. ``I create chaos and he tries to      control it,'' he said.       Newman is president of Magic Hat, but prefers his informal      title, ``conductor of cosmic symphonies.'' ``       That's really my title,'' he said.       Newman, who had a hand in the creation of Gardeners Supply      Co., Seventh Generation and Magic Hat, says he has no secret      to starting successful ventures.       ``I really don't. It really started by accident,'' Newman      said in an interview in his office located in a modestly      appointed trailer, named Sweet Lillian, next to the South      Burlington brewery.       ``I was sick and tired of getting fired,'' he said,      recalling his time in Vermont in the mid-1970s. ``I just      figured I better figure out how to support myself if I wanted      to stay in Vermont. I just kind of followed my nose.        ``I irritate people. I'm really not a good employee. I'm      highly insubordinate,'' he said, explaining that starting a      business was a better option than working for someone else.      ``It's been a constant theme in my life and career.'' Newman      insists he is in an unlikely executive.       ``Honestly,'' he said, wearing bright-yellow glasses and a      tie-dye shirt. ``There is nothing in my background. I never      had any interest in business. I never had any interest in      starting businesses.       ``I've never taken a business course in my life,'' he said,      downplaying the importance of an MBA. ``I'm not an education-     driven guy. I believe in experience.''       Newman, 62, was born in Brooklyn and grew up on Long      Island. He attended Long Island University with a major in      psychology and minors in sociology and English. ``I have      always been interested in culture. I grew up in the '60s.''       Newman said his strengths are creating culture, branding      and a vision for the companies.       ``The business, to me, is secondary. I'm more interested in      painting pictures,'' he said. A crucial part of forming a      company's ``painting'' is culture and philosophy. ``It's      never been about making money.''       ``It's about trying to create a picture, trying to create a      culture and trying to marry them. This is kind of what I do      know,'' he said.       For Magic Hat that philosophy is: ``to be a good neighbor      in our community,'' he said.       Magic Hat, he said, assists a series of nonprofits      including Vermont Cares, Committee on Temporary Shelter and      The Women's Rape Crisis Center. ``That's the part I get      addicted to,'' he said.       ``I make things more complicated'' by connecting events      with charities, he said. The Women's Rape Crisis Center, for      example, gets about $20,000 from the annual Mardi Gras      parade, which Magic Hat created in the mid-1990s.       Not all of Newman's ventures have been a success.       But he said he learns lessons--the best lessons--from the      failures.       He and a friend created a yacht time-sharing company,      Highland International in Hanksville, in the late 1970s.      Highland International never generated any revenue. Newman      and his partner burned through $300,000 of seed money in      about 18 months. Reflecting on the business misfire, Newman      said he should have purchased one boat with the funds,      instead of trying to leverage it into millions. Lesson      learned: proceed slowly.       Another one of Newman's business mistakes was Magic Hat's      Ale of the Living Dead, a garlic beer.       One of the bottles sits on Newman's desk. The beer, he      said, was often returned as ``undrinkable.'' The lesson with      the garlic beer: ``Don't let me drive recipe creation.''       The acquisition of Pyramid gives Magic Hat the potential to      place its bottles of brew on shelves in many more states.      Magic Hat is sold in 18 states now, mostly on the East Coast.      Pyramid's beers are sold in 28 states.       Newman said they had no choice but to expand Magic Hat      because the company ``had already passed through the overhead      level where small could work.''       Newman said the idea for Magic Hat emerged in 1993 with co-     founder Bob Johnson. The next year the pair were making beer      on Flynn Avenue in Burlington. After three years, Magic Hat      moved to a larger operation in South Burlington. When Magic      Hat left Flynn Avenue, 6,000 barrels were being brewed a      year. This year, Magic Hat will brew about 130,000 barrels at      the South Burlington location, Newman said. A barrel is 31      gallons.       Not including brew pubs, there are 300 to 400      microbreweries in the U.S. fighting for a 5 percent share of      the beer market, Newman said.       ``In order to be a survivor, we think you have to get      bigger. You can't stay small,'' he said.       Perhaps, recalling the lessons learned from his failed      yacht time-share company decades ago, when he learned to      ``start small and grow,'' Newman said Magic Hat's expansion      ``will be slow and methodical.''                          ____________________
