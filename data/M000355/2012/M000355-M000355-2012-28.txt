  The reason I shouldn't have to repeat this is because the President himself has been running around the country for 2 years saying any agreement has to be balanced--meaning both revenue and cuts. This was the message he ran on, and it also happens to be one that the overwhelming majority of Americans actually support, especially the part about cuts, which more than three-fourths say they support. If you heard some of the wasteful projects I detailed yesterday, you would see why.  I don't think there is a single person outside of Washington who doesn't think we waste massive amounts of money in this town and who doesn't wonder why it is so hard for us to agree to cut back. Yet now, with the election behind him, President Obama is suddenly silent on the need for spending cuts. He keeps talking about balance. That polls well, but when it comes to specific cuts he is largely silent. All of a sudden it is all tax hikes all the time. Forget balance. Just raise taxes and spend even more.  The President and his allies have taken so many things off the table, the only thing left is the varnish. The President now seems to think, after his reelection, if all he talks about is the need for tax hikes and that is all reporters write about, we will all magically forget the part about needing balance. It is a classic bait-and-switch, and we are seeing new versions of it nearly every day now.  Democrats campaigned for 2 years saying we needed to take a balanced approach to our problems. Yet now that the President has been reelected, they are walking back, and the only thing left are the taxes. What the President should be doing after his reelection is bringing people together and showing that he has the desire and the ability to lead the two parties to an agreement that is good for the economy and good for the country.  So far, at least, he has chosen a different path--a path aimed at pleasing the most partisan elements of his base. A month after his reelection and weeks before the fiscal cliff, he would still rather campaign than cooperate. We will find out this week if he has the will to change paths and get something done or just double down on the campaigning.  Look, the election is over. The President may enjoy these political rallies, but it is time to get serious. The American people are gravely concerned about the Nation's future. They are counting on us to prevent the kind of crisis that we have seen unfolding all across Europe.  Republicans have engaged in these discussions in good faith. We have agreed to make tough choices. The question is, Where is the President? Where is the President? Where is the only man in the country who can make it happen?  Well, it appears that with just a couple weeks left to resolve this crisis, he is busy moving the goal posts. Instead of leading as he was elected to do, he is out campaigning and playing games with the Nation's future.  So my sincere plea this morning is that the President get serious; that he put the campaign behind him and lead. If he does, he will have willing partners. The first sign is seriousness--seriousness about spending cuts.                             Olympia Snowe  Madam President, yesterday I began the difficult task of saying an early good-bye to now six Members of our conference who will be leaving the Senate at the end of the year. This morning I would like to say a few words about my friend and longtime colleague, Senator Snowe.  She has devoted the last 40 years of her life to serving the people of Maine. It has been an honor to work alongside this remarkable woman for the last 18 years and to see up close her tenacity and tough-mindedness in the service of her constituents. Some have described Senator Snowe's advocacy for Mainers as ferocious, and I think there are few better examples of that than the fight she waged on behalf of Maine after the BRAC recommendations of 2005.  When the list of targeted facilities came out, Senator Snowe mounted what has been described as a relentless months-long campaign akin to a defense at a trial. She marshaled all the data and the best arguments. When decision day finally arrived, not only were two of the three Maine facilities told to remain open, one of them was actually expanded. It is stories such as this that help explain why Olympia's constituents keep sending her back to Washington by such wide margins and why so many were shocked to hear that she would be leaving at the end of the year.  As one shipyard worker in Portsmouth whose job she helped save put it:       We love her, and she loves us. [And] I can't recall ever      saying that publicly about a U.S. Senator, but truly she's      such a wonderful person.  As Senator Snowe will tell you, many of her political views solidified during her modest Maine upbringing. Her parents ran a diner near Augusta. While they didn't have much, her father was adamant she receive a good education. So much so that he was dismayed to learn her kindergarten only lasted half the day. ``He was convinced,'' she once said, ``that I was getting off on the wrong foot.''  It was at school that Olympia first discovered her passion for politics. At St. Basil's Academy, a Greek Orthodox girls' school she attended until she was 15, she won her first election--as dorm president. She later graduated from Edward Little High School in Auburn, ME, and subsequently attended the University of Maine where, in 1969, she earned a degree in political science. It was also in college that she met Peter Snowe. Peter shared Olympia's passion for politics. They married shortly after graduation. In 1972, Peter was elected to the State legislature, while Olympia went to work as a legislative staffer for Maine Congressman Bill Cohen.  The young couple seemed well on their way to building a life together, but in 1973, in the midst of a winter snowstorm, tragedy struck. Peter was killed in a car crash, and at a still young age Olympia was left to build a life for herself.  What could have marked the end of her political aspirations became a new beginning instead. As Olympia once put it, she resolved to ``make a positive out of a terrible negative.'' She ran for office in the special election held to fill her late husband's seat, and she won. It was the start of a long and distinguished career in public service.  Olympia was subsequently reelected to the Maine House in 1974 and elected to the Maine Senate in 1976. In 1978, when Bill Cohen, her friend and former boss, ran for the U.S. Senate, she ran for his seat in the House of Representatives and won again.  At the age of 31, she was at the time the youngest Republican woman ever elected to Congress and 1 of just 16 women in the House. Olympia served eight terms in the House. She was a member of the House Budget Committee, the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and the former House Select Committee on Aging. Working with an Arizona lawyer named Jon Kyl and a Mississippi whip named Trent Lott, she helped turn minority Republicans into a potent legislative force, ensuring some of the biggest legislative victories of the Reagan era.  It was while serving in the House that Olympia met Jock McKernan, who was a rising political star in his own right. Elected as Maine's second Congressman in 1982, Jock served alongside Olympia in the House and was later elected Governor of Maine. The two were married in 1989, and they have been a great team since. As Olympia puts it:       I have a wonderful partner in life. We've been able to ride      the waves together.  When George Mitchell announced his retirement in 1994, Olympia threw her hat into the ring and won by a landslide with 60 percent of the vote against her opponent's 36 percent and carrying every county in the State. Believe it or not, it was the smallest margin of victory she has enjoyed in three Senate races. With this victory, Olympia became the only woman in history to serve in both houses of her State legislature and both Houses of Congress.  In the Senate, Olympia has worked tirelessly as a member of the Finance Committee, the Armed Services Committee, the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, the Select Committee on Intelligence, and as chair of the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.  A lot of people like to focus on Olympia's independent streak, but my experience is that she herself has alwayscared most deeply about the people of Maine. She has gone through great efforts over the years to talk to her constituents directly. She once said:       I've made main street tours across this state a hallmark of      my tenure in public office. They are like my secret poll.  It is through these tours that Olympia decides which problems to fix--whether it was storm relief after the 1998 ice storm, the fight I already mentioned to keep Maine's military facilities open, or reauthorization of the Northeast Dairy Compact on behalf of Maine's dairy farmers.  Of course, this isn't to downplay Olympia's penchant for independence or for joining gangs. Senator Snowe's maternal grandparents immigrated to the United States from Sparta, which may help explain her fighting spirit. Just like the Spartan King Leonidas, she has never been afraid of a fight--even with members of her own party.  She headed the Centrist Coalition with Senator Breaux. She cochaired the Common Ground Coalition with Senator Landrieu. In 1999 she was one of five Republicans to vote to acquit President Clinton of both articles of impeachment. And in 2005 she joined the bipartisan Gang of 14, which helped defuse an earlier dispute about threats to change the Senate rules.  Yet what many fail to mention is that despite her vaunted independence, Olympia has always been a very proud Republican. She recently said:       We believe as Republicans that the individual is more      important than the state. We believe that the great days of      our past can be a stepping stone to an even greater future.      We believe a job is preferential to a handout and      independence is better than dependence. We believe that the      private sector is more productive than big government will      ever be.  When it comes to a balanced budget--a top priority for the party--Senator Snowe has been a true leader. She has been a long-time supporter of a balanced budget amendment. As far back as 1993, when she was still serving in the House, she was one of four initial sponsors of the legislation that would have mandated a balanced budget. One of her first acts as a Senator was to deliver a speech before a Senate committee in support of a balanced budget amendment.  Olympia's many accomplishments have attracted broad notice outside of Washington. In 2004 Forbes named her ``one of 100 most powerful women in the world,'' rating her even more influential than J.K. Rowling or Oprah. In 2006 Time named her one of the ``ten best senators,'' noting that she is ``in the center of every policy debate in Washington.''  I do not think anything compares with the honor that was bestowed on Senator Snowe by the townspeople of Bethel, ME, who, in 1999, created the ``Olympia SnowWoman,'' a 122-foot tall snowman that still ranks as the tallest snowman--or woman--ever built. It required 13 million pounds of snow, took more than 1 month to build, wore a 100-foot-long scarf, had two entire 27-foot evergreen trees for arms, and required 16 pairs of skis for eyelashes.  ``It's just my luck,'' Senator Snowe said of the monument, ``I'd have a world record breaking monument named after me, and it will be gone by summer.''  Olympia, you have had a truly remarkable career. We thank you for your service to this Chamber and most especially to the people of the great State of Maine. We wish you all the best in the next phase of your life and, as you think of what to put in your memoir, I would only ask one thing: Please, go easy on us.                          ____________________
