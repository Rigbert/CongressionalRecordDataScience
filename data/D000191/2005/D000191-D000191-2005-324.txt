Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, again the gentleman did not answer my question. Rent a car in a 10/20 State, drive it into a 100/300 State, that car is essentially not insured for the purposes of that State.  Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler).
