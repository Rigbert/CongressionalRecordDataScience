 Mr. DeLAY. The distinguished whip understands that the Committee on the Budget is working as we speak, and continues to work to develop a product that they can mark up in the very near future. We fully expect to move a budget resolution through the House under a time frame that gives us ample opportunity to have a conference withthe Senate and complete the budget resolution by April 15, as required by law.  It is a very ambitious schedule, I know; and it is putting a lot of pressure on a lot of Members to make a lot of decisions in a very short period of time. But we feel very strongly that we need to get this budget done as quickly as possible.
