I used the words ``at this level.'' I do not believe we would be having the debate at this level if it had not been for the fact it did not happen.  I might also observe that the same attorney, who is a very capable and competent attorney in Oklahoma, Steven Jones, the one who so successfully got the delays in the Stafford case, is the same attorney that is handling Timothy McVeigh's case here, too.
