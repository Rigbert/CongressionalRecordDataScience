President, today, we will vote to defeat the filibuster against the nomination of Cheryl Krause to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. Her nomination has the strong bipartisan support of Pennsylvania Senators, Senator Bob Casey and Senator Patrick Toomey. The American Bar Association has unanimously given her their highest rating of ``well qualified.'' The Senate Judiciary Committee reported her unanimously by voice vote to the full Senate this past April, nearly 3 months ago.  Ms. Krause should already have been confirmed and be at work for the American people. Instead, Senate Republicans continue to filibuster qualified, uncontroversial nominees who in previous years would have been confirmed without any delay. This is deeply unfair to all Americans seeking access to justice and to the judicial nominees who, like Cheryl Krause, have had distinguished careers in the law. Of the 54 judicial nominees filibustered this year, 30 have been confirmed unanimously, without a single vote against them. These filibusters are undeserved, and should stop.  Ms. Krause has worked in private practice for over a decade, including as a partner at Dechert LLP and a shareholder at Hangley, Aronchick Segal, & Pudlin. Her work has focused on complex criminal defense matters in securities fraud, antitrust, and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. She has also taught courses on appellate advocacy, cyber crime, and judicial decisionmaking at University of Pennsylvania Law School and Stanford Law School. Professors from both universities have written in strong support for her nomination, and I ask consent that these letters be included in the Record.  From 1997 to 2002, Ms. Krause served as an assistant U.S. attorney in the Southern District of New York, where she distinguished herself as the lead prosecutor in the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force. Before becoming a prosecutor, she worked as an associate at the prestigious firm of Davis, Polk, & Wardwell and as a law clerk at Heller, Ehrman, White & McAuliffe LLP. After graduating with honors from Stanford Law School, she served as a law clerk to Judge Alex Kozinski of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit from 1993 to 1994 and to Justice Anthony Kennedy of the U.S. Supreme Court from 1994 to 1995.  Her commitment both to the practice of law and to her community in Philadelphia has been admirable. In 2011, as part of partnership between Dechert LLP and the Public Interest Law Center of Philadelphia, Ms. Krause brought a class action lawsuit in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania on behalf of over 1,000 autistic students within the school district of Pennsylvania challenging the school district's transfer of these students from school to school without adequate notice to parents. After 2 years of litigation, Ms. Krause was successful, and the district court required the school district to redevelop its policy. Ms. Krause has also helped to launch the Philadelphia Project, a program that provides legal services to families of children with disabilities in the school district of Philadelphia.  She is well qualified to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. Her record of accomplishments is unquestionable, as is her dedication to the rule of law and the Constitution. I urge my colleagues to vote to defeat the filibuster against this excellent nominee.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                          Stanford Law School,                                     Stanford, CA, March 10, 2014.     Subject: Nomination of Cheryl A. Krause to the U.S. Court of          Appeals for the Third Circuit     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     Chair, Committee on the Judiciary,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.     Hon. Charles Grassley,     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Grassley: We write      as the three former deans and the current dean of Stanford      Law School to express our enthusiastic support for Cheryl A.      Krause, who has been nominated for the U.S. Court of Appeals      for the Ninth Circuit.       Cheryl Krause graduated at the top of her class at Stanford      Law School in 1993. She was first in her class after her      first year of law school, and she and her partner were the      champions of the school-wide Kirkwood Moot Court Competition.      Ms. Krause herself was selected as the best oral advocate in      that final round. Following her graduation from law school,      she clerked for Judge Kozinski, now the Chief Judge of the      U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and for U.S.      Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. Following her      clerkships, she has pursued a wonderfully varied career--as a      law teacher, law firm lawyer and partner, and an Assistant      United States attorney. She has been repeatedly recognized as      one of the finest lawyers in the United States. Along the      way, she has somehow found time to perform an enormous amount      of pro bono legal representation and has been repeatedly      recognized for those contributions as well.       We write to tell you about Ms. Krause's reputation at      Stanford. That reputation can only be captured through a      series of adjectives that faculty use to describe their      impression of her: exceptional, stellar, admirable,      brilliant, incomparable. She is remembered as an academic      stand-out in and out of the classroom, a student leader, a      superb young lawyer, and a student who, faculty predicted,      would always combine a challenging legal practice with pro      bono and public service throughout her career.       Faculty members describe her as ``brilliant,'' ``among the      small handful of top students I have ever taught'' ``the best      student oral advocate I have ever seen,'' ``truly possessing      a judicial temperament,'' and ``ideally qualified      temperamentally and intellectually suited'' to be a judge.      Ms. Krause's career after law school has fulfilled these      impressions and predictions and more. She has forged a      remarkable path as a lawyer, and it is one that has prepared      her well for a career on the bench.       We hope that you will give her your most serious      consideration. We are optimistic that you will find her      record as impressive as that of her former teachers and      mentors at Stanford Law School.           Sincerely,     Paul Brest,       Professor Emeritus and former Dean, Stanford Law School.     Kathleen M. Sullivan,       Partner, Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, (former Dean,      Stanford Law School).     Larry Kramer,       President, William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, (former      Dean, Stanford Law School).     M. Elizabeth Magill,       Dean and Richard E. Lang Professor of Law, Stanford Law      School.                                  ____                                        University of Pennsylvania                                                   Law School,                                  Philadelphia, PA, March 7, 2014.     Re Cheryl Ann Krause.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.     Hon. Charles Grassley,     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Grassley: As faculty      members at the University of Pennsylvania Law School who have      had the privilege of working with Cheryl Ann Krause, we write      to express our enthusiastic support of her nomination to the      U. S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.       Since she was first appointed a Lecturer in Law in 2003,      Cheryl has taught Penn Law courses in cybercrime, evidence,      and appellate advocacy, and has guest-lectured in three      courses taught by other faculty. As a partner at the Dechert      firm, Cheryl has been the lead person teaching our Federal      Appellate Litigation Externship, in which Penn Law students      are assigned to litigation teams at Dechert working on pro      bono cases pending before the Third Circuit. In the early      2000s, Cheryl was a Barrister member of the University of      Pennsylvania Law School American Inn of Court (an      organization that seeks to promote ethics and professionalism      by bringing together law students, practitioners, and judges      for periodic discussions on legal issues), and she      participated in presenting three Inn of Court programs on      different topics.       In her teaching and mentoring at the Law School, Cheryl has      demonstrated the talents that will make her a first-rate      judge. Not     only does Cheryl bring to her tasks a powerful analytical      capacity, but also she has consistently displayed fair-     mindedness and intellectual curiosity. Her knack for      providing students and young lawyers with rigorous yet      constructive feedback signals that she would show respect to      the lawyers who appear before the Court while subjecting      their contentions to penetrating scrutiny. Cheryl possesses      excellent judgment and high integrity, and her interpersonal      skills would make her a valued and collegial member of the      Court.       In sum, we believe that Cheryl's legal acumen, temperament,      and experience make her a superb candidate for a seat on the      U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and we heartily      support her nomination.           Sincerely,         Stephanos Bibas, Professor of Law and Criminology,            Director, Supreme Court Clinic; Jill E. Fisch, Perry            Golkin Professor of Law, Co-Director, Institute for Law            and Economics; Paul M.
