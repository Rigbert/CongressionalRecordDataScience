Mr. Speaker, I would like to remind my colleagues of the many barriers people with disabilities face. They confront barriers to employment, transportation and mobility issues, environmental obstacles, as well as fears, prejudices and misconceptions about their ability to offer valuable service to business, to our communities, and to our nation.  People with disabilities battle a 50 percent nationwide unemployment rate, and those with severe disabilities struggle with a debilitating 70 percent rate of unemployment. I regret that ten years after this Congress passed the Americans with Disabilities Act, it is still necessary to affirm that people with disabilities can work and want to work. They can enrich the workplace with meaningful skills and talents. And they, like any other Americans, want to contribute their talents to our society.  The key to changing these shocking labor statistics is to encourage employers to focus on the abilities of an individual, rather than an individual's disabilities. Hiring a deserving, qualified individual with a disability is a win-win situation for business and the community. When a person with a disability is employed, the positive benefits reverberate in the community reducing welfare dependency and generating self-sufficiency, independence, stable families, and an increased tax base. Employing people with disabilities helps businesses as well. They have extremely high retention rates, higher than most employees, and there can be tax advantages for businesses that hire employees with disabilities.  The Javits-Wagner-O'Day (JWOD) Program is to be commended and should be supported for providing employment opportunities to Americans with disabilities. The JWOD Program uses the purchasing power of the Federal Government to buy products and services from participating, community-based nonprofit agencies dedicated to training and employing individuals with disabilities. JWOD completes the cycle of support by enabling persons with disabilities to acquire job skills and training, receive good wages and benefits, and gain greater independence.  The program serves 40,000 people with disabilities nationwide. Last year, it generated approximately $280 million in wages earned and nearly $1.5 billion in products sold. In Georgia alone, some 972 people with disabilities earned nearly $3 million in wages last year as a result of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day program.  The Bobby Dodd Institute (BDI), a community rehabilitation facility in my district, has found particular success with JWOD contracts. Bobby Dodd Institute trainees operate the Veterans Administration Hospital switchboard, the U.S. Attorney Office mailroom, the Decatur Army Reserve Base janitorial service, and even have an expanded regional presence at the Veterans Administration Hospital switchboard in Murfreesboro, Tennessee.  As a result of these JWOD contracts, the Bobby Dodd Institute has been able to provide employment opportunities to numerous individuals with disabilities and has helped them to become independent, self-sufficient citizens. I am pleased that these JWOD contracts have had such a positive impact and hope that this is only the beginning. With support from my esteemed colleagues, Javits-Wagner-O'Day contracts can increase, and our whole society will benefit.  This is a program that truly makes a difference in the nation, and in Georgia. I am proud to support it.                          ____________________
