 Broder can best be described as something of a moderate on the campaign finance issue. He has been at several different places over the years. He makes this point about raising the hard money limit.  Much has changed in America since 1974, the year that Richard Nixon was forced to resign from the Presidency. Since then, we have had six other Presidents, the arrival of the Internet, and enough inflation to make the 1974 dollar worth 35 cents. That debate will, of course, occur during the course of the Hagel amendment.  Broder goes on to point out:       Twenty-six years ago, Congress said that contributions      below $1,000 were free of that taint. Is there something      magical about that figure, or could it be bumped up to $2,000      or even $3,000 in order to finance robust campaigns without      forcing candidates to spend as much time organizing      fundraisers or dialing for dollars as they do in the current      money chase?  Further in the article:       Democrats and liberal interest groups claim that raising      the $1,000 limit would benefit only a few wealthy givers.      Only one-tenth of one percent of adult Americans made a      political contribution of $1,000 in the last cycle. Of      course, politics would be healthier if more Americans      contributed something, but only a small minority now check      their returns to divert $3 of their taxes to the presidential      campaign fund--which would cost them nothing.  All this does is reflect a basic lack of interest in politics on the part of the Americans, which is not something we applaud, but it is certainly understandable.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent David Broder's column be printed in the Record.
