Speaker, it gives me great pleasure today to pay tribute to the young woman who is nearing the end of her tenure as Miss Rhode Island. Elizabeth Reilly not only displays the poise, grace, and character that are often associated with participants in the Miss America contest, she has also made a significant contribution to the welfare of Rhode Island's children.  Elizabeth is a second grade teacher at West Broadway School in Providence. Her father is a teacher, and Elizabeth has long known that she, too, wanted to enter this critical field, in which she could work to help our youngest citizens.  Three years ago, while teaching at Sackett Street School in Providence, Elizabeth saw that many of her students did not have adequate clothing. This serious problem distracted the children and prevented them from focusing their energy on learning.  To address this troubling situation, Elizabeth established a clothing bank that collected donations of clothing and distributed them to children in need. Elizabeth's selection as Miss Rhode Island attracted additional attention and donations for the clothing bank, helping her to expand this vital service. Although Elizabeth's tenure as Miss Rhode Island is nearing its end, the clothing bank that she has created will continue to benefit Rhode Island children for many years to come.  On this floor, we often state that our Nation's citizens must reach out to each other in order to address the problems confronting our communities. Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in saluting Elizabeth Reilly, whose work exemplifies the true spirit of community. I know the future holds a great deal more for Elizabeth Reilly, and I wish her all the best.                          ____________________
