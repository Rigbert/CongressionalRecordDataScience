Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory and life of Edward A. Hill, a loving husband, son, brother, uncle, friend and colleague. Ed was a member of my staff from 2007 to 2011. His wife, Jessica Zufolo, also served on my staff in the late 1990s. They have been a part of the DeFazio family for many years, and it is with a heavy heart that we mourn Ed's passing.  Ed didn't start out working in politics, but after volunteering to help elect Chris Murphy in 2006 he decided to leave his insurance industry job in Connecticut and move to Washington, D.C. He quickly fell in love with Congress and with Jessica, whom he had met on the campaign trail. I don't think he ever looked back.  Ed was the type of guy everyone liked to be around. He was always smiling and quick with a joke or words of support. His love of craft beer and the home brew he shared made him very popular in the DeFazio office.  About nine months ago Ed was diagnosed with esophageal cancer. He fought it hard until the end. Unfortunately he was diagnosed too late, which is not uncommon with this type of cancer. April was Esophageal Cancer Awareness month, and I'm sure in his honor Ed would encourage us all to get tested.  Ed passed away on May 1st at Georgetown Hospital. At only 45 years of age, he was way too young to die. But, he lived those years he had to the fullest. He will be remembered and missed by all whose lives he touched.                          ____________________
