President, at the end of a Congress, we all know how easy it is for just one Senator to block a bill. I rise today to express my great disappointment that we have been unable to overcome objections from just one Senator from the other side of the aisle who is blocking the passage of legislation called the Senior$afe Act that is designed to help protect our seniors from financial fraud and exploitation. This is a bill I introduced with my colleague, Senator Claire McCaskill, as a result of extensive hearings and investigations that we have conducted in the Senate Aging Committee. A companion bill passed the House on a voice vote.  Nationally, as many as 5 million seniors may be victims of financial abuse annually. Stopping this tsunami of fraud has been one of the top priorities of the Senate Aging Committee.  In the many hearings we have held on this issue, what we found is that scammers seek to gain the trust and active cooperation of their victims, who are usually older Americans. Without that trust and cooperation, their schemes would fail. Unfortunately, seniors often do not see the red flags that signal that fraud is likely involved in these sophisticated schemes. Sometimes seniors are simply too nice, too trusting. In other sad cases, they may suffer from diminished capacity. But just as often, they miss these flags because the swindlers who prey upon them are extremely crafty and they know how to sound convincing. Any of us who have received these calls at home know how persuasive and persistent these con artists can be.  Whatever the reason, a warning sign that can slip by a victim might trigger a second look by a financial services representative who is trained to spot common scams and who knows enough about a senior's habits to question a transaction that just doesn't look right. In our work on the Senate Aging Committee, we have heard of so many cases where an alert bank teller or credit union employee on the frontlines has stopped a financial fraud in its tracks, saving seniors untold thousands of dollars. In fact, the Government Accountability Office estimates that our seniors lose an astonishing $2.9 billion a year to this kind of fraud,and that is probably the tip of the iceberg because many times this fraud is never reported.  I will give an example. Earlier this year, an attorney in the small coastal city of Belfast, ME, was sentenced to 30 months in prison for bilking two older female clients out of nearly half a million dollars over the course of several years. The lawyer's brazen theft was uncovered when a local bank teller noticed that he was writing large checks to himself from his clients' accounts. When confronted by authorities, he offered excuses that the prosecutor later described as ``breathtaking.'' For example, he put one of his clients into a nursing home to recover from a temporary medical condition and then managed to keep her there for 4 years until the theft of her funds came to light. In the meantime, he submitted bills for services, sometimes totaling $20,000 a month, including charging her $250 per hour for 6 to 7 hours to check on her house, which was a 1-minute drive from his office.  Financial institutions are in a critical position to check these fraudsters. If properly trained, employees can be the first line of defense. Regrettably, certain laws can inadvertently impede efforts to protect seniors because financial institutions that report suspected fraud can be exposed to lawsuits. Our bill, the Senior$afe Act, encourages financial institutions to train their employees and shields them from lawsuits for making good-faith, reasonable reports of potential fraud to the proper authorities.  As Jaye Martin, the head of Maine Legal Services for the Elderly, put it in a letter describing her support for the Collins-McCaskill bill, ``In a landscape that includes family members who often wish to keep exploitation from coming to light because they are perpetrating the exploitation, the risk of facing potential nuisance or false complaints over privacy violations is all too real.''  This is a barrier that must be removed so that financial institutions will act immediately to make a report to the proper authorities upon forming a reasonable belief that exploitation is occurring. These professionals are on the frontlines in the fight against elder financial exploitation and are often the only ones in a position to stop the exploitation before it is too late.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the full letter from Ms. Martin immediately following my remarks.  Our bipartisan bill is based on the State of Maine's innovative Senior$afe Program. It has been a collaborative effort by my State's regulators, financial institutions, and legal organizations to educate bank and credit union employees on how to identify and help stop the exploitation of older Mainers. It was pioneered by Maine's securities administrator, Judith Shaw, and it has led to a significant increase in reports of suspected senior financial exploitation and fraud.  The Maine program also serves as a template for model legislation developed for adoption by the North American Securities Administrators Administration, which is known as NASAA. The Senior$afe Act and this model State legislation are complementary efforts, and I am very pleased that the association of securities administrators has endorsed our bill.  As I mentioned, the House Financial Services Committee approved our companion bill by a vote of 59 to 0 in June, and it passed the House by a voice vote in July. The Senate bill is sponsored by a quarter of the Members of this body, balanced nearly evenly on both sides of the aisle, and has the support of a wide range of stakeholders looking out for the interests of consumers, including the securities administrators whom I have already mentioned, the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. These are all regulators who are looking out for our consumers.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record these letters of endorsement immediately following my remarks.  Under our bill, liability protections are only provided for good-faith, reasonable reports of suspected fraud.  The legal obstacles facing financial institutions that report this kind of suspected fraud and abuse are not limited to just privacy laws because these institutions have also been threatened with claims such as breach of contract, bad faith, slander, unfair practices, and even harassment. As one compliance officer for one of my community banks put it, without this kind of immunity for good-faith reporting, small community banks will face the ``freeze effect'' and won't make reports that could help to protect our seniors; thus, ``the effectiveness of Senior$afe will be undercut.''  I just cannot believe we cannot clear this commonsense bill for the President's signature when it would help so many seniors avoid becoming the victims of financial fraud and abuse, when it is supported by groups like Maine Legal Services for the Elderly, when it has won the support of national organizations of State securities administrators, State insurance commissioners, State bank regulators, when it would make such a difference.  Sadly, because of the objections of just one Senator on the other side of the aisle, we are stymied. That means we will have to start all over again next year. Much needed help for our seniors--that could help them avoid being swindled out of what GAO estimates is almost $3 billion a year--will have to wait for another day. I just don't understand it.  I have made many good-faith efforts in this regard, but regretfully, because we are at the end of the session, we don't have the time to go through all of the procedural steps that would be needed to pass this bill, which I am sure, given its broad bipartisan support, would pass overwhelmingly. I hope the Senator in question will reconsider and allow us to send this important bill to the President for his signature.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         Legal Services for the Elderly, Free Legal Help for            Maine's Seniors,                                                 December 5, 2016.     Re Senior$afe (S. 2216).     Senator Susan Collins,     Chair, Senate Special Committee on Aging, Dirksen Senate          Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: I want to thank you for inviting me      to speak with the Senate Special Committee on Aging about the      serious problem of financial exploitation of seniors by      guardians and others in a position of power. I also want to      thank you for your leadership in working to ensure there is      training of financial institution employees in reporting      elder abuse and an improvement in the timely reporting of      financial exploitation when it is suspected through passage      of the Senior$afe Act. I strongly support this legislation      that is based upon work done here in Maine.       I served for over two years on the working group that      developed Maine's Senior$afe training program for financial      institution managers and employees. It is a voluntary      training program. Through that work I came to fully      appreciate the very real concerns of the financial industry      regarding the consequences of violating, or being perceived      as violating, the broad range of state and federal privacy      laws that apply to their industry. I also came to appreciate      that absent broad immunity for reporting of suspected      financial exploitation, privacy regulations would continue to      be a barrier to good faith reporting of suspected financial      exploitation. In a landscape that includes family members who      often wish to keep exploitation from coming to light because      they are perpetrating the exploitation, the risk of facing      potential nuisance or false complaints over privacy      violations is all too real.       This is a barrier that must be removed so that financial      institution employees will act immediately to make a report      to the proper authorities upon forming a reasonable belief      that exploitation is occurring. These professionals are on      the front lines in the light against elder financial      exploitation and are often the only ones in a position to      stop exploitation before it is too late.       I want to add that tying the grant of immunity to required      training for not just supervisors, compliance officers, and      legal advisors, but to all who come in contact with seniors      as a part of their regular duties, will have the direct      result of bringing more cases of exploitation to the timely      attention of the proper authorities because it will      significantly increase the knowledge and awareness in the      industry of the red flags for elder abuse. In Maine, where      our training program is entirely voluntary and carries no      legal status or benefit, we have already seen what a      difference training can make.       Senior$afe is a much needed step in the fight against      financial exploitation of seniors and there is no doubt it      will make our nation's seniors safer. I thank you again for      your leadership in this important area.           Sincerely,                                                   Jaye L. Martin,                                               Executive Director.                                       ____                                         North American Securities                             Administrators Association, Inc.,                                 Washington, DC, October 27, 2015.     Re the Senior$afe Act of 2015.     Senator Susan Collins,     Chairman, Senate Special Committee on Aging, Dirksen Senate          Office Building, Washington, DC.     Senator Claire McCaskill,     Ranking Member, Senate Special Committee on Aging, Dirksen          Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Collins and Ranking Member McCaskill: On      behalf of the North American Securities Administrators      Association (``NASAA''), I'm writing to express strong      support for your work to better protect vulnerable adults      from financial exploitation through the introduction of the      Senior$afe Act of 2015. Your legislation will better protect      seniors by increasing the likelihood that financial      exploitation targeting the elderly will be identified by      financial services professionals, and by removing barriers      that might otherwise frustrate the reporting of such      exploitation to state securities regulators and other      appropriate governmental authorities.       Senior financial exploitation is a difficult but critical      policy challenge. Many in our elderly population are      vulnerable due to social isolation and distance from family,      caregiver, and other support networks. Indeed, evidence      suggests that as many as one out of every five citizens over      the age of 65 has been victimized by a financial fraud. To be      successful in combating senior financial exploitation, state      and federal policymakers must come together to weave a new      safety net for our elderly, breaking down barriers to      identify those who are best positioned to identify red flags      early on and to encourage reporting and referrals to      appropriate local, county, state, and federal agencies,      including law enforcement.       As you know, state securities regulators, working within      the framework of NASAA, are in the late-stages of our own      concerted effort to bolster protections for elderly investors      at risk of exploitation, including through the development of      model legislation to be enacted by states to promote      reporting of suspected exploitation. While the approaches      contemplated by the recently announced NASAA model      legislation and the Senior$afe Act differ in some respects,      they are complementary efforts, both undertaken with the      shared goal of protecting seniors by increasing the detection      and reporting of elderly financial exploitation.       The Senior$afe Act consists of several essential features.      First, to promote and encourage reporting of suspected      elderly financial exploitation by financial services      professionals, who are positioned to identify and report      ``red flags'' of potential exploitation, the bill would      incentivize financial services employees to report any      suspected exploitation by making them immune from any civil      or administrative liability arising from such a report,      provided that they exercised due care, and that they make      these reports in good faith. Second, in order to better      assure that financial services employees have the knowledge      and training they require to identify ``red flags''      associated with financial exploitation, the bill would      require that, as a condition of receiving immunity, financial      institutions undertake to train certain personnel regarding      the identification and reporting of senior financial      exploitation as soon as practicable, or within one year.      Under the bill, employees who would be required to receive      such training as a condition of immunity include supervisory      personnel; employees who come into contact with a senior      citizen as a regular part of their duties; and employees who      review or approve the financial documents, records, or      transactions of senior citizens as a part of their regular      duties.       The benefits of the types of reporting that the Senior$afe      Act aims to facilitate and encourage are far-reaching.      Elderly Americans stand to benefit directly from such      reporting, because early detection and reporting can minimize      their financial losses from exploitation, and because      improved protection of their finances ultimately helps      preserve their financial independence and their personal      autonomy. Financial institutions stand to benefit, as well,      through preservation of their reputation, increased community      recognition, increased employee satisfaction, and decreased      uninsured losses.       In conclusion, state securities regulators congratulate you      for introducing the Senior$afe Act of 2015. We share and      support the goals of this legislation, and look forward to      working closely with you as the legislation is considered by      the Senate.           Sincerely,                                               Judith M. Shaw,                                         NASAA President and Maine     Securities Administrator.                                  ____                                             NAIC & The Center for                                Insurance Policy and Research,                                               September 14, 2016.     Re Senior Safe Act.     Chairman Susan M. Collins,     U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging, Dirksen Senate Office          Building, Washington, DC.     Ranking Member Claire McCaskill,     U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging, Hart Senate Office          Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Collins and Ranking Member McCaskill: On      behalf of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners      (NAIC), which represents the chief insurance regulators from      the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and five U.S.      territories, we write to express our support for the Senior      $afe Act and applaud you for your leadership to increase      identification and reporting of suspected senior financial      exploitation.       It is estimated that older adults in our country lose $2.9      billion annually from financial exploitation, and these      losses can result in a diminished quality of life for those      who fall victim to such exploitation. State insurance      regulators share your commitment to protecting seniors from      financial exploitation. State and federal officials entrusted      with the responsibility of protecting consumers must remain      vigilant in their oversight. That is why a key component of      the NAIC's Retirement Security Initiative is ensuring      consumers have clarity and transparency into the insurance      products they are being offered, that the products are      suitable for their needs, and that bad actors do not      undermine efforts to address lifetime income and retirement      security challenges. We look forward to continuing to work      with you and your committee on these important issues.       Thank you again for your efforts to combat financial      exploitation of seniors.           Sincerely,     John M. Huff,       NAIC President, Director, Missouri Department of Insurance,      Financial Institutions and Professional Registration.     Theodore K. Nickel,       NAIC President-Elect, Commissioner, Wisconsin Department of      Insurance.     Julie Mix McPeak,       NAIC Vice President, Commissioner, Tennessee Department of      Commerce and Insurance.     Eric A. Cioppa,       NAIC Secretary-Treasurer, Superintendent, Maine Department      of Professional and Financial Regulation, Bureau of      Insurance.                                  ____                                               Conference of State                                             Bank Supervisors,                                                   April 29, 2016.     Senator Susan Collins,     Chairwoman, Senate Special Committee on Aging, Dirksen Senate          Office Building, Washington, DC.     Senator Claire McCaskill,     Ranking Member, Senate Special Committee on Aging, Dirksen          Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairwoman Collins and Ranking Member McCaskill: On      behalf of the Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS), I      write to express strong support for S. 2216, the Senior$afe      Act of 2015. State regulators are committed to combatting      financial abuse of elderly residents and believe that S. 2216      recognizes the contribution of states while empowering      institutions to reduce financial exploitation of the elderly.       State regulators supervise a diverse credit ecosystem, are      locally-focused, and have a unique insight on the      consequences of abusive practices in their communities. State      banking regulators supervise approximately 4,850 state-     chartered depository institutions, representing over 75% of      our nation's banks. Additionally, most state banking      departments regulate a variety of non-bank financial services      providers, including mortgage lenders.       Since the 1980s, several states have enacted laws to      address the abuse, neglect, and financial exploitation of      their elderly residents. These state laws provide immunity      for financial service professionals to report abuse in good      faith, contain penalties for failing to report or making      false reports of elder abuse, and combat power of attorney      abuse. S. 2216 recognizes the important work of states and      creates a consumer protection floor upon which states can      build.       Financial services professionals are in a position of trust      and have a unique window into the financial condition of      seniors. Their expertise and vantage point should be      leveraged to forcefully combat the growing epidemic of elder      abuse.       The Senior$afe Act incentivizes financial services      employees to report any suspected exploitation by making them      immune from any civil or administrative liability arising      from such a report, provided they exercised due care and      reported in good faith. Additionally, to ensure financial      services personnel have the requisite expertise, the bill      requires, as a condition of receiving immunity, that      financial institutions train key personnel regarding the      identification and reporting of senior financial exploitation      as soon as practicable.       Early detection is key to combatting elder financial abuse.      Not only can it minimize losses, but it may be able to      prevent abuses from occurring in the first place. Moreover,      this bill can deepen the involvement of financial      institutions in their community, enhance the training of      financial services personnel, and reduce insured losses.       In sum, CSBS strongly supports S. 2216 and looks forward to      working with you as the Senate considers this legislation.           Sincerely,                                                     John W. Ryan,                                                President and CEO.
