Res. 866) honoring the brave men and women of the United States Coast Guard whose tireless work, dedication, and commitment to protecting the United States have led to the Coast Guard seizing over 350,000 pounds of cocaine at sea during 2007, far surpassing all of our previous records.  The Clerk read the title of the resolution.  The text of the resolution is as follows:                              H. Res. 866       Whereas the estimated street value of the cocaine seized by      the Coast Guard in 2007 is more than $4,700,000,000 or nearly      half of the Coast Guard's annual budget;       Whereas the Coast Guard's at sea drug interdictions are      making a difference in the lives of American citizens      evidenced by the reduced supply of cocaine in more than 35      major cities throughout the United States;       Whereas keeping illegal drugs from reaching our shores      where they undermine American values and threaten families,      schools, and communities continues to be an important      national priority;       Whereas through robust interagency teamwork, collaboration      with international partners, and ever-more effective tools      and tactics, the Coast Guard has seized more than 2,000,000      pounds of cocaine during the past 10 years and will continue      to tighten the web of detection and interdiction at sea; and       Whereas the Coast Guard men and women who, while away from      family and hundreds of miles from our shores, execute this      dangerous mission, as well as other vital maritime safety,      security, and environmental protection missions, with quiet      dedication and without want of public recognition, continue      to show dedication and selfless service in protecting the      Nation and the American people: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That the United States House of Representatives      honors the United States Coast Guard, with its proud 217 year      legacy of maritime law enforcement and border protection,      along with the brave men and women whose efforts clearly      demonstrate the honor, respect, and devotion to duty that      ensures America's parents can sleep soundly knowing the Coast      Guard is on patrol.
