 As the Senator from Ohio indicated, the facts are very clear. Yes, the middle class may have gotten some benefit, but the lion's share of tax breaks went to the people on top.  What we are seeing in this country is a growing gap between the very wealthy and virtually everybody else. In many ways, the middle class is shrinking. Poverty is increasing. It makes zero sense to me that in the midst of all of that, we ask the middle class to pay more in taxes to provide health care to more Americans and we leave the top one-hundredth of 1 percent alone.  Let me also say this: There is a lot of support out there for the amendment Senator Brown, Senator Franken, Senator Begich, Senator Burris, and I are offering. Let me just read one. This is from the president of the Fraternal Order of Police. These are cops out on the street. Most people do not think the police are getting extravagant health care benefits.  This is what he said:       I am writing to you on behalf of the membership of the      Fraternal Order of Police to express our support for your      amendment which would eliminate the excise tax on high cost      insurance plans.  Et cetera, et cetera.       This provision is intended to tax the health plans of the      wealthiest Americans, but it will also tax the plans of many      law enforcement officers who need high cost and high quality      insurance due to the dangerous nature of their profession.      The Fraternal Order of Police strongly supports your      amendment, because health care reform legislation should not      increase the tax burden for those who fearlessly risk their      health, and even their lives, to keep our communities safe.
