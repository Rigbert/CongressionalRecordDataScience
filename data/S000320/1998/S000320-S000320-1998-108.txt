 The next vote is scheduled for 9:15 a.m. Friday morning.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes action on S. 2307, the fiscal year 1999 transportation appropriations bill, that the bill not be engrossed and be held at the desk.  I further ask that when the Senate receives the House of Representatives companion measure, the Senate immediately proceed to its consideration; that all after the enacting clause be stricken and the text of S. 2307, as passed, be inserted in lieu thereof; that the House bill, as amended, be read for a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider the vote be laid upon the table, that the Senate insist on its amendments, request a conference with the House on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses thereon, and that the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate, and that the foregoing occur without any intervening action or debate.
