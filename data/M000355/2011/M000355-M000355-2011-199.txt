 President, I rise today to recognize one of Kentucky's oldest and most respected local newspapers, the Hazard Herald of Hazard, KY. In July of this year, The Hazard Herald celebrated over a century's worth of news coverage by publishing a 100th-anniversary edition of its morning paper. The Herald is, and has been, the most trusted source of local and national news to the people of Hazard and Perry County for decades.  Founder and prominent lawyer and statesman Bailey P. Wootton, who eventually served one term as Kentucky attorney general in the 1930s, envisioned that the Herald would serve as the primary medium for progress and information for the local community when he began publishing the paper in 1911. Over the years, the Herald became the heart of the community, sharing in both the triumphs and sorrows of citizens of the county as it grew alongside them.  From the arrival of the first train to Hazard Depot in 1912, which a year later would pave the way for boosting the region's coal industry, to the decade-defining flood of 1927 that devastated the county, the Herald was front and center. In the 1930s the Herald followed Bailey during his campaign to be elected Kentucky attorney general, as well as the Hazard High School boys' basketball team as they were eventually crowned state champions.  World War II in the 1940s forced the Herald to begin printing daily to keep people informed with the war efforts in Europe, and it remained so until the mid-1950s when it then alternated to a biweekly publication. The paper mourned President Kennedy's death with the nation in the 1960s, and provided an in-depth account of President Bill Clinton's visit to Hazard in 1999--which was printed in color after the paper adopted color printing technology in the middle of the decade. Most recently, the Herald has adopted online publications and social media to keep pace with the technological advancements that define news and media today.  Perry County is fortunate to have such an established and trusted news source to inform the great people of Kentucky. In the 100th anniversary edition of the Herald, printed July 27, 2011, there is an article that highlights the paper's founding and first decade of printing. To help celebrate this landmark occasion, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:      [From the Hazard Herald, Centennial Edition, July 27, 2011]       The first decade 1911-1919: The Hazard Herald publishes      first issue, begins a tradition still alive a century later.       The first edition of The Hazard Herald was hand set and      came off the gasoline powered     printing press on June 22, 1911. Though we can't find a copy      of that first edition, the effect the Herald had on the local      community during its first decade is certainly on record.       The Herald was operated by its founder and president at the      time, Bailey P. Wootton, along with officers George W.      Humphries, James B. Hoge, and W.C. Trosper.       During that first year, a one-year subscription to the      Herald could be purchased for one dollar as the paper's staff      covered the growth of Hazard, which at the time was still      looking forward to the coming of the railroad a year later, a      move that would open up a town that in the years prior was a      remote hamlet nearly cut off by the rough and tumble      foothills of the Appalachian Mountains.       The first two years of the Herald's publication were      certainly not easy ones, as noted in Perry County Kentucky: A      History, published by the Hazard Chapter of the Daughters of      the American Revolution during the 1950s. A publisher in      Hazard at that time certainly lacked some of the modern      conveniences that newspaper staff today may take for granted:      ``With power still not available in 1911, a two H.P. gasoline      engine was installed to run the press. After 1912,      electricity was available and the changeover was made.''       In those first years the Herald also served as a chronicler      of Hazard's history (as it still does today). One of the most      important events in that history was the arrival of the      railroad. In the July 20, 1911 edition, the paper's fifth      that first year, a story details work being completed by the      Jones-Davis Company regarding construction of a section of      the L&E Railroad which extended ``from below Yerkes to the      head of the river of the mouth of Buckeye Creek, about 18      miles.''       The first train arrived at the Hazard Depot in 1912, and it      not only opened avenues of travel in and out of the county,      but it also paved the way for a more robust coal industry, as      noted in the Herald's October 7, 1912 edition: ``It will not      be long before the coal from this city will be counted by the      trainloads instead of the carload.''       Other notable events during the decade include a fire in      December 1913 that ravaged the business section of town,      destroying $50,000 worth of property, according to a headline      of the day. Consumed in the fire was the D.Y. Combs Hotel as      well as the offices of Dr. Gross and Dr. Hurst.       On August 17, 1914, the Herald reported on the first      automobile to arrive in Perry County: ``Last Thursday, Hazard      and Perry County (sic) were honored by the first automobile      ever inside the county limits. We have had the railroad      trains upward of two years, and that has ceased to be a      wonder; we have had one autocycle, which remained for a few      days and departed from whence it came. But the crowning glory      of all was the advent of the Ford touring car which passed      through our city last Thursday. Now we are on the qui vive      for the first aeroplane.''       By 1916, Wootton was still listed as the president, with      James B. Hoge and W.C. Trosper as secretary and manager      respectively, and a weekly editorial appeared in the      newspaper as well. In the January 27, 1916 edition, the      Herald took to task the City of Hazard for allowing the      city's sidewalks to fall in disrepair, writing: ``In any      case, there has been no excuse on the part of either Big      Bottom residents or the City government for leaving the walks      up that way in the shape it has been for such a long time.''       While the Herald maintained a local flavor during its first      decade, in this age before the Internet and instant news      delivery, the paper also made note of issues of national      importance. By 1918, World War I ended with the abdication of      Kaiser Wilhelm II on November 9. The Herald carried the story      with the headline: ``War Is Ended; Kaiser Abdicates.''       By the end of the decade, the paper's yearly subscription      rate had increased to $1.50 while Bailey Wootton remained the      president of the Herald Publishing Company, and John B.      Horton had been serving as the editor.                          ____________________
