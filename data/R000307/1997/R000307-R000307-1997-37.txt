President, I am pleased the Senate has acted expeditiously on S. 1000, the legislation that Senator Brownback and I introduced several weeks ago to designate the Kansas City, KS, Federal Courthouse after our Kansas colleague Senator Bob Dole. I appreciate the efforts of Senators Chafee and Baucus and the other members of the Environment and Public Works Committee in their effort to approve the bill for its consideration by the Senate before the August recess.  After the bill was introduced, Kansans contacted my office about Senator Dole and their recollections of his work, which he continues to do in behalf of Kansas. I thought it would be fitting to share an example with my colleagues. Mrs. Rose Coughlin of Kansas City, KS, shared with me her story about Senator Dole calling her just several weeks ago. Mrs. Coughlin, who suffers from polio, wrote to Senator Dole in mid-June just to pass along her deep appreciation and admiration of his perseverance during his legislative career on behalf of Kansas despite his permanent injuries sustained during World War II.  Much to her surprise, Senator Dole called her upon receiving the letter and talked with her at some length, inquiring about her condition. At the close of her letter to me she says, ``Needless to say he made my day.'' Her letter is indicative of Senator Dole's commitment and caring for Kansans.  Mr. President, S. 1000 has been endorsed by Carol Marinovich, mayor of Kansas City, KS, the location of the soon-to-be Robert J. Dole U.S. Courthouse.  I look forward to joining Senator Dole along with proud Kansans in the near future for the dedication ceremonies.  The bill (S. 1000) was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, read the third time, and passed; as follows:                                S. 1000       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF ROBERT J. DOLE UNITED STATES                    COURTHOUSE.       The United States courthouse at 500 State Avenue in Kansas      City, Kansas, shall be known and designated as the ``Robert      J. Dole United States Courthouse''.     SEC. 2. REFERENCES.       Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper,      or other record of the United States to the United States      courthouse referred to in section 1 shall be deemed to be a      reference to the ``Robert J. Dole United States Courthouse''.                          ____________________
