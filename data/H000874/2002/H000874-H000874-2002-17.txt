Speaker, I yield 4\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers), one of the most senior Members of this House, the ranking member of the Committee on the Judiciary, a giant in the civil rights movement of this country, whose voice is always heard on behalf of those who are dispossessed, downtrodden, or discriminated against. It is an honor to be his friend and an honor to serve with him in this House.
