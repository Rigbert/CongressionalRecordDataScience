In fact, I submitted a resolution urging the President do that. In fact, my resolution mirrors the resolution that was drafted by our former colleagues, Spence Abraham and John Ashcroft, that passed in 2000 when President Clinton was faced with the same kind of situation.  I am very hopeful that the Senate will take up that resolution and do exactly as the Senator from Nevada has said.  I also point out that it was very striking, even before this debate about Mr. Woodward's book, that the Saudi Foreign Minister said recently when they cut production--and he was quoted on the news services saying that he was not even contacted by the Bush administration. He heard that the Bush administration was disappointed from the press, but he was not even contacted by the Bush administration.  If ever there were an administration that had earned some chips with the Saudis, given all that our country has done, this is an administration that has done so. I think the points made by the Senator from Nevada are extremely important.  Mr. President, I believe my time has expired. I yield the floor.
