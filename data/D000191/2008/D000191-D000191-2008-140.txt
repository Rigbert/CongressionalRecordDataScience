2607, the DTV Transition Assistance Act, which will aid rural communities by ensuring that low power translators get the funding needed for digital equipment upgrades. This bipartisan legislation is critical to rural Americans that rely on over the air broadcast television as their main conduit to entertainment, news and even lifesaving information in emergency situations. That is why I joined with Representatives Walden and Boucher, the Co-Chairs of the DTV Caucus, in introducing similar legislation.   Under current law, $65 million has been set aside for the upgrade of low powered translators for the DTV transition. In Oregon alone there are over 400 stations that broadcast over these low powered translators. While this money has been set aside to assist in upgrading these translators, the wording of the statute did not allow the money to be spent until September of 2010, almost 2 years after the transition. This bill would make these funds available on the day of the transition in February of 2009. It would also give the NTIA the authority to use leftover funds from section 3008 of the Digital Television Transition and Public Safety Act of 2005 for grants, contracts, and assistance programs to assist seniors, rural residents, and minorities.   The Digital Television transition is the most sweeping and fundamental change to the television landscape since the advent of color. The advent of color television however, did not require millions of Americans to buy a new television or converter box or risk losing their picture. That fact alone makes the transition to digital television in February of 2009 a tectonic shift in broadcast television.   While this bill is an important fix, many problems still remain. The auctioning off of the newly available spectrum being vacated due to the digital transition has made the government over $19 billion. Despite this massivecollection of funds, the government has only allocated $5 million to educate the public about the transition, which is less than 0.03 percent of the $19 billion in revenue from the auction. The results have been as obvious as they have been preventable. A December 2007 survey by Consumer Reports found that 36 percent of respondents were completely unaware of the transition. How can we tell our constituents that we did everything we could when we spent next to nothing on educating them about the transition?   Instead the Bush Administration has privatized the outreach aspect of the transition, relying on private industry to inform viewers. The results have led to a jumble of different messages from different industries, all looking to benefit from the transition. There are examples of public service announcements supposedly made to inform consumers about the transition instead being thinly veiled advertisements for their own products.   The problems do not stop there. With only a 90 day window to buy convertor boxes before their coupons expire, many rural customers are finding that many stores either do not carry any convertor boxes or they are not carrying a pass through capable converter box that the customer will need in order to get all of their channels. These customers should not be penalized because of where they live.   Madam Speaker, this bill is an important step but it is only a step. We must do more to ensure that when Americans wake up on February 17th 2009, they are not left in the dark.                          ____________________
