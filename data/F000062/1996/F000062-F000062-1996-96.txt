 President, I rise today in support of my amendment to authorize $12 million for the development of a pulse doppler upgrade to the AN/SPS-48E radar system.  The AN/SPS-48E is currently the only surveillance radar capable of detecting low flying cruise missiles coming out of the severe ground clutter that is typical of littoral warfare over water or land. Given the proper funding, the Navy agrees that the AN/SPS-48E pulse doppler upgrade would re-initiate clutter reduction engineering activities, thereby improving their ability to meet current and emerging threats. Present lack of funding for this one-of-a-kind, superior radar system leaves our large deck amphibious ships and the new LPD-17 class ships and their crews unprotected and vulnerable to attack.  I am pleased that this amendment is acceptable and I thank the managers of the bill.
