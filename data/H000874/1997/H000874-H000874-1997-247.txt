Speaker, excuse me for interfering. I did not know he was here, but in 1962 there was a House Member, and his office was next to Otis Pike's, and there was this young kid at the University of Maryland that wanted to get into politics. So he came to his office and he volunteered, and he ran a robo machine and then did that doggone machine that you did the newsletters on, that you got so dirty that you would never get the ink off, I thought. And that fellow is here. I worked for him for the last year I was at the University of Maryland and for 3 years at Georgetown Law School. He was responsible, very frankly, not only for my being able to go to law school but for the fact, I think, that I am here. Dan Brewster, former U.S. Senator from our State.
