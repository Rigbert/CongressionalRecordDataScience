President, I am pleased and honored to join with my colleagues to introduce legislation to help meet the child care challenges facing families around the nation. Our bill is entitled the ``Caring for Children Act.''  Child care, in the home when possible and outside the home when both parents work, goes right to the heart of keeping families strong. Unfortunately, finding quality, affordable child care is one of the most pressing problems for families in Kansas and around the country.
