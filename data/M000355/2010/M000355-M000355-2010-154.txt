J. Res. 83, which would extend sanctions on the Burma regime for another year. As in years past, I am joined in this effort by my good friend, Senator Dianne Feinstein. Alongside the 2 of us are 66 other cosponsors, including Senators McCain, Durbin, Gregg, and Lieberman.  This overwhelming bipartisan support for sanctioning the junta reflects the clear view of more than two-thirds of the Senate that the generals currently ruling Burma should be denied the legitimacy they are pursuing through this year's sham elections.  Renewing sanctions against the military regime in Burma is as timely and as important as ever.
