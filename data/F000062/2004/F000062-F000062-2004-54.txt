 President, before I yield back the remainder of my time, I would like to thank the Senator from Delaware for his comments. The control tower at Dover Air Force Base, which is I think about a $9 million appropriation, was on their ask list in 2004. Unfortunately, we could not do it, so we made it a high priority this year. I know both Senator Hutchison and I were really pleased to be able to do it.  It is very nice for the Senator from Delaware to come to the floor to say thank you. Very few do that. It is appreciated. I thank the Senator very much.
