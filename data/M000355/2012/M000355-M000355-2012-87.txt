 President, this Monday, September 17, our Nation celebrated one of our greatest founding documents the document that has guided the discourse of our great Nation for 225 years. Every September 17, we celebrate Constitution Day.  Americans of all walks of life are united by the ideals of equal justice, limited government, and the rule of law. It was the vision and determination of the Founders who wrote and signed the Constitution that makes our celebration today possible.  More than two centuries ago, the Founders met in Philadelphia to create a constitution that would preserve liberty and foster freedom. They established three separate branches of government and a system of checks and balances among them. Ours is still the oldest written Constitution in use in the world.  The most important purpose of Constitution Day is to teach these lessons to the younger generations. I am pleased to say that the Kentucky Department of Education has made resources available to secondary schools across the Commonwealth to help them recognize this special day.  The University of Kentucky marked Constitution Day by inviting speakers and holding historical forums. And at the University of Louisville, Constitution Day was celebrated with a constitution quiz bowl and constitution cupcakes.  So on this day, we recognize the students, teachers, and community leaders in Kentucky and across the Nation who promote and protect the ideals of our glorious Constitution.  We also say a special thanks for our men and women in uniform who defend it.  More than two centuries ago, the 39 signers of our Constitution gave us a more perfect union through a document that endures and guides us here today.  They understood, as we all must, that above all, government serves to secure the blessings of liberty for the people of our great Nation. It is an honor to stand on this floor and recognize how we have reaped the fruit of their efforts these many years later.                          ____________________
