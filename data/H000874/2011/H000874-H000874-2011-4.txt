 I have just been handed a--it may have been sent out earlier--a Members' advisory which says:       The House will be in session as necessary to consider a      conference report on H.R. 3630, the Middle Class Tax Relief      and Job Creation Act of 2011.       The House's request for a conference will be transmitted to      the United States Senate this afternoon where it will await      the appointment of their conferees. To be clear, H.R. 3630      will physically reside in the Senate by the close of business      today.                              {time}  1600  It goes on to say, ``Members will be provided with at least 24 hours' notice prior to the House's next recorded vote.''  What I wanted to ask the majority leader is, does he expect his Members to go home this afternoon?  I yield to my friend.
