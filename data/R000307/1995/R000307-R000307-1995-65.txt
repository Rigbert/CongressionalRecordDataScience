Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Skeen en bloc amendment. This amendment reflects the work done between the authorizers and appropriators to put forward a bill that both committees can support. This amendment makes the difficult choices in discretionary spending to reach the requirements of the budget resolution.  Many of the spending choices reflected in the en bloc amendment are painful. I wish we didn't have to make them, but we do. Later this year, the Agriculture Committee will be bringing a farm authorization bill to the floor that will contain ever harder choices. The en bloc amendment before us today will allow the House to make clearer and more accurate decisions on how we should approach all farm and rural spending.  The gentleman from New Mexico [Mr. Skeen] and his colleagues on the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee have faced up to their budget responsibilities and provided in this amendment honest spending reductions in their discretionary area of responsibility. Adoption of this amendment is crucial to securing the support of all the agriculture community for this bill. I strongly urge the House to pass the Skeen en bloc amendment.
