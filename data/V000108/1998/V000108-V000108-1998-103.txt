Speaker, It is my distinct pleasure to congratulate The Methodist Hospitals, Inc. as it celebrates its 75th Diamond Jubilee Anniversary this Sunday, May 17, 1998. Methodist will commemorate its 75 years of dedicated service to the communities of Northwest Indiana in a Rededication to Community Service ceremony and Community Open House to be held at its Northlake Campus in Gary, Indiana. The celebration will serve as an opportunity for Methodist to reaffirm its commitment to excellence in health care services to every individual in Gary, Merrillville, and the surrounding communities.  Methodist Hospital was established in 1923 in response to concerns that a larger hospital would be needed to accommodate the growing population of the emerging ``Steel City'' of Gary. The events leading up to Methodist's dedication on May 27, 1923, however, can be traced back to 1910, when a registered nurse by the name of Margaret Pritchard came to Gary with the vision of establishing a hospital. In acquiring donations from a group of doctors in 1911, Ms. Pritchard witnessed the accomplishment of this task with the opening of Gary General Hospital on Van Buren Street. Over the next few years, measures were taken to provide for Gary General's future funding and growth, which resulted in an affiliation with Methodist Episcopal Hospital of the State of Indiana in Indianapolis, a major fundraising campaign targeting the steel mills, and the donation of property by the Gary Land Company. On June 11, 1923, Methodist Hospital and its School of Nursing officially opened.  After Methodist separated from the hospital board in Indianapolis in 1942, it expanded through major construction efforts and development of services to accommodate health care needs beyond the boundaries of Gary. Some of the hospital's additional services came with its establishment of Lake County's first physical therapy department in 1949, the county's first acute care unit for psychiatric patients in 1951, and the state's first accredited, full-service rehabilitation services center in 1971. Methodist further expanded its services to Northwest Indiana when it built a new 165-bed hospital facility in Merrillville, Indiana, which was completed in 1975. As a result of its growth, Methodist became regarded as a regional health care system and thus, the two facilities became Northlake Campus in Gary and Southlake Campus in Merrillville. In February of 1981, H. Theodore Tatum Family Health Center opened at the Northlake Campus, providing a base for the Family Practice Residency Program, and offering additional medical care for the community.  During the past two decades, Methodist Hospital has continued to grow and change, reflecting the needs of the communities and responding to the new era of outpatient services made possible by advances in technology and medicine. Methodist remains a not-for-profit community-based health care system, and is affiliated with various prestigious organizations, including: the Joint Commission for American Hospital Organizations; the Indiana State Board of Health, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education; and the American Academy of Family Physicians. Over the years, Methodist has taken an active role in bettering its communities by forging partnerships with schools, churches and businesses, and participating in outreach programs, such as Healthy Start, for prenatal and infant wellness, and Turning Point Center for addictions. In its 75th year of existence, Methodist Hospital has renewed its commitment to the residents of Northwest Indiana into the next century and beyond.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in commending the administrators, health care professionals, and other individuals who, over the years, have contributed to Methodist Hospitals' success in achieving its standards of excellence. Their hard work has improved the quality of life for everyone in Indiana's First Congressional District.                          ____________________
