President, the United States was instrumental in creating the International Development Association, which provides concessional loans to the poorest countries in the world. In this bill we have cut our contribution to IDA $308 million below what the President requested.  The request for fiscal year 1997 was $934 billion, and that only covers the arrears we already owe. The money in this bill for IDA is $74 million below the current level.  This amendment will bring our contribution to IDA up to the current level. That is still $234 million below the President's request, but it will at least show that we intend to do everything possible to prevent further erosion of support for IDA.  Some may think it does not matter if we maintain our leadership in IDA. They should talk to our economic competitors.  They know that IDA is a worthwhile investment, because of the contracts their companies get from IDA-financed projects and, even more importantly, the foreign markets IDA helps create. They know their ability to influence IDA policies is a direct function of their contributions. As we cut our contribution and our influence wanes, their influence grows.  It is influence many people here would miss, because with it the Congress has had a major role in making IDA lending procedures more open and subject to public scrutiny, and in eliminating wasteful policies. Money buys influence in these institutions, there is no two ways about it.  Mr. President, 40 percent of IDA lending goes to Africa, where the population is expected to more than double in the next 50 years. It would be unconscionable for the richest nation to cut its contribution to the largest source of funding for the poorest region in the world, which is potentially one of the largest emerging markets for American exports.  People need to realize that foreign assistance is not simply assistance for foreigners. It supports our own economic and political interests.  This is a critical year for IDA. When the United States indicated to the other IDA donors that we would not be able to contribute to IDA's replenishment this year and could only continue to pay off our arrears, the Europeans established an interim fund to get through this year without a U.S. contribution.  The administration supported that. But the Europeans made a miscalculation, by insisting that the U.S. would not be eligible for procurement for projects financed by the interim fund. While I can understand why they did that, since the interim fund consists entirely of their money, I believe it is misguided as a matter of policy to impose procurement restrictions on IDA-financed projects. I would say that if it were the United States or any other country that was being penalized, and whether it were IDA or any multilateral institution.  I would have liked to see us fully fund the President's request. That was not possible, since our budget is less this year than last. But I am hopeful that by maintaining our current level of funding, the Europeans will see that we are doing our best to eliminate our arrears, so we can go on to support IDA's replenishment. With the budget cuts we are facing there is only so much we can do in any single year.  I hope the Europeans will recognize the significance of what we are doing, and relent on the procurement restrictions. I think it is in everyone's interest that the United States remain a strong supporter of IDA, and that is not likely if these restrictions remain in effect.  Mr. President, there is one final aspect to this I want to mention. There has been a lot of talk about what percentage of IDA procurement American companies receive. Considering IDA alone, it is about 10 percent, largely because American companies have far less experience doing business in Africa than European companies. But when you consider World Bank and IDA contracts as a whole, U.S. procurement is about 20 percent, which is consistent with our share of contributions.  I thank the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator McConnell, for accepting this amendment.                           Amendment No. 5026       On page 148, line 10 through line 13, strike the following      language, ``That comparable requirements of any similar      provision in any other Act shall be applicable only to the      extent that funds appropriated by this Act have been      authorized: Provided further,''.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, in this group of amendments, there is a Bumpers amendment on Mongolia, a Reid amendment on female mutilation, an Inouye-Bennett amendment on USTTI, three Leahy amendments, and one McConnell-Leahy amendment on authorization restrictions.
