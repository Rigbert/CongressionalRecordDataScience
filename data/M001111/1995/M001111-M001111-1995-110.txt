 President, I rise in opposition to S. 956, a bill to divide the ninth judicial circuit into two circuits.  This is the fourth time since 1983 that a bill to split the ninth circuit has been introduced in the U.S. Senate. The proposal has failed to become law because the ninth circuit is operating well and providing uniform and consistent interpretation of Federal laws across the nine Western States, and the territories of Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands.  The courts of the ninth circuit are functioning well, and, in many instances, serve as models for the rest of the country. The ninth circuit has prided itself on its experiments in judicial administration, and has been a national leader in developing innovative caseload management and court administration techniques.  The vast majority of judges, lawyers, and bar organizations in the ninth circuit have voted on several occasions against the division of the circuit.  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill and to resist the temptation to meddle with an institution that is successfully administering justice in the American West.  Just 4 years ago, a comprehensive subcommittee hearing was held in the Senate on nearly identical legislation, and the proposal failed to emerge from committee. The proponents of S. 956 have identified no new reasons or change of circumstances to justify reopening this issue.  Mr. President, the ninth judicial circuit has prepared a detailed position paper opposing S. 956. I agree with the circuit's reasoning, and I commend this paper to my colleagues. I also urge them to join me in opposing this bill which is both unwise and unnecessary.  I ask that the complete text of the ``Position Paper in Opposition to S. 956--Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals Reorganization Act of 1995'' be printed in the Record.  The material follows:Position Paper in Opposition to S. 956--Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals                   Reorganization Act of 1995 (6/22/95)       Prepared by: The Office of the Circuit Executive for the      United States Courts for the Ninth Circuit, P.O. Box 193846,      San Francisco, California 94119-3486; Tel: 415-744-6150/Fax:      415-744-6179. [6/30/95]       Proposed legislation: S. 956 would divide the present Ninth      Circuit into two unequal-sized circuits. The new Twelfth      Circuit would consist of the states of Alaska, Idaho,      Montana, Oregon, and Washington (6 districts), with 9 active      circuit judges. The new Ninth Circuit would consist of the      states of Arizona, California, Hawaii, and Nevada, and the      territories of Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands (9      districts), with 19 active circuit judges.       The Ninth Circuit opposes S. 956. The Ninth Circuit is      functioning well and has devised innovative ways of managing      its caseload that are models for other circuits. As the      nation's largest circuit, it benefits from significant      advantages because of its size and believes division of the      circuit is unnecessary and unwise. The Circuit Executive's      Office for the United States Courts for the Ninth Circuit has      prepared the following information in ``question and answer''      format to assist decisionmakers to understand the circuit's      position on S. 956.               1. what would the proposed legislation do?       S. 956 would create two courts--one 19-judge court and one      9-judge court--in place of a single 28-judge court. A basic      problem with this proposal is that it creates more      administrative problems than it solves. Quantitatively, such      a circuit court would have a very small caseload. The      aggregate number of cases in such a circuit based on the most      recent statistics would be 1935,\1\ making it the circuit      court with the second smallest caseload in the country,\2\      with only the First Circuit court having fewer cases. Of the      11      regional circuits, the circuit court with the median volume is the      Second, with 3,986 cases; the proposed northern circuit would      be less than half that number. Take away the northern states,      and the Ninth Circuit court would still have the largest      volume in the country. In short, such a proposal creates a      very small circuit and gives not much relief.       In general, S. 956 presumes that two smaller circuits will      do a better job of maintaining consistency and deciding cases      promptly than the present circuit. The proposal ignores the      central fact of appellate dockets: caseloads are constantly      growing and dividing the circuit would simply create two      courts with increasing caseloads without dealing with the      fundamental problems resulting from expanding caseloads with      no increase in judicial resources.    2. how does this bill differ from earlier proposed legislation?       This is the ninth legislative proposal to split the Ninth      Circuit since 1940. It is nearly identical (except for the      alignment of Hawaii and the Territories) to measures      introduced by Senator Gorton in 1983, 1989, and 1991. Each of      those measures failed to emerge from committee and died at      the conclusion of the legislative session. The Subcommittee      on Courts and Administrative Practice of the Senate Committee      on the Judiciary conducted a legislative hearing on the 1989      bill (S. 948) on March 6, 1990. The sponsors of the current      bill have advanced no reason for dividing the circuit that      was not fully considered and rejected in 1990. They have      pointed to no change in circumstances that would justify yet      another examination of this issue.              3. are there drawbacks to the proposed bill?       The Ninth Circuit has functioned successfully in its      present configuration for over 100 years. Any effort to      abolish a successful, established institution should be      cautiously examined. The proposed bill could create serious      legal and administrative problems and costs that do not now      exist:       (1) the potential for inconsistent law relating to      admiralty, commercial trade, and utilities along the Western      seaboard, including Alaska, Hawaii, and the Territories;       (2) the opportunity for litigants to forum shop by filing      their cases in whichever circuit, northern or southern, they      feel is most sympathetic to their cause;       (3) the substantial cost of setting up duplicative      administrative structures;       (4) the loss of advantages of size (see Question #4,      below);       (5) the rejection of the expressed will of the vast      majority of the judges and lawyers in the circuit who oppose      its division.       Common sense suggests the inadvisability of creating a new      regional circuit that would require duplication of functions      that are already being satisfactorily performed in a larger      circuit. Administratively, the creation of a new circuit      would require duplicative offices of clerk of court, circuit      executive, staff attorneys, settlement attorneys, and      library, as well as courtrooms, mail and computer facilities.      In addition, approximately 40,000 square feet or new      headquarters space would be required, all of which would      duplicate offices and space in San Francisco. Further, a      small circuit, with its concomitant small caseload, would      underutilize judicial resources and reduce the opportunities      for efficiencies available to a larger circuit.       Lawyers expressed particular concern that dividing the      extended coastline in the West between two circuits would      create inconsistent and conflicting application of maritime,      commercial, and utility law in the two circuits, making      commerce more difficult and costly, and requiring them to      research the law of two circuits for every potential cross-     circuit transaction. Potential inconsistencies would be      especially troubling in the application of utility rates      along the entire Pacific seaboard by the Bonneville Power      Administration. These rate and administrative disputes should      remain in a single service area, the Ninth Circuit.       On four occasions in the past 15 years, the federal judges      in the Ninth Circuit and elected representatives of      practicing lawyers who participate in the Ninth Circuit      Judicial Conference have voted overwhelmingly in opposition      to splitting the circuit. The current Almanac of the Federal      Judiciary, Vol. 2, based on extensive polling, reports that      the lawyers ``almost unanimously praise'' the court, and,      with regard to circuit splitting, ``all seem to agree that      such a division would be difficult and probably      unsatisfactory.'' (1995-1, 9th Cir.)              4. are there advantages to a large circuit?       A single court of appeals serving a large geographic region      promotes uniformity and consistency in the law and      facilitates trade and commerce by contributing to stability      and orderly progress. In many respects, the size of the Ninth      Circuit is an asset that has improved both decisionmaking and      judicial administration. The court of appeals is strengthened      and enriched, and the inevitable tendency to regional      parochialism is weakened, by the variety and diversity of      backgrounds of its judges drawn from the nine states      comprising the circuit. The size of the circuit has also      allowed the circuit to draw upon a large pool of district and      bankruptcy judges for temporary assignment to neighboring      districts with a temporary but acute need for judicial      assistance.       The Ninth Circuit is a national leader in developing      innovative solutions to caseload and administrative      challenges. The ABA Appellate Practice Committee's Report      applauded three specific operational efficiencies:       . . .issue classification, aggressive use of staff      attorneys, and a limited en banc-[that] were developed by the      Ninth Circuit precisely to address the issues of caseload and      judgeship growth that the Subcommittee identified, and hold      promise for other circuits as they continue to grow. (at p.      10).       The Ninth Circuit has served as a laboratory for      experimentation in a host of other areas--from decentralized      budgeting to cameras in the courts, from block case      designations to improved state-federal judicial relations,      from alternative dispute resolution to appellate      commissioners, from improved tribal court relations to      alternative forms of capital case representation. The results      have inured to the benefit of the entire Judiciary. As the      congressionally-mandated Federal Courts Study Committee noted      in 1990, ``Perhaps the Ninth Circuit presents a workable      alternative to the traditional model.'' Final Report of the      Federal Courts Study Committee (1990).                5. what is the position of the sponsors?       In remarks introducing S. 853 (the immediate predecessor of      S. 956\3\), Senator Gorton of Washington asserted the      following grounds for the proposal: (1) a decrease in      consistency of decisions due to size; (2) unmanageable      caseloads; (3) inability to appreciate the interests of the      Northwest; and (4) a decline in the performance of the      circuit. 141 Cong. Rec. S7504 (daily ed. May 25, 1995)      (statement of Sen. Gorton). Senator Burns of Montana echoed      his colleague's concerns and suggested employment and local      economic stability are threatened by delays in resolving      lawsuits affecting timbering, mining, and water development.      Delays in criminal appeals, especially those involving the      death penalty, also are of concern to the Senators. 141 Cong.      Rec. S7504 (daily ed. May 25, 1995) (statement of Sen. Burns)      The circuit's specific responses to these contentions are set      forth in the following sections.     6. has the size of the circuit adversely affected consistency?       Consistency of court of appeals decisions is important to      provide coherent guidance to lower courts and litigants. The      Ninth Circuit has instituted case management devices that      have effectively reduced conflicts between panels and      maintained a high level of consistency in its decisions.       Since 1980, the use of a limited en banc panel to resolve      intracircuit conflicts has proven highly effective. All 28      active judges participate in determining whether a case will      be heard en banc. Each call for an en banc vote leads to      careful evaluation of the development of the law of the      circuit in that area. If a majority of the judges votes to      hear a case en banc (which happens less than a dozen times a      year), ten members of the court chosen at random plus the      chief judge serve as the limited en banc court. Judges and      lawyers have expressed a high degree of satisfaction with the      limited en banc process; only a handful of requests have been      made for a full court rehearing after the limited en banc      panel has issued a decision, and none have been granted.       An objective, highly-praised scholarly study of consistency      of the law in the Ninth Circuit concluded ``the pattern of      [multiple relevant precedents] exemplified by high visibility      issues. . . is not characteristic of Ninth Circuit      jurisprudence generally. Nor is intracircuit conflict.''      Restructuring Justice: The Innovations of the Ninth Circuit      and The Future of the Federal Courts (1990). A recent FJC      study reached a similar conclusion:       In sum, despite concerns about the proliferation of      precedent as the courts of appeals grow, there is currently      little evidence that intracircuit inconsistency is a      significant problem. Also, there is little evidence that      whatever intracircuit conflict exists is strongly correlated      with circuit size.       Structural and Other Alternatives for the Federal Courts of      Appeals (1993).       Of greater concern is the potential for increased      Intercircuit conflicts that would be spawned by the division      of circuits. Dividing the Ninth Circuit would place an      additional burden on the United States Supreme Court to      resolve conflicts that are now handled internally within the      circuit.       Nor is keeping abreast of the decisions of the Ninth      Circuit a significant problem. For the past seven years, the      number of published opinions issued by the circuit has      remained relatively constant. In large part due to      efficiencies and innovative case management methods pioneered      in the circuit, the court has been able to accurately      identify those selected precedential cases that truly merit      publication and those routine cases which are most      appropriately disposed of by a written decision sent only to      the parties.  7. Is the Ninth Circuit's Caseload Excessive When Compared to Other                                Circuits?       While the caseload for the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals      is the highest in the nation in absolute numbers, the      caseload level is clearly not excessive when compared to      other circuits, using either of two standard measurement      approaches.       Because federal statutes require that nearly all of the      work of an appellate court be conducted by three-judge      panels, the most accurate measure of a court's ability to      manage its caseload is the number of appeals filed and      terminated per panel. In 1994, the Ninth Circuit stood at 868      appeals filed per panel, very close to the median of 832 and      substantially below the numbers for the two circuits that emerged from      the split of the Fifth Circuit in 1980. For the same year,      the      Ninth Circuit stood at 914 appeals terminated per panel,      slightly above the median of 866.       Caseload levels may also be measured by case terminations      per judge. The current Ninth Circuit rate of merit case      terminations per judge is 446, a number which is exactly the      national median. By either measure, the caseload levels in      the Ninth Circuit approach the middle range for federal      appellate judges.       In contrast, under the proposed bill, the new Twelfth      Circuit, with nine judges, would seriously underutilize its      judicial resources and create huge disparities between the      two circuits. Using projected Twelfth Circuit filings of      1935, a nine-judge court would have 645 filings per panel.      The new Ninth Circuit, with 19 judges and filings of 6391,      would have 1014 filings per panel, or 57% more cases per      panel when compared to the judges in the Twelfth Circuit and      the third highest per panel filings figure in the nation.         7. is regionalism appropriate for an appellate court?       Sponsors of the legislation to divide the circuit cite the      need for a court free from domination by California judges      and California judicial philosophy. They assert that the      Northwest states confront emerging issues that are unique to      that region and that cannot be fully appreciated or addressed      from a California perspective.       The premise that a judge's place of residence prejudices      his or her determination of cases was rejected as completely      unacceptable by former Chief Justice Warren Burger in his      remarks concerning an earlier version of the sponsor's      legislation: ``I find it a very offensive statement to be      made that a United States judge, having taken the oath of      office, is going to be biased because of the economic      conditions of his own jurisdiction.'' (Record, August 2,      1991, S 12277) Calling an earlier version of legislation to      split the circuit ``environmental gerrymandering,'' then-     Senator Pete Wilson of California echoed Justice Burger's      concerns, stating:       The judges of the Circuit are there to apply the law, not      make it. Second, even in their application of the law, it is      not intended that federal courts abide by a sense of      localism. That is the role of the state and local courts.      Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals Reorganization Act of 1989:      Hearings on S. 948 Before the Subcomm. on Courts and      Administrative Practice of the Senate Comm. on the Judiciary,      101st Cong., 2d Sess. 286 (1990) (written statement of Hon.      Pete Wilson, U.S. Senate).       Similarly, the ABA Appellate Practice Committee's      Subcommittee To Study Circuit Size reported that ``a majority      of the Subcommittee questions whether regional differences      should be a criterion in determining circuit size. * * * The      role of circuit courts is primarily to apply federal law--a      law that with few exceptions is to be applied uniformly      across the land.'' (at p. 3).         8. What Is THE Ninth Circuit's Record of Performance?       One measure of the efficiency of an appellate court is the      average amount of time required to decide a case from the      period between filing a notice of appeal and rendering of a      final decision. In 1983, when an earlier version of      legislation to split the circuit was proposed, the court had      4583 new filings and the average length of time from filing      the notice of appeal to final decision was 10.5 months. In      late 1989, the court of appeals headquarter (where cases are      processed) was badly damaged and closed by the Loma Prieta      earthquake in San Francisco. Court staff was scattered among      six different temporary buildings until late 1991. During      this period, the court has 7257 new filings and the average      length of time from filing the notice of appeal to final      decision role to 15.6 months. Since the court was      consolidated in a single location in 1991, processing times      have substantially improved. In 1994, the most recent period      for which figures are available, the court received 8092 new      filings, and, despite vacancies, had reduced the average      length of time from filing the notice of appeal to final      decision to 14.5 months, slightly less than the time required      in the Eleventh Circuit.       The average time from filing to disposition, however, does      not accurately reflect the time the cases are actually in the      judges' hands. In the Ninth Circuit, the average time from      oral argument submission to disposition--that is, the actual      time the judges have the cases in their hands--is 1.9 months,      or .5 months less than the national average. In short, what      the court needs to reduce disposition times is more judges.      Hundreds of cases are available to be heard by judges; there      simply are not enough judges to hear them. This is the      ``swell'' in pending cases referred to when S. 853 was      introduced. 141 Cong. Rec. S7504 (daily ed. May 25. 1995) For      this reason, in 1992 the Ninth Circuit requested additional      judgeships. The Judicial Conference of the United States      endorsed the request which is now pending before Congress.      With four current vacancies on the court, the average time to      disposition is unlikely to improve substantially until new      judges come on board. Obviously this central problem would      not be alleviated by dividing the circuit and the proposed      split would materially increase the caseload of judges in the      remaining Ninth Circuit.       9. is circuit division the solution to growing caseloads?       The presumption that increasing the number of circuits      would solve the problem of expanding federal court caseloads      is the underlying fallacy of S. 956. Cases are resolved by      judges, not circuits, and increasing the number of circuits      without increasing the number of judges would only exacerbate      the problem.       Even with the proposed division of the Ninth Circuit, the      population shift and growth that is increasing litigation in      the West would continue to increase the workload of the two      new circuits. The old Fifth Circuit encountered the same      situation when it was divided into the Fifth and Eleventh      Circuits in 1980. Before the split, the Fifth Circuit had      4914 filings and 27 judgeships, compared to the Ninth      Circuit's 4262 filings and 23 judgeships. By 1994, the      combined Fifth and Eleventh Circuits' filings had increased      241% to 11,858, while the Ninth Circuit's had increased 190%      to 8115. Dividing the Fifth Circuit had no effect on the      growth of the caseload, which is at the root of the size      issue.       In its study on circuit size, the ABA Appellate Practice      Committee's Subcommittee to Study Circuit Size ``found no      compelling reasons why circuit courts of various sizes--     ranging from a few judges to fifty--cannot effectively meet      the caseload challenge. Indeed for every argument in favor      of smaller circuits, there is an equally compelling argument      for larger circuits.'' Report (October 1992), as p. 5. The      Federal Judicial Center's recent analysis of structural      alternatives in response to the mandate of the Federal      Court Study Committee concluded:       [T]here can be no doubt that the system and its judges are      under stress. That stress derives primarily from the      continuing expansion of federal jurisdiction without a      concomitant increase in resources. It does not appear to be a      stress that would be significantly relieved by structural      change to the appellate system at this time. Structural and      other Alternatives for the Federal Course of appeals (1993),      at p. 155.       The Ninth Circuit is functioning well and is handling its      caseload in a timely and responsible manner. It is a leader      in innovative case management techniques and its size offers      numerous advantages, including: the application of a uniform      body of law to wide geographic area, economies of scale in      case processing, the ability to serve as a laboratory for      experimentation in judicial administration and adjudication,      and the diversity of background of its members. The vast      majority of judges and lawyers in the circuit support      retention of the circuit in its present form and reject      circuit division as a response to the caseload crisis.
