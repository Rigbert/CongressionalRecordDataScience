 Monterey County's already fragile economy cannot afford the realignment of another major base.  Fort Hunter Liggett provides a total test and experimentation package to the Department of Defense. TEXCOM's isolated location provides unequaled access to extremely versatile training areas with a wide variety of weather and terrain conditions, controlled airspace to 24,000 feet, a 360-degree high energy laser testing area, isolation from ambient light and minimal radio frequency interference.  While Fort Hunter Liggett was evaluated in the BRAC process only as a training area, the base performs vital test and evaluation functions. Thus, the recommendation to realign Fort Hunter Liggett and move TEXCOM--a test and evaluation asset--is based on a flawed analysis that did not take into account TEXCOM's unique capabilities. The Director of Operational Test and Evaluation at the Defense Department has stated that moving TEXCOM would be a ``show stopper.''  Finally with regard to Fort Hunter Liggett, I do not believe that the proposed realignment is cost-effective. Information presented to the Commission staff by Monterey County officials regarding one-time costs, return on investment, and accumulated savings showed that the realignment of Fort Hunter Liggett is not cost-effective. However, I understand that this new information was not utilized by or presented to the Commission.  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of a letter from Mr. Phil Coyle, the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation, be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.
