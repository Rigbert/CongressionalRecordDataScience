Chairman, I rise in opposition, although I am not in opposition.  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 minutes.  There was no objection.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I congratulate my good friend, the gentlewoman from Wisconsin, for bringing forward this important amendment.  I think the key thing is what she said at the end, which is that the process may look good on paper but that that is not good enough when we are dealing with sovereign nations.  I have restored a tribe in my district and have worked a lot on tribal issues in my 28 years on the Natural Resources Committee. I have put an amendment into the FAST Act to allow tribal governance to take control of their Federal transportation funds so that the State isn't nicking money off the top and so that they actually can exert their sovereignty, and we have done that in some other areas for the tribes. This is, really, a critical amendment.  There is a real issue here. The tribes say, in the case of this pipeline, that they were not adequately consulted with. The Corps says, well, the box is checked. Thanks to the President, we are going to have a review of what really happened here. Obviously, this is not the only instance, and we need a broader review. We need to be sure that the Corps is fully cognizant of and recognizes the sovereignty of tribal nations so that they have in place a real and full consultation process for anything that may affect any tribe or reservation in the United States.  I think this is a great amendment and very timely, and I urge my colleagues to support it.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
