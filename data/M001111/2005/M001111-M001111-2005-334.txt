 President, last night, when I listened to the President of the United States, he called on the American public--he called on all of us--asking our young men and women to consider service to our country overseas. Part of that commitment is not just asking them to serve but being there for them.  He also called on all of us to put our flags up on the Fourth of July and to be proud as Americans and to honor those who are serving us and to tell them we are proud of them by raising our flags.  The other thing we can do is adopt this amendment on the supplemental and get the White House to agree with us to make it an emergency to provide the services that are necessary. We will raise our flags, we will honor our veterans, we will be proud of our soldiers, but we will also be there to take care of them when they come home.  That is what the Murray amendment will do today. I am proud to join with Senator Craig, Senator Hutchison, and others from the other side to do what is right. I call on the other Members of Congress, as well as the White House, to join us in this effort.  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
