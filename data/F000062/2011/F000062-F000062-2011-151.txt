 President, I rise again today with my friend and colleague from Kentucky, Senator McConnell, to submit the joint resolution to renew the import ban on Burma for another year.  We are proud to be joined in this effort by two champions for democracy, human rights, and the rule of law in Burma, Senators McCain and Durbin, and we look forward to swift action by the Congress and the President on this important matter.  Congressman Joseph Crowley and Congressman Peter King are introducing this resolution in the House and I appreciate their leadership and support.  Since we last debated the import ban on the Senate floor, we have received one bit of good news, but also, sadly, more confirmation on the urgent need to keep the pressure on the ruling military regime.  On November 13, 2010, Nobel Peace Prize laureate and leader of the democratic opposition, Aung San Suu Kyi, was released from house arrest.  While her latest detention lasted more than 7\1/2\ years, she had spent the better part of the past 20 years in prison or under house arrest.  Her release was wonderful news for those of us who have been inspired by her courage, her dedication to peace and her tireless efforts for freedom and democracy for the people of Burma.  Yet our joy was tempered by the fact that her release came just days after fraudulent and illegitimate elections for a new parliament based on a sham constitution.  The regime's intent was clear: keep the voice of the true leader of Burma silent long enough until they could solidify their grip on power using the false veneer of a democratic process.  Neither I, the people of Burma, nor the international community were fooled.  We all know that the last truly free parliamentary elections were overwhelmingly won by Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy in 1990 but annulled by the military junta.  This new constitution was drafted in secret and without the input of the democratic opposition led by Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy.  It set aside 25 percent of the seats in the new 440 seat House of Representatives for the military.  This would be in addition to the seats won by the ``Union Solidarity and Development Party'' founded by the military junta's Prime Minister Thein Sein and 22 of his fellow cabinet members who resigned from the army to form the ``civilian'' political party.  It barred Suu Kyi from running in the parliamentary elections.  And it forced the National League for Democracy to shut its doors because it would not kick Suu Kyi out of the party.  It should come as no surprise that the military backed party won nearly 80 percent of the seats in the new parliament.  In addition to preventing Suu Kyi and the National League for Democracy from competing in the elections, the regime ensured that no international monitors would oversee the elections and journalists would be prohibited from covering the election from inside Burma.  President Obama correctly stated that the elections ``were neither free nor fair, and failed to meet any of the internationally accepted standards associated with legitimate elections.''  The National League for Democracy described the elections and the formation of a new government as reducing ``democratization in Burma to a parody.''  Indeed, the new parliament elected Thein Sein, the last prime minister of the junta's State Peace and Development Council, as Burma's new president.  He is reported to be heavily influenced by Burma's senior military leader and former head of state, General Than Shwe.  So, the names change--the State Law and Order Restoration Council, the State Peace and Development Council, the Union Solidarity and Development Party--but the faces, and the lack of democracy, human rights, and the rule of law, remain the same.  So, while we celebrate the release of Aung San Suu Kyi, we recognize that Burma is not yet free and the regime has failed to take the necessary actions which allow for the import ban to be lifted.  As called for in the original Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act, we must stand by the people of Burma and keep the pressure on the military regime to end violations of internationally recognized human rights; release all political prisoners; allow freedom of speech and press; allow freedom of association; permit the peaceful exercise of religion; and bring to a conclusion an agreement between the military regime and the National League for Democracy and Burma's ethnic minorities on the restoration of a democratic government.  Until the regime changes its behavior and embraces positive, democratic change, we have no choice but to press on with the import ban as a part of a strong sanctions regime.  This also includes tough banking sanctions.  I would like to take this opportunity to once again urge the administration to put additional pressure on the ruling military junta by exercising the authority for additional banking sanctions on its leaders and followers as mandated by section 5 of the Tom Lantos Block Burmese Junta's Anti-Democratic Efforts Act.  Some of my colleagues may be concerned about the effectiveness of the import ban and other sanctions on Burma and the impact on the people of Burma.  I understand their concerns. I am disappointed that we have not seen more progress towards freedom and democracy in Burma.  But let us listen to the voice of the democratic opposition in Burma about the sanctions policy of the United States and the international community.  A paper released by Aung San Suu Kyi and the National League for Democracy argues that these sanctions are not targeted at the general population and are not to blame for the economic ills of the country.  Rather, the economy suffers due to mismanagement, cronyism, corruption and the lack of the rule of law.  The best way for the Burmese government to get the sanctions lifted, the paper argues, is to make progress on democracy, human rights, and the rule of law.  It concludes:       Now more than ever there is an urgent need to call for an      all inclusive political process. The participation of a broad      spectrum of political forces is essential to the achievement      of national reconciliation in Burma. Progress in the      democratization process, firmly grounded in national      reconciliation, and the release of political prisoners should      be central to any consideration of changes in sanctions      policies.  I agree.  So, let us once again do our part and stand in solidarity with Aung San Suu Kyi and the people of Burma.  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.                          ____________________
