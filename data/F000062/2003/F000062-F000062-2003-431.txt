 President, I wish to honor Mr. Stanley Hirsh, a California businessman, and publisher of the widely read Los Angeles Jewish Journal, who dedicated his life to others. Mr. Hirsh lost his battle with brain cancer and passed away on March 22nd. Mr. Hirsh left behind his wife, Anita, four children, and four grandchildren. He was 76.  While Mr. Hirsh was a highly successful businessman, he will be remembered, to quote the Jewish Journal, as a ``maverick philanthropist.'' Such a title was earned by Mr. Hirsh's plethora of donations to various charity organizations, his service during World War II in the United States Navy, and his formation of twelve kosher kitchens for Jewish seniors in the Los Angeles area.  In addition to his dedication to philanthropy, Mr. Hirsh sought to positively affect Arab-Israeli relations. In the early nineties, Mr. Hirsh and his family formed the Hirsh Family Early Childhood Development Center in Tel Aviv.  While no single accomplishment defined Mr. Hirsh, his friends remember him as an altruistic man who was steadfast in his leadership. Friend and Congressman Howard L. Berman recalled Hirsh as ``a real generalist, interested in matters of the greater community.''  Mr. Hirsh's dedication to community service is evidenced by his stint as president at the Jewish Federation, and in the mid 1980s, he chaired the United Jewish Fund General Campaign. Interestingly, Mr. Hirsh was the greatest contributor to the campaign.  Mr. Hirsh owned the Cooper Building in downtown Los Angeles and was a former chairman of the Community Redevelopment Agency in the city of Los Angeles.  Employees of Mr. Hirsh at the Jewish Journal remember him as being obsessed with fair and balanced reporting. Editor-in-Chief of the periodical, Robert Eshman, said that the paper grew ``significantly'' under Stanley's leadership.  People of Stanley Hirsh's caliber do not come very often and while his accomplishments still resonate, and his warmth and kindness honored, Mr. Hirsh will be sorely missed.                          ____________________
