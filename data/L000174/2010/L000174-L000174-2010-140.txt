They do protect our rights. They do protect the Constitution. But we have to make sure we respect what they do. We need judges and Justices who will fairly apply the law and use common sense, Justices and judges who appreciate the proper role of the courts in our democracy and make decisions in light of the fundamental purposes of the law. This is the standard I applied when reviewing this nomination. It is the same standard I applied to every Supreme Court nomination, including six Justices nominated by Republican Presidents for whom I have voted. It is a standard I believe Solicitor General Kagan has met.  Solicitor General Kagan not only has the necessary qualifications to be a Supreme Court Justice but has also demonstrated her respect for the rule of law, her appreciation for the separation of powers, and understands the meaning of our Constitution. Some may not want our country to move forward, to make progress, to move toward a more perfect union. But the issue squarely before this body is whether Solicitor General Kagan has the necessary qualifications, respect for the rule of law, and judicial independence to be confirmed by the Senate to serve on our Nation's highest court. I believe she does. This Vermonter will vote for Elena Kagan to be a Supreme Court Justice, and I will do it proudly.  Madam President--the Chair having changed during this speech, first presided over by the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, and now my distinguished neighbor, the State of New Hampshire--the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire presides. With that, I will close.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
