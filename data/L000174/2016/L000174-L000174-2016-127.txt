President, for the past 3 years, David Medine has served as chairman of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, PCLOB--the first chairman finally to be confirmed after Congress reestablished the PCLOB as an independent agency and strengthened its authority. Under his leadership, the PCLOB has worked diligently to review surveillance programs and make recommendations to protect individual privacy and civil liberties. Mr. Medine recently announced that he will be leaving government service to join a nonprofit organization that serves low-income and disadvantaged individuals. He will be missed.  Mr. Medine was confirmed at a critical time, just a month before the first Snowden revelations in June 2013. In response to reports that the NSA had been collecting Americans' phone records in bulk for years under section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act, he guided the PCLOB's work in reviewing that program and releasing a comprehensive report in January 2014. The recommendations in that landmark report included ending the bulk collection of Americans' phone records, installing an amicus at the FISA Court, and instituting a number of other privacy protections. Many of these recommendations were subsequently enacted into law in the bipartisan USA FREEDOM Act of 2015.  Under Mr. Medine's leadership, the PCLOB also released a detailed unclassified report in July 2014 on surveillance conducted pursuant to section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which is slated to expire at the end of next year. This report includes a valuable unclassified explanation of the implementation of section 702. These reports and Mr. Medine's related testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee have been tremendously beneficial to Congress and the American people in examining government surveillance programs.  Mr. Medine's public service spans more than 20 years. Over the course of his career, he has earned a reputation as a thoughtful and well-respected authority on privacy and data security issues. I commend Mr. Medine for his dedicated public service and efforts to protect the privacy and civil liberties of the American people, and I wish him well in this new chapter.
