Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds.  Mr. Chairman, once again the opponents of this bill are wrong. The gentlewoman from California (Ms. Waters) is talking about Enron and WorldCom cases being removed to Federal court. They already are there. Both of these corporations have filed for bankruptcy. Once there is a bankruptcy filing by anybody, the cases are heard in Federal court, simple as that.  I really would hope that they get their facts straight before they attack the bill the next time.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Feeney).
