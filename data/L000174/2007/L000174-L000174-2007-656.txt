He is going to be testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee tomorrow morning. We anticipate it will be for much of the day. He wished to inform me, as he did Senator Specter, of some changes in the so-called FISA Program. I have been very critical of the administration's actions through the National Security Agency--their wiretapping of Americans, wiretapping of people throughout the country, and apparently doing so without obtaining any warrants.  Interestingly enough, the information about this spying on Americans came not from our administration reporting it either through the Intelligence Committee or the Judiciary Committee or the appropriate committees involved; it came out because, like so many other things we find out about, we read about it first in the newspaper.  Apparently, the administration has decided not to continue this warrantless spying program on Americans, but instead to seek approval for all wiretaps from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. I say this based on the letter sent to us. This is public; this is not a classified matter. The law has required for years that they do it this way.  I welcome the President's decision not to reauthorize the NSA's warrantless spying program because, as I have pointed out for some time, and as other Senators on both sides of the aisle have pointed out, the program was, at very best, of doubtful legality.  Since this program was first revealed, I have urged this administration to inform Congress of what the Government is doing and to comply with the checks and balances Congress wrote into law in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.  We know we must engage in all surveillance necessary to prevent acts of terrorism, but we can and we should do it in ways that protect the basic rights of all Americans, including the right to privacy.  The issue has never been whether to monitor suspected terrorists--everybody agrees with that; all Americans do. The question is whether we can do it legally and with proper checks and balances to prevent abuses. Providing efficient but meaningful court review is a major step toward addressing those concerns.  I continue to urge the President to fully inform Congress and the American people about the contours of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court order authorizing the surveillance program and of the program itself. Only with meaningful oversight can we assure the balance necessary to achieve security with liberty.  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of a letter from the Attorney General, dated January 17, addressed to me and Senator Specter, which indicates copies to numerous other people, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                         The Attorney General,                                 Washington, DC, January 17, 2007.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.     Hon. Arlen Specter,     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S.          Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Leahy and Senator Specter: I am writing to      inform you that on January 10, 2007, a Judge of the Foreign      Intelligence Surveillance Court issued orders authorizing the      Government to target for collection international      communications into or out of the United States where there      is probable cause to believe that one of the communicants is      a member or agent of al Qaeda or an associated terrorist      organization. As a result of these orders, any electronic      surveillance that was occurring as part of the Terrorist      Surveillance Program will now be conducted subject to the      approval of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.       In the spring of 2005--well before the first press account      disclosing the existence of the Terrorist Surveillance      Program--the Administration began exploring options for      seeking such FISA Court Approval. Any court authorization had      to ensure that the Intelligence Community would have the      speed and agility necessary to protect the Nation from al      Qaeda--the very speed and agility that was offered by the      Terrorist Surveillance Program. These orders are innovative,      they are complex, and it took considerable time and work for      the Government to develop the approach that was proposed to      the Court and for the Judge on the FISC to consider and      approve these orders.       The President is committed to using all lawful tools to      protect our Nation from the terrorist threat, including      making maximum use of the authorities provided by FISA and      taking full advantage of developments in the law. Although,      as we have previously explained, the Terrorist Surveillance      Program fully complies with the law, the orders the      Government has obtained will allow the necessary speed and      agility while providing substantial advantages. Accordingly,      under these circumstances, the President has determined not      to reauthorize the Terrorist Surveillance Program when the      current authorization expires.       The Intelligence Committees have been briefed on the highly      classified details of these orders. In addition, I have      directed Steve Bradbury, Acting Assistant Attorney General      for the Office of Legal Counsel, and Ken Wainstein, Assistant      Attorney General for National Security, to provide a      classified briefing to you on the details of these orders.           Sincerely,                                              Alberto R. Gonzales,                                                 Attorney General.
