President, I am disappointed that the majority continues to refuse to reconvene the conference on juvenile justice legislation.  This Congress has kept the country waiting far too long for action on juvenile justice legislation and sensible gun safety laws. We are fast approaching the first-year anniversary of the shooting at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado. Next Thursday will sadly mark one year since fourteen students and a teacher lost their lives in that tragedy on April 20, 1999.  It has been 11 months since the Senate passed the Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice bill by an overwhelming vote of 73-25. Our bipartisan bill includes modest yet effective gun safety provisions. It has been 10 months since the House of Representatives passed its own juvenile crime bill on June 17, 1999. It has been 9 months since the House and Senate juvenile justice conference met for the first--and only--time on August 5, 1999, less than 24 hours before the Congress adjourned for its long August recess.  Senate and House Democrats have been ready for months to reconvene the juvenile justice conference and work with Republicans to craft an effective juvenile justice conference report that includes reasonable gun safety provisions, but the majority refuses to act. Indeed, on October 20, 1999, all the House and Senate Democratic conferees wrote to Senator Hatch, the Chairman of the juvenile justice conference, and Congressman Hyde, the Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, to reconvene the conference immediately. This week, Congressman Hyde joined our call for the juvenile justice conference to meet as soon as possible in a letter to Senator Hatch, which was also signed by Congressman Conyers.  Every parent, teacher and student in this country is concerned about school violence over the last two years and worried about when the next shooting may occur. They only hope it does not happen at their school or involve their children.  We all recognize that there is no single cause and no single legislative solution that will cure the ill of youth violence in our schools or in our streets. But we have an opportunity before us to do our part. We should seize this opportunity to act on balanced, effective juvenile justice legislation, and measures to keep guns out of the hands of children and away from criminals.  It is ironic that the Senate will be in recess next week on the anniversary of the Columbine tragedy. In fact, the Senate has been in recess more than in session since the one ceremonial meeting of the juvenile crime conference committee. I hope we get to work soon and finish what we started in the juvenile justice conference. It is well past the time for Congress to act.  I ask unanimous consent that this Hyde-Conyers letter of April 11, 2000 be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         House of Representatives, Congress of the United States,            Committee on the Judiciary,                                   Washington, DC, April 11, 2000.     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Hatch: We write to request a juvenile justice      conference meeting as soon as possible.       As you are aware, in the last two months, we have witnessed      a succession of gun violence tragedies. We have been shocked      by a six-year-old shooting a six-year-old in Mount Morris      Township, Michigan. We have seen a nursing home held hostage      and a mass shooting in Pittsburgh. In February, Memphis      firefighters responding to a call were shot and killed by a      disturbed man. It is clear that the Nation would like      Congress to respond.       We know that there is not complete agreement on all of the      issues before the Conference. We also recognize the need for      compromise. We have already agreed in principle to proposed      language to reduce the waiting period to 24 hours in most      cases, but are still trying to resolve appropriate ``safety      hatch'' exceptions.       We have pledged to each other to begin anew negotiations.      We believe, however, that beginning the work of the      Conference will play a constructive role in the necessary      process of narrowing our differences.       We appreciate your consideration of this request.           Sincerely,     Henry J. Hyde,                              Chairman, House Judiciary Committee.     John Conyers, Jr.,     Ranking Member, House Judiciary Committee.                          ____________________
