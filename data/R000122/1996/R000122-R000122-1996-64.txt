Speaker, I am pleased to introduce, along with my colleagues Mr. Schumer of New York, Mr. Pallone of New Jersey, and Mr. Miller of California, President Clinton's Environmental Crimes and Enforcement Act of 1996.  Our Nation's environmental quality is among the best in the world, in part thanks to laws like the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Clean Air Act that we have passed here in Congress. Over the last 25 years, these laws have worked to make our air cleaner, our water safe to drink, our lakes and rivers safe to swim in. But these laws are only pieces of paper. Effective enforcement of these laws is needed to protect public health and environmental quality.  The Environmental Crimes and Enforcement Act will provide new tools to investigate and prosecute environmental crimes.  For example, the bill adds an attempt provision to environmental statutes so that environmental crimes can be prosecuted even when law enforcement agents come upon and stop a crime in progress. Under current law, if agents conducting surveillance of a hazardous waste transporter stop the transporter from illegally dumping the hazardous waste, the perpetrator cannot be prosecuted for illegal dumping because no crime has occurred. Only if the agents were to allow the dumpers to complete their crime, and possibly cause damage to the environment and risk to public health, could the perpetrators be prosecuted. With an attempt provision, illegal dumpers can be stopped before causing environmental damage and still be held responsible for their actions. Also, an attempt provision will allow Federal agents to use benign substitutes for hazardous wastes in undercover operations.  The act would also extend the statute of limitations where the violator has concealed the environmental crime. In one typical incident, a waste hauler buried 55-gallon drums of toxic waste in a vacant lot rather than disposing of them properly. The concealed drums deteriorated and leaked, causing environmental contamination. Because the drums were not discovered within the short statute of limitations, no criminal charges could be brought against the hauler. This provision will ensure that polluters cannot escape justice by hiding their wrongdoing.  The bill would enhance penalties where a criminal violation of environmental law causes a death or serious injury. Police officers, fire fighters, and members of the public can suffer serious injury or death from toxic chemicals or other hazardous materials--it is appropriate to make the punishment fit the crime in these cases.  The bill will also enable Federal courts to ensure that those charged with environmental crimes do not shield or dispose of assets needed to pay for restitution.  In my home State of Rhode Island, the U.S. attorney, the EPA, the State attorney general, and the State Department of Environmental Management have formed a taskforce to target and prioritize environmental enforcement issues. This taskforce is accompanied by a citizen's advisory group that suggests priorities for enforcement. In a State like Rhode Island, where tourism and economic growth depend upon a clean and healthy environment, this type of cooperation is essential. The Environmental Crimes and Enforcement Act will enhance such partnerships between Federal law enforcement and State, local, and tribal governments.  As Attorney General Janet Reno said when announcing this proposal, ``The American people want, and have a right to expect, strong environmental protection. This bill will provide us with better tools'' to achieve those goals.                          ____________________
