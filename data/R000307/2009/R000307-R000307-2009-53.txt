. Marine Corps is celebrating its birthday. As I speak, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, the Drum and Bugle Corps and various and assorted marines are over in the Russell Building. I am to cut the cake, and I am getting into deeper and deeper trouble if we delay the ceremonies to the degree they could be delayed. If somebody wants to talk, obviously, you have 7 minutes, but I appreciate any consideration you might be able to give us.
