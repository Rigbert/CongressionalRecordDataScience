 President, everything the Senator from Michigan said, I agree with. I would just do it in a different way. I would do it according to the budget resolution that was adopted.  In that budget resolution, we fully protect Part A. It is a commitment on the part of this party, this Congress, and the President of the United States to only use Medicare money for Medicare, nothing else. That is what we will do.  This amendment is not needed because of the budget and the planning on this tax bill. This issue comes up every time we are trying to spread out the tax reductions over the next 10 years. It is very basic to every decision we make that we not go into the Medicare trust fund.  I ask Members not to vote for the amendment because it is not needed.  I raise a point of order on germaneness. That point of order is based upon section 305(b)(2) of the Budget Act.
