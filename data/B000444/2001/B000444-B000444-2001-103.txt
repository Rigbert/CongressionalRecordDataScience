Res. 143       Whereas tens of millions of Americans have served in the      Armed Forces of the United States during the past century;       Whereas hundreds of thousands of Americans have given their      lives while serving in the Armed Forces during the past      century;       Whereas the contributions and sacrifices of the men and      women who served in the Armed Forces have been vital in      maintaining our freedoms and way of life;       Whereas the advent of the all-volunteer Armed Forces has      resulted in a sharp decline in the number of individuals and      families who have had any personal connection with the Armed      Forces;       Whereas this reduction in familiarity with the Armed Forces      has resulted in a marked decrease in the awareness by young      people of the nature and importance of the accomplishments of      those who have served in our Armed Forces, despite the      current educational efforts of the Department of Veterans      Affairs and the veterans service organizations;       Whereas our system of civilian control of the Armed Forces      makes it essential that the Nation's future leaders      understand the history of military action and the      contributions and sacrifices of those who conduct such      actions; and       Whereas on June 14, 2001, the Senate adopted an amendment      to the Better Education for Students and Teachers Act      expressing the sense of the Senate that the Secretary of      Education should work with the Secretary of Veterans Affairs,      the Veterans Day National Committee, and the veterans service      organizations to encourage, prepare, and disseminate      educational materials and activities for elementary and      secondary school students aimed at increasing awareness of      the contributions of veterans to the prosperity and freedoms      enjoyed by United States citizens: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--       (1) the week of November 11 through November 17, 2001, be      designated as ``National Veterans Awareness Week'' for the      purpose of emphasizing educational efforts directed at      elementary and secondary school students concerning the      contributions and sacrifices of veterans; and       (2) the President should issue a proclamation calling on      the people of the United States to observe such week with      appropriate educational activities.
