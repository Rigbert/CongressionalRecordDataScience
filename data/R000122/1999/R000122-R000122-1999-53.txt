President, let me continue.  My amendment would simply state that OSHA has the authority to conduct an inspection when a minor, someone under 18 years of age, is killed on a farm regardless of the size of the farm, but they would also be prevented from levying any type of fine or enforcement action. Their role would be very simple and very direct: Find the cause of the action; then, not with respect to that particular farm, not with respect to any particular sanction of penalty, generally, if they can learn something that would help protect the lives of others, they would incorporate that, of course, in their overall directions and regulations for farming and other activities.  These goals are very simple and straightforward: Identify the cause of the accident so that the employer knows what steps are needed to prevent similar deaths, and make that information available so that other farmers can take steps to avert similar tragedies.  This is not an academic or arcane issue because there are numerous youngsters working on farms. There are also in the United States about 500 work-related deaths reported each year. Moreover, although only 8 percent of all workers under the age of 18 are employed in agriculture, more than 40 percent of the work-related deaths among young people occur in the agricultural industry.  So this is an issue of importance.  Let me stress something else. This particular amendment would only apply if the individual youngster was, in fact, an employee of the farm. This would not affect a situation where a son or daughter are doing chores around the farm. This is a situation when someone is hired to work on the farm, and that person is involved in a fatal accident. I think it is only fair because I believe the parents in America, when they send their children into the workplace--be it a supermarket or McDonald's or a farm, large or small--expect their children will at least have the coverage of many of the safety laws we have in place; but failing that, at least we will have the power, the authority, the ability to determine what happened in the case of a fatal accident.  This proposal is not unique to the situation I found in Rhode Island. The National Research Council, an arm of the National Academy of Science, issued a report entitled ``Protecting Youth at Work,'' and among the recommendations:       To ensure the equal protection of children and adolescents      from health and safety hazards in agriculture, Congress      should take an examination of the effects and feasibility of      extending all relevant Occupational Safety and Health      Administration regulations to agricultural workers, including      subjecting small farms to the same level of OSHA enforcement      as that apply to other small businesses.  My proposal goes not to that great length, not to that extreme. It is much more constrained and limited. It simply says when there is a fatality involving an employee under 18 years of age on a farm--small or large--OSHA can conduct an inspection to determine the cause and perhaps propose remedial actions but cannot invoke any type of sanction or fine.  That is the height of reasonableness, given the experiences we have seen, given the report of the National Academy of Science, given all of these factors.  I believe this should be done. In fact, it is long overdue. It is simple justice, not only for the families of those youngsters who are fatally injured on these small farms, but also it will give us the impetus to save lives in the future.  Some have criticized this amendment as potentially imposing an undue burden on small farms. This is erroneous criticism. There is no burden here other than facing up to the facts and finding out what happened. Indeed, I believe knowledge is power; if we know what caused these accidents, we can prevent them and, even, I hope, make the operators of these farms more conscious of what they are doing, particularly as they employ youngsters.  This is an amendment I believe is important; it is critical. I offered a variation on this amendment in the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions when we were consideringthe SAFE Act. We had a vigorous debate but, I will admit, it met resistance.  I believe passionately we can do something and we must do something. I also recognize this process will not end today, that in the last few hours or moments of this debate it is unlikely this amendment will pass. I will, as I indicated to the Senator from Pennsylvania, withdraw the amendment. Such withdrawal does not signify retreat by me on this issue. I will continue to look for ways in which we can have investigations of fatalities on small farms, not because of any animus toward large or small farms but because when someone loses a child, I believe they deserve an answer. What happened? How did it happen? How can other children be spared from such a fatality?  In that spirit, I will continue to advance this issue and look for additional ways we can get an investigation. Again, the emphasis is not on being punitive; the emphasis is on being, first of all, fair to the family; and second, of being remedial so we can address problems that may be systematic and prevalent not just on the site of the particular fatality but endemic and systematic throughout the farming community.                     Amendment No. 1866, Withdrawn  With that, I yield back my time, and I ask unanimous consent the amendment be withdrawn.
