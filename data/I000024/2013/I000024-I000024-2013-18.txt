Specifically, 10 days ago, we were meeting and putting this together--the big four, as they call it. It had 27 specific reforms in this area to support victims, to encourage sexual assault reporting, and, in addition, nine enhancements to the military justice system.  I mentioned our good friend from South Carolina, who is probably the expert in this area, and we consulted him, along with a lot of the other people, both Senator Gillibrand and Senator McCaskill had amendments and we have bits out of each one of those amendments they had. They are both better off than they were before. But without this, we got nothing--no changes at all.  So we have made great progress in this bill in the sexual assaults, as well as I mentioned Gitmo too which is a very controversial issue.  Mr. McCAIN. Would the Senator agree that even though there is significant difference between Senator Gillibrand and Senator McCaskill, they were in agreement with the many provisions my colleague just pointed out, which, whether we address their disagreements or not, they were both agreed these are very important measures they both agree on, that the entire committee agreed on in addressing this issue of sexual assaults in the military.
