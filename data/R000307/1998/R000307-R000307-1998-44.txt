President, I rise today to compliment the men and women of our sea services, the U.S. Marine Corps and the U.S. Navy, on an operation recently conducted. It was about a month ago in the African country of Eritrea. I think we should all be very proud of the way the Navy and the Marine Corps team responded to what I refer to as a 911 call, to execute an evacuation operation, commonly called a NEO, in that part of the world in Africa. It resulted from the unrest that this country, Eritrea, has had with its neighbor, Ethiopia. Let me highlight the action as it unfolded.  On the evening of the June 5 of this year, the marines and sailors of the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit, part of a forward-deployed Amphibious Ready Group, received what is called a warning order. A warning order is a ``heads up'' that a specific tasking is about to come your way and you had better start thinking about the mission that is contained in the warning order. That mission was the removal of American citizens from Eritrea because of the increasing unrest, as I have indicated, with Ethiopia. The marines, who had just finished conducting an exercise in Jordan, began their preparations right off the bat.  At 3:30 in the afternoon of the 6th of June, the commanding officer, Colonel T.L. Moore, as ordered by General Anthony Zinni, the Commander in Chief of the U.S. Central Command, launched two C-130 aircraft along with 30 marines and sailors from this expeditionary unit. They arrived in Asmara, Eritrea, and began removing U.S. citizens and personnel from other countries. At 11:50 p.m., on that same day, the mission was complete.  What mission?  These superb marines and sailors removed from harm's way, and to safety, 105 American citizens, 24 Norwegians, 20 who were British, 8 Canadians, 3 Ethiopians, 3 Japanese, 1 Korean, 1 Mexican, and 1 Swedish civilian. I am told the C-130s were proudly flying the Stars and Stripes in regards to this mission instead of their usual command banner strictly as a matter of pride in their mission and their nation.  Also as part of this continuing effort, the U.S.S. Tarawa got underway at 3 p.m. on the 6th and steamed at full speed to the coast of Eritrea to wait for any further requests for NEO assistance in case any more problems did, simply, come up.  I think the remarkable thing about the Tarawa is that the ship did actually prepare for this mission and got underway in less than 72 hours.  There was not any fanfare in the press about this. There were no stories in the media about the successful effort or pride of our men and women involved in this important mission. I think probably too many times the only military stories we hear about are some isolated event involving a service member that creates a negative headline, or some controversial issue, like today we are hearing over the media that somehow or other we are going to lessen or keep or improve or make more stringent the rules of the military in regards to adultery.  I just wanted to take this opportunity to share this mission with my colleagues because it reflects, I think, the pride and the professionalism that is the standard of the vast majority of the members of our Armed Forces. It is so infrequent that we in the Congress really salute these fine Americans.  So, Semper Fi and Bravo Zulu to the men and women of the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit, the U.S.S. Tarawa, and all other members of our Corps and Navy involved in this effort.                          ____________________
