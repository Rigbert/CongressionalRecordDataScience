Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a woman who has dedicated her life's work to peace in the Middle East and who will share her story at the Eleventh Annual Grand Banquet of the Greater Toledo Association of Arab-Americans on October 16, 1999. As a daughter of Ramallah, she is considered by many in northwest Ohio from El-Bireh as a sister, part of their families.  Dr. Hanan Ashrawi has been the human face of the Palestinians. As the official spokesperson for the Palestinian delegation to the Middle East peace process, she has told the world the story of her people, the pain they have felt and their hopes for the future. Her passion and her commitment to her people and to peace have led some to call her one of the most influential women of the 20th century.  Her dedication to peace can be traced to the influence of her parents. When she was a child, her father told her to ``be daring in the pursuit of the right.'' She has taken the words to heart.  In fact, it was her father's dedication to the written word that has had a lasting effect on Dr. Ashrawi. She is a woman of letters: a poet, a playwright, an author, and a professor of English. She sees the power that words hold--the power of ideas.  Dr. Ashrawi sees peace as based on the sanctity of human rights, especially the rights of women. She helped to found the Jerusalem Center for Women and works with many groups across the globe, including the Palestine Center for Human Rights; the Carter Center and the Fund for the Future of Our Children.  John Foster Dulles once said ``You have to take chances for peace, just as you must take chances in war * * *'' Dr. Ashrawi is not one who has been afraid to take chances--to reach out for compromise, to lend her voice for her people, and to be a strong woman.  Mr. Speaker, our nation was built on the principle of freedom of the people. We have an obligation as the world's harbinger of freedom to work with those dedicated to this principle as well. I congratulate Dr. Ashrawi on her life's work of freedom and peace.                          ____________________
