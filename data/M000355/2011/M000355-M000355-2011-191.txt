 President, let me add to the remarks of the distinguished majority leader and say congratulations to our brandnew Senator from Nevada for his outstanding inaugural address. He is off to a very fast start representing the people of Nevada and doing a wonderful job. I congratulate him again for an outstanding address.  I yield the floor.
