 President, I rise today to honor Dress for Success Lexington and its Kentucky co-founders, Analisa Wagoner and Jennifer Monarch. It was my distinct pleasure to help these women secure 501(c)(3) nonprofit status from the IRS for their business, and I am honored to know that I have played a role, albeit a minor one, in all the good that will continue to come of Wagoner and Monarch's venture.  Dress for Success was founded in New York City in 1997. Since then the organization had expanded into 128 cities around the world, including locations in Louisville and Lexington, KY.  As its name suggests, Dress for Success provides gently used, professional clothes to disadvantaged women. This is not, however, the totality of the organization's services. Looking the part is indeed a piece of the equation, but to ensure success they also provide counseling and training as their clients navigate the jobs market and begin work.  Jennifer and Analisa opened the doors to Dress for Success Lexington over a year ago. In the intervening time, they were inundated with enough clothing donations to render their initial location inoperable. Theirs is a business model that does not work unless people are willing to give. Fortunately, helping others in need is second nature for the people of Lexington, KY.  Last September, Dress for Success Lexington moved into a newer, much larger location in the Eastland Shopping Center. And with its newly acquired non-profit status, which makes the organization eligible for certain grants, donations, and a tax-exempt status, the future looks decidedly bright for Dress for Success Lexington.  Dress for Success Lexington is a model for serving the community. They are not just helping people--more importantly they are providing the tools and training for women to help themselves, and in turn do the same for others.  Therefore, I ask that my Senate colleagues join me in paying tribute to these exemplary citizens and Dress for Success Lexington.  Mr. President, the Lexington Herald-Leader recently published an article profiling Analisa Wagoner and Jennifer Monarch, and their work with Dress for Success Lexington. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows:           [From the Lexington Herald-Leader, Aug. 21, 2013]  Dress for Success Lexington Has Found a Home, Plans To Open in Late                                September                           (By Merlene Davis)       I wrote about Analisa Wagoner and Jennifer Monarch in April      as they were being overrun by mounds of gently worn clothing.       They had run out of room for the generous donations from      Lexington women who were more than willing to help their less      fortunate sisters get on their feet.       A bit overwhelmed but definitely not discouraged, Wagoner      and Monarch had been approved to start a local affiliate of      the     international Dress for Success program which provides      professional attire, a support network and career development      tools to help women become economically independent.       Now I am writing about them because they have secured a      permanent home for Dress for Success Lexington in the      Eastland Shopping Center. It will open in late September. The      non-profit will be the second such program in Kentucky.      Louisville's affiliate was established in 2000.       Wagoner said the new location is getting spruced up and      painted, the furnace is being replaced and a dressing room is      being added.       ``We are still in that process,'' she said. ``In the ideal,      fingers-crossed time line, we may get the keys by the end of      the week.''       That will be followed by the addition of furniture and      clothing racks.       Meanwhile, the women have scheduled the first of many      mandatory orientation and training sessions for volunteers.      People are needed in administration, inventory, fundraising,      outreach, and technical and graphic areas. Soon, there will      be a need for volunteers in the career center to conduct mock      interviews, offer job search tips and edit resumes and cover      letters. The training session will be held at the Central      Library downtown.       ``That is where we held our start-up meeting in May,''      Wagoner said. ``We have come so far since then. We've come      full circle.''       The sessions are geared to get everyone on the same page,      she said. A video provided by the worldwide organization will      be shown, featuring Joi Gordon, chief executive officer, who      will talk about the program.       Those in attendance will be able to select their preferred      area in which to help.       The Eastland site has more than 2,000 square feet of space      and was the ``last missing piece of the puzzle,'' Monarch      said. It will be enough space for organized racks of      professional clothing, two dressing rooms, an area with      computers, and office space.       ``With the space, we have everything we need to start      helping women, which is our No. 1 and only goal,'' she said.       Clients are helped through referral only, Wagoner said, and      after completing a job training program through a government      or social services agency.       The client then works with a volunteer personal shopper who      helps her select appropriate attire and also provides support      and encouragement as she prepares for job interviews.       After landing a job, the client can then return for more      clothing and support.       On Sept. 19, referral agencies will be invited to an open      house to learn about the program's mission. But that's not      all the events being planned. On Oct. 1, Mayor Jim Gray will      be on hand for the official opening.       And on Oct. 17, local designers, who have been given      outfits that aren't suited for the workplace, will show off      their skills in a Recycle the Runway fundraiser and fashion      show at The Grand Reserve on Manchester Street.       Wagoner and Monarch are determined to see this program      flourish. Considering where they started and where they are      now, I wouldn't advise anyone to stand in their way.       It will be better for us to just get onboard.                          ____________________
