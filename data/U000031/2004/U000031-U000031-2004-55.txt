Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the 100th year anniversary of the Trinity Evangelical Lutheran Church in Kalamazoo, Michigan. This celebrated Church has stood and continues to stand as a symbol of faith, hope, and reverence.  The Trinity Evangelical Lutheran Church began as a mission congregation on December 4, 1904. The first service was held at ``The Auditorium'' on Portage Street, and the church was referred to as the English Lutheran in the 1905 Kalamazoo City Directory. When the congregation had grown to need a larger facility, the present site was purchased on April 11, 1926 for $7,200.00. The ``new'' Trinity Lutheran Church construction began September 12, 1927, with the cornerstone being laid on Reformation Sunday. The building was dedicated June 10, 1928, and 262 members moved into the new building.  Another stint with over crowded conditions and the need for more space led to another building project--the 34-room Parish Education Building. The cornerstone was laid in 1956 and the new $160,000.00 project was dedicated on October 13, 1957. Several projects over the years have changed the appearance of this wonderful church building, both ``inside and out,'' bringing it to the current configuration 100 years later.  It goes without mention that God has richly blessed Trinity Lutheran Church in Kalamazoo and there is and always has been much talent, enthusiasm, and dedication among Trinity's members. Of even greater significance has been their repeated desire for and response to the Word of God for direction.                          ____________________
