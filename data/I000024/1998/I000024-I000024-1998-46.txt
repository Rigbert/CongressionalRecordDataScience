President, more recently, 16 of those generals have written a powerful open letter to the Senate opposing Senator Leahy's effort to legislate U.S. compliance with the Ottawa Treaty. They said in part:       In our experience as former senior military commanders of      American ground forces, such a decision would likely      translate into the needless and unjustifiable death of many      of this country's combat personnel and possibly jeopardize      our forces' ability to prevail on the battlefield.  I again ask unanimous consent that the full text of the letter from the generals dated June 16, 1997, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                      An Open Letter to the Senate                                                    June 16, 1998.     Hon. Trent Lott,     Majority Leader,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Lott: We understand that the Senate may      shortly be asked to consider an amendment to the FY 1999      Defense Authorization bill that would have the effect of      creating a statutory requirement for the U.S. military to      cease all use of anti-personnel landmines (APLs) by 2006, if      not before. In our professional opinion as former senior      commanders of American ground forces, such a decision would      likely translate into the needless and unjustifiable death of      many of this country's combat personnel--and possibly      jeopardize our forces' ability to prevail on the battlefield.       As you may know, we were among the twenty-four retired      four-star general officers who expressed to President Clinton      our concerns about such an initiative last summer. In an open      letter to the President dated July 21, 1997, we wrote: ``In      our experience, [the] responsible use of APLs is not only      consistent with the Nation's humanitarian responsibilities;      it is indispensable to the safety of our troops in many      combat and peacekeeping situations.'' The open letter went on      to note that:       ``Studies suggest that U.S./allied casualties may be      increased by as much as 35% if self-destructing mines are      unavailable--particularly in the `halting phase' of      operations against aggressors. Such a cost is especially      unsupportable since the type of mines utilized by U.S. forces      and the manner in which     they are employed by those forces do not contribute to the      humanitarian problem that impels diplomatic and legislative      initiatives to ban APLs.       ``Unfortunately, a ban on future deployments of APLs will      in no way diminish the danger posed by tens of millions of      `dumb' landmines that have been irresponsibly sown where they      will inflict terror and devastation on civilian populations.      Detecting and clearing such mines should continue to receive      urgent attention from our government and others. The      unverifiability and unenforceability of a ban on production      of such devices, however, virtually ensures that this      practice will continue in the future. Only the U.S.      military--and those of other law-abiding nations--will be      denied a means, through the use of marked and monitored      minefields, of reducing the costs and increasing the      probability of victory in future conflicts.'' (Emphasis      added.)       We were deeply troubled to learn that President Clinton has      recently agreed to impose constraints on and, within a few      years, to ban outright the use of even self-destructing anti-     personnel landmines. This is all the more remarkable given      the opposition previously expressed by the Joint Chiefs of      Staff and the Nation's Combatant Commanders to such      limitations and President Clinton's own statement of      September 17, 1997 when he announced his opposition to the      Ottawa treaty banning APLs, declaring:       ``As Commander-in-Chief, I will not send our soldiers to      defend the freedom of our people and the freedom of others      without doing everything we can to make them as secure as      possible. . . . There is a line that I simply cannot cross,      and that line is the safety and security of our men and women      in uniform.''       We urge you and your colleagues to reject any legislative      initiative that would have the effect of crossing the line--     whether by endorsing new ``operational concepts'' (read,      accepting more U.S. casualties) or other measures--that would      jeopardize the safety and security of our men and women in      uniform by impinging upon the U.S. military's ability to make      responsible use of self-destructing/self-deactivating anti-     personnel landmines and long-duration APLs in Korea.
