Mr. Speaker, tomorrow marks the observance of United Nations International Day in Support of Victims of Torture.  As Co-Chairman of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, I am particularly disturbed by the recent forced closure of the Diyarbakir Representation Office by Turkish Authorities. The Office had just opened by the Human Rights Foundation of Turkey on June 13, 1998, with the aim of assisting victims of torture in the southeastern region of Turkey. The Foundation operates similar treatment and rehabilitation centers in Ankara, Izmir, Istanbul, and Adana. Since 1990, these centers have assisted over 3,000 torture victims and have gained national and international respect. The unwarranted closure of the Diyarbakir center by the authorities only four days after it opened is but the latest form of harassment directed against those seeking to provide professional help to victims of torture in Turkey.  I call upon the Government of Turkey to stop its campaign of harassment and intimidation of human rights non-governmental organizations, including the Human Rights Foundation. If Prime Minister Yilmaz is serious about ending torture in Turkey, Mr. Speaker, he should redirect the resources of the state to vigorously prosecute those responsible for acts of torture.                          ____________________
