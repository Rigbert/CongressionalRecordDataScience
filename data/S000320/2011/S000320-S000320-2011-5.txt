 President, today I wish to pay tribute to Mr. Emory McCord Folmar, who passed away on Friday, November 11, 2011. Emory lived a life dedicated to service to his country, holding many military and civic leadership roles, and was a true inspiration to many. I am glad to have known such a remarkable individual and fellow public servant.  Emory Folmar was born on June 3, 1930, in Troy, AL. He graduated from the University of Alabama with his B.S. in business and was a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. Emory's career in the military began at the University of Alabama as well. During his college years he served as a cadet colonel of the Army ROTC. Upon graduating, Emory attended parachute training and instructors' schools and was assigned to the 11th Airborne Division of the 2nd Infantry Division of the Army. During his years of service in the military, Emory received the Silver Star, the Bronze Star, and the Purple Heart during his service in the Koren war. He was a brave defender ofthe United States of America and continued his dedication to the military throughout his career as a public servant.  In 1954, Emory moved to Montgomery, AL, where he began a successful construction business with his brother, James Folmar and Henry Flynn. His political career began in 1975 as president of the City Council District 8, and then he served as mayor of Montgomery from 1977 to 1999. As mayor, Emory made great strides in developing the downtown area and improving Montomgery's infrastructure. Staying true to his military roots, Emory worked hard for the wellbeing of Maxwell and Gunter Air Force Bases, which are vital to our national security and to Alabama's economy.  Additionally, Emory worked on the Presidential campaigns of Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush and ran for Governor of the State of Alabama in 1982. He has earned the respect and admiration of his colleagues, who have referred to him as the ``grandfather of the State's modern Republican Party.''  Emory is loved and will be missed by his wife, Anita Pierce Folmar, two children, Wilson Bibb Folmar III and Margaret Folmar Dauber, and many more family members and friends. My thoughts and prayers are with them as they mourn the death of a wonderful husband, father, friend, community leader. He was a role model to many, and the citizens of Alabama and of Montgomery are very fortunate to have benefited from his commitment to public service as mayor for 22 years.                          ____________________
