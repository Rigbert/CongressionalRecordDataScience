President, I note on the floor the presence of Senators Moran, Cornyn, and Warren. May I enter into a consent agreement as to the sequence of speaking? I ask unanimous consent that after I have spoken, Senator Warren be recognized next on the Democratic side, and I ask which Republican Senator would like to be included and in what order?
