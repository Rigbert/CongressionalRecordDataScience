Speaker, on behalf of this side of the aisle, I want to say again, as this will be I suppose the last time in the gentleman's role as majority leader that the gentleman addresses the House, we want to congratulate the gentleman on his service. We obviously have had disagreements through the years, but the gentleman has handled himself as a gentleman, and for this side of the aisle, we want to wish the gentleman Godspeed as he enters into a new phase of his career. I know the gentleman's family is pleased to welcome him back to full-time association. I know that was one of the gentleman's prime motives, as he expressed so eloquently on the floor.  On behalf of the minority, we want to wish the gentleman every success and good health and happiness in the future.
