Chairman, I would like to submit the testimony of Wenonah Hauter of Public Citizen before the House Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee. This testimony was inadvertently omitted from the printed hearings of the Subcommittee. Testimony of Wenonah Hauter Director of the Critical Mass Energy and                    Environment Program Public Citizen       Chairman Bonilla, Ranking Member Kaptur and Members of the      Subcommittee, my name is Wenonah Hauter. I am the Director of      Public Citizen's Critical Mass Energy and Environment      Program. As you know, Public Citizen is a national consumer      organization founded by Ralph Nader in 1971. We represent      150,000 members. We welcome this opportunity to present our      views on the FY 2004 Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and      Drug Administration and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill.            USDA--Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS)       We are adamantly opposed to the Administration's proposal      to collect $122 million in user fees to recover the cost of      providing inspection services beyond an approved eight-hour      primary shift. We believe that such a proposal could      compromise the effectiveness of FSIS inspectors. Furthermore,      FSIS has already taken action to de-list foreign      establishments that had been previously approved to export      their meat and poultry products to the United States on the      basis that inspection services were paid by the companies      involved instead of by the foreign government. Implementation      of the Administration's proposal to institute user fees would      be hypocritical.       Additionally, we are concerned that the current proposal to      hire approximately 80 more FSIS inspectors will be inadequate      to fill current vacancies and to make up for previous year's      cuts. We recommend that at least 200 line inspectors be hired      this year.       The alarming number and magnitude of meat and poultry      recalls in the past year indicate that there are some serious      problems with the implementation of the Hazard Analysis      Critical Control Points (HAACP) program. We have been arguing      for the past three years that HACCP has turned over too much      authority to industry to police itself and has severely      undercut the ability of FSIS inspection personnel to their      jobs. We have heard directly from inspection personnel who      state that they are very confused and concerned over their      roles in HAACP.       More troubling is the fact that the economic well-being of      companies is placed ahead of the public's welfare by the      management at FSIS. In June 2002, we were able to obtain      instructions to FSIS inspectors assigned to a large Kansas      slaughter plant in which they were admonished that should      they err on the side of public health and stop a slaughter      line for suspected fecal contamination they could be      personally liable for their decision.       We are also concerned about the failure of supervisors and      management to back up FSIS inspectors when they discover food      safety hazards. Since last year's massive ConAgra recall, it      has come to light that USDA was notified of potential      problems at the Greeley, Colorado plant as early as February      2002--some three months before the first recall notice went      out. Warnings came from John Munsell, president of Montana      Quality Foods and Processing, after FSIS personnel assigned      to his plant confirmed that the source of contaminated meat      ground at Montana Quality Foods and Processing was the      ConAgra plant in Greeley, Colorado. Instead of applauding Mr.      Munsell and the FSIS personnel for their investigative work,      they have been maligned by top FSIS officials and have been      told they had no authority to point the finger at ConAgra.       The same can be said of the Wampler recall. A twenty-year      veteran FSIS inspector, Vincent Erthal, had tried to warn his      supervisors for several months of the unsanitary conditions      at the Wampler plant in Franconia, Pennsylvania. His concerns      went unheeded. This fall, the second largest recall in FSIS      history was issued for possible Listeria monocytogenes      contamination of product coming out of that plant. After much      soul-searching, Mr. Erthal decided to come forward to reveal      how his attempts to warn FSIS supervision of his concerns      were thwarted. Again, instead of backing their own employee,      FSIS management has circled the wagons and launched a      campaign to discredit Mr. Erthal.       With all of the problems that FSIS has already experienced      with their implementation of HAACP in processing plants, the      proposed FY 2004 budget contains language that would expand      the HACCP-based Inspection Models Project (HIMP) in slaughter      facilities. HIMP is yet another attempt at weakening the      authority of FSIS inspection personnel and turning that      responsibility over to company personnel. In a December 17,      2001 report, staff from the General Accounting Office found      glaring methodological deficiencies in FSIS' current pilot      project. There has not been any evidence to show that those      deficiencies have been addressed. Therefore, we would urge      that this expansion of HIMP not go forward until all data      from the current project has been evaluated.       While we applaud additional funds to support food safety      education, we believe that the money will actually be used to      promote irradiation. In her written remarks to the      Subcommittee, Under Secretary for Food Safety Dr. Elsa Murano      stated it was her intent to devote resources to educate the      public about food irradiation. Her remarks also indicate that      she will attempt to blur the     definition of pasteurization to include irradiation as part      of the education campaign.       In focus groups conducted for FSIS in 2002, consumers in      St. Louis, Missouri; Raleigh, North Carolina; and      Philadelphia, Pennsylvania were asked whether they considered      irradiation to be a form of pasteurization, and      overwhelmingly consumers responded that making such an      assertion would be misleading. Those findings corroborated      findings from focus groups conducted for the Food and Drug      Administration (FDA) in three different cities during the      summer of 2001. We urge you not to fund any additional      efforts to change labeling requirements for irradiated food      by allowing ``pasteurization'' to be used.       Lastly, we are concerned about the recent revelations that      FSIS still has not addressed problems identified by the USDA      Inspector General (IG) regarding the agency's reinspection      program for imported meat and poultry products. In 2000, the      IG noted some 18 deficiencies in the FSIS reinspection      program. In her recent audit, the IG stated that FSIS has      still not corrected 14 of those deficiencies--even though      they had agreed to do so three years ago. In light of the      heightened concerns about the security of our food supply,      this is unconscionable. We urge you to instruct FSIS to      comply with the recommendations in the 2000 Inspector General      report.    usda--food and nutrition service/agricultural marketing service       The Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 (the      Farm Bill) contains a provision (section 4201 (1)) that      directs the Secretary of Agriculture not to prohibit the use      of approved food safety technologies in any commodity      purchased by the USDA for various government-sponsored      nutrition programs, including the National School Lunch and      National Breakfast Programs. The USDA has decided this means      that they should lift the current ban on the use of      irradiation as an intervention for ground beef products      purchased for these programs. And, it seems irradiation is      the only approved food safety technology they are pursuing.       Section 4201(l) received no scrutiny from any congressional      committee, in either the House or Senate. It never received      any floor debate in either the House or Senate. It was placed      in the Senate version of the Farm Bill at the last minute as      part of a 400-page manager's amendment. The conferees on the      Farm Bill never even discussed it in open session.       On November 22, 2002, the USDA announced that it would      solicit comments from the public on the implementation of      Section 4201(l) of the Farm Bill and specifically wanted      comments on irradiation. The comments are being collected by      the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS). Of the comments      posted on the AMS website as of March 19, 2003, by over a 5      to 1 margin, citizens have expressed their opposition to      lifting the ban on irradiation--with thousands of comments      still left to be posted. Comments opposing such action have      come from nearly all fifty states, while those supporting the      technology have come primarily from those who have direct      ties to the irradiation industry.       In order to promote this technology, the Food and Nutrition      Service (FNS) has funded an irradiation ``education'' program      in three Minnesota school districts. The program is being      administered by proponents of irradiation--with no access for      critics of the technology to present alternative views. In      addition, the steering committee for the program is dominated      by one irradiation company and its affiliates. In essence,      FNS is funding a government-sponsored advertising campaign      for one company.       Recent research indicates that some chemicals formed when      certain foods are irradiated may be harmful when consumed.      The new studies call into question the long-held position of      the FDA and the food industry that irradiated foods are      generally safe for human consumption. But the studies confirm      research published in 1998 and 2001 showing that      concentrations of chemicals called 2-alkylcyclobutanones (or      2-ACBs)--which are found only in irradiated foods--caused DNA      damage in human cells. Among the new findings, 2-ACBs were      shown to promote tumor development in rat colons. The 2-ACBs      are formed when foods that contain fat are irradiated,      such as beef, chicken, eggs and certain fruits--all of      which can legally be irradiated.       There is even less research into the long-term health      effects experienced by children who are exposed to toxic      chemicals in foods. Dr. William Au, a toxicologist at the      Department of Preventive Medicine and Community Health,      University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, has argued      that the lack of understanding regarding the ill effects      suffered by children who consume toxic chemicals in foods      extends to ``the toxicological risk with respect to eating      irradiated food.''       If implemented, Section 4201 (1) will create the largest      mass-feeding of irradiated food to children in history. We      urge the committee not to fund the purchase of irradiated      food for federal government nutrition programs.                      Food and Drug Administration       We are concerned about the lack of funding for the Food and      Drug Administration (FDA) for import reinspections. Even      after the additional funding the agency received in FY 2003      to hire more staff to perform food import reinspections, the      agency is only capable of reinspecting a paltry 1.3 percent      of imported food over which it has jurisdiction. This needs      to be addressed with additional funding, with the goal of      reaching at least the 20 percent reinspection rate that FSIS      is able to perform for imported meat and poultry products.      Furthermore, FDA should be granted the same authority that      FSIS currently possesses to inspect foreign establishments      that can export their food to the United States.       We are also concerned with the repeated attempts to weaken      the labeling for irradiated foods. The FDA has visited this      issue repeatedly since 1997--primarily at the direction of      Congress. Each time, the FDA finds that consumers do not see      eye-to-eye on this issue with the irradiation industry and      their supporters in Congress. It seems that there are those      who want to keep on trying until we get it wrong.       In the conference committee report that accompanied the FY      2001 Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug      Administration and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, the      conferees stated: ``The conferees expect FDA to make final      the regulations regarding labeling of irradiated foods by      March 1, 2002, and report to the House and Senate Committees      on Appropriations on the status by November 15, 2000. This      agreement changes the dates proposed for final regulations by      the House of September 30, 2001, and by the Senate of October      30, 2001.''       In its report to the Appropriations Committees, the FDA      explained that it had published an Advanced Notice for      Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR) in 1999 on food irradiation      labeling as the agency was directed to do under the FDA      Modernization Act conference committee report in 1997. In      evaluating the comments that the agency received from the      ANPR, FDA stated: ``The majority of these comments were      letters that urged the agency to retain special labeling for      irradiated foods but did not address the specific issues on      which FDA requested comment. A preliminary analysis of the      comments suggests no consensus about what alternative      language for disclosure of irradiation processing would be      truthful and not misleading. Because the public comments      provided no clear direction for agency rulemaking, FDA      believes that 1999 ANPR fulfills the Agency's obligations      under the FDAMA Conference Report.''       The FDA went on to say in its report to Congress that it      intended to impanel consumer focus groups to attempt to      obtain further guidance on the labeling issue.       During the summer of 2001, the FDA commissioned six      consumer focus groups in suburban Washington, DC;      Minneapolis, Minnesota; and Sacramento, California. In all of      the focus groups, the moderator attempted to make a strong      association between pasteurization and irradiation. This was      significant since there have been some irradiation proponents      who have argued that a more appropriate term to describe      irradiation is either ``cold pasteurization'' or ``electronic      pasteurization.'' In a 2002 report to Congress, the FDA      summarized the results of those focus groups: ``Most of the      participants viewed alternate terms such as `cold      pasteurization' and `electronic pasteurization' as      misleading, because they appeared to conceal rather than      disclose information about irradiated food products.      Participants did not see the current disclosure labeling as a      warning . . . Everyone agreed that irradiated foods should be      labeled honestly. They indicated that the current FDA      required statement is a straightforward way for labeling      irradiated foods.''       Furthermore, in his 2002 testimony before the House      Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug      Administration and Related Agencies Appropriations, Dr.      Lester Crawford, Deputy Commissioner of the FDA stated:      ``(W)hen we did focus groups at FDA on cold pasteurization,      the general feeling of the average citizen was that this was      kind of a ruse or a means to conceal the fact that the food      had been irradiated. And so we are kind of back to square      one. We don't have a good synonym for irradiation and we      would like to have one. We don't want to mislead the      public.''       The public has been very consistent on the issue--in focus      groups for USDA and FDA and in public comments solicited by      FDA. Consumers do not want labeling rules for irradiated food      to allow euphemisms like ``electronic pasteurization.'' In      fact, rather than changing the words that are permitted to      describe irradiated food, FDA should instead focus on      expanding the current rules beyond retail establishments, so      that irradiated food served in restaurants, hospitals and      schools must be labeled. There have already been too many      resources devoted to this issue within FDA. The driving force      ought to be what the consumers believe to be honest and      straightforward labeling--not what some in industry think      will make it easier to sell their product. The FDA has more      important things to do than devising ways to confuse and      mislead consumers. We urge you not to find further attempts      to change labeling rules for irradiated foods.       Thank you.
