Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I would just for a moment agree with both of my chairs and refer to my opening remarks where, despite our best efforts, we are also on the appropriations side underfunding these programs. I would agree with the chairman of the authorizing committee that I would hope the other body acts sooner rather than later.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
