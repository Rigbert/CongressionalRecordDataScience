Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.  Mr. Speaker, let us get back to the Innocent Child Protection Act, which passed the House unanimously on July 25, 2000. The purpose of that bill, which is law today, was to prevent the killing of a child in utero because of the mother's crimes causing the death penalty to be imposed. There the legislation, again which was signed into law, defined the child in utero as a human being at any stage of development who is carried in the womb. So that we decided and we made law 3\1/2\ years ago when the Innocent Child Protection Act was passed.  I would note that the three Members on the other side of the aisle who have spoken against the current bill all voted in favor of the Innocent Child Protection Act and the definition that I have just repeated for, I believe, the third time.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Gingrey).
