 President, this amendment would provide the same transparency and oversight that is provided for every other traded tangible commodity. All this amendment says is that electronic exchanges which change energy derivatives are subject to the same requirements as other exchanges, such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the New York Mercantile Exchange. Incidentally, these two organizations support this legislation.  Additionally, it says that if you are trading energy derivatives off an exchange, you simply need to keep a record of that transaction; and if it turns out that there is a complaint, the CFTC will have a record to review.  The problem, and why we need the legislation: Presently, energy transactions are regulated by the FERC, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, when there is an actual delivery of an energy commodity. Let me give you an example. If I buy gas from you and you deliver that natural gas to me, FERC has the authority to ensure thatthis transaction is both transparent and reasonably priced. That is a direct delivery. However, energy transactions have gotten so complex over just the past decade, most energy transactions no longer result in delivery; thus, with these nondelivery trades and transactions, a giant loophole has opened, where there is no oversight and no transparency.  Let me explain. Mr. President, I can purchase from you a promise that you will deliver natural gas to me at some point in the future. This is referred to as a derivatives contract. I may never really need to physically own that gas, so I can sell that gas to someone at a small profit, who can then turn around and sell it to yet someone else, and so on and so forth. This promise of a gas delivery can literally change hands dozens of times before the commodity is ever delivered. Even then, it may never get delivered if the spot market price is lower than the future price that comes due on that day.  In fact, 90 percent of energy trades represent purely financial transactions, not regulated either by FERC or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. As long as there is no delivery, there is no price transparency. So we don't know the price or the terms for 90 percent of the energy transactions taking place.  Again, this lack of transparency and oversight only applies to energy. It does not apply if you are selling wheat, or pork bellies, or any other tangible commodity. So, as I said, there is a very big loophole here.  Why is this type of trading so important? Many of these transactions provide needed insurance so a company can lock in set prices in the future without necessarily ever having to receive delivery. For example, knowing the price of natural gas in the future allows an energy company to, in turn, contract out its electricity, since it will know the price of natural gas, the main cost of production.  These transactions are here to stay. What this amendment simply does is shed light on them. Futures transactions do affect market prices for consumers, and that is why we need this transparency. That is precisely why other commodities, except for excluded financial commodities, are already regulated by the CFTC.  One simple example of how energy derivatives can affect delivered energy prices is the long-term energy electricity contracts that California and other Western States entered into last year, which were priced according to the long-term future costs for natural gas. As soon as the future price of natural gas plummeted after the contracts had been signed, electricity prices fell substantially. All of a sudden, these States looked foolish for signing these contracts.  How did this happen? How did it come up all of a sudden? The simple answer is that the Commodity Futures Modernization Act, signed into law in 2000, exempted energy and minerals trading from regulatory oversight and also exempted electronic trading platforms from oversight.  In a sense, what that legislation did was set up two different systems treating electronic trading platforms differently from all other platforms and treating energy commodities differently from other commodities.  Up until 2000, energy derivative transactions were regulated just like other transactions, and electronic trading platforms were treated like other platforms. I repeat, these were the standards that were in place all the way up to 2000.  Up until that time, if a gas or electricity commodity was delivered, FERC had oversight. If there was not delivery, the CFTC had the authority. So the loophole arose just 2 years ago.  At the time of the 2000 legislation, nobody knew how the exemptions would affect the energy market. We have a much better idea today because of what we have learned since then.  It did not take long for Enron Online and others in the energy sector to take advantage of this new freedom by trading energy derivatives absent any regulatory oversight or transparency. Thus, after the 2000 legislation was enacted, Enron Online began to trade energy derivatives--not deliveries, but derivatives--bilaterally over the counter in a one-to-one transaction without being subject to any regulatory oversight whatsoever. If the trade has delivery, again, it is regulated by FERC. If it does not, it falls into the abyss. Enron Online was able to trade back and forth without records and in secret. The result, of course, was higher prices.  Let me give an example of how that secret trading has affected California and the western energy markets.  On December 12, 2000, the price of natural gas in southern California on the spot market was $50 a decatherm, while it was $10 a decatherm close by in San Juan, NM. A decatherm is 1,000 cubic feet or enough gas to power about 100 kilowatt hours of electricity for a typical powerplant. It is enough gas to provide electricity for about 900 homes for 1 hour.  This problem lasted from November of 2000 to the end of April 2001--a full 6 months--while energy price spikes affected the entire western energy market. And all this time, hardly anyone understood what was happening in nondelivered energy transactions.  In 1999, California's total electricity price for the entire State was $7 billion. In 2000, it was $27 billion, and in 2001, it was $26.7 billion. You can see there are serious ramifications when markets are secret without any Federal oversight or investigation of dramatic price spikes. You cannot investigate it because there is no evidence because all this trading was done in secret with no records.  The Senate Energy Committee, of which I am a member, examined this issue last year, but we were not able to piece together the pieces at that time. In the wake of Enron's bankruptcy, we are beginning to learn a lot more. By controlling a significant number of energy transactions affecting California, and by trading in secret, Enron had the unique opportunity to drive up prices. Only time will tell whether that can be proved because of the absence of records and transparency.  Let me explain how this amendment works. First, the bill repeals the provisions of the 2000 Commodity Futures Modernization Act which exempted energy derivatives from regulatory oversight. As I said before, these transactions were regulated by the CFTC until 2000, so this is not an entirely new authority for the CFTC.  As a result of this provision, all electronic trading exchanges will once again be subjected to the same oversight as other exchanges when it comes to energy transactions.  Companies trading energy commodities off the exchange will simply have to keep a record of that transaction, just as they do for other traded commodities. That is certainly not too much to ask.  The amendment also requires FERC and the CFTC to work together to ensure that energy trading markets are, one, transparent, not in secret; two, regulated, which they should be; and three, working.  This will close the regulatory loopholes that allowed entities, such as Enron Online, to operate unregulated trading markets in secret.  I have received a letter from Pat Wood, the Chairman of FERC. Chairman Wood writes that neither FERC nor CFTC has adequate authority to determine price transparency and ensure that the energy market is functioning as it should. He supports this amendment. FERC Commissioners Brownell and Massey do as well.  This amendment does one more important thing. It ensures that entities running online trading forums must maintain sufficient capital to carry out their operations and maintain open books and records for investigation and enforcement purposes.  This last point is very important. Enron saw its future as a ``virtual'' company. As such, it sold off many of its physical assets over the past few years. So when investors and customers lost confidence and stopped trading out of fear that bankruptcy was in the offing, they learned that Enron had no collateral to back up these trades, and this was a major factor in Enron's final spiral into bankruptcy.  Who is supporting this bill? The New York Mercantile Exchange, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Cambridge Energy Research Associates who asked for just this, the American Public Gas Association, the American Public Power Association, Pacific Gas & Electric, Calpine, Mid-America Energy Holding Company, Texas Independent Producers and Royalty Association,the Consumers Union, and the Consumer Federation of America, all because they believe the time has come to see there are no trading markets in secret that do not keep records, and to shine the light of day on these trades.  Now, who is opposed to the amendment? Some energy companies oppose this bill. One lesson some of these companies seem to have learned from the recent energy crisis was they make more money when they can operate without any transparency, in secret, without any reporting requirements or oversight of any kind, and that cannot continue to exist.  I am very much encouraged that not all energy companies want to operate this way. As I mentioned, PG, Calpine, Apache, Mid-America Energy, and others support this bill, and many other energy companies are sitting on the sidelines waiting to see what may happen.  There are still some who fail to recognize the glory days of operating in secret are over. Regardless of what happens with this amendment, I want to go on record saying I will do everything in my power to see the energy sector is exposed to the same price transparency and oversight as every other sector of our economy. Make no mistake, this debate boils down to the issue of whether energy companies should be able to operate in continued secrecy.  Some of these companies have argued this amendment creates unfair reporting and oversight over energy companies. So let us again look at what this provision would do. It would treat electronic trading exchanges like any other exchange since, as I said before, there is neither price transparency nor regulatory authority over those exchanges where there is not a direct delivery. So with this provision, the same reporting requirements that CFTC requires of the New York Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Exchange would now be required of electronic exchanges. This means simply that CFTC would be able to assert the same oversight and require the same transparency of electronic exchanges that are already required of nonelectronic exchanges.  I have a very hard time understanding why this is so burdensome and unfair. Additionally, some of these companies have also asserted this amendment would create unfair burdens on companies engaged in bilateral transactions. Here is what they are complaining about: With our amendment, any entity engaging in bilateral transactions in energy commodities would have to keep a record of those transactions, and the CFTC would have the authority to look for fraud and manipulation.  Again, let me repeat, a company engaged in bilateral trading has to keep a record of that transaction, and the CFTC has the authority to investigate fraud. That is it. It is the same authority that was there before 2000 and the same standard that traders of all other commodities are required to meet.  So with all we now know about the energy sector and Enron, I challenge anyone to explain to me why energy companies should continue to have a loophole so they can trade in secret, not keep any records, and therefore there is no evidence that can be proven as to manipulation of price. The day has come to close that loophole.  I note one of the main original cosponsors is in the Chamber and wishes to speak to this amendment. I have had the pleasure of working with the Senator from Oregon on the Energy Committee, as I have with the Presiding Officer. The Senator from Oregon has been a leader and very focused on this issue. I want to thank him for his help, and I ask the Chair recognize him.                               Exhibit 1                              American Public Gas Association,                                       Fairfax, VA, March 5, 2002.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     Hart Senate Office Building,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: The American Public Gas Association      (APGA) is very pleased that you have taken the lead to amend      the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA). Your revisions to S. 517,      which amends the CEA, brings the trading of energy products,      including natural gas spot and forward prices, under the      appropriate jurisdiction of the Commodity Futures Trading      Commission (CFTC). As a result, your amendment will reduce      the various risks imposed on consumers by a partially      unregulated energy trading market.       As you know, Enron operated in what was essentially an      unregulated environment. While there will be much more to      come in the wake of Enron, one thing is perfectly clear      today--our federal government has an obligation to make sure      that no important trading activities fall between the cracks      leaving some energy markets without a federal agency with      oversight authority. Your amendment remedies this glaring      deficiency.       APGA is fully committed to support your effort to reverse      the action Congress took just 15 months ago in the      Commodities Futures Modernization Act (CFMA). The CFMA      amended the CEA by allowing some energy contracts to be      traded with no government oversight. We firmly believe that      the CFTC must have at its disposal the necessary jurisdiction      and authority to protect the operational integrity of energy      markets so that (1) transactions are executed fairly, (2)      proper disclosures are made to customers, and (3) fraudulent      and manipulative practices are not tolerated.       In December of 2000, when the CFMA was under consideration      in the Senate, APGA submitted a Statement for the Record to      the U.S. Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources      during a hearing on the ``Status of Natural Gas Markets.'' In      the statement, we expressed a concern that the proposed      legislation would codify an exemption for energy commodity      transactions that would shield those energy transactions from      the oversight and review of the CFTC. Enron took advantage of      this gap in regulatory oversight. Your amendment will close      that gap. Consumers across the country will benefit from your      efforts because they are less likely to be victimized by      activities that occur in a market where the CFTC exercises      oversight.       Again, public gas utilities and the hundreds of communities      that we serve commend you for your thoughtful and deliberate      leadership on this very important issue. While there may be      some who will oppose this amendment, one need not look far to      see whether the opposition is looking out for the best      interests of Wall Street or Main Street. We pledge to work      with you in any way we can to pass this much-needed      amendment. Please let me know how I can assist you.           Sincerely,                                                         Bob Cave,     President.                                  ____                               Exhibit 2                                     Texas Independent Producers &                                   Royalty Owners Association,                                       Austin, TX., March 6, 2002.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: We understand that later today, you      will introduce an important measure designed to bring greater      transparency to natural gas markets. We believe that improved      transparency will reduce price-markups charged in      transactions that take place after natural gas leaves the      wellhead and before it reaches the burner tip. Thus your      measure will benefit both consumers and producers. We support      the modified version of S. 1951 that you intend to offer as      an amendment to the Senate Energy Bill.       We understand that the amendment:       (1) will not grant any price control authority under the      Federal Power Act or Natural Gas Act;       (2) will continue to allow energy commodities (actually all      commodities other than agricultural commodities) to be traded      on electronic trading facilities that currently qualify as      exempt commercial markets, provided that the trading      facilities register, meet net capital requirements, file      reports, and maintain books and records;       (3) will require participants in such markets to maintain      books and records; and       (4) will apply these requirements to electronic trading      facilities which permit execution with multiple parties and      non-binding bids and offers, and will require books and      records to be kept by participants in facilities that permit      bilateral negotiations.       TIPRO believes that this measure will tend to improve price      transparency in natural gas markets, leading to a more      efficient and stable marketplace. The relatively modest      requirements outlined above should not unduly reduce      liquidity for gas traders. Accordingly, TIPRO endorses your      amendment.           Sincerely,                                             Gregory Moredock,                                             Natural Energy Policy     Committee Chairman.                                  ____                               Exhibit 3                              MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co.,                                        Omaha, NE., March 5, 2002.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am writing in support of your      effort to ensure that there is transparency and appropriate      federal oversight of energy futures trading markets.       As I testified before the Senate Energy and Natural      Resources Committee last month, I have long been concerned      that the type of exchange run by Enron before its collapse      offered opportunities for manipulation. Enron was the largest      buyer, the largest seller and the operator of an unregulated      exchange. In view of the revelations of the last several      months regarding Enron, the unregulated nature of these      markets has raised serious concerns regarding the ability of      the federal government to ensure that energy trading and      futures markets are operating in the interest of the public      and market participants.       As the Senate addresses this issue, it is important to      remember that electric and gas     markets as a whole responded to the Enron collapse without      disruption, so legislation should not compromise the      liquidity of these markets. I applaud your determination to      keep your amendment focused on oversight and transparency and      am encouraged that you, along with Senators Cantwell and      Wyden, have pledged to work with market participants to      continue to perfect this proposal as debate on the      comprehensive energy bill continues.       Ensuring public confidence in the integrity of energy      futures markets is a critical component of establishing a      modernized regulatory framework for the electric and natural      gas industries. I am pleased to support your effort and      commend you on your work on this important issue.           Sincerely,                                                   David L. Sokol,     Chairman and CEO.                                  ____                                             PG Corporation,                                    Washington, DC, March 6, 2002.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: We are writing today in reference      to the amendment you will be offering to the Senate Energy      bill, containing the substance of legislation you and several      of your colleagues introduced earlier to provide regulatory      oversight over energy trading markets, as amended.       At the outset, we applaud your efforts to ensure public and      consumer confidence in the operation and orderly functioning      of the energy marketplace. As you know, the industry relies      heavily on these markets and products to manage risk for the      benefit of consumers of electricity. We thus appreciate your      willingness to work with us and other market participants to      address areas of interest and concern as the provisions of      your amendment have been debated and refined. As presently      drafted, we view your amendment as providing an increased      level of oversight, while ensuring the continued ability of      market participants to utilize these instruments as part of      overall risk management strategies. We therefore support your      amendment.       Thank you for your hard work in this area, and we look      forward to continuing to work with you and others on matters      of national energy policy.           Sincerely,                                                  Steven L. Kline.
