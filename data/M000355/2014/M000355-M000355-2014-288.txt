 President, on the unemployment insurance bill, there have been productive conversations between the majority leader and several Members on this side. The Republicans have offered numerous commonsense proposals to get to a conclusion. Ideally, we would have spent the past week voting on those proposals, so there is really no good reason for us to be in the position that we are in right now.  Let me just underscore some of the things on my side that we would like to see in the final product. First, the Senate should actually be paying for whatever it passes, and not with spending cuts 11 years from now that we know aren't going to happen. It is also reasonable to expect practical progrowth job creation measures so we can actually get people back to work, and for a solution to be reasonable it should also respect the right of our constituents to be heard on this issue through a more open amendment process.  We have to get away from an attitude that essentially says the views of half the American people don't matter in the Senate. These days it has gotten even worse than that; ideas on both sides are often completely ignored. That is just not how the Senate is supposed to work. So we have an opportunity to begin to start fixing the problem on the bill that is before us. It is the right thing to do. I am hopeful common sense will prevail.
