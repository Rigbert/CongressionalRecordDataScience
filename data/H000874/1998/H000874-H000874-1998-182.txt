Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time.  Mr. Speaker, I rise, I would tell the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Archer), with the intention to support this bill when the roll is called. I was one of those who did not support this bill as it went to the Senate. I was very concerned about what the final product would be. I want to congratulate both the chairman and the ranking member for improving this bill as it came back. I think that is a good thing.  I want to rise, however, to say that this bill is a continuation of IRS reform, and to congratulate Secretary Rubin, Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Summers, and Carl Rossotti who, like all of us, have seen the need to bring both management reform and procedural reform and taxpayer sensitivity to the IRS.  Secretary Rubin is the first Secretary of Treasury with whom I have served since 1981 who has paid attention to the management issues at IRS. He formed, in 1997, a management board. He also made the determination to bring on a professional manager, Charles Rossotti, the founder and chairman of American Management Systems, and brought on as commissioner for a term. That change was a critically important change.  It is well and good that we amend the law so that we put forth a system that will reform the IRS management and the IRS dealing with taxpayers. But what is critically important is that we have on board personnel committed to that objective.  Secretary Rubin and this administration have done that. I think this legislation, in concert with the reforms that are ongoing and have been affected by the Clinton administration and Secretary Rubin, will make a very substantial, positive impact on the taxpayers of America. For that reason, I intend to support this legislation.
