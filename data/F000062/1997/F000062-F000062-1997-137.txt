 President, I rise today to offer an amendment to the Defense appropriations bill which expresses the Sense of Congress that U.S. payment for the cost of NATO enlargement is contingent on our NATO allies' willingness to pay their fair share of the costs of NATO enlargement as well.  I was concerned and surprised to read French President Chirac's statement last week that ``France does not intend to raise its contribution to NATO because of the cost of enlargement.''  Mr. President, we all know that NATO enlargement will cost money. And those costs must be borne fairly by all members.  If France or Germany or any other member of NATO is unwilling to pay its fair share, then this seems to me to be a faulty foundation for the expansion of NATO.  Indeed, as an article in the July 14-20 issue of Defense News stated:       Its decision to admit new members threatens to tear the      Western alliance asunder if the European allies fail to      shoulder a larger proportion of NATO's future security costs,      according to U.S. and European diplomats and analysts.  The purpose of this amendment is to make clear that the United States is willing to pay its share of the cost of NATO enlargement. No more. No less.  But this amendment also makes clear that if the Europeans are unwilling to pay their share of the costs, then the United States will not pay either.  The bottom line is that the costs should be fairly met and paid for by all Alliance members. The United States can not and should not pick up the share of European countries unwilling to do their part.  This amendment, I believe, sends a strong message to our European allies as we enter into the NATO enlargement process that if we are to enlarge the alliance it must be done fairly, and it must be done right.
