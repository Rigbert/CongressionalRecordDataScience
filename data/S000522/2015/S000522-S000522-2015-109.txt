Mr. Speaker, today marks the 59th anniversary of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution against Soviet tyranny. Though the Soviet tanks put down the uprising that time, it lit a torch of resistance that the communists could never put out and ultimately democracy prevailed. I submit the following remarks by Marion Smith, Executive Director of the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation, at an event last evening commemorating the 1956 Hungarian Revolution.              Commemorating the 1956 Hungarian Revolution                           (By Marion Smith)            [From Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation]       For a few days in 1956, Budapest became the capital of      freedom. The city, which was gutted and nearly destroyed by      the ruthless military showdown between Soviet and Nazi troops      in World War II, became the city of hope and heartbreak in      1956. The Hungarian nation's patriotic glory and enviable      spirit broke the yoke of the Soviet Empire, if only for a few      days.       Ruszkik haza!--Russians, go home!--a crowd eventually      growing to 300,000 demanded as young people, who had      everything to lose, gathered in the heart of the city.      Hungarians began to tear off red stars from buildings, they      toppled the statue of Stalin in front of the Hungarian Radio      and tore out the Soviet symbol from the middle of the      Hungarian flag, framed pictures of Lenin, Marx and Stalin      were gathered on the street and burnt in bonfires. The flames      of freedom lit up the nights.       The Soviet military stationed in Hungary was considerably      large. It should have been relatively easy to put down what      the regime called a fascist ``counter-revolution''. But it      wasn't. Moscow underestimated the resilience of the people      and the determination of Hungarians to fight. For their      freedom, for their family, for their life.       From the West, Hungarians received sympathy and prayers.      But not much more. And yet, these mostly young patriots      succeeded in driving out the Soviet tanks all the way to the      outskirts of Budapest. A free and democratic Hungary seemed      within grasp.       But the Communist Politburo in Moscow was not yet ready for      a breakup of the Iron Curtain and on November 4, Soviet tanks      rolled through the city. 30,000 troops and more than a      thousand tanks eventually put down the lightly armed      civilians of Budapest.       The Soviets gave Hungary a new leader, Janos Kadar. He      announced over the radio that the ``Hungarian Revolutionary      Worker-Peasant Government'' was formed to protect Hungary's      ``socialist achievements''. And people who disagreed, people      who took a part in the fights had to pay the price. For many,      the ultimate price. Some were simply shot on the streets like      dogs, some disappeared in the middle of the night, some spent      years in the prisons at Andrassy ut 60, where the House of      Terror today commemorates the brutality of the communist      secret police.       Although the system was dubbed ``goulash communism'' for      its more relaxed policies that allowed for some dissent, the      one-party system, political censorship, food shortages of a      centrally planned economy, and the arbitrary coercion of      citizens by state officials remained until the very last days      of the regime.       Almost sixty years after the Hungarian revolution, and more      than 25 years after the regime change, it is more important      than ever for Hungarians and Americans alike to remember that      communism was not a beautiful utopia. It was and is an      ideology that enables tyranny. Communist regimes everywhere      systematically killed a portion of their own people as a      matter of policy in peacetime, denied citizens their basic      rights, robbed them of their food and of their labor, and      tore families apart in maintaining a police state.       The mass exodus, one of the largest the U.S. has seen at      the time, of political dissenters from Hungary on the heels      of the 1956 revolution revealed the true intolerance of the      ``socialist dream''.       The Victims of Communism Foundation, through our Witness      project tells true stories about life communist regimes. To      understand the depth and scope of the evil of communism we      have to listen to those who knew it all too well, those like:       Bela Krasznay who spent nearly eight years in the notorious      Recsk labor camp during the 1950's as a political prisoner      due to his family background (landed-owners and military      officers).       Janos Horvath who served as the youngest member of the      Hungarian parliament in 1948, was imprisoned for four years      by the communist regime because of his political beliefs only      to return to the Hungarian parliament, becoming its oldest      living member until his retirement in 2014.       Livia Gyarmathy who was ordered by the state to become a      chemist, despite wanting to go to medical school and      eventually became a filmmaker, and produced the first ever      film about the Recsk labor camp--the Hungarian Gulag.       Daniel Magay, whose idyllic childhood was wrecked when      communist authorities targeted his father, a popular      landowner. Though his efforts to escape communism brought      Daniel to the 1956 Olympic Games and, eventually, San      Francisco, Daniel remains deeply shaped by having grown up      under that brutal system.       We must not think that the fall of the Soviet Union meant      the ``end of history'' or even the end of communism. As      Charles de Gaulle, the former French president said: ``Stalin      didn't walk away into the past, he dissolved into the      future.''       Today, one fifth of the world's population lives in a one-     party communist state.       This very summer, new statues of Stalin have been erected      in several Russian towns by Russia's Communist Party whose      leader promised new statues in Irkutsk in Siberia and to      Eastern Ukraine.       In Donetsk, where the Soviets are responsible for the death      of millions of Ukrainians in the period of forced starvation      known as Holodomor, a new cult of Stalin is on the rise with      new street posters of the bloody murderer on display.       Russia is eager to display the red flag with hammer and      sickle as a sign of past glory at sporting events from the      Sochi Olympics to the FINA World Championships in Kazan. All      this while Russian authorities have shut down the Soviet era      archives, revised children's text books and harassed or      jailed historians or journalists who dare to tell the truth      about life in the Soviet Union.       And in our own country, a country that spent more resources      on fighting communism than any other country in the world, we      see a shocking lack of understanding from teenagers and young      adults who do not know the basics of 20th century history.      They don't understand how bankrupt the Marxist ideology      actually is and why the struggle we as Americans took against      communist imperialism was and is worth it.       The simple lesson of the Cold War is that there is      absolutely nothing romantic, cute, or enviable about the      socialist system and the communist utopia. Few nations know      this better than the Hungarians, whose torn red white and      green flag became, in 1956 a symbol for a universal desire      for freedom. And so it remains today.                          ____________________
