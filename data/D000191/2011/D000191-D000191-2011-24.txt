 Then when they escape, we hire people, pest control eliminators, to go out and try to find them when people abandon them. What a jobs creator.  No, we're not going to rebuild our infrastructure. We're not going to try and continue to have fair wages for people who build the best airplanes in the world, Boeing. No, those things are off the table as far as the Republicans are concerned. It's job-killing regulations, that's what's hurting America.  Come on guys, get real. Let's rebuild America. Let's invest. Let's pay workers a fair wage. You know, when a worker earns a fair wage, they can afford to go to the small business down the street and patronize them and buy their goods. And then maybe some day, if you stop these job-killing trade deals, they'll be able to buy goods that are actually made in America with their decent wages at an American company. Get real.
