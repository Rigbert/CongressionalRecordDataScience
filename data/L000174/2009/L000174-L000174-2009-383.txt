I will say what I said before, when he was standing on the floor. I, along with Senator Grassley, strongly oppose his amendment because the False Claims Act is so well put together, has a balanced approach of providing incentives for whistleblowers, and has recovered more than $22 billion for the Treasury. That is why Senator Grassley and I oppose the amendment by the Senator from Arizona. Awards to whistleblowers have to be approved by judges, so there is a mechanism to handle excessive awards.  When we have something like the False Claims Act that is working as well as it is--as I said, it is one of the few things that has made money for the Federal Government. So far it has made $22 billion for the U.S. taxpayers. I hate to interfere with something that is working.  My time is up.
