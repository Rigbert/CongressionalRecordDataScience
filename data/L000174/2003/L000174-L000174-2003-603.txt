President, while there are continuing problems caused by the administration's refusal to work with Democratic Senators to select consensus judicial nominees who could be confirmed relatively quickly by the Senate, today we again demonstrate what can happen when the administration works with us.  In spite of the President's lack of cooperation, the Senate in the 17 months I chaired the Judiciary Committee was able to confirm 100 judges and vastly reduce the judicial vacancies that had built up and were prevented by the Republican Senate majority from being filled by President Clinton. Last year alone the Democratic-led Senate confirmed 72 judicial nominees, more than in any of the prior 6 years of Republican control. Not once did the Republican-controlled committee consider that many of President Clinton's district and circuit court nominees. In our efforts to turn the other cheek and treat this President's nominees better than his predecessor's had fared, we confirmed 100 judges in 17 months. Yet not a single elected Republican has acknowledged this tremendous bipartisanship and fairness. When Chief Justice Rehnquist thanked the committee for confirming 100 judicial nominees, this was the first time this accomplishment had been acknowledged by anyone from a Republican background. I thanked him last week when I appeared before the Judicial Conference.  Almost all of the judges confirmed are conservatives, many of them quite to the right of the mainstream, and many are pro-life. Many of these nominees have been active in conservative political causes or groups, but we moved fairly and expeditiously on as many as we could.  We cut the number of vacancies on the courts from 110 to 50, despite an additional 60 new vacancies that had arisen. I recall that the chairman said in September of 1997 that 103 vacancies, during the Clinton Administration, did not constitute a ``vacancy crisis.'' He also repeatedly stated that 67 vacancies meant ``full employment'' on the Federal courts. Even with the vacancies that have arisen since we adjourned last year, we remain below the ``full employment'' level that Senator Hatch used to draw for the Federal courts with only 50 vacancies remaining on the district courts and courts of appeals, according to the Judiciary Committee website. Unfortunately, the President has not made nominations to a number of those seats, and on more than half of the current vacancies he has missed his self-imposed deadline of a nomination within 180 days. Of course, several of the nominations he has made are controversial.  This year the President has taken the truly unprecedented action of renominating candidates voted down in committee in spite of the serious concerns expressed by fair-minded members of this committee. That is a significant problem.  This year we have had a rocky beginning with a hearing that has caused a great many problems we might have avoided. The chairman's insistence on terminating debate on the Cook and Roberts nominations is another serious problem. Of course, the administration's unwillingness to work with the Senate so that we may be provided the documents and information needed to proceed with a final vote on the Estrada nomination has already proved to be a significant problem. The opposition to the Sutton nomination is also extensive.  Nonetheless, the Senate has proceeded to confirm 113 of President Bush's judicial nominees, including 13 this year alone. The Senate confirmed the controversial nomination of Jay Bybee to the Ninth Circuit, another pro-life judicial nominee. Already this year the Senate has confirmed more circuit court judges than Republicans allowed to be confirmed in the entire 1996 session. In addition, I note that it was not until September, 1999, that 13 of President Clinton's judicial nominees were confirmed in the first session of the last Congress in which Republicans controlled the Senate majority. This year we are 6 months ahead of that schedule.  The California nominee comes from the bipartisan selection commissions Senator Feinstein and Senator Boxer have established in California and the Indiana nominee has the bipartisan support of his home State Senators. I congratulate the nominees and their families.                          ____________________
