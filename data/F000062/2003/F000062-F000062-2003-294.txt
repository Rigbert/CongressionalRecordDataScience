  It is really a misconception to think this is an amendment against derivatives. This isn't an amendment against derivatives. I have never said derivatives caused the western energy crisis. What I said was that there is a loophole in the law: Where all other finite commodities, except for energy and metals, have certain regulations with respect to transparency, these particular finite commodities do not; and that certain traders use this loophole to practice, if you will, a kind of fraud in their trading. The fraud was to artificially find ways to boost their products. I wish to respond to that.  Let's go into one of the ways they proceeded to do this--through what is called a round trip or a wash trade. Yesterday on the floor, Senator Fitzgerald and I, as well, very clearly pointed out what a wash trade is: I sell you a finite commodity, and you sell that same commodity back to me. On our balance sheets, we both carry a sale. Yet nothing ever changes hands. What we are saying is that this should be an illegal practice. What we are saying is that, at the very least, it ought to have transparency to it. We ought to be required to keep a record, to have an audit trail, and to have anti-fraud and anti-manipulation oversight of these practices by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  What we more fundamentally say is that a great deal of this was done in the western energy crisis through electronic trading.  Madam President, I understand I have the right to modify the amendment. Is that not correct?
