 The Senator from New Jersey is--I don't want to hurt his reputation--my closest ally in the Senate. We share a common border. Although I always kid him, as big as New Jersey is, the Delaware River is owned by the State of Delaware up to the high river mark in New Jersey. It is one of our claims to fame. We literally lap upon New Jersey's shore. But I thank him. I will be very brief.                          ____________________
