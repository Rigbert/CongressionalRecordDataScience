Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that information.  I presume the CR, or continuing resolution, is anticipated, as the gentleman referenced. Is that accurate?  Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  As the gentleman knows, we have been in discussions to try to get a budget agreement. We have hopes we can get that done this time. If we are able to get that budget agreement, we will need some time for the appropriators to do their work, so we would have a continuing resolution.
