Speaker, I yield to the distinguished gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay), the majority leader, for the purposes of asking the majority leader the schedule for the coming week.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman for yielding. I am told that the airports are still open. I know all of our Members are rushing to catch their planes to go back to their districts, and I wish them a very good weekend. But, Mr. Speaker, I do appreciate the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer) for yielding to me.  Mr. Speaker, the House will convene on Tuesday at 12:30 p.m. for morning hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business. We will consider several measures under suspension of the rules, and a final list of those bills will be sent to the Members' offices early next week. There will be no votes in the House before 6:30 on Tuesday.  On Wednesday we expect to consider two bills from the Committee on Ways and Means: the Miscellaneous Trade and Technical Corrections Act of 2003 and H.R. 743, the Social Security Protection Act of 2003.  On Thursday we expect to consider H.R. 878, the Armed Forces Tax Fairness Act.  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I will be happy to answer any questions the gentleman may have.
