President, for the benefit of my colleagues, I want to explain how we are going to proceed. Obviously, Senator Baucus made his unanimous consent request. I didn't anticipate that when we were ordering the speakers earlier. We are going to go to Senator Santorum for the purpose of an amendment, but he will only take 3 minutes, and then we are going to go to Senator Obama for his amendment, and then I am going to propose on behalf of Senator Voinovich an amendment he has worked out with the Presiding Officer.
