 President, if the majority leader will allow me an observation about Dr. Ogilivie and his extraordinary service to this body and to the Nation, it was truly exemplary. I know I speak for all of the Members on this side of the aisle when I say to Dr. Ogilivie, thank you for your years of service here. It is wonderful to see you again.                          ____________________
