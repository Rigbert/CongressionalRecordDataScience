President, without objection, I will proceed for the remaining seconds and simply remind everyone that we are taking another step to expand unemployment coverage for an additional 14 weeks for every State and 6 more weeks for those States that have unemployment rates above 8.5 percent. We are incorporating a home buyer tax credit that has worked remarkably well, and we are also incorporating net operating loss treatment for small businesses so they can have additional resources to hire more Americans.  This legislation is important, it is critical, it is vital, and I hope it is unanimously accepted.                             Cloture Motion
