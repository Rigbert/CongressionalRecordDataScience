Speaker, one of the things that makes America great is the dedication and commitment of many individuals throughout our country who participate in organizations to promote the well being of their community. The Foothill Parent Teacher Association is one of those commendable organizations.  The Foothill PTA represents Foothill Elementary School located in Corona, California. In order to provide an environment of quality programs and a high level of parental involvement, the Home-School Communications project was implemented. One of the purposes of this program is to provide weekly communication between home and school. Once a week each student is sent home with a packet of information, which the parent signs off on when received, allowing continual communication between home and school. The Foothill PTA also sends out a newsletter every month, which includes a calender of upcoming events and encourages parents and students to participate. Finally, the program offers up-to-date information to all parents by providing a 24-hour PTA Information Hot Line and a PTA web page on the Internet. It is important to acknowledge that the Home-School Communications project would not be possible without the volunteers who actively participate in the PTA.  This outstanding program should be applauded for the positive results it has brought to Foothill Elementary School. Since the commencement of the Home-School Communications project there has been an overall increase in parental involvement in school activities. There has been 99 percent participation at parent-teacher conferences and an increase of 110 percent in PTA membership, and it has brought a sense of togetherness and satisfaction to the parents, teachers, and office staff. There also has been an increase in attendance at school events, including the Halloween Carnival and the First Annual Reflections Awards Night.  All this effort and dedication by the members of the PTA has not gone unrecognized. The Foothill PTA received the California State PTA Advocates for Children Award in 1995 and the Outstanding Unit for California and Creative Membership Awards in 1997. In 1998, the Foothill PTA won Outstanding Unit for California and National PTA Outstanding Unit. Also, the Foothill PTA has been recognized as an Outstanding Unit at the council level for the last 4 years.  I want to thank the Foothill PTA for all their hard work and dedication to the children in our community. I am proud to have an organization like the Foothill PTA in my district. I encourage Foothill PTA members to continue with their involvement and wish them the best in their future endeavors.                          ____________________
