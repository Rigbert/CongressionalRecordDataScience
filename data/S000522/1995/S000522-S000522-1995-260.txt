Mr. Speaker, last week, the National Governors' Association passed an important resolution in support of congressional restoration of flow control authority to State and local governments.  When the Supreme Court rejected such authority in its May 1994 decision in Carbone versus Clarkstown, New York, it struck a devastating blow to the financial stability of thousands of communities nationwide. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor reminded Congress of its part in developing these circumstances. You see, although Congress had implied that States and localities had the authority to use flow control; Congress had never granted the authority explicitly. We now have not only the opportunity, but the responsibility to finish what we started.  It is imperative that we do so with all due speed because communities nationwide have amassed an outstanding debt of more than $10 billion purely by meeting its traditional responsibilities of picking up the trash.  Congress held hearings and markups and debates on this issue throughout 1994. The divergent interests of local governments, the private sector waste companies, and Wall Street came together through months of intense negotiations. The product of these efforts was a compromise proposal which passed the House by unanimous consent on October 7, and nearly passed through the Senate before it adjourned the next day.  On January 4, I reintroduced this exact text as the Community Solvency Act (H.R. 24) with a bipartisan group of cosponsors. I encourage my colleagues to read the persuasive and well-reasoned arguments of the Governors' resolution and to join them in their fight to meet the public health and safety needs of our constituents in a cost-effective and environmentally sound way. In short, I encourage my colleagues to cosponsor H.R. 24.               National Governors Association Resolution       3.4.1 Each State, Alone or in Cooperation with Other      States, Should Manage the Waste Produced Within Its Borders      in an Environmentally Sound Manner. This goal requires states      to take responsibility for the treatment and disposal of      solid waste created within their borders to eventually      eliminate the transportation of unwanted waste sent over      state lines for treatment or disposal.       It should be the national policy for each state to promote      self-sufficiency in the management of solid waste. States      should be allowed to use reasonable methods to achieve their      goal of self-sufficiency, including the use of waste flow      control. Self-sufficiency is a reliable, cost-effective,      long-term path and generally reflects the principle that the      citizens ultimately are responsible for the wastes they      create.       As states phase in programs to ensure self-sufficiency,      Congress should require the federal government to pursue      aggressively packaging and product composition initiatives      and to identify and foster creation of markets for recyclable      or recycled goods. Federal assistance in these waste      reduction endeavors is critical to developing national waste      reduction and recycling programs to achieve self-sufficiency.       Similarly, the federal government must mandate national      minimum performance standards for municipal solid waste      disposal facilities. Otherwise, some states may resolve      capacity crises brought about by export limitations by      keeping open landfills that otherwise should be closed. Also,      the lack of minimum standards may encourage exports, because      it might be cheaper, even taking into consideration      transportation costs, for a community in a state with      stringent regulations to ship to nearby states that do not      have the same requirements.       The development of solid waste management plans should be      the primary responsibility of the states and local      governments, and the Governors urge EPA to assist states in      the development of comprehensive and integrated planning and      regulatory programs through financial and technical      assistance. Such plans should include a ten-year planning      horizon and should be updated at least every five years.      These plans should include a description of the following:       The waste management hierarchy that maximizes cost-     effective source reduction, reuse, and recycling of      materials;       The planning period;       The waste inventory;       The relationship between state and local governments;       Municipal solid waste reduction and recycling programs;       A waste capacity analysis for municipal solid waste (which      in no way should resemble a capacity assurance requirement      similar to Section 104 of the Comprehensive Environmental      Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, or CERCLA);       The state's regulatory program;       The process for citizen participation; and       Self-certification that the state has necessary authority      to implement these program elements.       EPA review of plans should be limited to a check for      completeness based on elements specified in this policy and      raised by EPA during the public comment period of the draft      plan. EPA does not have the ability or the resources to take      on the solid waste planning and management responsibilities      that fall under the historical and rightful domain of state      and local governments. Moreover, EPA's intrusion into the      planning process (in a manner similar to Subtitle C of the      Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA) would      frustrate and impede the planning process already underway in      many states.       States should retain authority to implement and enforce      Subtitle D programs upon passage of legislation reauthorizing      RCRA, and new program elements in this legislation should be      automatically delegated to states. Should a state fail to      submit a complete plan, EPA should assume responsibility for      the permitting and enforcement portion of a state solid waste      management program after the state is given the opportunity      to appeal and correct any deficiencies.                               ____________________
