 Chairman, this is not price controls. I am surprised to hear my colleague referring to George Bush as a socialist. He would be very upset about it. His administration developed this policy, because they believed quite correctly that if the taxpayers put money into the development of a drug, they have the right to get something out of that investment, that the company cannot simply charge any amount of money they want making that drug unaffordable to the American people. Let us stand up for the taxpayers. Let us stand up for the consumers. Let us vote for this policy that was instituted by George Bush.
