Speaker, I thank the distinguished majority whip and acting leader.  Mr. Leader, so that Members can be certain as to the schedule for next Thursday and Friday, on Thursday the House will begin business at 10 a.m., I understand, with no votes to occur before 2 p.m., and we will consider suspension bills and the conference report on the Homeland Security appropriations bill, and then the House will meet on Friday at 9 a.m. to consider the energy bill. Is that accurate?
