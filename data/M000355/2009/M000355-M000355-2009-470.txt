 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a member of our Armed Forces from my home State of Kentucky, 1LT Edward R. ``Eddie'' Ward, who is being inducted posthumously into the U.S. Army Aviation Association of America's Order of Saint Michael.  Established in 1900, the Order of St. Michael recognizes individuals who have contributed significantly to the promotion of Army aviation. Those selected have demonstrated the standards of integrity and moral character, displayed an outstanding degree of professional competence, and served the U.S. Army aviation or civilian aviation community with distinction. There are three levels of the Order of St. Michael--Bronze, Silver, and Gold. First Lieutenant Ward is receiving Gold, the top level, which is awarded when an individual exhibits the highest values of honesty and ethical character.  Ward first enlisted in the Army in 1901 at the age of 19. Six years later, at the age of 25, he was assigned by the signal officer of the Army to take charge of ``. . . all matters pertaining to military ballooning, air machines, and all kindred subjects.'' Ward became the first noncommissioned officer of the enlisted nucleus that eventually evolved into the present-day Aviation Branch of the Army.  His career was comprised of a great deal of leadership. He headed the team that uncrated and prepared the Wright aircraft for military trials at Fort Omaha. He also served at several air schools including Fort Omaha and the Philippines Air School. However the majority of his career was spent in the Aeronautic Branch of the Signal Corps until his retirement from the armed forces in 1930.  The Order of St. Michael uses the story of St. Michael defeating the dragon to exemplify the bravery and gallantry associated with the aviation soldier and the boldness and swiftness of aviation on the battlefield. Edward Ward was a true Kentuckian and an American hero who epitomizes the heroism and courage told in this story. He was a prime example of the brave and dedicated soldiers that make our military the best in the world.  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join with me in recognizing 1LT Edward R. Ward's dedication to our military and our country.                          ____________________
