On the day that we had the Amtrak crash, they cut the capital acquisition account for Amtrak by $251 million, despite the fact that Amtrak has a $20 billion backlog.  There are 140-year-old tunnels that are near collapse, which will paralyze the East Coast. There are bridges that are 100, 110, 120 years old--and, yes, we do not yet have the positive train control system on all of Amtrak's routes.  That has been something that has only been recommended for 25 years by the National Transportation Safety Board. This is pretty pathetic.
