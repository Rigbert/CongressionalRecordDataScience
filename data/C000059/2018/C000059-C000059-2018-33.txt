Chairman, I rise in support of the gentleman's amendment.  In 2015, a Federal court ordered the Fish and Wildlife Service to remove the lesser prairie chicken from the list of threatened and endangered species. Environmental activists immediately petitioned the Agency to list the species again, and the Agency, having been stung by the court, concluded that the petition had merit.  Now the Agency is on the verge of listing the species yet again, and it will end up in court again, where it will be delisted again. Rinse and repeat.  Folks, how many times must we repeat this cycle before people start working together? How much money must be wasted fighting each other before we realize that our money is better spent actually helping the species?  This amendment calls a timeout on the madness, at least for one species. That is why I am urging an ``aye'' vote.
