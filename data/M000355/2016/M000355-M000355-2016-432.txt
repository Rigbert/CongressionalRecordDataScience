 President, I wish to pay tribute to a good friend and mentor of mine who is receiving a great honor from his alma mater of Western Kentucky University. Judge Tom Emberton, former chief judge of the Kentucky Court of Appeals and a man with a long career of renowned service, will be honored as a member of WKU's Hall of Distinguished Alumni this October. It is the highest award the university can bestow upon an alumnus.  Judge Emberton recalls that his great aunt began the family tradition of attending WKU, and his mother attended also. Tom met his wife at WKU, and their two children and all but one of their grandchildren attended as well.  Tom was an active member of the WKU community during his time on campus. He was named business manager of the College Heights Herald, elected president of his sophomore and junior classes, and president of his fraternity. He temporarily interrupted his studies to serve in the U.S. Air Force, where he was part of the Strategic Air Command under Gen. Curtis LeMay.  After graduation in 1958, Tom began a long history of public service to the people of Kentucky. In 1965, he was elected county attorney. In 1967, he worked on the winning campaign for Louie Nunn for Governor, the first Republican Governor to be elected in the Bluegrass State in 20 years. After the campaign, Governor Nunn asked Tom to serve as his chief administrative aide.  Tom then became the Republican nominee for Governor himself in 1971. I remember the campaign well, as I worked on it for Tom. I had left my position as a legislative aide here in the U.S. Senate for Kentucky Senator Marlow Cook to go back to Kentucky to work for Tom's campaign because I believed in him and in what he could do for the Commonwealth. Unfortunately, Tom did not win that race, but he certainly emerged from it as a man who had earned admiration and respect around the State. We all knew great things were in store for Tom.  Tom continued to practice law in Barren and Metcalfe counties. Then in the late 1980s, he was appointed by then-Governor Wallace Wilkinson to the Kentucky Court of Appeals. He was reelected to that panel repeatedly and had a long and distinguished career, capped off by being elected chief judge by his fellow judges after several years of service. He held that chief judge slot until his retirement from the bench in 2004.  To this day, Tom is still active in his community with many volunteer and philanthropic activities. He is also an avid reader, and I know one of his favorite places to relax is in his office surrounded by books.  Western Kentucky University has certainly made the right choice in selecting Judge Tom Emberton as a distinguished alumni. My friend Tom is highly deserving of this honor, and I am sure his family is very proud of him and all he has accomplished. I know my U.S. Senate colleagues join me in congratulating Judge Emberton for this recognition and wishing him the very best in his future life endeavors.  Mr. President, area publication the Herald News recently published an article detailing Judge Emberton's life and career. I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 [From the Herald News, June 29, 2016]                     Judge Emberton Honored by WKU                          (By Shirley Mayrand)       Every couple of years we're reminded of why we're so proud      of Judge Tom Emberton. In 2014 he received the Jim C. Coleman      Community Service Award, and in October he will join WKU's      Hall of Distinguished Alumni during WKU's 2016 Homecomings      Celebration at the Sloan Convention Center. It brings back      some fond memories.       ``Western has always been a part of my life,'' Tom said,      ``even from a small first grader. My mother went to      Western.'' His mom finished a year of college and then got a      teaching job at a Monroe County school where they lived at      the time. Tom recalls how she told him as a first grader he      could continue to have fun when he got to Western.       The family moved to Metcalfe County right after World War      II ended and Tom graduated from Edmonton High School. He      attended one semester at Western before going into the U.S.      Air Force where he was part of the Strategic Air Command      under General Curtis LeMay. ``His mission,'' Tom explained,      ``was that if Russia could get an atomic bomb off in this      country, that we could respond to that in 15 minutes.''       In 1955, Tom returned home to resume his education at      Western. He credits his great aunt with starting the family      tradition of attending WKU. She enrolled in 1909, just three      years after it opened. (H.H. Cherry purchased full ownership      of the school in 1899 and the Southern Normal School part of      the institution became Western Kentucky State Normal School      in 1906.)       Tom met his wife, Julia there, their two children attended      and all but one of their grandchildren.       Tom believes that his active role at WKU was what earned      him the honor of being selected for the Hall of Distinguished      Alumni. As a student he was named business manager of the      College Heights Herald, elected president of his sophomore      and junior classes and president of his fraternity.       Continuing on to the University of Louisville to pursue a      law degree, he continued student leadership activities. He      was the president of the Delta Theta Phi fraternity and      president of the Student Bar Association. ``It's those things      that the alumni association looked at to see what you'd done,      rather than just walk into class.'' Tom got his law degree in      1962 and was elected as county attorney in 1965.       In 1967, Tom was tapped by Louis Nunn to assist in his      campaign for governor. When Nunn won the election he asked      Tom to move to Frankfort and be his chief administrative      aide. At that time a governor could only serve one four-year      term. Tom's own bid for the governorship ended after winning      the Republican primary, and he returned to the farm at Cave      Ridge to practice law in Barren and Metcalfe counties, where      he brought Jim C. Coleman in as a law partner.       Around 1976, Tom opened the Southern Mineral coal mine in      Hyden (Lesley County), KY. Coal was very lucrative at the      time, but within a few years the bottom dropped out and he      returned to law once again.       Over his long, successful career, his greatest satisfaction      came while serving as a Kentucky Court of Appeals Judge. He      was first     appointed around 1988 to fill a vacancy, then was re-elected      to the 14-judge panel repeatedly until he retired in 2004      after being elected Chief Judge in 2001. From 2004 to 2009 he      was required to substitute as necessary.       ``I made the mistake of buying a bunch of cattle. I've been      an avid reader all my life, and I made plans that when I      retired I was just going to sit up here (in my office) and      read. I haven't gotten through ten percent of them and I'm 84      years old.''       Reminiscing once more on WKU, Tom concluded, ``I worked at      a filling station greasing cars and changing tires during      high school. If it had not been for Western; if Dr. Cherry      had decided not to set a building in Bowling Green . . . I'd      probably still be doing that today.''                          ____________________
