President, I would like to engage my colleague from Iowa in a dialog on this issue relative to the budget and the deficit.  The question I asked earlier related to the experience of the Senator from Iowa when he traveled his State and the response of the people of Iowa when it came to the suggestion of President Bush that his tax cut program--primarily for the wealthiest people in the country--be made permanent law. And I asked the Senator: I know that everyone likes a tax cut, but what are you finding?  If I might have the permission of the Chair to ask this question of the Senator from Iowa, without yielding the floor----
