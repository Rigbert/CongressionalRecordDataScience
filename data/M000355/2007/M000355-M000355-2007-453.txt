 President, a great injustice has come to an end. I rise to recognize the clearing of a good man's name.  Former Senator Bill Frist, with whom I and my Republican colleagues had the honor of serving for 12 years in the Senate, was cleared last week of every allegation of wrongdoing related to his ownership and sale of stock while serving as majority leader.  I rise because, with the exception of an editorial in this morning's Wall Street Journal, the clearing of this good and honorable man's name has gone largely unreported.  It is a sad fact of political life in America that the mere allegation of wrongdoing--the mere allegation of wrongdoing--has the power to tarnish someone's name and dog them for years. But worse still is the silence that so often greets the vindication of the accused.  I remember the rush to judgment that followed the allegations. I remember the memo Democrats sent out attacking Bill on ethical grounds.
