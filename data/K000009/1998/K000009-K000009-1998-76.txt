Chairman, I support the gentleman in his opposition to this particular amendment. I think every single account in agriculture, whether it is research, whether it is conservation, whether it deals with emergency feeding, whether it is WIC, school lunch, we can go down the list, every single account needs more money and wants more money. I think we have been very fair. In the research accounts, I think that we accommodate various interests around the country. We just do not favor one set of perhaps powerful interests that would want to do research. On behalf of the United States of America, I think we have produced a good bill. A lot of this research is continuing research.  It is unfortunate that when additional research dollars were sought and they attempted to make them mandatory, of course, there were no funds, user fees or other sources of revenue that could help us pay for those research projects. I think it would be unfair to try to rearrange the order that we have set now within the bill. I think we have been very fair to the research accounts. Unfortunately if people want more dollars for research, they are going to have to come up with revenue sources to pay for them. I support the chairman in his opposition to this amendment.
