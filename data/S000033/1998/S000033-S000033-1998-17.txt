 Chairman, I would just suggest that Members have been waiting here for many hours. This is an issue of enormous consequence. There are a lot of speakers who would like to speak.  So I do appreciate, I think we appreciate, the gentleman's wanting to move this long, but a lot of people have waited a long time to give their thoughts on this issue.
