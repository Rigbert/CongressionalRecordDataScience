What is in this conference committee report about the Capitol Police is totally undeserved and unwarranted. It is a shame there are some people in this Capitol, not necessarily on this side of the Rotunda, who unfortunately put that language in here. Remember, we are here safely today because they are literally risking their lives as we do our work. For goodness sakes, they deserve our appreciation, and they do not deserve the condemnation that is part of this conference committee report.
