Speaker, I, too, would like to rise to honor the life of Ed Roybal, a great Member of this House with whom I had the pleasure of serving for many years when I first came here back during the 1980s. I would have to say that no one fought harder for health care, particularly for senior citizens and Social Security and Medicare, than the great congressman from the State of California, Mr. Roybal.  He had a quiet strength about him and great dignity, and he treated Members with such graciousness. I certainly remember how he treated me when I first came to the House as a new Member. There were only 24 women serving in the House at that time. I think it is fair to say we have come a long way since then, but Ed Roybal is someone who especially was kind to the women and to the new Members, and I shall never forget him for that.  He helped me in my own campaign when I was running for reelection in my district back in the mid-1980s when there was an effort made to distort votes on Social Security and Medicare, and Ed Roybal came to set the record straight.  I would like to extend to his daughter, who I know he is smiling on today as she serves here in this Congress, and to his entire family the greatest sympathy from the people of Ohio who thank him for the efforts toward which he dedicated his life. I know that the senior citizens who continued to receive Social Security and Medicare during the decades of the 1980s and 1990s and now into the 21st century have Ed Roybal to thank for that.  Condolences to the entire Roybal-Allard family on the passing of this great American gentleman and lawmaker.                          ____________________
