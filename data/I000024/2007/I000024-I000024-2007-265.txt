President, may I ask a point of inquiry of the Senator from Massachusetts. Apparently the desk is not in agreement with what we did. We set aside the pending amendment for consideration of my amendment which I brought up and presented. Then we returned to that amendment. I would like to ask the Chair if that is accurate.
