 President, on April 27 to April 29, 1996, more than 1,300 students from 50 States and the District of Columbia will be in Washington, DC to compete in the national finals of the We the People . . . The Citizen and the Constitution program. I am proud to announce that a class from Male High School in Louisvillewill represent Kentucky. These young scholars have worked diligently to reach the national finals by winning local competitions in our home State.  The distinguished member of the team representing Kentucky are: Abby Alster, Jil Beyerle, Lori Buchter, Adam Burns, Melissa Chandler, Sienna Greenwell, Patrick Hallahan, Nicole Hardin, Tony Heun, Michelle Hill, Patricia Holloway, Cammie Kramer, Kevin Laugherty, Anne-Marie Lucchese, Astrud Masterson, Kimberly Merritt, Tiffany Miller, Matthew Parish, Angela Rankin, Dana Smith, Danielle Vereen, Maleka Williams, Jamie Zeller.  I would also like to recognize their teacher, Sandra Hoover, who deserves a lot of credit for the success of the team. The district coordinator, Diane Meredith, and the State coordinators, Deborah Williamson and Jennifer Van Hoose, also contributed a significant amount of time and effort to help the team reach the national finals.  The We the People . . . The Citizen and the Constitution program is the most extensive educational program in the country developed specifically to educate young people about the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. The 3-day national competition simulates a congressional hearing in which students' oral presentations are judged on the basis of their knowledge of constitutional principles and their ability to apply them to historical and contemporary issues.  Administered by the Center for Civic Education, the We the People . . . program, now in its 9th academic year, has reached more than 70,400 teachers and 22,600,000 students nationwide at the upper elementary, middle, and high school levels. Members of Congress and their staff enhance the program by discussing current constitutional issues with students and teachers.  The We the People . . . program provides an excellent opportunity for students to gain an informed perspective on the significance of the U.S. Constitution and its place in our history and our lives. I wish these students the best of luck in the national finals and look forward to their continued success in the years ahead.                          ____________________
