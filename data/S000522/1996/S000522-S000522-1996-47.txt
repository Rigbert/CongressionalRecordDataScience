Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  First of all, I want to thank the gentleman from Iowa, Chairman Lightfoot, for his humane and courageous leadership in ensuring in this legislation that taxpayers are not forced to subsidize the killing of unborn baby boys and girls by abortion.  Let me make it very clear that the taxpayers pay into this program approximately more than 70 percent of the total funding. The premium payers, all of us who are part of the Federal employees health benefits program, pick up the remaining 30 percent of the cost of our health insurance, but the taxpayers of the United States of America are paying for 70 percent of the cost associated with this program. So this is very much akin to the Hyde amendment because the taxpayers are indeed paying for abortion on demand if the Hoyer amendment is enacted into law.  Let me just say, Mr. Chairman, that I have always been struck by the considerable lengths some people will go to sanitize and to deny realities that are unflattering to their cause, inconvenient and messy to face. The plain fact of the matter is that abortion methods either dismember an unborn child's fragile body or burn her alive in a poison solution, while some babies are killed by the partial birth abortion method. Those victim babies are stabbed in the back of the neck with scissors and have their brains sucked out. Yet all of this cruelty is euphemistically referred to as choice and vigorously defended as an expression of freedom rather than the child abuse that it is.  Whole societies, Mr. Chairman, have at times bought into gross evils dressed up as legitimate and good. The abomination of slavery was vigorously defended by the best and the brightest of its day. Just read Roger Taney's Dred Scott decision--an apologetic that looks and sounds remarkably like Roe versus Wade.                              {time}  1115  The subjugation of whole nations, bride burning, female genital mutilation, and even human sacrifice have had their sincere and sophisticated apologists. Of course, they were and are dead wrong, but these human rights abuses have their apologists. In the past three decades, the abortion rights movement, a multimillion-dollar industry, takes the prize for intellectual dishonesty, the art of the skillful dodge, and the clever manipulation of euphemisms designed to conceal an utterly gruesome reality.  All of the arguments marched out to justify the slaughter of unborn babies used in today's debate and used in other debates that we have had on this floor were first conceived, tested, and marketed by public opinion specialists, pollsters, and focus groups. Those talking points that routinely find their way into our offices from NARAL and Planned Parenthood are the best that market research can buy.  Still, it is amazing to me that in 1996, with all of the breathtaking advances in fetology, the use of the ultrasound technology and microsurgery for the baby in the womb, that some can still stand here with straight faces and argue that the taxpayers and the premium payers should pay millions of dollars to dismember and to poison these precious little kids. The sanitizing of these child killings has so insulated some from the cruelty of abortion that they somehow believe that they are enlightened to take that point of view.  Way back in 1976, Mr. Chairman, I asked my predecessor, then Congressman Frank Thompson, who swore he was personally opposed to abortion, and I kept saying to him, why are you personally opposed? He just came back and said, well, I am personally opposed. Well, I asked him if he thought that a baby was involved in abortion. Was a baby killed? He said, and I quote, ``You can't have an abortion unless there is a baby involved.'' Then he became a little bit red-faced, after he saw what he had just admitted. And a reporter who was on the scene at the time, and my wife, were frankly shocked, but pleased with his candor. He at least admitted that a human baby was killed as a result of abortion.  Recently I read in the Weekly Standard an article by Tucker Carlson entitled, ``What Pro-choice Republicans Believe.'' I frankly was absolutely amazed by the answers given by some of my good friends and colleagues on our side of the aisle, and it was a kind of deja vu of the conversation that I had some 20 years ago with my predecessor, then Congressman Frank Thompson. One prominent lawmaker was asked why he was personally opposed to abortion. The article described it this way. Senator Specter stopped cold. Eighteen seconds of uncomfortable silence pass. The Senator has spent much of the past year talking incessantly about abortion, and yet he seems baffled by the question, as if it has never been asked before or even imagined that it could be asked.  When Senator Specter finally replies, his tone has changed. He speaks through clenched teeth: ``Well, it is something I would not choose to do, and I would just leave it at that.'' And Senator Specter does leave it at that.  Asked to elaborate on his views, he angrily refuses. ``I think it says allthere is to say that I'm opposed to it. Now, do you have another question?''  Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask that question of the Members that are arguing for abortion funding today. I especially want to ask this of my colleague from Illinois [Mr. Durbin]. And again let me remind you, 70 percent of the funding used for the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program is taxpayers' dollars. So Mr. Lightfoot's language is very much a parallel to the Hyde amendment. Yes, there is some money that you and I and others kick in. It is only 30 percent in terms of premium payers, and even many of those, like myself, a premium payer, do not want that money as well to be bundled and used to pay for abortions on demand. That is what the Hoyer amendment would do.  It is abortion on demand, abortion for birth control reasons. And if the Hoyer amendment is passed, if his amendment becomes law, the U.S. Government will subsidize the slaying of children. Back in 1983, before the pro-life rider was in effect, some 17,000 babies were killed each year, facilitated and subsidized by the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program and by the taxpayers.  I would like to ask my friend from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, who is standing here waiting to speak, do you believe that an unborn child is a human being? Perhaps you would like to answer. On your time, I hope you will.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. I do hope the gentleman will answer that when he takes the podium, whether or not there is a human life destroyed by abortion.
