  As I highlighted in recent days, we have before us a nominee whose skills and background are tailor-made for the responsibilities of the office. Ms. Bowman has extensive experience in community banking, and the seat to be filled is intended for an expert in that very field.  My colleagues hardly need me to illustrate any further the role that small community banks play in the lives of family farms, small businesses, and communities all across our country. It is time to take an important step for them and confirm this well-qualified nominee.  Yesterday, we passed legislation to reauthorize the Coast Guard by an overwhelming bipartisan majority.
