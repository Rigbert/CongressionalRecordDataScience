 What is in this bill is extremely important to my constituents. We have some of the worst traffic in the Nation. I know the Senator from Illinois has severe traffic problems. We share airport concerns in our home States for which this bill has improvement funding. We are ready to go to final passage.  I would just add, I say to the Senator from Illinois, we have a managers' package ready to go. We could be done in the next half hour, move this bill out, and go to the Ag bill to which the Senator referred. I am deeply concerned that we have delayed its passage.  I have apple farmers and tree fruit farmers in central Washington who are in severe financial straits.
