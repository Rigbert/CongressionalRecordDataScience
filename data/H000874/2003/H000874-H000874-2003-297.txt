Speaker, I yield to my friend, and I am glad to see him on the floor, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay), the leader, for the purpose of inquiring about the schedule for next week.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer) for yielding to me.  Mr. Speaker, the House will convene on Monday at 12:30 p.m. for morning hour debates and 2 p.m. for legislative business. We will consider several measures under suspension of rules. A final list of those bills will be sent to the Members' offices by the end of the week. Any votes called on those measures will be rolled until 6:30 p.m.  On Tuesday and Wednesday we expect to consider additional bills under suspension of the rules. We also plan to consider several bills under a rule: H.R. 2115, the Flight 100--Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act, to reauthorize programs for the Federal Aviation Administration; H.R. 1115, the Class Action Fairness Act; and H.R. 2143, the Unlawful Internet Gambling Funding Prohibition Act.  In addition to these bills, we may also consider H.R. 1528, the Taxpayer Protection and IRS Accountability Act.  And, finally, I would like to note for all Members that we are making a change in the schedule that was sent to offices at the beginning of the year. We do not plan to have votes next Friday, June 13.
