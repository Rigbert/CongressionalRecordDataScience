 My concern, and the concern of the Senator from New Hampshire, is that essentially this is going to change the focus of this legislation to put it on the mail-order and catalog issues. There are Members of the U.S. Senate who feel that mail-order and catalog sales are insufficiently taxed. I am not one of them. I am one who believes that we all ought to work together, on a bipartisan basis, to deal with tomorrow's set of economic concerns, which involves the digital economy.  I tell the Senator from Arkansas that as the original sponsor of this legislation, I have made more than 30 separate changes to this legislation in an effort to accommodate what I think are valid concerns which come from States and municipalities and others who are advocating the viewpoint of the Senator from Arkansas.  But what I am not willing to support is essentially changing the focus of this legislation. If we do that, I believe that the 100,000 home-based businesses in my State, and the hundreds of thousands across this country, are not going to see their concerns addressed; I think we will not be taking advantage of the opportunity to look at the Internet issues objectively, and we will lose that focus and take it off into another area which is, in my view, likely to not produce consensus with respect to the mail-order or catalog issue, nor make the progress we need to with respect to the Internet.  Mr. President, I yield back the time.  Several Senators addressed the Chair.
