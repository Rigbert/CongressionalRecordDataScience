President, I delighted that the majority leader has decided to take up the nomination of Eric L. Clay to be a U.S. Circuit Judge for the Sixth Circuit. Mr. Clay is a well-qualified nominee.  The Judiciary Committee unanimously reported his nomination to the Senate on May 22, 1997. The sixth circuit desperately needs Eric Clay to help manage its growing backlog of cases. In fact, the sixth circuit has three vacancies, two of which have been designated judicial emergencies by the Judicial Conference of the United States.  We first received Eric Clay's nomination in March 1996. He was accorded a hearing in the last Congress on March 26, 1996, and was reported by Judiciary Committee to the full Senate on April 25, 1996. Unfortunately, his nomination was never acted upon because of the Presidential election year slowdown of judicial confirmations in 1996.  The President renominated Eric Clay on the first day of this Congress for the same vacancy on the sixth circuit, which vacancy has existed since September 1994. This is one of the judicial emergency vacancies that we should have filled last year. This vacancy has persisted for more than 2\1/2\ years. He has the support of both Senators from Michigan, a Republican and a Democrat. He had a confirmation hearing on May 7 and the committee considered and unanimously reported his nomination to the Senate 2 weeks later. This important nomination was held without action on the Senate Executive Calendar for over 2 months by the Republican leadership.  I am delighted for Mr. Clay and his family that his nomination is finally being confirmed and am confident that he will make a fine member of the sixth circuit.                          ____________________
