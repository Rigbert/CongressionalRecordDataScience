Chairman, I would just like to comment, in asking my colleagues to support this amendment, that the amendment itself is intended to address the two Supreme Court decisions. And in addition, if we leave this language in the bill, the chairman was correct, this is at the policy level. This doesn't belong in an appropriation bill. Let them deal with this in the courts and the authorizing committees.  I think it creates a very, very high speed bump that threatens our bill's passage as we move forward, so I ask my colleagues to support us on striking the provision related to the waters of the United States, section 108 offered by myself and Mr. Beyer of Virginia.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
