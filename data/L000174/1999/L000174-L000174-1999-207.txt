Peter that one of the trials you had on Earth was the senior Senator from Vermont, who is your friend, as you know. We have been friends for many years.  On the number of Federal judges, though, I do get letters from lawyers all over the country, and I believe even from the State of Mississippi, from their trial bar, in several cases where, having paid all kinds of taxes, they now have to hire arbitrators to hear the cases because the dockets are too full. I am hearing from Federal prosecutors all over this country this is a matter of some concern, that because of the speedy trial rules under the Constitution and practice, they are concerned about their cases. There aren't enough judges to try them. So there are some areas where we do have some serious problems. We know that the Chief Justice of the United States has criticized the lack of enough judges to do the work of the courts and the time it takes to get vacancies filled.  We have two judges we could voice vote right now--there would be no objection--James Lorenz and Victor Marrero, Calendar Nos. 213 and 214.
