President, with the forbearance of my friend from Wyoming, I am pleased to tell the managers of the bill and all that we have reached agreement with Senators Enzi, Kennedy, Snowe, and Klobuchar to preserve the important privacy protections of electronic health records in the bill. I think these changes will help ensure there are meaningful privacy protections for America's electronic health records in place. I know that is something both the Senator from Wyoming and I are interested in. This helps. I support the amendment, and I urge its immediate adoption.
