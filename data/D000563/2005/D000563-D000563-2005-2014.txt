Ten years ago, Randall Lemmon and his wife Mary were living in Champaign, IL, downstate Illinois. His wife was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease, sceradoma, a connective tissue disease which can debilitate very quickly. Within months of her diagnosis, Mary experienced the loss of independent functioning and found herself needing assistance with even the most basic tasks in life. She eventually collapsed and went to a nursing home, which was not covered by the family's insurance. Eventually she died, leaving behind her husband, five children, and a $150,000 nursing home bill. As a result, they were forced into bankruptcy.  Currently, in Illinois you can only protect $7,500, up to $15,000 in the value of your home. What could anyone live in for $15,000? Here is Randall Lemmon with five children, and because he was forced into bankruptcy court he would lose his home.  Senator, you are saying, at the minimum, let him at least protect $150,000 in his home to raise the five children after his wife has died in a nursing home; is that what your amendment says?
