 If, in fact, a taxpayer goes in to the regional director of the EPA or into any number of Federal ``alphabet'' agencies and sits down and says, I want to do the following, and then in laying out the facts of what they intend on doing does not disclose all the facts--does not, for example, tell the regulator that where they want to lay this pipe or where they want to build this building is in the middle of a swamp. He says, ``I own a piece of land that is high ground and here is my plan, this is what I want to do. Can I do it?''  If the taxpayer does not fully disclose to the agency the actual facts as the taxpayer knows them, does the Senator intend for that taxpayer to be held harmless, if it turns out the rule has been violated?
