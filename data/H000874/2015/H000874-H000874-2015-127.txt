Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, my friend, Dr. Burgess, has just made an observation, that this resolution is about the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee Appropriations bill. I will tell Mr. Speaker, as you know--and the American people, I am sure, know--that that Agency is funded through September 30 of this year, which means we have months to go before it will run out of funds.  The other bill that he mentions, of course, as you know, is about a proposal, not a rule. It may be a rule at some point in time, but it is a proposal which has no absolute definite need to be done today or next week or next month.  However, Mr. Speaker, the Export-Import Bank, if we do not act by tomorrow, loses its authority to loan money or to support--not to loan money, but to support the selling of goods from America by American workers to those abroad.  We just went through a trade debate which was about jobs and whether or not it was going to undermine jobs in America. Now, my previous colleague, Ms. Waters, mentioned President Reagan, she mentioned President Bush, and she mentioned President Clinton. But the person who says we are going to lose jobs if we don't pass the Export-Import Bank is the Speaker of this House, Mr. Speaker, John Boehner of Ohio. He says, if we don't pass this, we are immediately going to start losing jobs--John Boehner, Speaker of the House from Ohio.  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the House bring up H.R. 1031--a bill to protect thousands of American jobs by preventing the Export-Import Bank from shutting down.
