 President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter and testimony regarding this bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                        Gun Owners of America,                                    Springfield, VA, May 18, 1995.       Dear Senator: The tragic bombing in Oklahoma City has,      unfortunately, provoked a ``feeding frenzy'' of efforts to      manipulate the unfortunate victims for the political      advantage of certain special interests and ideological points      of view. These efforts have been embodied in attempts to      blame pro-Second Amendment organizations, pro-life groups, or      Republicans in general for what appear to be the actions of      isolated madmen.       In this climate, it is particularly important that we not      over-react or react foolishly to the heart-rending events      which we, as a nation, have witnessed. On April 27, S. 735      was introduced by the Majority Leader and the Chairman of the      Senate Judiciary Committee, and was brought directly onto the      Senate calendar. While avoiding some of the most extreme      proposals which have been posited for political advantage in      the wake of the bombing, S. 735 nevertheless contains some      provisions which are far too dangerous to be considered      without hearings, markup, and the normal checks and balances      of the legislative process.       As introduced, Gun Owners of America would oppose S. 735,      and would rate any vote for that legislation as an anti-gun      vote. In particular, we object to provisions of S. 735 which      would:       Allow the BATF to go after gun dealers for far-reaching      ``conspiracy'' charges involving no overt act at all;       Significantly broaden the materials which the Secretary of      the Treasury could require from law-abiding businesses,      groups and individuals;       Preempt state law enforcement efforts in many circumstances      which are primarily of local concern,       Broaden the authority of the FBI to make demands of      citizens not suspected of crimes, and, in general, increase      the ability of government to intrude on the privacy and      rights of individuals.       It may well be the Congress, after due consideration, will      decide that some changes in federal law are necessary. But      this is not an area where legislation should be adopted prior      to full consideration of the ramifications of that      legislation. I therefore urge you to step back, hold      hearings, and take time to consider what, if any, changes in      federal law would genuinely address the issue of terrorism,      rather than merely serving as a political placebo. The      country and the Constitution will both be healthier as a      result of your efforts.           Sincerely,                                                      Larry Pratt,     Executive Director.                                                                    ____Excerpts From Written Testimony Before the U.S. Senate Committee on the     Judiciary, Submitted by David B. Kopel, Associate Policy Analyst                              wiretapping       Various proposals have been offered to expand dramatically      the scope of wiretapping. For example, the Clinton bill      defines almost all violent and property crime (down to petty      offenses below misdemeanors) as ``terrorism'' and also allow      wiretaps for ``terrorism'' investigations.       Other proposals would allow wiretaps for all federal      felonies, rather than for the special subet of felonies for      which wiretaps have been determined to be especially      necessary. Notably, wiretaps are already available for the      fundamental terrorist offenses: arson and homicide.      Authorizing wiretaps for evasion of federal vitamin      regulations, gun registration requirements, or wetlands      regulations is hardly a serious contribution to anti-     terrorism, but amounts to a bait-and-switch on the American      people.       Currently, FBI wiretapping, bugging, and secret break-ins      of the property of American groups is allowed after approval      from a seven-member federal court which meets in secret. Of      the 7,554 applications which the FBI has submitted in since      1978, 7,553 have been approved.       Making the request for vast new wiretap powers all the more      unconvincing is how poorly wiretap powers have been used in      the past. Terrorists are, of course, already subject to being      wiretapped. Yet as federal wiretaps set new record highs      every year, wiretaps are used almost exclusively for      gambling, racketeering, and drugs. The last known wiretap for      a bombing investigation was in 1998. Of the 976 federal      electronic eavesdropping applications in 1993, not a single      one was for arson, explosives, or firearms, let alone      terrorism. From 1983 to 1993, of the 8,800 applications for      eavesdropping, only 16 were for arson, explosives, or      firearms. In short, requests for vast new wiretapping powers      because of terrorism are akin to a carpenter asking for a      pile driver to hammer a nail, while a hammer lies nearby,      unused.       Even more disturbing than proposals to expand the      jurisdictional base for wiretaps are efforts to remove legal      controls on wiretaps. For example, wiretaps are authorized      for the interception of particular speakers on particular      phone lines. If the interception target keeps switching      telephones (as by using a variety of pay phones), the      government may ask the court for a ``roving wiretap,''      authorizing interception of any phone line the target is      using. Yet while roving wiretaps are currently available when      the government shows the court a need, the Clinton and Dole      bills allow roving wiretaps for ``terrorism''      [[Page S7604]] without court order. (Again, remember that      both bills define ``terrorism'' as almost all violent or      property crime.)       The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) provides      procedures for authorizing wiretaps in various cases. These      procedures have worked in the most serious foreign espionage      cases. Yet the Clinton and Dole bills would authorize use of      evidence gathered in violation of FISA in certain deportation      proceedings.                       warrantless data gathering       Proposals have also been offered to require credit card      companies, financial reporting services, hotels, airlines,      and bus companies to turn over customer information whenever      demanded by the federal government. Document subpoenas are      currently available whenever the government wishes to coerce      a company into disclosing private customer information. Thus,      the proposals do not increase the type of private information      that the government can obtain; the proposals simply allow      the government to obtain the information even when the      government cannot show a court that there is probable cause      to believe that the documents contain evidence of illegal      activity.       Similar analysis may be applied to proposals to increase      the use of pen registers (which record phone numbers called,      but do not record conversations, and thus do not      require a warrant). If a phone company has a high enough      regard for its customers' privacy so as to not allow pen      registers to be used without any controls, the government      may obtain a court order to place a pen register. Business      respect for customer privacy ought to be encouraged, not      outlawed.          curtailing first amendment rights of computer users       For some government agencies, the Oklahoma City tragedy has      become a vehicle for enactment of ``wish list'' legislation      that has nothing to do with Oklahoma City, but which it is      apparently hoped the ``do something'' imperative of the      moment will not examine carefully.       One prominent example is legislation to drastically curtail      the right of habeas corpus. Although Supreme Court decisions      in recent years have already sharply limited habeas corpus,      prosecutors' lobbies want to go even further. Two obvious      points should be made: First, habeas corpus has nothing to do      with apprehending criminals; by definition, anyone who files      a habeas corpus petition is already in prison. Second, habeas      corpus has nothing to do with Oklahoma City in particular, or      terrorism in general.       A second example, of piggybacking irrelevant legislation      designed to reduce civil liberties are current FBI efforts to      outlaw computer privacy.       If a person writes a letter to another person, he can write      the letter in a secret code. If the government intercepts the      letter, and cannot figure out the secret code, the government      is out of luck. These basic First Amendment principles have      never been questioned.       But, if instead of writing the letter with pen and paper,      the letter is written electronically, and mailed over a      computer network rather than postal mail, do privacy      interests suddenly vanish? According to FBI director Louis      Freeh, the answer is apparently ``yes.''       Testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee about      Oklahoma City, director Freeh complained that people can      communicate over the internet ``in encrypted conversations      for which we have no available means to read and understand      unless that encryption problem is dealt with immediately.''      ``That encryption problem'' (i.e. people being able to      communicate privately) could only be solved by outlawing high      quality encryption software like Pretty Good Privacy.       First of all, shareware versions of Pretty Good Privacy are      ubiquitous throughout American computer networks. The cat      cannot be put back in the bag. More fundamentally, the      potential that a criminal, including a terrorist, might      misuse private communications is no reason to abolish private      communications per se. After all, people whose homes are      lawfully bugged can communicate privately by writing with an      Etch-a-Sketch. That is no reason to outlaw Etch-a-Sketch.       Although Mr. Freeh apparently wants to outlaw encryption      entirely, the Clinton administration has been proposing the      ``Clipper Chip.'' The federal government has begun requiring      that all vendors supplying phones to the federal government      include the ``Clipper'' chip. Using the federal government's      enormous purchasing clout, the Clinton administration is      attempting to make the Clipper Chip into a de facto national      standard.       The clipper chips provides a low level of privacy      protection against casual snoopers. But some computer      scientists have already announced that the chip can be      defeated. Moreover, the ``key''--which allows the private      phone conversation, computer file, or electronic mail to be      opened up by unauthorized third parties--will be held by the      federal government.       The federal government promises that it will keep the key      carefully guarded, and only use the key to snoop when      absolutely necessary. This is the same federal government      that promised that social security numbers would only be used      to administer the social security system, and that the      Internal Revenue Service would never be used for political      purposes.       Proposals for the federal government's acquisition of a key      to everyone's electronic data, which the government promises      never to misuse, might be compared to the federal      government's proposing to acquire a key to everyone's home.      Currently, people can buy door locks and other security      devices that are of such high quality that covert entry by      the government is impossible; the government might be able to      break the door down, but the government would not be able to      enter discretely, place an electronic surveillance device,      and then leave. Thus, high-quality locks can defeat a lawful      government attempt to read a person's electronic      correspondence or data.       Similarly, it is legal for the government to search through      somebody's garbage without a warrant; but there is nothing      wrong with the privacy-conscious people and businesses using      paper shredders to defeat any potential garbage snooping.      Even if high-quality shredders make it impossible for      documents to be pieced back together, such shredders should      not be illegal.       Likewise, while wiretaps or government surveillance of      computer communications may be legal, there should be no      obligation of individuals or businesses to make wiretapping      easy. Simply put, Americans should not be required to live      their lives in a manner so that the government can spy on      them when necessary.       Thus, although proposals to outlaw or emasculate computer      privacy are sometimes defended as maintaining the status quo      (easy government wiretaps), the true status quo in America is      that manufacturers and consumers have never been required to      buy products which are custom-designed to facilitate      government snooping.       The point is no less valid for electronic keys than it is      for front-door keys. The only reason that electronic privacy      invasions are even discussed (whereas their counterparts for      ``old-fashioned'' privacy invasions are too absurd to even be      contemplated), is the tendency of new technologies to be more      highly restricted than old technologies. For example, the      Supreme Court in the 1920's began allowing searches of      drivers and automobiles that would never have been allowed      for persons riding horses.       But the better Supreme Court decisions recognize that the      Constitution defines a relationship between individuals and      the government that is applied to every new technology. For      example, in United States v. Katz, the Court applied the      privacy principle underlying the Fourth Amendment to prohibit      warrantless eavesdropping on telephone calls made from a      public phone booth--even though telephones had not been      invented at the time of the Fourth Amendment. Likewise, the      principle underlying freedom of the press--that an unfettered      press is an important check on secretive and abusive      governments--remains the same whether a publisher uses a      Franklin press to produce a hundred copies of a pamphlet, or      laser printers to produce a hundred thousand. Privacy rights      for mail remain the same whether the letter is written with a      quill pen and a paper encryption ``wheel,'' or with a      computer and Pretty Good Privacy.       Efforts to limit electronic privacy will harm not just the      First Amendment, but also American commerce. Genuinely secure      public-key encryption (like Pretty Good Privacy) gives users      the safety and convenience of electronic files plus the      security features of paper envelopes and signatures. A good      encryption program can authenticate the creator of a      particular electronic document--just as a written signature      authenticates (more or less) the creator of a particular      paper document.       Public-key encryption can greatly reduce the need for      paper. With secure public-key encryption, businesses could      distribute catalogs, take orders, pay with digital cash, and      enforce contracts with veriable signatures--all without      paper.       Conversely the Clinton administration's weak privacy      protection (giving the federal government the ability to spy      everywhere) means that confidential business secrets will be      easily stolen by business competitors who can bribe local or      federal law enforcement officials to divulge the ``secret''      codes for breaking into private conversations and files, or      who can hack the clipper chips.                           *   *   *   *   *                      right to keep and bear arms                       Cracking down on militias       Equating all militias with white supremacists is nonsense.      Like the Los Angeles Police Department, some militias may      have members, or even officers, who are racist, but that does      not mean that the organization as a whole, or the vast      majority of its members are racists. Most militias are      composed of people with jobs and families; people who are      seeking to protect what they have, not to inflict revenge on      others for their own failings.       The frenzy of hatred being whipped up against law-abiding      militia members is not unlike the hatred to which law-abiding      Arab-Americans would have been subjected,      had Oklahoma City been perpetrated by the Libyan secret      service. It is not unlike the hatred to which Japanese-     Americans were subjected after World War II. Ironically,      some politicians who complain about the coarse, angry tone      of American politics do so in speeches in which they heap      hate-filled invective upon anyone and everyone who belongs      to a militia.       As this Issue Brief is written, no evidence has developed      which ties any militia (let [[Page S7605]] alone all of them)      to the Oklahoma City crime. At most, two suspects are said to      have attended a few militia meetings and left because the      militias did not share their goals. This fact no more proves      a militia conspiracy than the hypothetical fact that the      suspects went to church a few times would prove that the Pope      and Jerry Falwell masterminded the Oklahoma City bombing.       That someone who perpetrated a crime may have attended a      militia meeting is hardly proof that all militias should be      destroyed. The step-father of Susan Smith (the alleged South      Carolina child murderer) sexually molested her one night      after he returned from putting up posters for the Pat      Robertson presidential campaign. What if someone suggested      that the ``radical'' patriarchal theories espoused by      Robertson and the Christian Coalition created the      ``atmosphere'' which led to the incestuous rape, and that      therefore all Christian Coalition members were responsible      for the crime, and the FBI should ``crack down'' on them? The      claim would be dismissed in a second; equally outrageous      claims about gun owners should likewise be dismissed.       It is a sad testament to the bigotry of certain segments of      the media that totally unsubstantiated, vicious conspiracy      theories of the type which were once employed against      Catholics and Jews are now being trotted out against militia      members, patriots, and gun owners.       No militia group was involved with the Oklahoma City      bombing. Despite the hate-mongering of the media, the      ``need'' to start spying on militia groups is a totally      implausible basis for expansion of federal government powers.       Moreover, militia groups hold public meetings, sometimes      advertising in local newspapers. There is hardly a need for      greater ``surveillance'' of such public groups.       To respond intelligently to the militia and patriot      movements, we must acknowledge that, although the movements      are permeated with implausible conspiracy theories, the      movements are a reaction to increasing militarization,      lawlessness, and violence of federal law enforcement, a      genuine problem which should concern all Americans.       We must also remember that it is lawful in the United      States to exercise freedom of speech and the right to bear      arms. Spending one's weekends in the woods practicing with      firearms and listening to right-wing political speeches is      not my idea of a good time, but there is not, and should not,      be anything illegal about it.       If we want to shrink the militia movement, the surest way      is to reduce criminal and abusive behavior by the federal      government, and to require a thorough, open investigation by      a Special Prosecutor of what happened at Waco and at Ruby      Ridge, Idaho. If, as the evidence strongly suggests, the law      was broken, the law-breakers should be prosecuted, even if      they happen to be government employees.       Conversely, the persons responsible for the deaths of      innocent Americans should not be promoted to even-higher      positions in the FBI or federal law enforcement. If the      Clinton administration were trying to fan the flames of      paranoia, it could hardly do better than to have appointed      Larry Potts second-in-command at the FBI.       Militias and patriot groups have been understandably      ridiculed for a paranoid world-view centered on the United      Nations and international banking. But ironically, many of      the people doing the ridiculing share an equally paranoid      world-view. Most members of the establishment media and the      gun control movement have no more idea what a real militia      member is like than militia members have about what a real      international banker is like. In both cases, stereotyping      substitutes for understanding, and familiar devils (the      United Nations for the militia, the National Rifle      Association for the establishment media) are claimed to be      the motive force behind the actions of a man who (allegedly)      believes that the government put a microchip in his buttocks.       Nearly twenty years ago, an article in the Public Interest      explained the American gun control conflict:       ``[U]nderlying the gun control struggle is a fundamental      division in our nation. The intensity of passion on this      issue suggests to me that we are experiencing a sort of low-     grade war going on between two alternative views of what      America is and ought to be. On the one side are those who      take bourgeois Europe as a model of a civilized society: a      society just, equitable, and democratic; but well ordered,      with the lines of authority clearly drawn, and with decisions      made rationally and correctly by intelligent men for the      entire nation. To such people, hunting is atavistic, personal      violence is shameful, and uncontrolled gun ownership is a      blot upon civilization.       ``On the other side is a group of people who do not tend to      be especially articulate or literate, and whose world view is      rarely expressed in print. Their model is that of the      independent frontiersman who takes care of himself and his      family with no interference from the state. They are      `conservative' in the sense that they cling to America's      unique pre-modern tradition--a non-feudal society      with a sort of medieval liberty at large for every man. To      these people, `sociological' is an epithet. Life is tough      and competitive. Manhood means responsibility and caring      for your own.''       The author explained the disaster that America will create      for itself if fearful in government attempt to ``crack down''      on fearful gun-owners, thereby fulfilling the worst fears      that each group has of the other:       ``As they [the gun-owners] say to a man, `I'll bury my guns      in the wall first.' They ask, because they do not understand      the other side, `Why do these people want to disarm us?' They      consider themselves no threat to anyone; they are not      criminals, not revolutionaries. But slowly, as they become      politicized, they find an analysis that fits the phenomenon      they experience: Someone fears their having guns, someone is      afraid of their defending their families, property, and      liberty. Nasty things may happen if these people begin to      feel that they are concerned.       It would be useful, therefore, if some of the mindless      passion, on both side, could be drained out of the gun-     control issue. Gun control is no solution to the crime      problem, to the assassination problem, to the terrorist      problem. . . . [S]o long as the issue is kept at a white      heat, with everyone having some ground to suspect everyone      else's ultimate intentions, the rule of reasonableness has      little chance to assert itself.''                            ASSAULT WEAPONS       Perhaps the most cynical effort to exploit the Oklahoma      City tragedy is the effort of gun prohibition advocates to      use the murders as a pretext for preserving the federal ban      on so-called ``assault weapons.'' To state the obvious, the      Oklahoma City bombing was perpetrated with a bomb, not a gun.      The bombers may have attended meetings of groups which      support the right to keep and bear arms, but that does not      prove that gun rights groups were coconspirators, despite the      vicious insinuations of some gun prohibition advocates.       The reasons for repealing the gun ban remain as strong as      ever. First of all, Congress has no Constitutional power      (under the Constitution's text and original intent) to ban      the simple possession (as opposed to sale in interstate      commerce) of anything.       Second, if one looks at actual police data (rather than      unsupported claims from anti-gun police administrators),      ``assault weapons'' constitute only about one percent of      crime guns.       Third, despite the menacing looks of so-called ``assault      weapons,'' they are not more powerful or more deadly than      firearms with a more conventional appearance. Instead, the      ``assault weapon'' ban is based on cosmetics, such as whether      a gun has a bayonet lug--as if criminals were perpetrating      drive-by bayonetings.       Finally, the ban has already been nullified for all      practical purposes. Since the law defines an ``assault      weapon'' based on trivial characteristics like bayonet lugs,      gun manufacturers have already brought ought new versions of      the banned guns, minus the cosmetically offensive bayonet      lugs and similar components.       Repeal of the ``assault weapon'' ban makes sense as a move      towards a more rational federal criminal justice policy. It      makes even more sense when its social impact is considered.      Many gun control advocates acknowledged that ``assault      weapons'' were a tiny component of the gun crime problem, but      they still liked the ban because of its symbolic value. A      great many other people, however, were very upset by the      symbolic message of the gun ban. Some of them have joined      militias, patriot groups, or similar organizations. Indeed,      it would be no exaggeration to say that President Clinton,      Representative Schumer, and Senator Feinstein have, through      pushing the gun ban through Congress, done more to promote      the surge in militia membership than anyone else in the      nation.       If we want to reduce the number of people who are      frightened by the federal government, the federal government      should stop frightening so many people. Given the irrelevance      of the ``assault weapon'' ban to actual crime control, repeal      of the ban would be a very important step that the federal      government could take to convincing millions of Americans      that it is not a menace to their liberty. Conversely,      retention of a ban on cosmetically-incorrect firearms by law-     abiding citizens would be a strong statement to the American      people that their federal government does not trust them; and      if so, why should they trust it?                            BAN ON TRAINING       Morris Dees of the Southern Poverty Law Center has begun      promoting a federal ban on group firearms training which is      not authorized by state law. First of all, state governments      are perfectly capable of banning or authorizing whatever they      want. The proposal for a federal ban amounts to asking      Washington for legislation similar to that which various      allies of Mr. Dees promoted at the state level in the 1980s,      with little success. The vast majority of states having      rejected a training ban, the federal government should hardly      impose the will of the small minority on the rest of the      states.       A former direct-mail fundraiser for the antigun lobby, Mr.      Dees may be forgiven for a low level of concern for the      exercise of the right to keep and bear arms. But the right to      keep and bear arms necessarily includes the right to practice      with them, just as the Constitutional right to read a      newspaper editorial about political events necessarily      includes the right to learn how to read. Just as the      government may not forbid people from learning how to read in      groups, it may not forbid people from learning how to use      firearms in groups.       ``Organizing, arming, and training in conjunction with a      political agenda would be [[Page S7606]] seen as dangerous in      any other society but our own,'' a private security      consultant recently told Congress, demanding that ``these      groups be flatly dealt with as `enemies of our society.'''       Of course the United States was founded by ``religious nuts      with guns,'' and later achieved independence as a result of a      war instigated by people who organized, armed, and trained      with a political agenda. The spark of the revolutionary war,      the battle of Lexington and Concord, was prompted by the      ruling government's attempts to confiscate the ``assault      weapons'' of the day held by local militias. It was at the      Concord Bridge where militiamen were ordered to ``wait until      you see the whites of their eyes'' and then shot government      employees who were coming to arrest them for possessing an      illegal ``assault weapon'' (a cannon). The Texan revolution      against Mexico likewise began over civilian possession of      ``military'' arms, when the Mexican government demanded that      settlers hand over a cannon, and the Texans replied, ``Come      and take it!''       The militiamen of Concord Bridge and Texas may have broken      the law, but they were great men, worthy of admiration by      every schoolchild, and every other American. ``You need only      reflect that one of the best ways to get yourself a      reputation as a dangerous citizen these days is to go around      repeating the very phrases which our founding fathers used in      their struggle for independence,'' observed American      historian Charles A. Beard.                bureau of alcohol, tobacco and firearms       Some people have claimed that criticism of an alleged      pattern of criminal conduct at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco      and Firearms is tantamount to complicity in the Oklahoma City      bombing. If so, then the United States Senate is the party      ultimately at fault. In 1982, the Senate Subcommittee on the      Constitution investigated the BATF and unanimously concluded      that the agency had habitually engaged in:       ``. . . conduct which borders on the criminal. . . .      [E]nforcement tactics made possible by current firearms laws      are constitutionally, legally and practically reprehensible.      . . . [A]pproximately 75 percent of BATF gun prosecutions      were aimed at ordinary citizens who had neither criminal      intent nor knowledge, but were enticed by agents into      unknowing technical violations.''       If it is legitimate for a United States Senate subcommittee      to find that BATF operations consist of ``conduct which      borders on the criminal,'' it is hardly inappropriate for      other persons to point out similar conduct.       The Waco raid was the most spectacular, but hardly the only      instance of abuse of power by BATF in conducting search      warrants.       On December 16, 1991 (the first day of the third century of      the Bill of Rights), sixty BATF agents, accompanied by two      television crews, broke into the Oklahoma home of John      Lawmaster. Acting on a tip (suspected to be from Lawmaster's      ex-wife) that Lawmaster had illegally converted a semi-     automatic to full automatic, BATF worked with the ex-wife to      lure Lawmaster away from his home before the raid. With      Lawmaster absent, BATF knocked down his front door with a      battering ram. While some agents stood guard with weapons      drawn, other agents broke open his gun safe, scattered his      personal papers, spilled boxes of ammunition onto the floor,      and broke into a small, locked box that contained precious      coins. To look through some ceiling tiles, one agent stood on      a table, breaking the table in the process.       Neighbors who asked what BATF was doing were threatened      with arrest. Having found nothing illegal, BATF left weapons      and ammunition strewn about the home, and departed. They      closed the doors, but since BATF had broken the doors on the      way in, the doors could not be latched or locked. Upon      returning to the shambles that remained of his home,      Lawmaster found a note from BATF: ``Nothing found.'' Utility      company representatives arrived, and told Lawmaster that they      had been told to shut off all his utilities.       One of the field commanders of the Waco raid was Ted      Royster, head of BATF operations for Texas, Oklahoma, and New      Mexico. Royster also supervised the Lawmaster ``raid,''      watching the operation from a parked vehicle with tinted      windows.       On February 5, 1993--23 days before the Waco raid--BATF      ransacked the home of Janice Hart, a black woman in Portland,      Oregon, terrorizing her and her three children for hours,      destroying her furniture, slamming a door on a child's foot,      forcing two children to wait outside in a car while Ms. Hart      was interrogated inside, and refusing to allow her to call an      attorney, until BATF discovered that there was a case of      mistaken identity. (BATF had been looking for Janice Harold,      who bears no resemblance to Mrs. Hart.) In this case, unlike      most others, BATF did at least send a      check for damages, although no apology was offered.       As reported by the Washington Times:       ``In 1990, [Louis Katona] lent a military-style grenade      launcher to ATF for use in an unrelated prosecution, but it      was never returned.       ``In May 1992, ATF executed a search warrant at his home.      During the search, Mr. Katona said his car's tires were      flattened, his firearms were intentionally damaged and his      pregnant wife was manhandled so roughly that she had a      miscarriage.       ``In September, he was charged with 19 felonies * * * When      the case went to trial in April 1994, U.S. District Judge      George W. White directed a verdict of not guilty--asking on      the record, `Where's the beef?'''       In a case which is widely known among the gun community,      but which has been ignored by the national press, except for      the Washington Times, the home of gun show promoters Harry      and Theresa Lamplugh was raided by BATF in 1994. At least      fifteen BATF agents, armed with machine guns, burst into      Lamplugh's home one morning. Mr. Lamplugh asked the men, most      of whom were not wearing uniforms, if they had a warrant.      ``Shut the fxxxx up mother fxxxer; do you want more trouble      than you already have?'' they responded, sticking a machine      gun in his face.       Over the next six and half hours, BATF agents demolished      the home, refused to let the Lamplughs get dressed, held a      pizza party, killed three house cats (including a Manx kitten      which was stomped to death), scattered Mr. Lamplugh's cancer      pills all over the floor, and carted off over eighteen      thousand dollars worth of the Lamplugh's property, plus their      medical records. Nearly a year later, the government has      neither filed any criminal charges, nor returned any      property, even the medical records.       The first of BATF's notorious raids came on June 7, 1971,      when agents broke into the home of Kenyon Ballew. A burglar      had told the police that Ballew owned grenades. Ballew did      own empty grenade hulls, which are entirely legal and      unregulated. Wearing ski masks and displaying no      identification, BATF agents broke down Ballew's door with a      battering ram. Responding to his wife's screams, Ballew took      out an antique blackpowder pistol, and was promptly shot by      BATF. Nothing illegal was found. He remains confined to a      wheelchair as a result of the shooting, and now subsists on      welfare.       If the sear (the catch that holds the hammer at cock) on a      semiautomatic rifle wears out, the rifle may malfunction and      repeat fire. The BATF arrested and prosecuted a smalltown      Tennessee police chief for possession of an automatic weapon      (actually a semiautomatic with a worn-out sear), even though      the BATF conceded that the police chief had not deliberately      altered the weapon. In March and April of 1988, BATF pressed      similar charges for a worn-out sear against a Pennsylvania      state police sergeant. After a 12-day trial, the federal      district judge directed a verdict of not guilty and called      the prosecution ``a severe miscarriage of justice.''       Today, observes Robert E. Sanders, a former head of BATF's      criminal division, the bureau's leaders, to the great dismay      of many high-quality field agents, have ``shifted from the      criminal to the gun,'' and are now waging ``an all-out war      against the gun.'' Sanders noted that ``Instead of focusing      on selected criminals, there is an indiscriminate focus on      anyone who owns guns. They are in total consonance with the      Clinton administration's anti-gun position and with the gun      control groups.''       BATF's management has consistently proven itself unwilling      to obey statutory law. The Firearm Owners' Protection Act      specifically forbids BATF to gather registration information      about guns to gun owners, except in connection with a      criminal investigation. Nevertheless, BATF is implementing      ``Project Forward Trace'' to register the owners of certain      legal semiautomatic firearms.       The Treasury Department defends the Waco attack on the      basis that ``the raid fit within an historic, well-     established and well-defended government interest in      prohibiting and breaking up all organized groups that sought      to arm or defend themselves.'' The candid admission of BATF's      objective, however, conflicts with the fact that nothing in      existing law makes it illegal for persons, alone or in      groups, to collect large number of weapons and to defend      themselves. To the contrary, the ownership of large numbers      of weapons is specifically protected by federal statute, by      federal case law, and of course by the Second Amendment.       One approach to improving BATF's conduct would be      incremental reforms of the statutes governing BATF. Such an      approach was attempted by the Firearm Owners' Protection Act,      signed into law in 1986. The 1986 reforms, pushed by the      National Rifle Association and other pro-gun organizations,      reduced BATF search authority, especially for paperwork      technicalities, and increased penalties for armed career      criminals. Yet even today, the armed career criminal statutes      are often enforced in a manner targeting small-scale, unarmed      offenders.       The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (a descendant      of the Bureau of Prohibition) enforces the federal alcohol      laws in a manner also characterized by administrative abuse,      over-reaching beyond statutory power, and selective      enforcement against persons or companies who dare to      criticize BATF.       Nor are people outside of BATF the only victims. Planning      for the BATF raid on the Mount Carmel Center in Waco began      shortly after the Bureau found out that      Sixty Minutes was working on a story about sexual harassment      at BATF. Months later, Sixty Minutes host Mike Wallace      opined ``Almost all the agents we talked to said that they      believe the initial attack on that cult in Waco was a      publicity stunt--the main goal of which was to improve      AFT's tarnished image.'' (The codeword for the beginning      of the BATF raid was ``showtime.'') [[Page S7607]]        The Sixty Minutes report was devastating. BATF agent      Michelle Roberts told the television program that after she      and some male agents finished a surveillance in a parking      lot, ``I was held against the hood of my car and had my      clothes ripped at by two other agents.'' Agent Roberts      claimed she was in fear of her life. The agent who verified      Ms. Roberts' complaints claims that he was pressured to      resign from BATF. Another agent, Sandra Hernandez, said her      complaints about sexual harassment were at first ignored by      BATF, and she was then demoted to file clerk and transferred      to a lower-ranking office. BATF agent Bob Hoffman said      ``[T]he people I put in jail have more honor than the top      administration in this organization.'' Agent Lou Tomasello      said, ``I took an oath. And the thing I find totally      abhorrent and disgusting is these higher-level people took      that same oath and they violate the basic principles and      tenets of the Constitution and the laws and simple ethics and      morality.'' Black BATF agents have complained about      discrimination in assignments.       Abolishing BATF is no solution, for abolition would leave      in place the federal alcohol, tobacco and firearms laws, and      transfer their enforcement responsibility to some other      agency. It is the very nature of the victimless crimes--such      as laws criminalizing the peaceful possession or manufacture      of alcohol or firearms--which lead to enforcement abuses. As      long as the consensual offense laws remain in the U.S. Code,      abusive enforcement is likely, as has been the historical      norm since the enactment of such laws. Removing most firearm      (and alcohol and tobacco) laws from the federal statutes does      not imply that alcohol, tobacco, and firearms should be      subject to no legal controls. Rather, the control of those      objects can continue to be achieved at the state level,      without a redundant layer of federal control and the manifold      temptations of federal abuse.       Since 1985, BATF's size has increased 50%, from 2,900      employees to 4,300. In a time of vast budget deficits, simply      restoring BATF to its former size might save both taxpayer      dollars and taxpayer lives.       While BATF's performance at Waco was disgraceful, two facts      should be kept in mind: First, the BATF has a large number of      honorable, admirable employees who have quietly gone about      their work for years enforcing federal regulations applicable      to gun dealers, and enforcing federal laws against possession      of guns by persons with felony convictions for violent crime.      Misbehavior of some BATF staff (and some BATF leadership)      should not be taken as proof that all BATF employees are bad.
