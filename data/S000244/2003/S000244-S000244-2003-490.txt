Chairman, reserving the right to object, there is a snowstorm bearing down on this city. There are numerous Members who have asked me to speed this debate up so that they can get out of town and not be marooned here. I would ask the gentleman from Florida to have compassion on those Members and withdraw his unanimous consent request. If he persists, I am constrained to object.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. Objection is heard.
