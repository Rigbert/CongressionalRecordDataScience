President, I have already stated what this amendment does. It does try to get some sense into some of these organizations advocating noncompetitiveness or anticompetitiveness for the United States. One such organization is called the OECD, Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. This organization I have already talked about, but one of the things they advocate is high taxes for the United States. In order to make sure we can still use this organization for a function that seems to be desirable by the tax committee, I will read the modification.
