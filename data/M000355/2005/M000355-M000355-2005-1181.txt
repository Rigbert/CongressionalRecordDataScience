S. circuit judge for the Eleventh Circuit. Earlier today, cloture was invoked on the Pryor nomination by a vote of 67 to 32. Under a previous order, the time until 4 p.m. will be equally divided for debate on that nomination. At 4 p.m., the Senate will proceed to a vote on confirmation. The vote on the Pryor nomination will be the first vote of the day.  Following the Pryor confirmation vote, the Senate will consider the Griffin and McKeague nominations to the Sixth Circuit. We will debate those nominations concurrently and vote on confirmation tomorrow evening. I would say to our colleagues, we are not finished when we finish the vote on Judge Pryor tomorrow afternoon. We have two more very important nominations to the Sixth Circuit, a circuit that has been 25-percent vacant for many years. So we will not be able to conclude until we finish all of those nominations tomorrow.                          ____________________[Page S6241]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                                PROGRAM  Mr. McCONNELL.
