On Friday, June 4, 2010, the Plumbers Local Union 210 will honor the graduating class of 2010 at the Annual Apprentice Graduation Banquet, which will be held at Tiebel's Restaurant in Schererville, Indiana.  At this year's banquet, the Plumbers Local Union 210 will recognize and honor the 2010 Apprentice Graduates. The individuals who have completed their apprentice training in 2010 are: Jonathan Banaszak, Matthew Czarnecki, Bernard Jewett, Kevin Kuzma, Bryan Lain, William Linebaugh, Roy Swearengin, Jeremy VanHoose, and Dustin Weber.  Northwest Indiana has a rich history of excellence in its craftsmanship and loyalty by its tradesmen. These graduates are outstanding examples of each. They have mastered their trade and have demonstrated their loyalty to both the union and the community through their hard work and selfless dedication.  Madam Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating these dedicated and hardworking individuals. Along with the other men and women of Northwest Indiana's unions, these individuals have committed themselves to making a significant contribution to the growth and development of the economy of the First Congressional District, and I am very proud to represent them in Washington, DC.                          ____________________
