 And as I paid my respects at the wake the day before the service, I was reminded I had been in that church twice before to pay tribute to Stephanie's father who died during her tenure here, and then her husband who also died. And it was almost hard to walk into that church for the third time, and my respect for her grew even more for the strength that she showed to all of us despite these enormous personal losses that she had borne.  Mr. Speaker, in concluding, let me just say that from 1 Peter 4:10-11, this is what the prayer card said at her funeral service:       Each one should use whatever gift he has received to serve      others, faithfully administering God's grace in its various      forms. If anyone speaks, he should do it as one speaking the      very words of God. If anyone serves, he should do it with the      strength God provides, so that in all things God may be      praised through Jesus Christ. To him be the glory and the      power forever and ever. Amen.  And at the base of the card is Stephanie's signature with the words, ``I hope I made you proud.''  Mr. Speaker, may I ask now for the membership to rise and pay tribute to the life of Congresswoman Stephanie Tubbs Jones.
