Speaker, on July 23, 2002, I was granted a Leave of Absence due to a family emergency. I was not present for rollcall votes Nos. 330, 331, 332, 333, and 334.  If I had been present, I would have voted ``no'' on rollcall No. 330 an amendment by Representative Goss to limit the use of funds to enforce the ban on travel to Cuba; ``yes'' on No. 331 an amendment by Representative Flake to prohibit the use of funds to enforce the ban on travel to Cuba by U.S. citizens; ``yes'' on No. 332 by Representative Flake to prohibit the use of funds to enforce restrictions on remittances to nationals of Cuba; ``yes'' on No. 333 by Representative Rangel an amendment to prohibit the use of funds to implement, administer or enforce the economic embargo against Cuba; and ``yes'' on No. 334 passage of H.R. 3609, the Pipeline Safety Act.                          ____________________
