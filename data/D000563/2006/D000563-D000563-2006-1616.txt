The fact remains that this list is secret to the public. If this is a public forum, if we are considering legislation that will impact the public, why, then, is the most fundamentalquestion about who will pay into this trust fund being kept confidential and secret?  It strikes me as straining credulity that this process is so open and transparent that we cannot tell the businesses of America how much they have to pay in or the victims of America how much they can expect to receive into this trust fund for their own payments. That is a fact. And because staff members or Senators can go to the hearing room and look through the report--not make a note, not make a copy--does not create a lot of confidence.  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.
