Speaker, today I rise to pay tribute to Julia Pappas of my district, who passed from this life after 94 years on February 28, 2001. As another political season draws near and with recent events bringing out the patriotism of Americans, Julia's life and example of citizenship should be reflected upon and recognized.  Born on Christmas Day 1907 in Andrianoupolis Thrace Asia Minor, Julia was an immigrant to the United States. Even as she reveled in her Greek heritage, she became fully immersed in her adopted homeland's society. She was avidly involved in grassroots politics, and could always be counted on for support. She understood better than many that the right of American citizenship came with civic responsibility, and was a strong advocate for citizen participation in our political process.  Julia was a dedicated member of the Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Cathedral, where her presence was familiar and her involvement in church activity second-to-none. She truly lived her faith showing through word and deed its importance to her. She was a member of the Cathedral's Daughters of Penelope, AHEPA Auxiliary, and the Philoptochos Society. She was also a Red Cross and Lucas County Democratic Party volunteer.  A lifelong traveler, Julia saw the world and reported on her travels to others, enabling them to understand the different cultures of our world. She was able to realize ``a lifelong dream'' of visiting Jerusalem, a trip she felt deeply.  Twice widowed, Julia was an absolutely devoted wife, mother, grandmother and greatgrandmother. She thoroughly enjoyed watching her grandchildren grow and participated in their lives. I know her daughter Helen and daughter-in-law Patricia, along with her grandchildren, great-grandchildren and extended family have many cherished memories of her. A true lover of life with a strength of spirit unmatched, Julia Pappas came to embody the actress Helen Hayes' retort that ``Old age is not something to which I have arrived kicking and screaming, it is something I have achieved.'' Few have achieved it with more grace and aplomb than Julia Pappas, beloved wife, mother, grandmother ``Yia Yia'' and friend.                          ____________________
