President, it has been more than a year since the Columbine tragedy, but still this Republican Congress refuses to act on sensible gun legislation.  Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. Until we act, Democrats in the Senate will read some of the names of those who lost their lives to gun violence in the past year, and we will continue to do so every day that the Senate is in session.  In the name of those who died, we will continue this fight. Following are the names of some of the people who were killed by gunfire one year ago today.  September 5, 1999:  Andre P. Bacon, 21, Chicago, IL;  Agron Berisha, 18, Miami, FL;  Mark Douglas, 34, Fort Wayne, IN;  Princeton L. Douglas, 18, Chicago, IL;  Willie Lassiter, 20, Atlanta, GA;  Denkyira McElroy, 24, Chicago, IL;  Jerry Ojeda, 23, Houston, TX;  Rodney Prince, 18, Baltimore, MD;  Jarhonda Snow, 4, Miami, FL;  Unidentified Female, San Francisco, CA.  One of the gun violence victims I mentioned, 23-year-old Jerry Ojeda from Houston, was drinking with friends when they began taking turns shooting a 9-millimeter pistol into the air. After firing several shots, Jerry took the gun and turned it on himself.  We cannot sit back and allow such senseless gun violence to continue. The deaths of these people are a reminder to all of us that we need to enact sensible gun legislation now.                          ____________________
