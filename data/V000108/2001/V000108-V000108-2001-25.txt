 Mr. Speaker, I would point out that the United States of America is the only industrialized nation on the planet Earth who cannot produce enough steel to meet its own needs. The word ``war'' has been mentioned frequently this morning on this floor and I would point out it is those specialty steels made by the domestic steel industry that are necessary for those nuclear attack submarines and those armored vehicles. Unfortunately, we have an industry in stress. Edgewater Steel in Pennsylvania has ceased operations. Great Lakes Metals in Indiana has ceased operations. Trico Steel in Alabama has ceased operations. CSC Ltd. Steel Company in Ohio has ceased operations. Northwestern Steel & Wire in Illinois has ceased operations. Laclede Steel in Missouri has ceased operations. Al Tech Specialty Steel in New York has ceased operations.  The gentleman from New York (Mr. Quinn) and I went to the Committee on Rules yesterday to ask for $2.4 billion over 3 years to allow this vital industry to consolidate and save itself. We were turned down, but IBM gets $2.3 billion. Vote ``no'' on the rule.
