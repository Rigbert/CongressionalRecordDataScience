Should we let this authority lapse, it will jeopardize national security programs. Therefore, we must act in this bill with the provisions that cover the private DOE contracts. However, we must try to get the entire act renewed as recommended by the administration and the agencies that have help to develop, modify and oversee its activities over the past nearly half century that have served us so well. I strongly believe that it vital to pass full and comprehensive reauthorization of the Price-Anderson Act. The law has worked well and has been considered a model in other countries. It insures against terrorism against the plants and has been studied in an attempt to help fashion the terrorism insurance recently passed in this body. I would urge that we do what we can in this body to get Price-Anderson renewed in the most expeditious fashion. I want to thank my colleagues on both the Armed Services Committee and the Environment and Public Works Committee, of which I am the ranking member of the Nuclear Subcommittee, and I look forward to working with them so that we may pass comprehensive Price-Anderson reauthorization during the 107th Congress.
