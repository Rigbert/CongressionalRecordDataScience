Speaker, during this reflective season of Ramadan, Passover, and Lent, I have been reflecting on friends whose lives closely paralleled the stories of sacrifice in the Holy Books. It is this reflection that calls to my mind Mrs. Gale Cincotta of Chicago, who passed from this life to the next on August 15, 2001. I am grateful for the opportunity to encapsulate her life's work for the Record.  Born of humble origin and reared in Chicago's Austin neighborhood, Gale became a neighborhood activist and then national leader as her personal knowledge of injustice led her on a passionate journey. Her dissatisfaction with her sons' educational opportunities spurred her to address the issue. She became impassioned with the root causes of an inadequate educational system: poverty, lack of decent and affordable housing and the resulting decaying neighborhoods. As her understanding grew about these issues, Gale found her true vocation. Armed initially only with a small but vocal band of neighborhood residents, Gale began a crusade which would eventually lead her to national prominence. She was, the Chicago Tribune noted upon her death, ``one of the most effective community activists in the nation.'' I would add that she had extraordinary vision, a sharp intellect, a love of those without voice or power, and a boundless sense of humor.  Feisty, blustery, and with a keen ability to cajole or badger those with influence and power into doing what needed to be done, Gale earned the respect of all with whom she worked whether or not they agreed with her. Her passion was unmistakable, her commitment unwavering, and her expertise unparalleled. She taught many people, including myself, what being a neighborhood activist is really all about: it is about changing people's lives for the better. It is about helping them gain power to improve the condition of people's lives.  Though responsible for many changes in neighborhood development and revitalization, lending practices and housing concerns across our nation, Gale's greatest public accomplishment was gaining Congressional approval of the Community Reinvestment Act in 1977. Passage of this Act, now a cornerstone of neighborhood financing that has released billions of dollars of private credit to formerly red-lined neighborhoods, was considered by the Chicago Tribune Gale's ``single greatest triumph.'' Ever the champion of marginal neighborhoods, she persuaded not only elected officials but also bankers, insurance companies, landlords, and business leaders that neighborhood investment--while being the right think to do--could also be profitable. She taught them that the savings of people of ordinary means should not be drained from their neighborhoods, but made available for reinvestment. Her work made the capitalist system work in some of the most neglected corners of our nation. Her tireless and unmatched efforts yielded visible results by turning faded city blocks into flourishing neighborhoods from coast to coast. Gale organized other programs and works, and many awards and accolades were bestowed upon her through the years, but surely none meant as much to her as the lasting legacy of the Community Reinvestment Act and the people and communities it still helps.  Gale Cincotta lives on in the seeds she planted in the hearts of the people she served and the minds of those she battled with and against to make people's lives better. Shenever yielded. She once said to me that the media had convinced Americans they were all ``middle class'' and that had bred a dangerous political complacency among the working class of people and the poor, who struggled daily to gain an economic foothold in our country. Their interests will not be served by false images of how hard and political this struggle is really.  The new director of the organization she founded, the National Training and Information Center, recalled that Gale--a mother of six sons and a widow--loved to dance. His message to the people upon taking the reigns as director began with a quote from an old Shaker hymn. The words seem to sum up Gale's legacy quite well: ``They buried my body and they thought I'd gone, but I am the dance and I still go on.'' Surely, she lives among us.                          ____________________
