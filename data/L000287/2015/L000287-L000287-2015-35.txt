Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague from Colorado for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this rule and against H.R. 5. Everyone who knows me knows that I believe that if you spend 5 minutes--only 5 minutes--with a young person, you can change a life and shift the course of history. Many years ago, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and Rosa Parks saw a little light, a little hope in me, ``the boy from Troy,'' a young student from rural Alabama. They gave me hope and opened doors.  Their actions taught me how important it is to tear down barriers and invest in the potential of each and every American child.  Mr. Speaker, we have the responsibility to learn from our experiences and provide a quality foundation for the next generation. But this bill turns back the clock on progress. H.R. 5 puts the hardest-hit--those most in need--on the chopping block. We don't want to go back. We want to go forward. It cuts funding, pushes down standards, and rolls back the protections for our future--our youth--our precious children.  I urge each and every one of my colleagues to vote ``no.'' Let us come together and do what is right and what is just to help students realize the American Dream. That is the thing to do, and we must do it.                              {time}  1430
