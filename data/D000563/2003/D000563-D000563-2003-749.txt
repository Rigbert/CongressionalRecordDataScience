President, it is the nature of our debate on the budget resolution that there is a very limited amount of time available to discuss amendments which we will be offering. I am taking this opportunity this morning to describe to my colleagues and those following the debate an amendment which I plan to offer this morning to the budget resolution.  All of us are transfixed by images that come over the television, as we listen to the radio, and as we read the newspaper about the war in Iraq. We are reminded on a minute-by-minute basis of the heroism, bravery, and determination of our Armed Forces.  Last week, there was a resolution commending the Armed Forces for their efforts, as well as standing, by the President as Commander in Chief as he leads these forces into battle. That resolution was enacted by a vote of 99 to 0, with all Senators present voting in favor of it--all Democrats, Republicans, and Independents. It is an indication of the solidarity in this Chamber behind the men and women in uniform.  The amendment which I will offer during the course of the budget resolution debate today will be further evidence of our solidarity behind the men and women in uniform. My colleagues may be surprised to learn that those who are serving in the military in Iraq are eligible for what is known as imminent danger pay, combat pay. It is one of those rare moments in military life when we know these men and women put their lives on the line and we give them a bonus, an imminent danger pay bonus, above their ordinary compensation. One might ask themselves, well, how much is combat pay for those who are serving? Combat pay today is $150 a month, $5 a day. Combat pay to our soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and Coast Guard is less than the minimum wage for one hour in America for each day they are in battle in harm's way. That was last changed in 1991, when it was raised to $150.  The amendment I will propose, the imminent danger pay increase amendment, will raise the monthly amount to $500 a month. Make no mistake,there is no compensation in dollar amounts we can give these men and women for their heroism and sacrifice, but I think it is important that we step forward with this increase so that combat pay is $500 a month.  There is a second part to the amendment. We also say when we activate someone into a war theater that we help their family at home. That is known as family separation allowance. How much do we give the family of these service men and women back home during the period of time their loved ones are in combat? The family separation allowance is $100 a month. I met with some of those families at the Rock Island Arsenal in my State last Saturday. They are facing extraordinary challenges for child care, for the expenses of their families they had not anticipated. We should do better for them. I am suggesting as part of my amendment that $500 should be the monthly compensation for the family separation allowance. That is the nature of my amendment.  I ask all my colleagues in the Senate who stood shoulder to shoulder, 99 to nothing behind the men and women in uniform, to do the same now when we raise combat pay to $500 a month and the family separation allowance to $500 a month as well. That will be a clear demonstration that our commitment to these troops goes beyond words and goes to the budget, so we can provide them and their families the resources they need to not only come home safely but without the hardships that would be part of this service if we did not do our part to help them.  I hope my colleagues on a bipartisan basis will join as we did on the resolution.  I might add, there are some procedural hurdles being thrown in my path. People are saying the procedures may not allow you to offer this amendment. I beg my colleagues on both sides, as our men and women in uniform cannot hide in the deserts of Iraq, we should not hide on the floor of the Senate behind procedural niceties when it comes to fair compensation for our men and women in uniform and their families waiting dutifully at home.  I urge my colleagues to reconsider their opposition to this amendment. This is the right thing to do, and we should do it today.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
