 President, on October 3 of this year, I had the honor of speaking at the portrait unveiling of U.S. District Court Judge John G. Heyburn. I ask unanimous consent that my comments at that ceremony be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:       I first met John Heyburn in 1971. Somehow, we had both      found ourselves here in Louisville working for a fledgling      gubernatorial candidate named Tom Emberton. It was the first      of many attempts by John to derail what was otherwise      destined to be a dazzling legal and judicial career with a      foray into politics. And I like to think the increasingly      frequent television ads many of you have seen for a certain      U.S. Senate race have finally confirmed him in the view that      between the two of us, he chose the nobler path.       So you're very welcome for that, John. I assure you, it's      been an expensive lesson in career advice.       Now, I don't remember a whole lot about that governor's      race, but I do remember what I was thinking when John and I      met--that we were cut from different cloth. He came from a      very prominent family here in Louisville. His dad had run for      Congress back when I was in college, which I remembered. He      attended boarding school up in New England . . . he went to      Harvard . . . he golfed. You get the drift . . .       So what happened next was unexpected, but in retrospect      entirely predictable: I liked him. I liked him a lot. And the      accuracy of that first impression has been validated again      and again in the decades since.       John Heyburn is just impossible not to like.       That's the first thing to say about the man we've come here      to honor. And I think it needs to be said, because it's      certainly not the main reason so many of us made sure to be      here today. But it's a big reason so many of us really wanted      to be here, and why this is such a happy occasion. John      doesn't just inspire confidence and respect. He doesn't just      impress with his intellect and erudition. He makes you feel      lucky to know him.       And I think I got a good sense for why that is on that      first campaign for Tom Emberton. I mean, here was a brilliant      young guy from a distinguished family, fresh out of Harvard,      about a head taller than everybody else. The rest of us on      the campaign were all basically operating without a license.      And yet he just loved it. He brought the same enthusiasm to      that race that he brings to everything else, the sense that      whatever it is you're doing, he's interested. And as long as      you put your whole self into it, it's worth it.       John's basic approach to life had already been set all      those years ago, and I can't think of a better way to      describe it than to borrow a phrase from Oliver Wendell      Holmes, who once gave the following piece of advice to a      group of Boston lawyers: ``Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do,      do it with thy might.''       The language may be a little antiquated, but I think the      sentiment captures John perfectly. Because whether it's      running a marathon in college, keeping time at one of Will's      swim meets, tracking Jack's free-throw percentages in high      school, drafting a judicial decision, resolving a dispute      among lawyers . . . or facing up to the physical adversities      of recent years, John has done it ``with all his might''.       And that's the second thing to say about John Heyburn.       Now, for those of you who may be wondering, Tom Emberton      ended up losing his race for governor. But as I indicated,      one losing campaign wasn't quite enough to drive John out of      politics. A few years later, he helped me win my own first      political campaign, as County Judge Executive here in      Jefferson County. And once elected, he gave me some very good      counsel as a lawyer on my staff.       In repayment for his services I invited John to join my      ticket for a run of his own . . . and then proceeded to run      what was hands-down the worst campaign of my life. The      defining artifact of the race was a billboard we put up along      I-65. It was basically just three disembodied heads on a big      neon board. I looked like Howdy Doody. John looked like      Hitler. We took it down after a day and a half. And John's      hopes for a career in politics were dashed once again . . .       It would take one more run for a political office to      extinguish John's political ambitions, and to show him where      his greatest talents lay. One of his recent judicial      decisions led him to make an unexpected cameo in this year's      Senate primary. But aside from that, he's been pretty quiet.      For the past 22 years, John Heyburn has put all his might      into this courtroom. And his impact has been enormous.       The truth is, John's such a friendly presence, it's easy to      forget what a penetrating intellect he has or what an      influential jurist he's been. But his skills and his focus as      a judge are by now legendary.       As Chair of the Judicial Panel on Multi-District      Litigation, he's interacted with some of the best lawyers in      the country. It's one of the main reasons he enjoys the job.      It's a welcome duty for him, yes, and a testament to his very      laudable commitment to public service. But mostly, I think,      it's just a great opportunity for John to put his mind to      work and to engage other legal minds on a very high level.       In more than two decades as a judge for the Western      District, John has also untangled countless legal knots and      delivered far-reaching opinions on some mind-numbingly      complex and important cases. And that's to say nothing of the      countless settlement conferences, which require a subtle      genius of their own.       Others can speak more intelligently about the ins and outs      of specific cases and the day-to-day demands of a judge. John      has clearly excelled at both. But I think one of the far      less-appreciated contributions he's made in his many years      here has been his strong, positive influence on the culture      of the place.       So let me just say that as someone who's played an active      role in nominations to the court over the years, it's very      gratifying to hear about the deep camaraderie and mutual      respect that the district court judges in the commonwealth,      and particularly in this district, enjoy. And of their      reputation for excellence.       I think there's no question that no one is more responsible      for that than John. And I'm grateful.       One veteran of the Kentucky bar summed it up like this:      ``It is a privilege,'' he said, ``to practice law in Kentucky      federal courts. The judges are fair, they're even-handed.      They follow the statutes . . . they follow precedent . . .      but they're [also] independent and they're really fine human      beings.''       I've heard of young lawyers dreading their first day in      court but leaving here encouraged and energized not just      because they made it through, but because Judge Heyburn was      so kind and generous to them.       Experienced court-watchers say he's tougher on the lawyers      he knows than on the ones he doesn't. And as for John's      clerks, well, some speak of their time here as nothing short      of a revelation. It's the dignified but humane way he      conducts his chambers. It's the methodical way he decides a      case. But it's also just the sheer joy he brings to his work      on the bench, or to talking politics over a sandwich at the      City Cafe, or even to teaching a high school civics class      with his clerks.       I'm told that on some of these field trips, by the way,      John actually has his clerks act out the characters in famous      court cases. It's not exactly something law school prepares      you for. But they seem to enjoy it. At least they pretend to.       The larger point is this: in a field that isn't exactly      known for excitement, John has always found a way to make the      law interesting. His enthusiasm is contagious. And that's      been one of his great gifts to the profession, and to      everyone whose lives intersect with the work of this court.       One of John's former clerks put it like this. He said that      after law school he was totally burned out, and not really      looking forward to the career ahead of him. Then he met Judge      Heyburn.       ``Judge Heyburn,'' he said, ``he just made me fall in love      with the law.''       That's why John attracts some of the best and the      brightest. It's why his clerks love him.       He brings the law to life. He looks beyond the facts at      hand and forces his clerks to ask ``Why.'' He takes an      interest in their lives long after they leave here. And he      also gives them something else. He gives them a model for how      to do their jobs well without forgetting that their first and      most important job is at home.       And that's the third thing I would like to say about John      Heyburn. He's a scholar. He's a giant on the bench. He's a      good friend to his friends. He's a lot of fun. But he is a      husband and a father first.       Ask his clerks what they remember about his chambers and      they're just as likely to remember all the photos of Martha      and Will and Jack as the wood paneling. Ask Martha about      their marriage and she'll tell you they have as much fun      together today as they did the day they met. Ask the boys      what they remember, and they'll tell you something about      their dad that a lot of other kids wish they could.       They'll say: ``My dad was never MIA.''       Now, for the past year or so, young Jack has had the great      misfortune of being one of the very first people that I see      in the morning when I'm up in Washington. I'm sure he doesn't      look forward to that. But to me it's a great comfort. Not      just because I like him too, but because whenever I see Jack      I see Martha and John.       It reminds me of home. It reminds me of good times past.      And it makes me hopeful about the future. Because these are      really good people. They're both impressive in their own      right.       And they really care about others.       So I'm delighted to be here to honor the judge on this      happy occasion.       John Heyburn finally found his calling. And to the surprise      of absolutely no one, he has lived it out with all his might.      He has earned the respect of his peers and the gratitude of      many clerks. He is greatly admired. And as the impressive      crowd that's gathered here attests, he is very deeply loved.       Congratulations, old friend.                          ____________________
