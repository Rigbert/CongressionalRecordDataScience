  Mr. DeFAZIO. Madam Speaker, while Memorial Day is the traditional beginning of the summer vacation and travel season for all Americans, it's going tobe a gloomy day across America. No, I'm not a weather forecaster. It's going to be a gloomy day because of record extortionate and manipulated prices at the pump. Guess what? Crude oil prices are down over a year ago, but somehow gas is up 50 cents a gallon at the pump. How is that? The refineries are making four times, four times their normal margin on refining. Why is that? They said, oh, well, gosh, we couldn't have known people were going to start buying gas around Memorial Day. We had to close down some of the refineries to maintain them and to clean them. Does Exxon translate into Enron? Remember when Enron was doing the same thing in California? High demand, shut down the generating plants. Exxon, high demand, shut down the refineries.  It's time to stop the price gouging by Big Oil. Break them up. They aren't competitive, they're colluding.                          ____________________
