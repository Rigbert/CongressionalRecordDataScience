Speaker, I appreciate his answer.  Reclaiming my time, on appropriations conference reports, prior to the Thanksgiving recess, can he tell us how many he anticipates might be ready, obviously realizing that the other body's actions are difficult to determine, but does he have any thoughts on what appropriations conference reports we might be considering prior to the November 18 date?
