Speaker, today the Bush administration set yet another record. Congratulations. They announced a new record trade deficit for April, which puts the United States on track for yet a new annual record in trade.  Now, what does that mean to average Americans? Well, first off, it means that we are outsourcing jobs overseas, outsourcing capital overseas, losing jobs and productivity here; and we are going in debt to China and Japan and other nations. China has $122 billion of U.S. Treasury bonds; Japan owns $440 billion. They are getting to a point where they will be able to influence our economy and our interest rates in the United States and our currency. This is worrisome.  The loss equals about $1.5 billion a day in U.S. wealth; $1 million a minute being hemorrhaged overseas.  Now, when one is confronted with a policy that is failing, one usually would begin to rethink that policy. But no, not the Bush administration. As we know, they are very stubborn; and they are never wrong. In the case of trade, they think that there are tremendous benefits to the United States by outsourcing, exporting jobs, putting people here out of work. In fact, the President's own economic adviser in the annual report of the President of the United States said as much. He said that this was a good thing that jobs were being outsourced. It was a new manifestation of the radical free trade policies that they believe in down there at the White House.  Now, the problem, of course, goes beyond just the outsourcing of jobs and loss of capital. It is ultimately undermining the national and economic security of the United States of America. As we lose our productive capacity in critical areas, we are going to have a hard time replacing those in a future time of crisis, whether it is with China or somebody else who will have captured much of that productive capacity, those critical skills that go with those capacities.  I sat next to a gentleman on the plane last week going back to Oregon who works in the titanium industry; and he is very concerned about the loss of U.S. capabilities in critical metals, and very concerned that China is now leaping ahead in many areas, and if we should ever get into a conflict or an adversarial situation with China in the future, we would be at a disadvantage.  But this administration thinks, in fact, that this is all really great, because a few people are getting really rich. The CEOs are doing great. So what if salaries are down, wages are down, jobs are lost here in the United States of America. The CEOs or the contributor class. The Bush Pioneers and Rangers, those who can gather up $250,000 or $1 million for the President's reelection, are telling him, this is great, their bonuses are up, they are doing well, their friends at the country club are doing well; and we can just maybe change the subject when it comes to average Americans. Maybe we can distract them with something else so they will not realize how screwed they are. I hope not. I hope that Americans next fall express their opinion of these radical free trade policies, the huge trade deficits, the outsourcing of jobs, the CEO class who earn 600 and 700 times what their workers earn.  Mr. Speaker, this is a scandal, what we are doing; and it is undermining our country. And the President, if reelected, says one of the first things he is going to do is expand NAFTA, the job-losing NAFTA agreements, to all of Latin and South America. Just think of the opportunity. They pretend it means we will export things there, but they know it does not. It means the same thing as all of the other trade agreements. It means U.S. companies can locate there to exploit cheaper labor and lay off people here at home. But ultimately, who is going to be able to consume things here in the United States of America when the middle class is not working anymore? Ultimately, they are going to undo the entire system of the United States of America, but they do not really seem to care much about that.  They announced a big victory just yesterday, that is, that Mexican trucks, unsafe Mexican trucks that weigh two times as much as U.S. trucks, that are bigger, that are driven by people who do not take drug tests, do not have U.S. commercial drivers licenses, do not have the same rest time requirements, do not have in many cases front brakes, will be rumbling down the U.S. highways soon. They announced a great victory when the Supreme Court threw out a case that would restrict Mexican trucks from coming into the United States. Again, something else very shortsighted and very much against the interests of average Americans and working Americans.                          ____________________
