President, for decades people around the world have witnessed seemingly intractable conflict in the Middle East, and those who live there have suffered through generations of violence. While the peace sought for that region has been elusive, organizations such as the Arava Institute for Environmental Studies in Southern Israel have continued the struggle to promote conflict resolution and unity to counter forces of hate and violence. Vermont Rabbi Michael Cohen is one of the founding faculty members of the Arava Institute.  In October, Rabbi Cohen wrote of the Women Wage Peace movement in Israel after thousands of people from different political and religious backgrounds joined together to march in support of peace in that troubled region.  The Women Wage Peace movement, founded by a small group of Israeli women, has grown over the years in both force and numbers. Its mission: to demand a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. The rallies took place throughout the country, with a final march, the March of Hope, taking place in Jerusalem.  Rabbi Cohen, together with many other students, staff, and faculty of theArava Institute and community members from Kibbutz Ketura where he currently teaches, attended one of the rallies at the official Israeli-Jordanian border crossing along the Eilat promenade, and, the following day, at Qasr al-Yahud, the Jordan River baptismal site.  At the baptismal site one of the members of Kibbutz Ketura recognized a man sitting on the Jordanian side of the river who had visited the Arava Institute earlier in the summer. The man had come to support the March of Hope from the Jordanian side, while members of the Arava Institute showed their support from the Israeli side. The two men exchanged warm words from across the river epitomizing the goals of the movement.  The Middle East is facing one of its most unstable and dangerous periods in modern history. Entities like the Arava Institute, along with the Women Wage Peace movement, offer hope that peaceful coexistence is possible in the Middle East. Women, men, Israelis, Palestinians, Christians, Muslims, Jews, youth, and elders have joined together to remind us that we are all connected as members of one international community.  I ask unanimous consent that Rabbi Cohen's October 26, 2016, post, ``A rabbi in the desert: A reminder of what can be,'' from the Arava Institute blog be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                            [Oct. 26, 2016]            A Rabbi in the Desert: A Reminder of What Can Be       When I was five I attended my first political rally. It was      the March on Trenton which paralleled the famous March on      Washington and Martin Luther King's ``I have a Dream      Speech.'' The event in Trenton, New Jersey, as well as others      around the country, were held for people who could not make      it to the nation's capital to show nationwide support for the      message of the event.       Fast forward fifty-three years later, and the grassroots      Israeli-Palestinian ``Women Wage Peace'' movement decided on      the same format; rallies throughout the country followed by a      rally in Jerusalem. So during the week of the Sukkot holiday,      I found myself standing at the official Israeli-Jordanian      border crossing between Eilat and Aqaba with members of the      southern Arava valley communities including Kibbutz Ketura      and students, staff, and faculty of the Arava Institute. The      message of the rally was women demanding, with men invited to      participate, a model of political leadership that would      transform decades of failure when it comes to a settlement of      the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. ``Right, Center, Left      Demand a Peace Agreement'' was the slogan of the rally. After      a march along the Eilat promenade there were a number of      speeches including one by the mayor of Eilat.       The following day many of us got up before the sun so we      could travel first to Qasr al-Yahud, the Jordan River Baptist      site and then onto Jerusalem. At Qasr al-Yahud we joined      together with hundreds of Palestinians. People shared smiles,      food, and a sense of doing something important together. It      was a powerful sight as we marched, many hand in hand, from      the gathering point to the baptismal site.       There, participants mingled with Christian pilgrims who had      come to the site for baptism ceremonies. The Jordan River at      that point is some fifteen feet wide and on both sides steps      allow pilgrims easy access to its holy waters. A member of      Kibbutz Ketura pointed out a man with white beard sitting on      the Jordanian side of the river who had visited the Arava      Institute shortly after our arrival this summer! He owns a      farm near that spot and is working with Dr. Clive Lipchin,      the Director of our Center for Transboundary Water      Management, and Arava alumnus and researcher Suleiman      Halasah, to install the prototype of a new solar desalination      system in Jordan. He came to support the March from the      Jordanian side of the border. I called across the river and      border. He immediately recognized me and we had a      conversation much to the delight and surprise of those who      listened to us. This extraordinary encounter modelled what      the Arava Institute is capable of creating, and by extension      what the Women Wage Peace event was all about.       The rally was addressed by Liberian Nobel Peace Prize      laureate Leymah Roberta Gbowee, whose story of empowerment,      bravery, and strength resonated with the marchers. From Qasr      al-Yahud we continued on our way to Jerusalem, where our      numbers swelled to 20,000 as we marched past Israeli      government ministry buildings, the Knesset, the Prime      Minister's office, the President's House, and finally ended      up a block from the Prime Minister's residence. The marchers'      spirits were uplifted by the sight of so many people snaking      their way through the streets and neighborhoods of Jerusalem.      At the final rally, Yael Deckelbaum led us in her touching      song ``Prayer of the Mothers''.       The day was called the March of Hope. Hope is one of the      great motivating forces in our lives; it allows us to reach      forward to what we want. The day was a strong reminder of      what can be. The activities of the Arava Institute are daily      reminders that hope can also be lived as a reality.                          ____________________
