 President, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Dr. Kay Adkins, the president and CEO of Ashland Community and Technical College, ACTC, on her upcoming retirement after more than 5 years of leadership to this Kentucky institution. A western Kentucky native, Dr. Adkins knew this would be her last post before a well-deserved retirement that will begin at the end of June.  After earning her doctorate in educational administration from Illinois State University, Dr. Adkins held leadership positions at community colleges around the country. Just before coming back to the Commonwealth, she served as the president of Yuba College in Marysville, CA, where she found success in diversity, strategic planning, and the establishment of the Yuba College Foundation.  During her time at ACTC, Dr. Adkins helped the organization fulfill its mission to provide accessible, affordable, and quality education to its students. A member of the school's board of directors said, ``She's the total package.'' A former chairman of the board credits her leadership with making ACTC a leader of Kentucky's community colleges.  One of her many accomplishments in Ashland was the establishment of the Holy Family Community Collegiate High School, which helps students earn 2-year degrees while they pursue a high school diploma. Dr. Adkins also strengthened the relationship between ACTC and many of Kentucky's colleges and universities, so students could transfer their credits to a 4-year program. In the face of economic hardships in the region, she helped develop second-career retraining programs to help displaced or out-of-work Kentuckians.  Dr. Adkins' efforts have already shown impressive results. Under her guidance, ACTC awarded a record number of credentials to its graduates each of the last 3 years. She has also built close ties with the employer community in an effort to increase the number of scholarships available to students and help them begin meaningful careers after graduation. Her leadership has benefited students and the community.  Now, she plans to spend retirement in her native western Kentucky with her husband, playing golf and traveling. I would like to congratulate Dr. Adkins on her successful career and thank her for years of dedication to Kentucky's students, and I urge my colleagues to join me.                          ____________________
