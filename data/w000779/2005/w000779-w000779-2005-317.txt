President, the pace of technological innovation offers American consumers an eye-catching array of electronic gadgets. But for every new lap top or HDTV that goes home from the store with a consumer, an old computer or TV gets moved to the garage or shoved into the back of a closet. What to do with the growing amount of trash from the digital economy is a question that Senator Talent and I believe must be addressed before our landfills are full and foreign countries close their ports to ships loaded down with old US computers. Today we are introducing bipartisan legislation to jumpstart a nationwide electronic waste recycling initiative.  When I was a member of the Commerce Committee, I helped write theground rules for the digital economy. My goal was to help create a climate that would spur the development of technology so it would become accessible and affordable to all Americans. This approach seems to be working. One measure of the success of the digital economy is the sheer number of computers and electronic gadgets that Americans own. Americans now spend more than $130 billion a year on electronics, from computers to HDTVs.  The boom in consumer spending on electronics and the growth in the digital economy are not without a downside. In one year alone, some 60 million computers and 20 million television sets become obsolete and more than 500 million computers will be discarded in the decade ending in 2007. These obsolete computers alone will result in over 6.3 billion pounds of plastic and 1.6 billion pounds of lead in our landfills or incinerators.  Electronic waste, or e-waste, is not even a blip on the radar screen of most policymakers. There have been a few news articles here and there, but so far they've been buried, well behind page one. I want to tackle the problem of e-waste in the same way we went about solving the Y-2K problem: putting policies in place to help all stakeholders deal with it before it overtakes us.  Some communities across the country have begun to talk about how to deal with the accumulation of electronic waste. A few States, like California and Maine, recently passed laws to get recycling programs going. Several other States, including my own State of Oregon, will likely consider legislation this year. Among the options, some States favor an upfront fee, tacked onto the price of electronics, intended to help pay for the cost of recycling, others are looking at end-of-life fees. No one yet has looked at the approach Senator Talent and I are proposing.  My own sense is that slapping a fee on consumers for the purchase of a new computer or television is not necessarily the best way to encourage them to drag those old 80-pound computers and TVs out of the basement and get them to a recycling facility. Someone who needs a new one may just pay the fee but leave their old computers and TVs at home. End-of-life fees mean that today's manufacturers and retailers end up paying for e-trash left over from manufacturers that have gone out of business or from off-shore companies.  The bipartisan legislation Senator Talent and I are introducing today, The Electronic Waste Recycling Promotion and Consumer Protection Act, takes a novel approach to the problem.  First, to get consumers motivated to move their old computers or televisions out of the garage and to a recycling facility, the bill would give them a one-time tax credit based on showing they gave their old computers or televisions to a qualified recycler.  Second, to build up the recycling infrastructure nationwide, the legislation would give manufacturers, retailers and qualified recyclers tax credits over a 3-year period, based on showing that they had recycled a certain amount of e-waste each year and done it in a way that is safe and environmentally sound.  Third, the bill would give the Environmental Protection Agency a year to come up with options for a nationwide e-waste recycling program that would, if approved by Congress, preempt State plans. Manufacturers, retailers and recyclers are going to find it increasingly difficult to deal with a crazy quilt of 50 different State e-waste recycling laws.  These are the incentives, but incentives without teeth won't work. So at the end of 3 years of tax credits, if EPA determines that there are enough recyclers in place, no one who operates a municipal solid waste facility could knowingly accept any computer, computer monitor or television unless the e-waste is to be recycled.  The bill would also ask EPA to consider the benefits of requiring manufacturers who sell computers and TVs to take them back for recycling. And, to make sure we're keeping our own house in order, the legislation would require the federal government to properly recycle its computers.  The goal here is to provide incentives to build a nationwide e-waste recycling infrastructure. EPA estimates that electronic waste already constitutes 40 percent of the lead and 70 percent of the heavy metals found in landfills today. If this waste is not handled properly, there is a real risk that toxins from the lead, mercury and cadmium will leach into the air, soil and water. The health effects of these toxins are well known and include an increased risk of cancer as well as harm to kidneys, the brain and the nervous system.  As one who has worked so hard to foster the digital economy, I believe there is also a duty to assure that e-waste is handled responsibly. Consumers need to know that potentially harmful e-waste is being handled properly and I can't find a reason to add millions of tons of new toxic waste to our environment.  I also believe that the United States, as the leading innovator and consumer of electronic products in the world, has a duty to deal with e-waste responsibly. Sending shiploads full of e-junk that contains harmful lead, mercury and cadmium to poor countries overseas is not my idea of responsible.  Senator Talent and I have worked with a group of folks that normally don't see eye to eye on such issues. Through many hours of negotiation they have helped us produce a bill that represents a solid first step toward solving this problem. I am pleased that we have support for the approach taken in our legislation from environmental groups and industry groups, ranging from manufacturers like HP and Intel to retailers and solid waste recyclers, like Waste Management. We are committed to continuing to work with them to move the legislation through Congress.  In closing, electronic waste is not going away. It's time to put bipartisan policies in place that will jumpstart the creation of a nationwide e-waste recycling infrastructure so that consumers have access to recycling facilities and get in the habit of recycling these items. I've talked to manufacturers, retailers, recyclers, environmental and consumer groups and they tell me that this issue must be addressed now by a national rather than state-by-state approach. This bill is a common-sense, first step that will help us get a handle on the growing problem of electronic waste.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 510       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Electronic Waste Recycling      Promotion and Consumer Protection Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds that--       (1) the National Safety Council estimates that--       (A) in 2003, over 60,000,000 personal computers became      obsolete and between 1997 and 2007 more than 500,000,000      computers will need to be discarded; and       (B) at an average weight of 70 pounds, this will result in      over 6,300,000,000 pounds of plastic and 1,600,000,000 pounds      of lead added to the supply of waste needing to be managed;       (2) according to the Environmental Protection Agency--       (A) a computer monitor or television set generally contains      4 to 8 pounds of lead;       (B) mercury, cadmium, and other heavy metals are generally      used in such equipment as well; and       (C) households and businesses in the United States often do      not discard older computers and televisions when buying newer      versions of the same products;       (3) according to experts, the average household may have      between 2 and 3 older computers and televisions in storage,      and approximately 20,000,000 to 24,000,000 computers and      televisions are placed in storage each year;       (4) according to the Environmental Protection Agency,      discarded computer, television, and other electronic      equipment--       (A) when not discarded in large quantities, is currently      managed in most States as municipal solid waste, just like      ordinary trash; and       (B) constitute 40 percent of the lead and 70 percent of the      heavy metals that are found in landfills and, if not handled      properly, can be released into the environment, contaminating      air and groundwater and posing a significant threat to human      health, including potential damage to kidney, brain, and      nervous system function, and cancer in cases of excessive      exposure;       (5) materials used in computers, televisions, and similar      electronic products can be recovered through recycling, which      conserves resources and minimizes the potentially harmful      human and environmental health effects of those materials;      and       (6) establishing a nationwide infrastructure for electronic      waste recycling will--       (A) facilitate access of people in the United States to      recycling services; and       (B) improve the efficiency and use of electronic waste      recycling.

A bill to provide that the approved application under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for the drug commonly known as RU-486 is deemed to have been withdrawn, to provide for the review by the Comptroller General of the United States of the process by which the Food and Drug Administration approved such drug, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce ``Holly's Law,'' a bill that would suspend FDA's approval of RU-486 and direct the GAO to conduct an independent review of the process used by the FDA to approve the drug.  Holly's Law is named in memory of Holly Patterson, an 18-year old woman who died after taking the drug in 2003. RU-486 has killed three women in the United States and many more have been hospitalized with a severe bacterial infection known as septic shock.  RU-486 was approved by the FDA in September of 2000. The FDA approved RU-486 under a special ``restricted distribution'' approval process known as ``Subpart H,'' reserved only for drugs that treat ``severe or life-threatening illnesses,'' like cancer and AIDS.  Subpart H allows an expedited approval of certain drugs by not subjecting them to the testing and review standards required of all other new drugs. These are important tests necessary to determine the safety and long-term effects of a drug. Clearly, the fact that these tests were not done on RU-486 was a damaging omission considering the death and illness associated with use of the drug.  Due to the serious threat RU-486 poses to women's health, we are asking that Congress suspend FDA's approval of RU-486 until the GAO can provide a report on whether RU-486 should have been deemed ``safe and effective'' by the FDA.  I am grateful to Senators Allen, Brownback, Coburn, Ensign, Enzi, Inhofe, Santorum and Vitter who have joined me as original cosponsors of this bill. They understand that RU-486 is a dangerous drug that cannot remain on the market while more women die. I urge my colleagues to support Holly's Law to take RU-486 off the market before more women are harmed by it.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.
