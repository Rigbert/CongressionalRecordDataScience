Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.  Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from New York has just referenced the Daschle provision in Public Law 107-206 and said it was not, ``court-stripping.'' I just want to quote what the provision of law says:  ``Any action authorized by this section shall not be subject to judicial review by any court of the United States.''  That quote from the law speaks for itself.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Bachus).
