Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce a resolution along with Speaker Gingrich, Mrs. Chenoweth, chairman of the House Resources Subcommittee on Forests and Forest Health, Mr. Taylor of North Carolina, Mr. Herger, and Mr. Peterson of Pennsylvania, Mr. Pombo, Mr. McInnis, Mr. Sessions Mrs. Smith of Washington, Mr. Riggs, Mr. Cunningham, Mrs. Cubin Mr. Nethercutt, Mr. Doolittle Mr. Lewis of California, Mr. Skeen, Mr. Schaffer of Colorado, Mr. Hansen, and Mr. Radanovich expressing the sense of Congress that the United States should manage its public domain national forests to maximize the reduction of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.  Global warming has been an issue of great debate and discussion in Congress. Whether you believe human induced global climate change is occurring or not, this resolution deserves the support of everyone.  Science has proven to us that carbon dioxide, the leading greenhouse gas can be taken out of the atmosphere by allowing a young vibrant forest to absorb carbon through photosynthesis. It is stored as wood.  Carbon dioxide can also be kept out of the atmosphere by harvesting the forest before it begins to decompose or burn, thus storing the carbon in wood products that are environmentally friendly, as well as providing an economic benefit to society.  In December of this year, the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, which may commit to the United States to mandatory greenhouse gas reductions, is expected to be signed in Kyoto, Japan. The ramifications of this treaty could be enormous for people, the economy, and our way of life.  The key issue is whether the Clinton-Gore administration will commit the United States to mandatory reductions of carbon dioxide. Mandatory reductions mean it will cost you $8 more each time you fill your gas tank. Mandatory reductions mean your home heating bill will increase by 50 percent. Mandatory reductions will cost taxpayers millions of dollars and will cost many Americans their jobs.  There are alternatives to mandatory reductions of carbon emissions. One alternative is to manage our public forests better in order to extract from the atmosphere and store more carbon dioxide than we currently do. This means using the controls on greenhouse gasses that mother nature gives to us rather than control that Government mandates us to follow.  With this resolution, we send a message to the Clinton-Gore administration. Use mother nature's way of cleaning the atmosphere. Manage our forests to improve the environment. Don't simply impose still more Government controls on our lives.  We must send a message to the Clinton-Gore administration that the Federal Government itself should take the lead in taking steps to reduce the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. By managing our public domain national forests to minimize additions of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere we will improve our air quality, the health of our Nation's forests and set an example for other nations' as the world prepares for the negotiations in Kyoto, Japan.                          ____________________
