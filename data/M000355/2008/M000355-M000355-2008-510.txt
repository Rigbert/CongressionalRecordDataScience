 REID. Yes, I am happy to.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this is the kind of discussion, of course, that the Senate is witnessing that typically occurs between the majority leader and myself and managers of the amendments. To sum it up, this is the kind of legislative finger-pointing that turns the public off. But it is the way in which we go forward.  We had discussions yesterday about voting on the very issues the majority leader just indicated are the key issues relating to this bill. Hopefully, during the course of the day, we will be able to come together and have the votes on the key amendments and move forward.  The President, of course, is not going to sign a lengthy extension or a 30-day extension. Any hope that we will extend existing law without dealing with the retroactive liability issue is a waste of energy and time. That isn't going to happen. So we are going to focus on this bill and, hopefully, find a way to go forward and let the Senate work its will.  If the House chooses to leave tonight, I find that a highly irresponsible act--right before the expiration of this very important law. There isn't anything more important that we are doing right now, with the possible exception of trying to figure out a way of going forward to stimulate our economy and prevent an extensive slowdown, than getting the homeland protected.  A key ingredient in securing that protection, we know, is getting this FISA law right and getting it passed--not some kind of short-term extension. The terrorists are not going to take a vacation for a few weeks or for 6 months or next year; they are going to be around for a while. We need to get this right and do it now, and today is a good day to get started.  I yield the floor.
