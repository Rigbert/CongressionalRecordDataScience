Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 100 years of living by one of our community's most endearing constituents, Mr. Phil Zimmerman of Toledo, OH. Mr. Zimmerman, born on March 16, 1895, married his wife Eva, 70 years ago. Together they have reared 3 daughters, 7 grandchildren, and 13 great-grandchildren, all of whom join our community in congratulating this centurion of a man on his 100th birthday.  One of the founding fathers of Toledo's Old Newsboys Goodfellow Association, Mr. Zimmerman serves now as the organization's honorary president, the only person ever to hold the post. A life member, he remains actively involved in its good works--providing scholarships to talented students and winter outerclothes to needy children--by serving as a cochairman of the finance committee.  Phil Zimmerman has been active in our community in other ways as well. He is a 32d-degree Mason, a Shriner, member of B'nai B'rith, and past president of the Fraternal Order of Eagles. He was a business leader as well and owned the Diamond Jewelry Co., and served as vice president of the Toledo Blueprint Co.  The actress Helen Hayes has said, ``Old age is not something at which I have arrived reluctantly, it is something which I have achieved.'' His family, friends, and community honor and applaud Phil Zimmerman on his rare and remarkable achievement of a lifetime with 100 years and more.                          ____________________
