 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a respectable and courageous Kentucky veteran, Mr. John W. Dearmon of Somerset, KY. John served his country for 28 years, from 1943 to 1971, as one of our country's very first Navy SEALs.  John moved to Burnside, KY with his family when he was a boy in 1936. During World War II John was chosen to be part of a class of 141 that produced the first 27 Navy SEALs from underwater demolition teams. During the war, John was in command of a 45-foot intercoastal patrol boat that navigated the harbor and coast of Guam in the Western Pacific.  SEAL training for John consisted of 16 weeks of basic training, with 6 weeks of underwater swimming school. In addition, John recalls parachuting from 30,000 feet during jump school--his team was capable of jumping from up to 43,000 feet but he never had to jump from that altitude.  John is very proud of his service to his country and claims the Navy made him tough. Being a Navy SEAL instilled in John the courage to feel like he can accomplish anything, a trait he takes great pride in. John's formal education ended after he finished the 8th grade, however, he believes he received a real education about how to succeed in life from the Navy.  John W. Dearmon is a true American hero and patriot who is an inspiration to the great people of Kentucky. In fact, when asked if he ever thought about quitting during his arduous assignment, he responded, ``No! Absolutely not! I'm an old Kentucky farm boy. I'm gung-ho. I never thought about quitting.''  John devoted his life to protecting the liberty and freedom our great country was founded upon, and I commend him for his bravery and honor. The Pulaski County Commonwealth Journal recently published an article to honor John's life and accomplishments. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:     [From the Pulaski County Commonwealth Journal, Aug. 13, 2011]    Life of a SEAL: John Dearmon Was One of Original 27 Elite Forces                            (By Bill Mardis)       ``It felt great! I would love to have been with them . . .      I started and they finished it for me!''       A Pulaski County man can feel heartbeats of the U.S. Navy      SEALs as they moved in and killed terrorist mastermind Osama      Bin Laden in a firefight. John W. Dearmon knows their      thoughts, their toughness and resolve. He was one of the      original SEALs. In his mind, he will always be a SEAL.       Dearmon was in a class of 141 during early World War II      that produced the first 27 SEALs. ``In my class, we ended up      with 27 SEALs, originating from underwater demolition teams.      The class was too tough for 114. They didn't make it. They      dropped out.''       ``I didn't join, I was picked. They picked the best men . .      . I was one of them. I was proud to be a part,'' Dearmon      said.       Dearmon cringed in sorrow a few days ago when a helicopter      crashed in eastern Afghanistan and killed 22 Navy SEALs who      were being flown in to assist an Army Rangers unit pinned      down by enemy fire. The United States Navy's Sea, Air and      Land Teams, commonly known as Navy SEALs, are the U.S. Navy's      principal operation force and a part of the Naval Warfare      Command.       SEALs are tough hombres. Few there are who can qualify.       ``It just doesn't get any tougher. It's really tough. You      don't make it if you don't have endurance,'' said Dearmon.      ``Basic underwater demolition training . . . that's the hard      part, getting through that.'' ``Basic training lasts 16      weeks, and there are six weeks in underwater swimming      school.''       ``Did you ever think about quitting?''       ``No! Absolutely not! I'm an old Kentucky farm boy. I'm      gung ho. I never thought about quitting.''       ``Were you ever scared?''       ``Well, I really don't know how to answer that. I was      anxious a few times.''       Dearmon was in command of a 45-foot intercoastal patrol      boat, patrolling the harbor and intercoastal areas around      Guam in the western Pacific. The boat carried eight depth      charges, anti-submarine warfare weapons intended to destroy      or cripple a target submarine by the shock of exploding near      it.       ``We dropped depth charges,'' recalled Dearmon. ``I never      knowingly got results, but more than likely we did (get      results),'' he mused. Dearmon was quick to point out that he      never engaged in hand-to-hand combat as did the SEALs who      killed Bin Laden.       Dearmon parachuted from 30,000 feet. ``We could jump from      up to 43,000 feet, but I never jumped that high.'' Dearmon      pointed out that equipment available to his first unit of      SEALs is ``like a caveman'' to what they have today. ``The      electronic equipment, it's so advanced.''       ``You're still tough,'' a reporter suggested to the young-     looking 87-year-old.       ``I still think I'm tough . . . at least for a little      while,'' he grinned. Despite his age, Dearmon said he is in      relatively good health and ``. . . I can take care of      myself.''       His wife, the former Margaret Louise Bray, died July 21.      They were married 57 years. ``I was devastated (when she      died) but I'm getting so I can get along. I'm able to get      around.''       He goes out for coffee with a group of friends every      Thursday morning. It was a friend, Jim Cundiff, who called      the Commonwealth Journal and asked: ``Do you know that one of      the original Navy SEALs lives in Pulaski County?''       The suggestion led to a meeting with Dearmon and a story      appropriate for the times, when Navy SEALs are again in the      news.       Dearmon, a native of Tennessee, moved to Burnside with his      family in 1936. He left in 1940, working with the Civilian      Conservation Corps (CCC). He joined the Navy in June 1943 and      served 28 years, retiring in 1971.       ``Would he do it all over again?''       I loved every minute I was in the Navy. I'm proud of my      life. I didn't have much (formal) education. I finished the      8th grade . . . but in the Navy I got a real education. I      feel like I can do anything. I built this house (at 125 East      Summit Drive, Somerset) in 1972. I had never built anything      before, but I got a `How To' manual and went to work.''                          ____________________
