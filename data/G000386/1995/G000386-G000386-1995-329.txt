 President, I hope before the clock starts to tick that I can take 15 seconds to speak about Pastor Halverson, and to remind everybody that Pastor Halverson is just retiring as Chaplain for the U.S. Senate. He is not retiring from being a pastor for people. He is not retiring from being a servant for the Lord.  This morning, I asked him to pray for me, and as I have done for the last 14 years, I will continue to pray for his work daily because I know that work will continue.                          ____________________
