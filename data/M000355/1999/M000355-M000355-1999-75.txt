 But selective disarmament of the two great political parties, some would argue, is not a step forward in having more and more competitive elections, which presumably would be a good thing for the American political system. As the Senator knows, I don't want to disarm anybody. I don't think we have a problem in America because we have too few voices speaking on issues.  My view is, a government that spends $1.8 trillion a year is a government that can threaten an awful lot of people. It is not at all surprising these citizens, groups, and parties want to have an impact on a government that has the ability to take away everything they have. So I am not surprised, nor am I offended, by all of these voices having the opportunity to speak out.  But I thank the Senator from New Jersey for making the very important point that it is a sort of selective quieting of voices, a singling out of six committees. I think there are something like 3,000 committees registered with the Federal Election Commission. If this particular version of McCain-Feingold were passed, I say to my friend from New Jersey, 6 committees out of 3,000 would be unable to engage in issue advocacy, raising an important fifth amendment problem under the equal protection clause. Is it possible for the Government to single out 6 committees out of 3,000 and say only those committees cannot engage in issue advocacy?  So this thing has an important fifth amendment problem. We have talked a lot about the first amendment in this debate. This proposal has a serious fifth amendment problem.  I thank my friend from New Jersey for his observations about what is going to happen, practically, if you simply target the parties.
