 President, at a time when we are witnessing the devastating consequences of ethnic and sectarian division in places such as Iraq and Darfur, I believe it is vital to recognize the efforts of those who work to promote peace and reconciliation. In that spirit, I wish to commend the 53 Nobel laureates who signed an appeal by the Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity in support of ``tolerance, contact and cooperation between Turks and Armenians.''  In their appeal, the laureates call on both Turks and Armenians to take the steps necessary to open the Turkish-Armenian border, generate confidence through civil society cooperation, improve official contacts, and allow basic freedoms. As part of this commitment, the laureates call on Turkey to end all forms of discrimination against ethnic and religious minorities and abolish Article 301 of the Turkish Penal Code. This provision has been used to take legal action against those who speak out about the Armenian genocide, including Nobel laureate Orhan Pamuk and recently murdered Turkish-Armenian journalist Hrant Dink. There is no question that article 301 contributed to the toxic political environment that led up to Mr. Dink's assassination in January.  The laureates also note that ``Turks and Armenians have a huge gap in perceptions over the Armenian Genocide.'' To address this chasm of understanding, they call for further study and dissemination of a report prepared by the International Center for Transitional Justice. That impartial analysis of the massacres perpetrated against Armenians in the early 20th century concluded that the killings ``can be said to include all the elements of the crime of genocide . . .'' This finding was corroborated by the International Association of Genocide Scholars, which issued its own statement in 1997 to reaffirm ``that the mass murder of Armenians in Turkey in 1915 is a case of genocide which conforms to the statutes of the United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide.'' The existence of these independent evaluations of the Armenian genocide and relevant international law should provide an opportunity for both countries to accept the verdict of history and move forward.  Mr. President, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has unanimously passed S. Res. 65, a resolution echoing many of the sentiments expressed by the laureates and honoring the life of Hrant Dink, a leading proponent of Turkish-Armenian reconciliation up until the time of his brutal murder. It is my hope that the full Senate will adopt this important measure without further delay.  I congratulate the Wiesel Foundation for its work to produce this important statement and request consent that it be printed in the Record. I hope that the words of these Nobel laureates will encourage the people of both nations to recognize and ultimately transcend the legacy of the Armenian genocide. Once this occurs, I have every confidence that the people of Armenia and Turkey will be able to rebuild the ties between their countries and forge a new, enduring peace.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                   The Elie Wiesel                                      Foundation for Humanity,                                      New York, NY, April 9, 2007.       Dear Friends: We, the undersigned Nobel laureates, issue      this appeal directly to the peoples of Turkey and Armenia.      Mindful of the sacrifice paid by Hrant Dink, the ethnic      Armenian editor of Agos in Turkey, who was assassinated on      January 19, 2007, and whose death was mourned by both Turks      and Armenians, we believe that the best way to pay tribute to      Mr. Dink is through service to his life's work safeguarding      freedom of expression and fostering reconciliation between      Turks and Armenians.       To these ends, Armenians and Turks should encourage their      governments to:       Open the Turkish-Armenian border. An open border would      greatly improve the economic conditions for communities on      both sides of the border and enable human interaction, which      is essential for mutual understanding. Treaties between the      two countries recognize existing borders and call for      unhampered travel and trade.       Generate confidence through civil society cooperation.      Turks and Armenians have been working since 2001 on practical      projects that offer great promise in creatively and      constructively dealing with shared problems. The governments      should support such efforts by, for example, sponsoring      academic links between Turkish and Armenian faculty, as well      as student exchanges.       Improve official contacts. Civil society initiatives would      be enhanced by the governments' decision to accelerate their      bilateral contacts, devise new frameworks for consultation,      and consolidate relations through additional treaty      arrangements and full diplomatic relations.       Allow basic freedoms. Turkey should end discrimination      against ethnic and religious minorities and abolish Article      301 of the Penal Code, which makes it a criminal offense to      denigrate Turkishness. Armenia also should reverse its own      authoritarian course, allow free and fair elections, and      respect human rights.       Turks and Armenians have a huge gap in perceptions over the      Armenian Genocide. To address this gap, we refer to the 2003      ``Legal Analysis on the Applicability of the United Nations      Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of      Genocide to Events which Occurred During the Early Twentieth      Century,'' which corroborated findings of the International      Association of Genocide Scholars.       It concluded that, ``At least some of the [Ottoman]      perpetrators knew that the consequences of their actions      would be the destruction, in whole or in part, of the      Armenians of eastern Anatolia, as such, or acted purposefully      towards this goal and, therefore, possessed the requisite      genocidal intent. The Events can thus be said to include all      the elements of the crime of genocide as defined in the      Convention.'' It also concluded that, ``The Genocide      Convention contains no provision mandating its retroactive      application.''       The analysis offers a way forward, which addresses the core      concerns of both Armenians and Turks. Of course, coming to      terms will be painful and difficult. Progress will not occur      right away. Rather than leaving governments to their own      devices, affected peoples and the leaders of civil society      need to engage in activities that promote understanding and      reconciliation while, at the same time, urging their      governments to chart a course towards a brighter future.
