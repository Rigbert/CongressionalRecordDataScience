 Hayes. Mr. Hayes has faithfully served citizens in parts of south central Kentucky through his commitment to the Warren Rural Electric Cooperative Cooperation, RECC, and its members for 40 years.  Hayes was born in humble circumstances in Simpson County under the roof of his grandmother's farmhouse. After 4 years in Butler County, the Hayes family settled in Richardsville, located in Warren County. Mr. Hayes attended Richardsville Elementary School and later, Richardsville High School, where he played point guard on the basketball team.  As a promising young man, Mr. Hayes married his childhood sweetheart, Karen Smith, in December 1966. Two years later, on May 6, 1968, Mr. Hayes began his work for Warren RECC.  He entered as a chainman and quickly exceeded expectations, being promoted to groundman in the same year. By 1969, Mr. Hayes had worked his way up to apprentice lineman and acquired the nickname ``Squirrel'' for his prodigious ability to climb poles. Mr. Hayes' physical talents were not the only thing that went noticed at Warren RECC. His relentless hard work and dedication earned him a promotion to line frontman just 1 year later.  From here, Mr. Hayes continued to impress. His tenacity and loyalty led to his eventual promotion as successor to Wilmuth Deweese in 1990 as district manager of the Warren RECC Leitchfield office. In 2000, Gerald accepted the position of president and CEO of Warren RECC, taking on the responsibility of leading a company he had already committed to for 32 years.  The Warren RECC mission statement claims ``safety, integrity, value, and innovation'' as their guiding principles. Mr. Hayes has worked relentlessly to see that these values are upheld and not forgotten. On May 6, 2008, Gerald will honorably retire from his position as CEO, 40 years to the day he began work as a chainman. Mr. Hayes's wife Karen, their four children Laura, Leah, Lisa and Landon, and their seven grandchildren have proudly supported him throughout his career, and are the foremost reason Mr. Hayes has been able to achieve so much.  Warren RECC has been providing quality electrical service to south central Kentucky residents for 70 years thanks to Mr. Hayes' constant and faithful service. He is a truly outstanding Kentuckian, and I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Mr. Gerald W. Hayes for his 40 years of outstanding and loyal service.                          ____________________
