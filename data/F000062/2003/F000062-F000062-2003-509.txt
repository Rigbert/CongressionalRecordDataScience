 President, last night I introduced the ``State Criminal Alien Assistance Program Reauthorization Act of 2003,'' bipartisan legislation to authorize funds to relieve State and county governments of the some of the fiscal burdens associated with the incarceration of undocumented criminal aliens.  I am pleased that Senators McCain, Kyl, Schumer, Boxer, Hutchison, Bingaman and Domenici have joined me in introducing this important measure.  The broad principle on which this bill is based is simple: the control of illegal immigration is a Federal responsibility. When the Federal Government falls short in its efforts to control illegal immigration, it must bear the responsibility for the financial and human consequences of this failure.  More and more, however, the fiscal consequences of illegal immigration are being borne by the States and local counties.  The State Criminal Alien Assistant Program, SCAAP, Reauthorization Act of 2003 would properly vest the fiscal burden of incarcerating illegal immigrants, who are convicted of felonies or multiple misdemeanors, with the Federal Government.  The legislation would do so by authorizing up to $750 million in Fiscal Year 2004 for Federal reimbursement to the States and county governments for the direct costs associated with incarcerating undocumented criminal aliens. It would authorize an additional $850 million in Fiscal Year 2005, and $950 million for the program in Fiscal Years 2006 through 2010.  The number of State and local governments seeking SCAAP funding has jumped 25 percent from the previous year. The combination of the increase, and the fact that all 50 States and the District of Columbia receive some funding from the program, suggests that no State is immune from the fiscal costs associated with crimes committed by illegal aliens.  Therefore, I urge all of my colleagues to work with me to not only ensure that the SCAAP program survives, but also that it is adequately funded.  At a time when the administration is asking State and local governments to do even more with their local funds to enforce the nation's immigration laws, it is at the same time recommending the elimination of a vital source of funding that already falls far short of what states spend to incarcerate criminal illegal aliens.  High impact States, like California, continue to shoulder extraordinary costs for housing illegal aliens in its criminal justice system. The State prisons had an estimated 22,565 criminal aliens it its system out of a total population of 160,728.  In just a 3-month period last year, the State's county jails housed just under 10,000 criminal aliens. Overall, California taxpayers paid more than $2.28 billion in 2001 to cover these costs.  In 2002, California received a SCAAP payment of $220 million--less than 10 percent of the total costs to the State. This year, California taxpayers can expect to spend even more.  The SCAAP reauthorization bill would help California and all other States that are experiencing increasing costs from incarcerating undocumented felons--both low-impact and high-impact states.  Last year, the State of Wisconsin and its counties, for example, received more than $3.5 million in funding; Massachusetts received over $13 million; Pennsylvania received lose over $2.6 million; Virginia received more than $6.4 million; North Carolina received $5.2 million; Michigan received $2.9 million; Minnesota received $1.8 million.  Thus, even states that have not traditionally had to confront the growth in illegal immigration are now bearing the costs of this Federal responsibility.  The administration's opposition to this program is puzzling.  I am particularly disappointed that an Administration headed by a former governor of a State highly impacted by the Federal Government's inability to control illegal immigration, would recommend the elimination of this important program.  Who pays when these costs go uncovered?  In California, the burden will fall on our law enforcement agencies--including sheriffs, officers on the beat, anti-gang violence units, district attorneys offices. At a time when the nation is focused on enhancing security within our borders, within our States and within our local communities, a vital program like SCAAP should not be vulnerable to being short-changed or eliminated.  I note that when the current president was governor of Texas, he was a strong supporter of Federal funding for SCAAP he, too, recognized that controlling illegal immigration was a federal responsibility and that States cannot and should not be expected to handle the national burden on their own.  Certainly, the problems that were faced by Texas then with respect to the incarceration of criminal aliens have grown since then-Governor Bush wrote that letter. In 1997, the year in which the letter was written, the State of Texas incurred more than $129 million in incarceration costs. In fiscal year 2002, those costs soared to more than $1.17 billion.  It is inexplicable to me that this administration would now call for the elimination for the program. I will include the letter then-Governor Bush wrote to Representative Hal Rogers, chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State, the Judiciary and Related Agencies, for the Record.  After years of strongly supporting funding for the SCAAP program, President Bush's recent opposition to the program prompted Congress to cut the program by 56 percent this year, from $565 million to $250 million.  I urge my colleagues to reverse that course in Fiscal Year 2004 and consider restoring the cuts that were made when Congress considers the FY2003 supplemental appropriations request the administration is likely to submit in the next several weeks.  I thank my colleagues who joined me yesterday for their tireless efforts in ensuring that States and local counties receive some compensation for they do their part in securing their communities from criminal aliens who are in the country illegally.  I join them in introducing the SCAAP reauthorization legislation in hopes that it will go further to alleviate some of the fiscal hardships States and local governments incur when they must take on this Federal responsibility.  I ask unanimous consent to print the letter to which I referred in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                    State of Texas                                       Office of the Governor,                                                    July 10, 1997.     Hon. Hal Rogers,     Chairman, Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State, the          Judiciary and Related Agencies, Committee on          Appropriations, Washington, D.C. 20515.       Dear Chairman Rogers: The cost of processing and housing      criminal aliens in our state criminal justice system      continues to grow. I am writing to ask you to support funding      the $650 million authorization to reimburse state and local      governments for the costs of incarcerating undocumented      criminal aliens. We are thankful for Congress' recognition of      this problem in Texas and appreciate the funding we have      already received.       The Immigration and Naturalization Service estimates that      Texas incarcerates more than 8,000 undocumented aliens each      year. At this current rate of incarceration, the annual cost      to Texas exceeds $129 million. During fiscal year 1996, Texas      received $51.9 million in reimbursement under the State      Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP). Any additional      funds dedicated to assist Texas in recapturing the costs of      housing these criminal aliens would be greatly appreciated.       Thank you for your time and attention to this matter of      importance to Texas. I will appreciate any action you can      take on this matter.           Sincerely,                                                   George W. Bush,     Governor.                          ____________________
