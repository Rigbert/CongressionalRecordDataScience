 Madam Speaker, I can't believe what I have heard from my friends on the other side of the aisle. If they succeed in defeating this bill, it is a case of be sorry for getting what you ask for. This bill actually puts more civil liberties protections into the PATRIOT Act than the conference report which has already been passed by both Houses and is ready to be enrolled and sent to the President for his signature.  So if you have your way and you vote down the bill that was authored by the gentleman from New Hampshire, Senator Sununu, you are not going to have the additional civil liberties protections that are contained in Senate 2271. That is not going to stop the conference report which you opposed in December, as is your right, from going to the President and being signed without these additional civil liberties protections.  If you are for more civil liberties protections in the PATRIOT Act, vote for this bill. If you are against them, vote against this bill. But the fate of this bill has no bearing on the fact that the conference report on the PATRIOT Act reauthorization has been cleared by both Houses and is ready to go to the White House. So think before you vote ``no.'' I am voting ``aye'' because this is a good bill, and we ought to vote on this bill based upon what is in it rather than what is in other legislation.
