 REID. Yes, of course. I would be happy to yield.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I want to commend Senator Murray, Senator Sessions, and the majority leader for conducting an open and complete and full debate. I know everyone is exhausted, and people may not feel it at the moment, but this is one of the Senate's finest days in recent years, and I commend everyone who has participated in this extraordinary debate.
