 Madam Speaker, I would just refer the membership to the text of the bill on the top of page 3, which says, and I read it, ``In hearing and determining a claim or cause of action removed under this section, the court shall only consider whether authorizing or directing the withholding or withdrawal of food or fluids or medical treatment necessary to sustain the incapacitated person's life constitutes a deprivation of any right, privilege or immunity secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States.''  Now, in every civil rights lawsuit that was removed to Federal court, the Federal court applied privileges and immunities and protections provided by the Constitution of the United States or Federal law, and all this bill does is to allow the same type of review on whether someone's Federal rights are deprived by action of the State court in the Federal court.  If we did not do this in the civil rights revolution of the 1960s, this country would be a lot different place and a lot worse place than it is today. It was Federal judges that applied Federal law in those cases, and if it was good enough to apply them in the civil rights cases of the 1960s, why is it not good enough to deprive a person who is incapacitated the same type of Federal judicial review on their Federal rights in a Federal court?  We should not deprive an incapacitated person of a judicial review in a Federal court of their Federal civil rights, and that is why this bill ought to pass.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
