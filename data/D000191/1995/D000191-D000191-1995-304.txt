There is an excellent quote which plays off that in the business section today of the Washington Post, page D1, where the vice-chairman of Goldman, Sachs, Robert Hormats, says the prestige of the President, the Fed Chairman, and the leadership of both Houses in Congress has been committed. If Congress were to kill the aid package, the feeling in the rest of the world would be that we are a nation in disarray, a country incapable of addressing a crisis. The psychological blow would be enormous.  I wonder if Mr. Hormats is really talking about the blow to the United States of America and the people whom I represent who have not been speculating in Mexico, or is he talking about the blow to Goldman, Sachs, who has done 5.2 billion dollars' worth of business in Mexico for the last 3 years.  If we are taking about that, I am really concerned what is being proposed now by the ex-director of Goldman, Sachs, the Secretary of the Treasury, is to bail out Mexico now through an Executive order, not through coming to the United States Congress.                             {time}   2050  They found the Congress exerted, in this case, uncommon good sense; they said ``Wait a minute, we don't see the collateral or the national security interests. Why are we looking at this $40 billion bailout?''  I see the gentleman from California [Mr. Hunter] has arrived.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California.
