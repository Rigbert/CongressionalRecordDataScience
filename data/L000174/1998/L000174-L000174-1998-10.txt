President, Allen Gartner is one of Vermont's real citizen treasures. He was recently honored by the Rutland Region Chamber of Commerce on their 100th anniversary. I ask unanimous consent that a letter Iwrote and an article about this honor be printed in the Record.  The whole Gartner family represent the best of Vermont and Marcelle and I value their friendship.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                    Patrick Leahy,                                                 U.S. Senator,                                                  October 1, 1998.     Rutland Region Chamber of Commerce,     North Main Street,     Rutland, VT       Dear Friends: My mother was wrong.       She always told me that if I wanted something done right, I      should do it myself.       What I learned a little later in life was that if I REALLY      wanted something done right, I needed to ask Allen Gartner to      do it.       Allen personifies Rutland--his love of his family, his      sense of the broader community, his deep spirituality, and      his sense of the broader community of which we are all a      part. Most important for his friends in Rutland and all over      Vermont is an indomitable sense that if you work hard enough,      and if your cause is just, anything is possible.       It is fitting that Allen is honored by a group as respected      as the Rutland Region Chamber of Commerce. But Allen, by the      life he leads, the work he does and the joy he brings to      others, honors all of us every single day.           Sincerely,     Pat.                                  ____            [From the Rutland Daily Herald, October 5, 1998]         Allen Gartner, Business Leader With a Sense of Charity                       (By Laurie Lynn Strasser)       ``Tzedaka'' is the most important word in the Hebrew      language, Mintzer Brothers co-owner Allen S. Gartner said      last Thursday after receiving the 1998 Business Person of the      Year award from the Rutland Region Chamber of Commerce.       It means ``charity.''       ``I was raised that this is the greatest country in the      world, by a long shot,'' said Gartner. ``It was our      obligation to give back to the community. My parents not only      spoke those words, but they lived by those words.''       In conferring the honor, Rutland Chamber of Commerce      Executive Vice President Tom Donahue rattled off a litany of      boards that Gartner has served on. Donahue added that if he      listed all the extracurriculars and charities Gartner had      helped, ``this luncheon might turn into a dinner meeting.''       In an interview afterward, Gartner said he felt honored by      the award, but that recognition was not the point.       ``Whatever I'm doing, I need to do because that's what      people should do,'' he said. ``The bottom line of business is      not what's important. That's not what we're on this planet      for. We're only here a speck anyway. Really, it's just a      blip. What's important is the welfare of the community.'' His      father, the late Walter Gartner, used to say that the best      form of giving is anonymous. His father made it out of Nazi      Germany in the nick of time, but lost the rest of his family      to the Holocaust. After World War II, he married and bought      Mintzer Bros., a fuel oil and grain business that had been      founded in 1926.       Walter Gartner's wife, Margot, gave birth to Edward in 1945      and Allen in 1949.       The younger Gartner still recalls the days when customers      bought berry baskets, syrup cans and laying mash. By the      early 1960's, the emphasis had switched to building supplies.       Gartner worked at the Strongs Avenue store in the summers      between his graduation from Rutland High School in 1967 and      Union College in 1971.       He spent his junior year abroad in France. Just last year,      he returned to Paris for an emotional reunion with his host      family. The people he last saw as teenagers are now in their      40s, he noted.       Gartner earned a bachelor's degree in political science and      modern languages.       ``I have a passion for politics,'' he said. ``To me,      politics is conflict and compromise.''       He went on to pursue an advanced degree at New York      University Law School, although he never intended to become a      practicing attorney.       ``I spent the first 20 years of my life trying to be a      peace-maker,'' he said. ``The first day of law school, the      professor's asking, ``What would your argument be? It was      always anti-thetical to what I believed, but it was good      education. I refer to my law school education almost every      day of the week.''       It wound up taking him seven years to finish at NYU because      his father had suffered a stroke. Living with relatives on      Manhattan's Upper West Side, he would attend graduate school      then work for one semester each year.       ``I'd go down to the pay phone in the basement of the law      school library and make phone calls for the business,'' he      recalled. ``I'd do this every day, buying and selling lumber,      calling customers.''       Gradually, he and his brother, Edward, took the reins from      their father. Walter Gartner died in 1983.       The brothers opened another Mintzer branch in Ludlow in the      early 1980s. Three years ago they expanded again into the      Route 7 south space vacated by Grossman's after it went out      of business.       In the coming year, Mintzer Bros. may face its toughest      challenge in 70 years. Home Depot, the largest hardware chain      in the world, has indicated an interest in opening a large      store in Rutland.       ``Big orange is a dose of reality,'' he said referring to      Home Depot's theme color. ``You've got to fight the good      fight, fight it as best as you can. Business today is war.      I'm not sure I'm cut out for war.''       Gartner was instrumental in recruiting area merchants to      form Rutland Region First, a grassroots organization whose      goal is to stop Home Depot from locating in the area.       No matter what happens with the business, it is important      to keep perspective, said Gartner. He has faced worse      hardships, including the loss of his firstborn daughter when      she was six days old and chronic back pain for the past 17      years. Financial challenges are not as important as keeping      his family intact, Gartner said.       Just like when he was growing up, Gartner still plays the      role of peaceseeker, but these days he has taken the quest to      an international level.       Last week, he met Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who was      in Washington, DC, to parley with Israeli Prime Minister      Benjamin Netanyahu.       ``It pains me to see Palestinians mistreated,'' he said.      ``I'm a Zionist, but I think we've got to live together.''       Committed to the Middle East peace process for the past      decade, he shaved off his beard when he learned of the      historic 1979 accord between Israel and Egypt. When Yasser      Arafat signed a treaty with the late Isaac Rabin in 1993,      Gartner was there on the south lawn of the White House.       ``It was a most emotional moment for me,'' he recalled,      describing weeping Jewish and Arab Americans throwing their      arms around each other.                          ____________________
