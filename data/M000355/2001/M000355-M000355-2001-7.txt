 President, the Senate Appropriations Committee yesterday marked-up H.R. 3338, the FY 2002 Department of Defense Appropriations Bill. I authored language in the report accompanying that bill requiring the Pentagon to report to Congress on Thailand's defense needs in the wake of Burma's recent purchase of 10 MiG-29 fighter aircraft from Russia. I did so because of my grave concerns with regional security and stability--and with the welfare of the people of Burma who endure hardships and indignities under the oppressive misrule of the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC). In terms of oppressive regimes, the SPDC ranks right up there with the Taliban.  My colleagues should take note of the November 28 edition of Jane's Defence Weekly which states that Burma has ``significantly expanded the country's military strength while most other [countries] in the region are pursuing force reductions . . . military modernization since 1988 has been heavily tied to China as the principal source of equipment--variously valued at between $1 billion and $2 billion. [The purchase of the MiGs from Russia] following up its 1996 purchase of Mi-17 helicopters, suggests that a new dimension could dominate the next phase of development . . . [the SPDC] has stated publicly that armed forces strength has been targeted to expand by a further 25 percent, to 500,000.''  Lest my colleagues fail to understand what is happening in Rangoon today, let me sketch a quick outline:  The legitimately elected leader of Burma--Daw Aung San Suu Kyi of the National League for Democracy (NLD)--continues to be under house arrest in Rangoon, with up to 1,800 political prisoners languishing in Burmese prisons. While SPDC thugs and Suu Kyi are engaged in ``talks'', the junta is building up its military strength and purchasing billions of dollars of military hardware from Russia and China. To say that the defense build-up sends conflicting messages to the NLD and the world is a gross understatement.  Meanwhile, the people of Burma suffer from neglect and abuse at the hands of the SPDC who attached absolutely no importance to the welfare of Burmese citizens. None. And to make matters worse, Japan appears to be rewarding the SPDC by providing a grant aid to Burma for the repair of the Baluchaung Hydroelectric Power Plant in Karenni State. The Japanese government must understand that such assistance is not only premature, it is also misguided. Money is certainly the language of the thugs and thieves in Burma, but it cannot buy peace and stability in that mafia state.  I encourage my colleagues to read Fred Hiatt's excellent op-ed in Monday's edition of the Washington Post, and ask that it appear in the Record following my remarks.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Washington Post, Dec. 3, 2001]                             Eyes Wide Open                            (By Fred Hiatt)       One inevitable reaction, as we hear now of the depredations      of the Taliban regime, is: Where were we all while this was      going on?       Oh, some feminists and human rights activists tried to call      our attention to Afghanistan's gender apartheid. Journalists,      including The Post's Pam Constable, reported from Kabul. We      took note briefly when religious minorities were ordered to      wear identifying marks and when those ancient statues were      destroyed.       But for most of us, the recent revelations of Taliban      brutality--of forced conscription, point-blank murder,      scorched-earth destruction and merciless impoverishment of      widows and children--have been just that, revelations. As the      Bush administration rails righteously against a regime it      barely seemed to notice before Sept. 11, we have to ask:      Where were they--where were we--these five long years? How      could we have let it happen?       One way to answer the question is to look at places where      it is happening still.       This week past Nobel Peace Prize winners will gather in      Oslo to honor one missing laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, the      rightful leader of the Southeast Asian nation of Burma,      wasn't allowed to pick up her prize in 1991, and a decade      later she remains under house arrest and cut off from the      world. Her countrymen--some 48 million of them, more or less      double Afghanistan's population--are preyed upon by their      leaders much as Afghans were by theirs.       The facts are depressingly familiar to the relatively few      who follow events in Burma (renamed Myanmar by the junta). A      promising, resource-rich nation with a well-educated and      peaceable population has been ground gradually toward poverty      and ignorance by a succession of malevolent and misguided      rulers.       In 1990 the ruling junta, apparently deluded about its      popularity, as dictators frequently are, staged elections.      The National League for Democracy, led by Aung San Suu Kyi,      won four out of every five parliamentary seats, even though      she was already under house arrest. Instead of letting the      parliament meet, the generals put many of the winners in      jail, where some remain to this day.       Among juntas, Burma's is particularly famous for its use of      forced unpaid labor. As many as 1 million Burmese, by the      estimate of the International Confederation of Free Trade      Unions, have been press-ganged into building roads, railroads      and military installations. Many of the conscripted are      children. Many are forced to act as porters for the army,      often in dangerous circumstances.       The generals, fearing the people they rule, maintain an      army of 400,000. They have shuttered the country's      universities for most of the past decade. People are jailed      for possession of unlicensed fax machines. Media are      controlled by the state. Some 1,500 people     are in prison for political crimes, mostly for having sought      to peacefully express opinions of which the regime did not      approve. In a country where one in three children is      malnourished, the generals recently agreed to buy from Russia      a dozen advanced MiG-29 fighter jets.       The combined effect of repression and the military's      incompetence is ever-worsening poverty. In the past year, the      local currency has lost half its value. The only export on an      upward curve is heroin. Vast acreages of rain forest have      been destroyed to feed the generals' corruption. Just in the      past two months, the BBC recently reported, food prices have      doubled, and power outages have become routine. HIV-AIDS is      spreading fast.       Despite democracy's advances around the world in recent      years, the Burmese assuredly are not the only people still      enchained. North Koreans, Chinese, Belarusians, Iraqis,      Cubans--all are denied their freedoms, yet none is about to      be liberated by U.S. bombing. There's a limit to what we can      do, and what we should do.       Yet in all of those places the United States can and should      press for freedom. In Burma, economic sanctions are beginning      to have some effect. Concerned about their image and the      economy, the generals have released some 200 political      prisoners and at least entertained the efforts of a U.N.      envoy, now on his sixth trip to the nation. If other      countries remain steadfast in supporting Aung San Suu Kyi--     refusing to provide aid, for example, except in consultation      with her--there's some hope for more progress.       Burma, after all, would require no nation-building, no Bonn      conferences, no search for a viable opposition. A qualified      and democratically elected leader waits quietly in her      lakefront Rangoon house, still committed after a decade to      human rights and nonviolent change. When she finally moves to      the prime minister's office that belongs to her, and the      Burmese people cheer their liberation as many Afghans have      been cheering theirs, it would be nice if we could say at      least: We're not surprised. We knew that terrible things were      happening. We were with you all along.                          ____________________
