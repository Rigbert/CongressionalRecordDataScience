President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record letters of support from the National Governors Association, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and two other letters.  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                               National Governors Association,                                    Washington, DC, March 3, 1998.     Senator James Inhofe,     SROB, Washington, DC       Dear Senator Inhofe: On behalf of the nation's Governors we      are writing in support of a requirement that EPA pay one      hundred percent of the cost of monitoring for the new fine      particle air quality standard. We also urge Congress to      codify the time frames in the President's directive for      implementing the new federal standards for ozone and      particulate matter.       As you realize, state face a heavy burden of performance      under the federal air quality standards. The costs of new      monitoring networks will be substantial. Moreover, while many      states regard the EPA's implementing timeframe as      unrealistic, we are concerned that we may be given even less      time than promised to monitor and submit data to the EPA. It      would be self-defeating if states were shortchanged on the      resources for monitoring and the time allowed for      implementation of the new air quality standards. If states      were not provided with adequate time and resources to carry      out their responsibilities, the underlying purpose and      objective of the federal requirements might not be realized.      For that reason, it is important to codify the President's      schedule for implementing the new air quality standards, and      to ensure that EPA pays for all costs associated with the new      monitoring requirements.       If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact      us or Mr. Tom Curtis of NGA at 624-5389.           Sincerely,     George V. Voinovich,       Chairman.     Tom Carper,       Vice Chairman.                                                                    ____                                                         NFIB,                                    Washington, DC, March 3, 1998.     James Inhofe,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC       Dear Senator Inhofe: On behalf of the 600,000 small      business members of the National Federation of Independent      Business (NFIB), I am writing to urge you to support the      Inhofe Amendment to the Senate Highway bill (ISTEA).       Members of the Administration have stated that a nationwide      monitoring system for PM2.5 is necessary to classify      nonattainment areas under the new clean air standards. As      states seek ways to comply with the new standards, it is      critical that these decisions be based on sound data provided      by this type of monitoring network.       By ensuring the construction and operation of a new      nationwide PM2.5 monitoring system, the Inhofe Amendment      provides a framework of reliable data and sound science to      assist states with control strategies.       In a recent NFIB survey, a strong majority of small      business owners favored requiring agencies to use sound      science and valid evidence before issuing new rules.       The new stringent standards for ozone and particulate      matter will undoubtedly result in expanded emissions controls      on small businesses in areas of the country that have not      been subject to prior regulation. Designation of      nonattainment areas will bear heavily on those least able to      shoulder the burden--small businesses. It is imperative that      designations for the new standards be supported by sound,      accurate data.       Thank you for your consideration of our request and your      support for small business.                                                   Dan Danner,                                                   Vice President,     Federal Government Relations.                                                                    ____                                        Chamber of Commerce of the                                     United States of America,                                    Washington, DC, March 3, 1998.     To Members of the United States Senate:       The U.S. Chamber of Commerce urges your support for the      amendment to be offered by Senator Inhofe to S. 1173, the      Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act. The U.S.      Chamber of Commerce is the world's largest business      federation, representing more than three million businesses      and organizations of every size, sector, and region.       From an economic standpoint, immediate implementation of      the new standards would triple the number of communities out      of compliance, at a time when continuing improvements are      being made to the nation's air quality. The amendment will      provide states, businesses and consumers greater certainty      that control strategies for attaining compliance with both      the new ozone and fine     particulate matter standards are based on reliable data. The      amendment will provide the necessary funding to the      Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for establishing a      nationwide monitoring network for PM2.5 and allows      for the collection of three full years of monitoring data      before EPA decides which areas of the country do not meet the      new standard. The amendment is consistent with the timelines      set froth in President Clinton's Memorandum on Implementation      of the new National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for      ozone and PM2.5.       Accordingly, we urge your support for the Inhofe amendment      to ensure that the new NAAQS are based on the best data      possible. The U.S. Chamber will consider including the vote      on this amendment to S. 1173 in its annual How They Voted      ratings.           Sincerely,                                              R. Bruce Josten,                                         Executive Vice President,     Government Affairs.                                                                    ____                                              American Legislative                                             Exchange Council,                                    Washington, DC, March 2, 1998.     Senator James Inhofe,     Russell Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Inhofe: It has come to my attention that you      are considering an amendment to the Senate Highway bill,      known as ISTEA, dealing with the Environmental Protection      Agency's revised National Ambient Air Quality Standards for      particulate matter. I commend you on addressing this      important issue.       ALEC's members comprise over 3,000 state legislators in all      fifty states. These new standards will seriously impact our      state economies and divert scarce funds from other health and      environment priorities. Thus, it is crucial that these      standards not be imposed prematurely.       ALEC has adopted the Resolution on Ozone and particulate      Matter NAAQS Revisions, (enclosed), a model resolution      opposing the rapid implementation of these changes. In the      resolution, ALEC notes that little monitoring information has      been developed as to the beneficial health effects of new      standards. ALEC believes more study is needed to ascertain if      a casual link exists between particles of 2.5 microns and      possible adverse health effects. Also, ALEC supports further      study to determine the actual benefits and costs involved.       ALEC's model legislation has been considered by many state      legislatures, and has already passed in seven states. I hope      this information is helpful as you continue your      deliberations on this issue. If you have any questions, I      encourage you to call Scott Spendlove, Acting Director of      ALEC's Energy, Environment, Natural Resources and Agriculture      Task Force, at (202) 466-3800.           Sincerely.                                                      Duane Parde,                                               Executive Director.
