Speaker, the gentleman is absolutely correct and that's my point. But in previous years the President has told us in his budget this revenue would be available, and he has relied on that to offset what would otherwise be larger deficits either as a result of tax cuts or of spending. He has relied on this money.  So what we are saying on this side of the aisle is let's pay for the revenue that the President anticipated if we're not going to take it, and none of us want to take the revenue that is generated by the alternative minimum tax in this fiscal year.                              {time}  1815  So, ladies and gentlemen, if we don't pay for it, what do we do? Because the President relied upon it in previous budgets, and, frankly, the Congress did as well on both sides of the aisle. If that revenue does not come in and we don't pay for it, there is only one thing to do: borrow. And this administration has borrowed more money from foreigners than any administration in history all together. From Washington to Clinton, all together they didn't borrow as much money as this President has borrowed from foreign governments and put our country at risk. We're saying let's stop that. And in the 1990s, ladies and gentlemen of this House, we said let's stop that. Who's ``we''? President Bush, the Democratic House and the Democratic Senate said let's stop that, and we adopted PAYGO. And in 1997 we had another agreement, and a Democratic President and a Republican Congress said let's continue that policy because we believe it's a good policy.  And just a few years ago, the former chairman of the Budget Committee, Jim Nussle, who is now the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, said PAYGO is a policy that has worked, and we ought to pursue it. But as my friend knows, in 2001, we simply abandoned PAYGO. Why did we abandon PAYGO? Because demonstratively it had worked. For the previous 4 years we had, for the first time in the lifetime of anybody in this House of Representatives, had 4 budget years in a row that produced a surplus. Four. Why? Because we had a PAYGO in place. Why? Because when we wanted to take actions, we had to have the consequences of our actions and tell the American public it was not a free lunch. We would have to pay for it.  That's simply what this bill does. It pursues the policy of fiscal responsibility. It abandons the policy of fiscal irresponsibility and the pretense that there is a free lunch that we have been pursuing for the last 7 years and incurred that $1.6 trillion, give or take $100 billion, in the last 7 years.  Ladies and gentlemen of this House, no one wants to have a tax increase for these 25 million people. It was never intended. But some of my Republican colleagues say we didn't intend this, so we ought not to pay for it. That's like saying I didn't intend to run the stop sign and have an accident, and therefore, we don't have to pay for the consequences. We have relied on this money, the President has relied on this money. But we're saying we're not going to collect it, but we will responsibly pay for it.  In closing, let me say that Charlie Rangel likes to quote Russell Long, who said, ``Don't tax me. Don't tax thee. Tax the man behind the tree.'' Unfortunately, ladies and gentlemen of the House, the policies that we pursue are not taxing me and not taxing thee, but taxing the children and the grandchildren behind the tree.  It takes courage to pay for things. The largest expansion in entitlement programs in the last 25 years was done with hardly any Democratic votes and all Republican votes, and it wasn't paid for. We were told that it was within the budget. It wasn't. It wasn't paid for. Our children and grandchildren will pay that bill.  Have the courage, the wisdom, and the good common sense to adopt this legislation, and urge our colleagues in the other body to share that courage, to share that common sense to morally step up to the plate and have this generation pay for what it buys. Pass this important bill and pay for it.                             General Leave
