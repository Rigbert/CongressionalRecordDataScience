Speaker, I offer a privileged resolution and ask for its immediate consideration.  The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                               H. Res. 2       Resolved, That the Senate be informed that a quorum of the      House of Representatives has assembled; that Nancy Pelosi, a      Representative from the State of California, has been elected      Speaker; and that Karen L. Haas, a citizen of the State of      Maryland, has been elected Clerk of the House of      Representatives of the One Hundred Sixteenth Congress.  The resolution was agreed to.  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                          ____________________
