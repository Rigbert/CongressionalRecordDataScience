President, although we have different views on this issue, I would yield 1 minute to the Senator from Arizona.  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to express my appreciation for Senator Lieberman's and Senator Collins' hard work. We have had some disagreements. I still believe that if we could have, say, five amendments that would be voted and debated, I think we could move forward with this bill. I truly believe that.  I would like to see, possibly even right after this vote, if we could reach some agreement between the leaders and ourselves that we could say there would be five pending amendments and perhaps we could go ahead and debate and vote on those. I, again, think we have some very significant differences, but the fact that the chairman and the two cochairmen or whatever they call themselves have worked incredibly hard on this issue, they deserve debate. I hope they would understand we are seeking like five amendments.
