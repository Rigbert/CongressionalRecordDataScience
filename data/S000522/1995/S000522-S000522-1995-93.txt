Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  This amendment is designed to achieve several simple but important goals. First, it erects a firewall to ensure that money in the refugee assistance budget will be used for protecting refugees, not for general operating expenses at the State Department, which are adequately funded elsewhere.  Second, it avoids a back-door $12-million cut in the refugee assistance budget. We were very proud, in the Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights, to have been able to hold a few programs level with last year. One of those was child survival. And I am very pleased that the Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, Exporting Financing and Related Programs of the Committee on Appropriations has likewise looked to protect this important program. Another was refugee assistance. It was not easy, and I think we all know in these times of deficit reduction, holding anything harmless is very, very hard. But it was done.  Third, my amendment would avoid a corresponding $12-million back-door increase in the general operating budget for the State Department for which, again, we have authorized adequate funds. There is no need for the State Department to raid the refugee budget to pay its operating expenses. It already has $2.1 billion in the two largest operating accounts alone.  Under current law, the PRM Bureau gets its salaries and expenses from these accounts just like every other bureau in the State Department. The State Department operating accounts have not taken the steep cuts that the operating budgets of USIA or AID and other agencies have taken.  Finally, the refugees really do need the money more than the bureaucrats.  Let me cite three examples. In the current fiscal year at the height of the Rwanda refugee crisis, UNHCR found it necessary to reduce food rations in the camps that were holding Rwandan refugees. This was because the World Food Program had run out of food. The UNHCR said it had no money to pay for the food program, in large part because the State Department said there was not enough money in the refugee account to make a contribution for this purpose.  Surely an extra $12 million, perhaps even a smaller amount, would have made it unnecessary to cut those rations.  In Thailand, the State Department decided to shut down an English-language school for the Hmong refugees in order to save money. This will make it more difficult for these refugees to assimilate in the U.S., if they are resettled here. Shutting down the language school may also have had the effect of encouraging the Thai Government in its belief that the United States is not serious about accepting those people.  Finally, in the refugee centers in Croatia that hold victims of ethnic cleansing from Bosnia, the facilities are inadequate and the screening process is slow and it is erratic. Thousands of people have been in these centers for years. The United States claims it cannot find more than a handful of refugees who are eligible for resettlement. Refugee advocates point out that if you cannot find genuine refugees in Bosnia, we will never be able to find them anywhere else in the world. Many of these people can never go home. Their villages have been destroyed. Their families have been massacred. We have been unable or unwilling to commit the resources to do the job right.  Mr. Chairman, we all know we cannot solve all of   the world's problems. There are over 40 million refugees and displaced persons in the world. We cannot accept more than a tiny number of them here in the United States, but we can at least keep our priorities right.  In this case, those priorities are so obvious that my amendment has been endorsed by human rights organizations as diverse as the U.S. Committee for Refugees, the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Services, the U.S. Catholic Conference, the Council of Jewish Federations, the Christian Coalition and the Family Research Council.  The refugee budget has already absorbed real cuts this year, Mr. Chairman, both from inflation and from the dramatic decrease in the value of the dollar against European currencies. The money they are spending this year will buy 15 percent to 20 percent less overseas, less protection, less food, less water, fewer sanitary facilities than the same amount that we spent last year.  We could not afford to raise the refugee budget not even to keep our own spending power even with last year. My amendment, let me remind everyone, does not add a penny to the budget. It simply prohibits a back door transfer that would fund $12 million of spending here in Washington, DC.  I hope Members will vote ``yes'' on this pro-refugee, pro-fiscal responsibility amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I include for the Record the following letter:                                  U.S. Committee for Refugees,                                    Washington, DC, June 21, 1995.     Hon. Chris Smith,     Chairman, House International Relations Subcommittee on          Foreign Operations, House of Representatives, Washington,          DC.       Dear Mr. Smith: This letter is to inform you and your      colleagues of our strong support for your proposed floor      amendment that would prohibit using the Migration and Refugee      Assistance (MRA) account to pay for the State Department's      general salaries and administrative expenses.       The Foreign Operations Appropriations bill, H.R. 1868,      would, as currently written, use $12 million of MRA funds to      pay for salaries and expenses. This would be a damaging      change from current law and would effectively result in a $12      million reduction in direct assistance to refugees. Your      amendment would wisely retain current law, which allows all      MRA expenditures to go toward programs, and pays for salaries      and expenses by drawing from the Diplomatic and Consular      Programs account.       Your amendment would prevent a backdoor cut in U.S.      assistance to the world's 16.2 million refugees. H.R. 1868      should be amended. We wholeheartedly endorse your amendment      and urge other Members to give it bipartisan support on the      House floor.           Sincerely,                                                  Roger P. Winter,                                                         Director.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
