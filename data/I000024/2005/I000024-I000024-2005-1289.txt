It is reminiscent that this is not something new. Back when I was serving in the other body in the late 1980s, Congressman Jim Oberstar and I actually made a trip to Europe--that was before the European Union days--both to Germany and France to find out the level of subsidy they had. At that time, we were not able to find out, and we did an exhaustive search. They were denying that they did, and later on they admitted they were subsidizing. With their type of accounting, perhaps it is even worse than the figures the Senator is expressing today. So I applaud the Senator for her efforts.
