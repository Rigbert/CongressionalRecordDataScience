 President, I would like to urge the chairman and ranking member of the Commerce, State Justice Appropriations Subcommittee to join me in directing the National Marine Fisheries Service, through the Information and Analyses, Resource Information account, to provide $250,000 to the Odyssey Maritime Discovery Center in Seattle, WA.  The Odyssey Center is a new educational learning center opening in July, 1998. This Center will establish an educational link between the everyday maritime, fishing, trade, and environmental activities that occur in the waters of Puget Sound and Alaska, and the lessons students learn in the classroom. Through high-tech and interactive exhibits, over 300,000 children and adults per year will discover that what happens in our waters, on our coast lines, at our ports affects our State's and Nation's economic livelihood, environmental well-being, and international competitiveness. The Center wishes to establish an exhibits and lecture series to link the public, particularly school children, with the maritime, fishing, trade, and environmental industries. Named in honor of the great Senator of Washington, Warren G. Magnuson, this series would begin in 1998 and would serve as an educational resource on the sustainable development, uses, and protection of our seas and coastal waters. This series would provide a fitting tribute to Senator Magnuson, the founder of this Nation's Federal fisheries policies and the namesake of our principal fisheries management law, the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act.
