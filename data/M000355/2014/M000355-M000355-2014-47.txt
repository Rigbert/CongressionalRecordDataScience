 The Senator pointed out that having a cross-border pipeline is not exactly something new. As our chairman, Senator Hoeven, has pointed out repeatedly, it has cleared every environmental test. We cannot figure out why this has happened other than some misplaced ideological crusade the President wants to lead, not approved by Congress.  We all remember what it was like here in 2009 and 2010. Our friends on the other side had 60 votes. They could do whatever they wanted to. They could not pass cap-and-trade when they owned the place. They passed ObamaCare. They passed the stimulus. They passed Dodd-Frank. They couldn't pass cap-and-trade.  The President obviously feels so strongly about this, he is willing to give the Chinese a 16-year pass, ignore Congress and go full speed ahead. Part of that ideological rigidity is reflected in the challenge our friend from North Dakota has had here for a number of years in getting a decision made, which by any objective standard ought to be a no-brainer. My goodness, this is about as close to a no-brainer as you will ever run into.  I came out here for the specific purpose of praising the great work of the Senator from North Dakota. Without him we would not be where we are today on this issue.  I wonder if the Senator has any further question or observation to make?
