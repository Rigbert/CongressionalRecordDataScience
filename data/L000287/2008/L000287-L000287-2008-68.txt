Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend and my colleague, the chairperson of the Rules Committee, for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I stand before you today with a very heavy heart. Today this Congress will vote to spend $165 billion more on war. War is bloody. War is messy. It tends not just to hide the truth, but to sacrifice the truth. It destroys the hopes, the dreams and the aspirations of a people.  When the citizens of this Nation are begging for aid, struggling to make ends meet, it doesn't make sense to spend our precious resources on an unnecessary war. Sometime, somehow, some way, somebody must say enough is enough.  The rest of you may do what you may, but, as for me and my house, I will not vote for another dollar, another dime, another nickel, another penny, for this war. I will vote ``no'' on funding for war.
