 President, talking about taxes, it is essential to remember small businesses are the backbone of our economy. Small business entrepreneurs create more than two out of every three new jobs and generate roughly half of our Nation's gross domestic product. Yet they are saddled with the heaviest tax burden.  Small businesses predominantly pay their income taxes using individual income tax returns, which means they frequently pay the highest marginal tax rate. While they file less than 1 percent of all tax returns, small businesses account for more than 31 percent of all tax payments. Make no mistake, these are not highly paid executives or people living off their investments; these are ordinary people trying to make a living as they pursue the American dream.  Who pays the tax on the rich? Seventy-nine percent of the top rate literally falls on small business. To ignore this small business tax factor is to risk breaking the backbone of our economy. This point of order which this amendment would establish would protect small businesses from tax hikes on the rich.  I yield the floor.
