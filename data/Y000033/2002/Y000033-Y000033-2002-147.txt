Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3479, the National Aviation Capacity Expansion Act.  This Bill is long overdue.  Chicago O'Hare has been in need of a new runway for the last 20 years.  It's annually one of the worst airports in terms of cancellations and delays.  What's worse, problems at O'Hare ripple through our entire system, creating tie-ups and delays at dozens of other airports.  This bill furthers the agreement reached by local and State leaders to allow the city of Chicago to go ahead with a proposed capacity expansion project from O'Hare.  It likewise allows the State to go forward with its proposal for peotone and guarantees that Meig's Field will remain open.  I support H.R. 3479 to address these vital national transportation issues and urge everyone to support this bill.
