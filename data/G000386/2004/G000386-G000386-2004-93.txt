S. Marine Corps. Private First Class Skinner courageously gave his life on August 26, 2004, in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom when he was shot during a heavy exchange of gunfire in Najaf, Iraq. Private First Class Skinner is survived by his father Randy Skinner, his mother Laura Hamann, his older brother James and his younger sister Stephanie. This brave young soldier was only 20 years old. In his short life he made a lasting impression on his friends, family and fellow soldiers.  I ask my colleagues in the Senate and my fellow Americans to join me today in paying tribute to my fellow Iowan, Private First Class Skinner, for his sacrifice on behalf of our country. My deepest sympathy goes out to his family and friends. Private First Class Skinner was a great man that dedicated himself to his duty as a soldier. Private First Class Skinner told his grandmother that he joined the Marines because ``They're over there fighting for me and my country, I want to go over there and fight for you and my country.'' Private First Class Skinner is the example of a fine man and a strong soldier. I salute him for his sense of duty and his service to the American people.  We can all be proud of this extraordinary soldier. He did not die in vain, but died for his country that he loved to serve. Private First Class Skinner has entered the ranks of our Nation's greatest patriots. He will always be honored as a hero who gave the ultimate sacrifice for liberty. He will be greatly missed.                          ____________________
