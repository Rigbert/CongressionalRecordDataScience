 14, the Energy bill. At 9:30 tomorrow morning, the Senate will debate the Dorgan amendment related to hydrogen. That vote will occur at some point Tuesday morning prior to the policy luncheons. It has also been my hope, and the hope of many Members,as I indicated earlier, that tomorrow morning the Senate could consider and pass a bill relating to sanctions against Burma. As I suggested earlier, I will be asking the Senate to do that in the morning, and hopefully we will have a chance to move forward on that important piece of legislation.  Tomorrow we will continue to work with our Democratic colleagues to clear the Energy bill. Additional amendments are expected throughout tomorrow's session; therefore, rollcall votes will occur during tomorrow's session. It is also the hope of the bill managers that we can lock in a final list of amendments. Senator Reid referred to that earlier. We hope to be able to do that as soon as possible, and we encourage all Senators who wish to offer an amendment to contact the chairman and ranking member of the Energy Committee.                          ____________________
