President, I join with my colleagues, Senators DeWine, Dodd and Burr to introduce the Services for Ending Long-Term Homelessness Act, (SELHA).  It is estimated that two to three million Americans experience a period of homelessness in a given year. While the majority of these individuals find themselves homeless for a brief period of time, a growing segment are experiencing prolonged periods of homelessness. Roughly 200,000 to 250,000 Americans fall under the category of chronically homeless.  In March 2003, former Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson issued a report from a work group and an interagency subcommittee that was assembled to define the issues and challenges facing the chronically homeless and develop a comprehensive approach to bringing the appropriate services and treatments to this population of individuals who typically fall outside of mainstream support programs.  Similarly, the President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health recommended the development of a comprehensive plan to facilitate access to permanent supportive housing for individuals and families who are chronically homeless. However, affordable housing, alone, is not enough for many chronically homeless to achieve stability. This population also needs flexible, mobile, and individualized support services to sustain them in housing.  The legislation we are introducing today is critical to the development and implementation of more effective strategies to combat chronic homelessness through improved service delivery and coordination across Federal agencies serving this population. It directs the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration to coordinate their efforts not only with the Department of Housing and Urban Development, but with other Federal departments and the various agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services that provide supportive services.  Mr. President, SELHA is an important bipartisan measure which will help to ensure that the growing number of Americans experiencing chronic homelessness have access to the range of supportive services they need to get them back on their feet, living in permanent supportive housing and taking the steps necessary to become productive and active members of our communities again.  I look forward to working with my colleagues toward expeditious passage of this legislation.                                 ______                                       By
