 President, I rise today alongside my colleague from North Dakota in support of S. 456, the Information Technology Tax Credit bill, which provides employers with a tax credit for information technology training for their employees.  The purpose of this legislation is quite simple: To assist American companies which are having difficulty in recruiting skilled workers to fill positions in the information technology field.  Information technology--including computer programmers, systems analysts, computer scientists and engineers--is a critical ingredient in the growth of the U.S. economy as well as the economy of California. A field that barely existed a few decades ago, information technologies are now among the most important emerging technologies in the world.  Information technology now accounts for more than $500 billion a year to U.S. economy, and one-third of all new jobs created since 1992 are in computers, semiconductors, software, and communications equipment.  According to recent studies, ``e-commerce'' is projected to grow from $2.6 billion in 1996 to over $220 billion in 2001--explosive growth that will generate countless additional jobs.  And, just as important, many information technology jobs tend to be high value added, high-wage.  Last year California alone was responsible for sales of approximately $125 billion in high-tech production--almost than double 1992's $64 billion in sales.  Computer services--just one sector of the IT economy--have created 100,000 jobs in California in the past five years. There are now over 400,000 people in California employed directly in high-tech manufacturing jobs. When information technology business service jobs are added into the mix, there are currently over 700,000 information technology jobs in California, according to the Center for the Continuing Study of the California Economy.  And yet, despite this explosive growth--or perhaps because of it--America is simply not producing enough skilled and able workers to meet the needs of the information technology field.  Last year the Information Technology Association of America releases a study which estimated that there are more than 340,000 high skilled positions in the information technology field that are not filled.  And the Department of Labor has projected that our economy will require more than 130,000 information technology jobs in just three fields--computer scientists and engineers, systems analysts, and computer programmers--every year for the next decade.  One of the most sobering experiences of my Senate career occurred last year when I was told point blank by the CEO's of several large California high-tech companies that the United States is simply not producing a sufficient number of skilled and educated workers to fill the information technology positions that their companies need to fill if they were to be able to continueto grow and successfully compete in the international economy.  To meet the needs of these companies, last year Congress had to revise the cap on H1B visas to allow foreign professional and skilled workers who had the education and skills to fill these information technology positions to come to the United States.  While raising the H1B visa cap may meet the short term needs of these companies and of the economy, it is not a long-term solution to this problem.  To avoid the danger of a ``hollowing out'' the U.S. workforce we must invest more in the education and training of American workers so that they have the education and skills needed for the information technology jobs which make up the backgone of the new high-tech economy.  We must make sure that new workers entering the workforce have the skills they need to match with the jobs they want to be able to get. We must focus on retraining unemployed, older, and displaced workers, and encourage new partnerships between the IT industry and educational institutions. And we must reach out to those who have been left out to make sure that they have the training they need to join in our current economic prosperity.  To meet these needs, this legislation provides a tax credit for employers who offer information technology training for individuals, equal to 20 percent of the information technology training program expense, capped to $6,000 in a calender year.  And, to help those who may have been excluded from the economy of today take their place in the economy of tomorrow, it provides a 5 percent increase in the value of the credit as an additional incentive for training in empowerment zones or enterprise communities.  The current strength of U.S. information technology industry comes, in large part, from a long and successful partnership between government, educational institutions, and industry.  This legislation builds on that partnership to both meet our current needs and to train the next generation of information technology workers, and to maintain the U.S. economy's strength and leadership in the twenty-first century.                                 ______                                       By
