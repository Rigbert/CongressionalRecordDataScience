Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, the regional transit authorities are important to transportation in rural areas. I would be happy to discuss this matter further with the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Clyburn) and the gentleman to determine whether we can help with the problems in South Carolina.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield?
