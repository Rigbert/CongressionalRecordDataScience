 I say ``again'' because I first came to the Senate on the issue of asylum and summary exclusion last April 17 to oppose similar provisions in another conference report. I offered a motion to recommit that conference report on S. 735 in order to strike those sections added to that bill in the dark of night modifying our asylum processes, establishing summary exclusion and precluding judicial review. I objected then to those sections of that bill that had not been previously considered by the Senate and that had nothing to do with preventing terrorism, but were snuck into that conference report to alter general immigration law. I failed in that attempt to recommit the antiterrorism conference report by a mere 7 votes.  I knew from the beginning that my motion to recommit has little chance of success because Members were intent on passing an antiterrorism bill in connection with the anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing. Several Senators came up to me and said that they would have an easier time voting with me on the immigration bill and encouraged me to fix the problem when the immigration bill was considered in the Senate.  When we considered the Senate immigration bill in May, I continued my efforts. With Senators DeWine, Kerry and Hatfield I cosponsored an amendment to the asylum and summary exclusion provisions of that bill. With the support of a bipartisan group of Senators, including Senators Kennedy, Chafee, Simon, Jeffors and Hatch, we prevailed. On May 1, 1996, the Senate approved our amendment 51 to 49 and it replaced the summary exclusion provisions that had been in the immigration bill.  The bill that the Senate passed last May did not undermine our asylum processes or require summary exclusion where it was not necessary or appropriate. In the only vote by either body on these issues the Senate stood with those fleeing oppression and upheld our tradition as a haven for the oppressed and for those seeking religious and political freedom.  We have now come full circle. We in the Senate again find ourselves confronted by a time deadline and an unamendable bill. I am aware of where we are on the legislative calendar and can see other Members looking at their watches as they struggle to conclude this Congress and return home to campaign for reelection. I suspect that most Members have not even had a chance in the waning days of this Congress to examine the immigration bill conference report, let alone begin to explore what it will mean to those who will be denied refuge from oppression in other parts of the world under its provisions. There is no time, no real opportunity to educate ourselves or focus attention on this important matter. The majority simply rolls it out as part of ``must-pass'' legislation at the end of the session and it cannot be stopped.  I know that this legislation will pass and I expect that President Clinton will sign it--despite concern that these provisions may well violate our treaty obligations and undercut our world leadership on this issue. I recall that last February President Clinton wrote to Congressman Berman and noted his concern that ``we not sacrifice our proud tradition of refugee protection and support for the principles of the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees.'' The President wrote: ``This critically important Treaty, which responded to the displacement that followed the Second World War, has enjoyed broad bipartisan support in the Congress. Moreover, our efforts to urge other governments to comply with its provisions has been a major element of our diplomacy on international humanitarian issues.''  Specifically on the matter of summary exclusion, the President wrote that he favored ``carefully structured stand-by authority for expedited exclusion.'' That is what I would provide, but the approach that the conference report rejects.  With regard to the overall proposals for summary exclusion that the House was pressing, the President wrote that they were ``too broad and would also result in considerable diversion of INS resources.'' He noted that: ``These provisions seem particularly unnecessary in view of the successful asylum reforms we have already initiated.'' I agree.  I look forward to working with President Clinton when we return next January to correct the excesses of this bill and to right the balance that is needed if we are to honor our commitment to our tradition and those in troubled areas of the world who look to America for refuge.  We did not have an opportunity to craft sensible summary exclusion and asylum provisions and this measure does not bear the Senate's stamp of approval. All Democratic conferees were barred from even offering motions or amendments. I was prepared to offer an amendment to correct the excesses of this conference report and to reaffirm the human rights of those who look to this great country for refuge, but there is no real opportunity today to urge those changes to this legislation. Justas its provisions will result in the summary exclusion of some with valid asylum claims and its truncated procedures will certainly result in the United States returning refugees to countries where their lives and freedoms are in danger, so, too, the circumstances in which the Senate considers this matter have summarily excluded this Senator from participation in the House-Senate conference on this bill and precluded any opportunity for amendment or modification of these provisions.  Let me share with you the stories of some of those who have recently succeeded in gaining asylum in this country who would most likely have been denied our refuge had the bill and its procedures governed.  One of the best recent examples of someone who could have lost his life had the bill been the law of the land is now a constituent of mine in Vermont. His name is Moses Cirillo. Moses is from the Sudan and is a Christian. He had served as a translator for Christian missionaries, distributed Catholic literature and worked with aid groups in the southern part of Sudan. Those are the activities that placed him and his family in danger. He escaped to Ethiopia and then to the United States on a false passport. He lost his wife and son and brother before fleeing.  When he got to this country, this land of freedom and opportunity, Moses Cirillo could not get the INS or an immigration judge to believe him or understand the circumstances that brought him here. Fortunately for Moses, the Vermont Refugee Assistance came to his aid and pursued his cause. This summer, after 3 years in detention, Moses Cirillo was granted asylum. The INS agents at the border and an immigration judge had ruled against him. It was only when his case was reviewed by the Board of Immigration Appeals that he finally prevailed. Had we not had the procedural safeguards that will be eliminated by this conference report, there can be little question that Moses Cirillo would not be free and living in Vermont today.  Just a few days ago the Senate passed Senate Concurrent Resolution 71, a ressolution condemning human rights abuses and denials of religious liberty to Christians around the world. In that resolution we recognized that religious minorities continue to be oppressed and persecuted around the world. We termed religious persecution ``an affront to the international moral community and to all people of conscience.'' We commented on persecution of Christians in such countries as Sudan--like Moses Cirillo--in Cuba, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, China, Pakistan, North Korea, Egypt, Laos, Vietnam, and countries that were formerly part of the Soviet Union. We termed religious liberty a universal right.  We noted ``the United States of America since its founding has been a harbor of refuge and freedom to worship for believers from John Winthrop to Roger Williams to William Penn, and a haven for the oppressed.'' We referred to Pope John Paul II's call against regimes that ``practice discrimination against Jews, Christians, and other religious groups.'' We proclaimed our ``commitment to human rights around the world'' and our international leadership on behalf of persecuted religious minorities.''  We concluded less than 2 weeks ago, on September 17, that the Senate unequivocally condemns egregious human rights abuses and denials of religious liberty to Christians around the world and recognized Sunday, September 29, as a day of prayer recognizing the plight of persecuted Christians worldwide.  It makes little sense merely to condemn religious persecution if we turn around and enact procedures that will shut out the oppressed and summarily exclude refugees from religious persecution. It rings hollow to recall our history of freedom of religion and our station as a haven for the oppressed when we are poised and prepared to abandon that proud tradition.  While the Senate of the United States finds it easy to condemn religious persecution in Sudan, INS agents and an immigration judge initially denied Moses Cirillo asylum claim. It was only the extraordinary efforts of human rights advocates in Vermont and their persistent pursuit of justice through the procedural safeguards in our asylum process that allowed him to prevail. If this bill had been the law, those protections would not have been available. I will continue to work to ensure that before too long we will choose to act consistent with the recognition that religious persecution still plagues so much of the world.  Another recent case is that of Fauziya Kasinga. I first brought this young woman's case to the attention of the Senate back in April. Two days before, a reporter named Celia Dugger had told Ms. Kasinga's story on the front page of The New York Times. She had sought for 2 years to find sanctuary in the country only to be detained, tear-gassed, beaten, isolated and abused.  She, too, came to the United States with false documents. In her case she obtained a false British passport in order to escape mutilation in Togo and traveled from Germany to New York. On June 13, the Board of Immigration Appeals granted her application for asylum from female genital mutilation in Togo. After 2 years in detention, in a case that was initially opposed by INS and rejected by an immigration judge, she finally was freed and granted asylum.  Her case established new law. For when the INS was called upon to file a brief with the Board of Immigration Appeals it took the position for the first time that fear of female genital mutilation should present a sufficient cause to seek asylum in the United States. Hers was a precedent setting case. Does anyone doubt that she would have been returned to Togo if the summary exclusion provision of the bill had been the law? Does anyone honestly think that the immigration agents with whom she came in contact at the border or the immigration judge who denied her claim would have established such a precedent as a case of first impression and rescued her?  It is ironic that in this immigration bill we require that aliens from certain countries be advised prior to or at entry into the United States of the severe harm caused by female genital mutilation and we create a criminal statute against female genital mutilation on children in the United States. Unfortunately, neither of those measures will help the young women who are being subjected to this practice in other parts of the world.  In addition, this bill would amend our statutory definition of refugee to include persons forced to abort a pregnancy or to undergo involuntary sterilization or who are persecuted for refusing such procedures. It will do no good to amend these definitions if we do not have fair procedures and a real opportunity for refugees to establish the circumstances from which they flee to America. Summary exclusion is wholly incompatible with these expansions of the grounds for asylum.  I am glad to see that the bill excludes Cuban refugees from the harsh provisions of the new exclusionary asylum procedures. I believe that this exception should be the rule. Indeed, this exception shows that the majority does not trust the procedures that they are imposing on refugees from all other countries in the world.  Let us examine briefly the Cuban exception and how it might or might not apply. First, we should notice that it only applies to those who are wealthy enough, lucky enough, or skilled enough to arrive by aircraft at a port of entry. Thus, not all who escape from Cuba would be covered by this narrowly drafted special exception.  Further, let us consider how the exception might or might not work in a real-life situation. Not so long ago Fidel Castro's own daughter came to the United States using a disguise and a phony Spanish passport to seek asylum. Under the provisions of the bill, she might well have been turned away at the border after a summary interview if the INS agent who confronted her did not believe that she was Cuban or Castro's daughter. Would that INS officer or the immigration judge reviewing the summary decision within 24 hours think that this disguised person with false documentation had established a ``significant possibility'' that she was Castro's daughter? Think about what would most likely have happened.  Next, I ask you to consider the case of Alan Baban. Mr. Baban is one of the many Kurds who was jailed and tortured in Iraq. He succeeded in bribing ajailor and escaping. He went into hiding for 3 years and ultimately escaped to this country without documents.  In spite of the notorious persecution of Kurds by the Iraqis and the scarring Mr. Baban carries with him for life, the INS agents who confronted Mr. Baban at the airport did not believe him and determined that he did not have a credible claim of persecution. Having come to the United States for freedom from oppression, Mr. Baban was imprisoned, again--this time by U.S. authorities.  A year later he was denied political asylum when the interpreter he was assigned at a hearing did not speak or understand his Kurdish dialect. As a result, the immigration judge before whom he appeared did not believe that Mr. Baban was Kurdish.  It took 16 months in detention before Alan Baban was finally granted asylum on appeal. That appeal will be eliminated by the procedures mandated by the bill.  Consider the case of Ana X. whom I met last April when she came forward to share her story. Two-years ago she fled Peru. She had been horribly treated and threatened by rebel guerillas from the Shining Path there. She came to this country without proper documents and gained asylum only after a full and fair opportunity to convince an immigration judge at a hearing that she would suffer persecution if she was returned to Peru.  When she tried to share her history with us earlier this year, she could not finish her second sentence before she broke down in tears, overwhelmed by the memories of what she had suffered. I cannot imagine this victim of oppression being able to talk about her suffering to a strange authority figure immediately upon her arrival in the United States. Fortunately, she had a chance to obtain the help of volunteers and was able to present her case to an immigration judge at a hearing.  Finally, consider the case of Nikolai S. from a former Soviet republic and a social scientist. He had been beaten by government agents because he is Jewish. He came to the United States in 1994 to conduct research and he found it hard to bring himself even to apply for asylum. Once he felt that he was ready and had assembled supporting evidence of the dangerousness of anti-Semitism in his homeland, he applied. Had the arbitrary 1-year filing deadline of the bill been in place, his application would have been rejected as too late.  Human rights organizations like the Lawyers Committee have documented a number of cases of people who were ultimately granted political asylum by immigration judges after the INS denied their release from detention for not meeting a ``credible fear'' standard and numerous instances where it took an appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals.  I note the efforts of the Representative of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, who has been supportive of our efforts to have credible fear judged by the accepted international standard.  I have heard from many House Members, Republicans and Democrats, who feel very strongly about these provisions. Some have sent Dear Colleague letters urging that others join us ``in protecting human rights around the world.''  In particular, I have heard from Representatives Christopher Smith, Tom Lantos, Ben Gilman, Rick Boucher, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Matthew Martinez, Lincoln Diaz-Balart, George Miller, David McIntosh, Henry Waxman, Steve Chabot, Eni Faleomavaega, Thomas Davis, Robert Torricelli, Mark Souder, Ed Pastor, Jon Fox, Cynthia McKinney, Matt Salmon, Eliot Engel, Robert Menendez, and our former colleague Ham Fish.  I also remain deeply concerned that the bill would deny the Federal courts their historic role in overseeing the implementation of our immigration laws and review of individual administrative decisions. This bill will not allow judicial review whether a person was actually excludable and will create unjustified exceptions to rulemaking procedural protections under the Administrative Procedure Act.  This bill signals a fundamental change in the roles of our coordinate branches of Government and a dangerous precedent. Judicial review has often been a source of accountability for the executive branch. The bill eliminates that oversight and weakens protection that serves to make sure that the Executive is following the law. Over 90 law professors had written to us on this point on July 29. Their wise counsel is being ignored at our peril.  The summary exclusion and asylum provisions of the bill remain among its most extreme and unnecessarily harsh provisions. At the eleventh hour, after the House approved the conference report, there have been attempts to meet to create a better bill, but those truncated talks have done nothing to improve the asylum and summary exclusion provisions on which the congressional Republicans remain insistent.  Let me briefly outline adjustments that could have been made to preserve our asylum system while continuing to reform our processes as needed. The bill takes several giant steps backward from the bipartisan Senate effort in May to preserve our asylum process. We were successful in the only vote taken on the matter of summary exclusion and asylum in either House. I feel strongly that the Leahy-DeWine approach is a much more fair and balanced approach than that taken in the bill. We are now being forced to consider a bill that would have the effect of summarily excluding refugees from around the world who seek to come to America for freedom from oppression.  Within the past 2 weeks the Washington Times, the New York Times and the Washington Post have each published strong editorials condemning the asylum provisions of the Republican conference report. The Washington Times concluded: ``As lawmakers weigh these issues, they ought to keep in mind the following question: How would I feel about these rules if it were I who was applying for asylum?"  In the interest of bipartisan compromise I was prepared to offer a motion and an amendment to preserve the essence of our asylum system while adding additional requirements for expedited consideration of claims for asylum. It is that motion and amendment that Chairman Smith of the House and Chairman Hatch of the Senate ruled out of order at the meeting of House and Senate conferees on September 17.  The Leahy amendment would allow summary exclusion procedures if they are needed in an extraordinary migration situation, as designated by the Attorney General, rather than require their use at all times. This is what the administration requested, in contrast to the universal use of summary exclusion that the extremist measures in the bill will require. The Department of Justice has indicated that, except for a future migration emergency, they can handle asylum claims without resort to summary exclusion and the amendment, like the Senate immigration bill, would have provided such standby authority.  The Leahy amendment would incorporate an international recognized standard for screening asylum claims rather than forcing refugees back into the hands of their oppressors. It would require asylum seekers to show that their claims were not manifestly unfounded in order to receive a full hearing and examination of their circumstances. That is the standard that the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees and the international community strongly favors and the standard consistent without treaty commitments.  The Leahy amendment would preserve limited and narrow habeas corpus review to provide an opportunity to correct erroneous administrative action, which may in many cases by a matter of life or death. The bill seeks to choke off judicial review at every turn. We do not need less accountable government action and unfettered discretion being exercised by overburdened immigration agents to the detriment of refugees fleeing oppression. The New York Times wrote that this is one of the principal reasons it believes this ``a dangerous immigration bill.'' It observed that Republicans as well as Democrats ought to be alarmed by the prospect of unrestricted executive power without judicial review and accountability.  The Leahy amendment would treat refugees more fairly during the initial interview and tried to eliminate artificial barriers to screen out what may be valid asylum claims. By acting summarily before the refugee has a sense that it is okay to speak of the persecution and fear from which he or she isseeking refuge, the bill will screen out the unwary, the unschooled, and the uncertain who will be reluctant to talk about the persecution that compelled them to seek refuge and freedom in America.  The Leahy amendment would only impose a limitations period on asylum claims that are raised for the first time defensively to ward off deportation rather than impose an arbitrary 1-year limit on all asylum claims. If the use of asylum claims defensively to ward off deportation is the problem, let us deal with that problem and not penalize refugees with valid asylum claims who were too traumatized or fearful to come forward until they had gotten settled in this new land.  We need not gut our asylum law by allowing low-level bureaucrats to make life-and-death decisions through summary exclusion at the border. Our country has a proud tradition of protecting victims of persecution and serving as a beacon of hope and freedom. We need not and should not forsake it. This compromise Leahy amendment would give real refugees a fair opportunity to present their circumstances and seek asylum.  We do not have to turn our backs on America's traditional role as a refuge from oppression and resort to summary exclusion processes that the Washington Times, the Washington Post and the New York Times agreed are unwise and unnecessary.  I was pleased last week to appear with Bishop Murry from the National Conference of Catholic Bishops and Martin Kraar of the Council of Jewish Federations. They along with the American Bar Association and many others appreciate what this rewrite of our asylum laws by the bill would mean.  I want to recognize all those who have come forward to work with us to try to preserve the asylum process. Support has come from a wide variety of sources: The Committee to Preserve Asylum, UNITE, the American Jewish Committee, the National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium, the Lawyers' Committee for Human Rights, the U.S. Catholic Conference, the American Bar Association, the American Friends Service Committee, the American Immigration Lawyers Association, the Asian Law Caucus, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund, the Domestic and Foreign Missionary Society of the Protestant Episcopal Church, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, the United Church Board for World Ministries, the ACLU, the National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium, Amnesty International USA and the Women's Commission for Refugee Women and Children. I look forward to continuing our efforts and ultimately prevailing on these fundamental issues.  The bill fails to take into account the unfortunate but all too real circumstances that exist in repressive regimes around the world. Refugees flee by all sorts of means, including using false documents and escaping through third countries en route to the United States. The bill would punish asylum seekers who are afraid to apply to their government for proper travel documents and identification papers.  Raoul Wallenberg received international recognition for rescuing tens of thousands from Nazi persecution by issuing Swedish identity papers and arranging transport to Sweden. Oskar Schindler saved many lives by securing false documents and identities. As many as 10,000 Jews fled the Holocaust through Asia with the noble assistance of Chiune Sugihara, a Japanese diplomat who disobeyed his government and issued them visas. Do we really mean to disadvantage the claims of those who, like the beneficiaries of the courageous work of Oskar Schindler, Raoul Wallenberg and Chiune Sugihara during World War II, needed false travel documents? I hope not.  I am confident that consideration of asylum claims can take false documents into account without making them a barrier to full review. The asylum provisions in the bill would place undue burdens on unsophisticated refugees who are truly in need of sanctuary but may not be able to explain their situation to an overworked asylum officer. Had similar provisions been in place during World War II, those saved by Raoul Wallenberg, Oskar Schindler and Chiune Sugihara could have been summarily excluded because they used false documents to escape the Holocaust.  Refugees seeking asylum in the United States come to us for protection. Let us not turn them back. Let us not abandon America's vital place in the world as a leader for human rights.  I ask unanimous consent that following my statement there be printed in the Record letters from the UNHRC Lawyers Committee for Human Rights and law professors.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Branch            Office for the United States of America,                               Washington, DC, September 20, 1996.     Re Asylum and summary exclusion provisions of the immigration          bill (proposed conference report H2202).     Hon. Orrin Hatch,     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman Hatch: I am writing to you regarding the      draft Conference Report referenced above. In our previous      letter to you, we expressed our concerns regarding the      summary exclusion provisions of the prior House bill.      Although the Senate version included Senator Leahy's      amendment revising the Senate summary exclusion provision to      comport with international standards for adjudicating refugee      claims, we note that the proposed Conference Report does not      include these changes. Our Office continues to urge the      adoption of the Senate version of summary exclusion and      remains concerned that the proposed ``expedited removal''      provisions in the proposed Conference Report and several      other provisions, if enacted, would almost certainly result      in the US returning refugees to countries where their lives      or freedom would be threatened.       The following provisions of the proposed Conference Report,      outlined in greater detail below, are of particular concern      to our Office:       1. Expedited Removal (Section 302); (a) Examination at Port      of Entry; (b) ``Credible Fear'' Standard; (c) Detention; (d)      Administrative Review; and (e) Access to Counsel.       2. Numerical Limitation on Asylum Grants (Section 601).       3. Exceptions to Ability to Apply for Asylum (Section 604):      (a) Asylum Filing Deadlines; and (b) Safe Third Country.       4. Bars to Asylum and Withholding of Deportation for      Persons Convicted of Aggravated Felonies (Section 241(b) and      604).       5. Asylum Filing and Employment Authorization Fees (Section      604).       6. No Automatic Stay of Deportation pending Judicial Review      (Section 306).       1. Expedited Removal (Section 302)--This section allows the      expedited removal, without further hearing or review, of      certain ``applicants for admission.'' An ``applicant for      admission'' is defined as anyone in the US who entered      illegally or a person seeking entry. Section 302(b) would      permit an immigration officer to issue a final order of      removal for such applicants, if s/he determines that such      applicants have false documents or no documents, if; (1) They      cannot prove they have been in the US for the prior two-year      period of (2) they are arriving in the US and fail to      indicate an intention to apply for asylum or a fear of      persecution.       At a port of entry, those who indicate that they are      asylum-seekers but who are unable to establish a ``credible      fear'' of persecution to an asylum officer shall be similarly      removed. ``Credible fear'' of persecution is defined to mean      that ``there is a significant possibility, taking into      account the credibility of the statements made by the alien      in support of the alien's claim and such other facts as are      known to the officer, that the alien could establish      eligibility for asylum.'' Review of the credible fear      determination will be conducted by an immigration judge and      is to be concluded if possible within 24 hours and no later      than 7 days after the removal order. Prior to the credible      fear interview, asylum-seekers may consult a person or      persons of their choice, but any consultation must be at no      expense to the Government and must not ``unreasonably delay      the proceedings.''       UNHCR is concerned that this process fails to incorporate      international standards for refugee status determination. We      stress that the summary nature of the proceedings in the      proposed Conference Report is reflected in the lack of      appellate rights, and that, therefore, it is all the more      important that the initial examination and interview process      not be ``summary.'' We note our concerns below:       a. Examination at Port of Entry--``Screening'' of arrivals      in the US must be conducted with procedural safeguards in      place to ensure that refugees are not excluded. Section 302      fails to provide these safeguards. Special risks for refugees      are inherent in the expedited process as proposed by this      section, in which there is no review of an order to exclude.      All persons seeking entry must be given guidance as to the      procedure, orally and in writing, in a language they can      understand, before an initial examination so that they are      aware of the consequences of failing to come forward with      their asylum claim at that time. Although this section      provides     that information shall be given concerning an asylum      interview, it fails to provide for guidance at this critical      point. Given the dual role of the immigration officers      conducting the initial examinations (border enforcement and      selection of those who merit a credible fear determination),      they should have a list of questions designed to identify      asylum-seekers, as well as training in interviewing skills.      There must be meaningful review of all ``expedited removal''      orders, given the consequences of a mistaken decision.       b. ``Credible Fear'' Standard--UNHCR urges you and members      of the Committee to reject any provision that requires      asylum-seekers, before they are allowed the opportunity to      present their claims for asylum to an immigration judge, to      establish a ``credible fear'' of persecution, as defined      above. Such a requirement creates a new, heightened standard      which increases the likelihood that a refugee will be      returned to a country where his/her life or freedom would be      threatened, especially given the fact that review is      expedited, applicants are detained during this process, and      there is limited access to legal representation. UNHCR      recommends that asylum-seekers who establish that their      claims are not ``manifestly unfounded'' be accorded the      opportunity to present their asylum claims in a hearing      before an immigration judge. This provision comports with the      international standard for expeditious refugee status      determinations as set forth in UNHCR Executive Committee      Conclusion No. 30 (1983).\1\---------------------------------------------------------------------------     *Footnotes to appear at end of letter.---------------------------------------------------------------------------       Moreover, certain types of claimants, e.g., torture or      trauma victims and those with gender-related claims, will      have difficulty stating their claims, much less establishing      ``credible fear.'' Some at-risk groups, such as unaccompanied      minors, should not be subjected to summary procedures at all.      Others, with novel or complex claims, such as persons fleeing      situations of international or internal armed conflict, or      torture survivors who should be protected by the Convention      against Torture, should be provided with a full exclusion      hearing. These claimants are at great risk of being returned      to persecution if they must meet the heightened standard      created by the expedited removal provisions.       c. Detention--This provision also mandates that an      applicant who has been determined to have a credible fear of      persecution remain in detention for further consideration of      the application for asylum. In the view of the hardship that      it involves, as noted in UNHCR Executive Committee Conclusion      No. 44, detention should normally be avoided, particularly      when the elements on which the asylum claim is based have      been determined. Asylum-seekers who have met this heightened      standard should be released pending further consideration of      their claims.       d. Administrative Review--In the proposed Conference      Report, the provision for review of a negative ``credible      fear'' determination and expedited removal order requires      that the immigration judge conduct the review ``as      expeditiously as possible,'' and recommends it be concluded      within 24 hours. Moreover, this review may be conducted      telephonically or by video, inadequate methods when      credibility is at issue. Minimum procedural guidelines for      refugee status determinations, as set forth in UNHCR      Executive Committee Conclusion No. 8 (1977) specify that an      applicant should be given a reasonable time to appeal for a      formal reconsideration of the decision. These procedures do      not comport with the guidelines noted above.       e. Access to Counsel--The Proposed Conference Report      permits an asylum-seeker to consult with a person of his or      her choosing, at no cost to the Government and as long as      such consultation does not ``unreasonably'' delay the      proceedings. These limitations to consultation in the context      of an expedited removal process should be consistent with      guidelines that asylum-seekers be given the necessary      facilities for submitting their claims to the authorities,      including meaningful access to counsel and to the services of      a competent interpreter and the opportunity to contact a      representative of UNHCR. These factors, set forth in UNHCR      Executive Committee Conclusion No. 8 (1977), should be taken      into consideration in assessing whether a delay is      ``unreasonable.''       2. Numerical Limitation on Asylum Grants (Section 601)--     This section, which expands the definition of refugee to      include persons who have been subjected to or who have a      well-founded fear of coercive population control methods,      limits to 1000 per year the number of individuals who may be      admitted to the US as refugees or granted asylum under this      expanded definition. By placing a numerical limitation on      this category of asylum-seekers, the Attorney General may      return an individual to a country where his or her life or      freedom would be threatened merely because the numerical      limit has been reached. Such an action would place the US in      violation of its obligations under the 1967 Protocol.       3. Exceptions to Ability to Apply for Asylum (Section      604)--This section creates certain bars to the application      for asylum. Moreover, there is no judicial review of a      decision to bar an application under the following      provisions.       a. Asylum Filing Deadlines--A time limit for filing an      application has been included, which, if not met, bars      individuals from seeking asylum. Individuals may not apply      unless they demonstrate by clear an convincing evidence that      the application has been filed within one year after the date      of the person's arrival in the US, unless they demonstrate to      the satisfaction of the Attorney General either (a) the      existence of changed country conditions which materially      affect the person's eligibility for asylum or (b)      extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing      within one year.       UNHCR recommends that these deadlines be deleted. Failure      to submit an asylum request within a certain time limit      should not lead to an asylum request being excluded from      consideration, as outlined in UNHCR Executive Committee      Conclusion No. 15 (1979). The United States is obliged to      protect refugees from return to danger regardless of whether      a filing deadline has been met. There are a number of      legitimate reasons why asylum-seekers would not be aware of      or able to comply with a deadline for submitting      applications, such as lack of information about the asylum      process, preoccupation with meeting basic survival needs,      inability to communicate in English, and insufficient      resources for obtaining counsel.       b. Safe Third Country--Individuals may not apply for asylum      or may have their asylee status terminated if the Attorney      General determines that they may be removed, pursuant to a      bilateral or multilateral agreement, to a country (other than      their country of nationality (or last habitual residence if      no nationality)) in which their lives or freedom would not be      threatened on account of one of the five grounds and where      they would have access to a full and fair procedure for      determining a claim to asylum or equivalent temporary      protection, unless the Attorney General finds that it is      in the public interest for the person to receive asylum in      the U.S. UNHCR recommends that these provisions be deleted      or modified in light of international guidelines, the      wider context of global responsibilities for refugee      protection, and principles of international      responsibility-sharing. Moreover, these provisions appear      to authorize the denial of the right to apply for asylum      to certain nationalities or groups. These provisions also      authorize the sending of an asylum-seeker or asylee to a      country in which she might suffer forms of persecution not      rising to the level of a threat to life or freedom. While      no universally accepted definition of ``persecution'' has      been adopted by the international community, it is widely      accepted that other serious violations of human rights, in      addition to threats to life or freedom, constitute      persecution when linked to race, religion, nationality,      membership of a particular social group or political      opinion. Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for      Determining Refugee Status (Geneva 1988) (hereinafter      Handbook) at para. 51.       4. Asylum and Withholding of Deportation for Persons      Convicted of Aggravated Felonies (Sections 241(b), 604)--     Section 241(b) bars the removal of refugees to countries      where their lives or freedom would be threatened and codifies      the exceptions to this bar, most of which are exceptions      currently found in INS regulations. This section codifies the      provision that refugees who have been convicted of an      ``aggravated felony (or felonies)'' for which the sentence to      imprisonment is at least five years shall be considered to      have committed a particularly serious crime and will not be      protected from removal.       Section 604 broadens the definition of ``aggravated      felony'' to include a much greater number of crimes than      previously were in this category. It would include, for      example, certain crimes for which a term of imprisonment      imposed is one year (previously this was five years). It also      codifies current regulations that bar a grant of asylum to      individuals who have been convicted of a particularly serious      crime and provide that a conviction of an aggravated felony      shall be considered to be a conviction of a particularly      serious crime. This section also allows the Attorney General      to designate by regulation offenses that will be considered      to be particularly serious crimes or serious non-political      crimes, permitting further expansion of the categories of      crimes that would bar a grant of asylum.       These sections, therefore, bar individuals from the      protection of non-refoulement\2\ if they have been convicted      of an ``aggravated felony'' for which the sentence imposed is      at least five years, and bar individuals with a well-founded      fear of persecution from the protection of asylum regardless      of the sentence imposed. Article 33 of the 1951 Convention      relating to the Status of Refugees, binding on the US through      its incorporation into the 1967 Protocol, requires that      before returning a person fearing a threat to life or freedom      in his or her country of origin, the country concerned must      make a case-by-case determination whether the person has been      convicted of a particularly serious crime and constitutes a      danger to the community.       Under current law, the recently enacted Antiterrorism and      Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), the Attorney General, in      her discretion, may grant withholding of deportation to      ensure compliance with the 1967 Protocol. It appears that      this provision may no longer be in effect if the proposed      Conference Report becomes law. It is our opinion that the      waiver in AEDPA should still be available and that it permits      the Attorney General to conduct case-by-case determinations      in the cases of individuals who have been convicted of an      ``aggravated felony'' to determine whether the crime is a      particularly serious crime and whether the individual is The      ``particularly serious crime'' exclusion ground should only      be invoked in     ``extreme cases'' and only after a balancing test has been      applied, weighing the degree of persecution feared against      the seriousness of the offense committed. These principles      are set forth in our Handbook at paras. 154 and 156. The need      for a balancing test is even more urgent in light of the      proposed provisions expanding the definition of ``aggravated      felony'' to include many crimes for which the sentence      imposed is one year, and giving the Attorney General the      power to designate other offenses as ``aggravated felonies.''       5. Asylum Filing and Employment Authorization Fees (Section      604)--This section permits the Attorney General to impose a      fee for applications for asylum and employment authorization.      UNHCR is concerned that any fee imposed for filing an asylum      application may have the unintended effect of discouraging      refugees from realizing their fundamental right to seek and      enjoy asylum. UNHCR's Executive Committee in Conclusion No. 5      (1977) ``appealed to Governments to follow, or to continue to      follow, liberal practices in granting permanent or at least      temporary asylum to refugee. . .'' UNHCR is particularly      concerned about the precedent that the imposition of a fee      will set for the international community.       Likewise, UNHCR is concerned about the imposition of a fee      for employment authorization, UNHCR Executive Committee      Conclusion No. 22 (1981) states that asylum-seekers ``should      receive all necessary assistance and be provided with the      basic necessities of life, including food, shelter, and basic      sanitary and health facilities.'' Under current law, asylum-     seekers are not eligible for employment authorization unless      their claim has been pending for over 180 days. UNHCR urges      that a fee not be imposed, especially in light of the fact      that asylum-seekers are not eligible for benefits which      satisfy the basic necessities of life.       6. Stay of Deportation Pending Judicial Review (Section      306)--This section eliminates the automatic stay of      deportation to individuals, including asylum seekers, who      have been issued an order of removal by an immigration judge      and appeal this decision to a federal appeals court. UNHCR      urges the US to preserve the automatic stay of deportation      for asylum-seekers in order to ensure compliance with minimum      procedural safeguards. UNHCR Executive Committee Conclusion      No. 8(1977) provides that asylum applicants ``should . . . be      permitted to remain in the country while an appeal. . .to the      courts is pending.       Your consideration of UNHCR's views is greatly appreciated.      Please do not hesitate to contact me if I may provide      additional information or assistance to you, your Committee      members or other members of Congress.           Sincerely,                                            Anne Willem Bijleveld,                                                   Representative.

Dear Senator Leahy: We write to urge you to vote against      H.R. 2202, the pending immigration bill, which we understand      will soon come before you for a vote. The bill is      fundamentally flawed in that it seeks to restrict the rights      of refugees in the context of efforts designed to control      illegal immigration. H.R. 2202 contains extreme measures that      will severely impair the internationally-recognized right of      refugees to seek and enjoy asylum. If the bill is passed, it      will transform U.S. law from a system designed to protect      victims of persecution to a system designed to punish them.       H.R. 2202 contains numerous provisions that would threaten      the lives of refugees. Some of these provisions were examined      and rejected by the Senate; others were never even      considered. In particular, H.R. 2202 would: 1) summarily      exclude, without meaningful access to counsel or review,      asylum-seekers who arrive in the United States without proper      travel documents; and 2) apply a strict deadline on the      filing of all asylum applications. In our extensive      experience representing asylum-seekers, we have seen first      hand the many barriers--language, fear for family members,      post-traumatic stress disorder--a refugee must overcome in      order to apply for and gain safe haven. Blanket summary      exclusion and strict time deadlines for filing asylum      applications are hurdles that many of the most deserving      refugees simply will not be able to cross. Enacting H.R. 2202      will, without question, result in victims of torture, rape      and other extreme forms of persecution being denied      protection. This violates not only our international treaty      obligations, but our commitment as a nation to protect the      rights of the persecuted. We urge you to do all you can to      prevent it.           Sincerely,     Elisa Massimino.     Michael Posner.                                                                    ____                                               September 17, 1996.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     Russell Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: I, like many Americans, am deeply      concerned about the proposed restrictions on political asylum      contained in the immigration bill now before Congress. Of      particular concern to me are two provisions: a filing      deadline on asylum applications and summary exclusion      procedures.       As a member of the Board of Directors of the Lawyers      Committee for Human Rights, I have had the unique opportunity      to meet and speak with clients of the Committee's pro bono      Asylum Representation Program. Asylum seekers are people who      must flee from danger in their homelands to safer, more      politically stable countries. They are men, women and      children, doctors, journalists, students and others from all      walks of life who are persecuted in their homelands for      religious or political beliefs, ethnicity or race. Some flee      to Europe, South America, or Asia; others to the United      States. The right of a refugee to seek protection from      persecution was incorporated into U.S. law in the Refugee Act      of 1980 and is guaranteed under the U.N. Convention Relating      to the Status of Refugees. Last year, the U.S. granted asylum      to fewer than 8,000 individuals, representing less than one      percent of asylum seekers worldwide.       In the following pages, you will hear the personal stories      of six asylum seekers and you will see how the proposed      restrictions would have irrevocably and tragically changed      the course of their lives. These asylees came to the Lawyers      Committee, where they were represented before the INS by      volunteer attorneys. The staff and volunteers of the      Committee know the obstacles asylum seekers face--the trauma      experienced by torture victims, the concern for the safety of      family members back home, the disorientation of a new culture      and a new language. The Committee also has analyzed hundreds      of asylum cases to study the potential effects of the      proposed restrictions. Both their findings and experience      clearly show that, if enacted, a strict filing deadline and      summary exclusion procedures will force genuine refugees back      to their homelands to face persecution, torture and perhaps      death.       The United States has long been a symbol of freedom,      opportunity and hope for refugees fleeing Nazi Germany, war-     torn Rwanda, and other ravaged states. Let us defend this      legacy and preserve a refugee's right to seek protection and      safety. The proposed restrictions would not only violate our      international treaty obligations but would betray our      nation's commitment to respect basic human rights.           Sincerely,     Sigourney Weaver.                                                                    ____                                                    July 29, 1996.       Dear Conferee: We, the undersigned professors of law, are      writing to express our concerns about provisions in the      pending immigration legislation that would eliminate or      severely curtail judicial review. Efficiency in the      enforcement of our nation's laws is important, but this goal      is not well served by enacting legislation that has      potentially serious constitutional problems.       Proposals are now pending in Congress that would radically      reduce and, in some cases, eliminate the most fundamental      safeguard of judicial review in individual cases and judicial      oversight over the deportation process as a whole. These      proposals, like the recently enacted antiterrorism law, are      exceptional in their scope and threaten basic principles upon      which our legal system is founded.       The House-passed immigration bill, like the antiterrorism      law which, unless repealed in the pending immigration      legislation, bars judicial review of deportation orders based      on certain nonterrorism grounds, establishes a summary      exclusion provision where an immigration officer would have      final unreviewable authority to exclude and deport      international travelers and asylum seekers, and strips the      federal courts of jurisdiction to review any individual claim      or class action challenges arising from these procedures.      Additionally, the House-passed bill provides that ``no court      shall have jurisdiction'' to review certain waiver decisions      of the Attorney General, and limits injunctive relief with      regard to certain provisions ``regardless of the nature (of      the action or claim or of the identity of the parties      bringing the action.)'' The Senate-passed immigration bill      denies judicial review of Attorney General denials of      discretionary relief and orders of deportation based on      criminal convictions.       These proposals grant agency authority to take      constitutionally questionable action and raise issues of      constitutional dimensions wholly apart from the immigration      context and the rights of immigrants. The most basic      safeguards of due process are threatened, along with the      elimination of a meaningful role for the judiciary to perform      its historic function of reviewing the implementation and      execution of law. The proposals also implicate the separation      of powers structure of our government by undermining the      judicial roles to protect due process and safeguard      individual rights and to review the actions of     the Executive Branch. Congress cannot exercise its power in a      way that deprives any person of life, liberty or property      without due process of law.       Moreover, we believe that these legislative proposals are      not premised on any study or empirical data demonstrating a      need to eliminate a process that affords full and fair      hearings with administrative and judicial review. The federal      judiciary plays an essential role in this scheme,      interpreting the laws and ensuring that the executive branch      complies with them. The process of judicial review helps      insure that administrative officers implement the laws in a      manner consistent with the intent of Congress.       We believe the proposals in the legislation are of dubious      constitutionality and imprudent as a matter of public policy.      Congress should take this opportunity to correct the defects      in the antiterrorism law and preserve our constitutional      traditions           Sincerely,       (Institutional affiliations are shown for purposes of      identification only)         Anna Williams Shavers, University of Nebraska College of            Law; Bruce Ackerman, Sterling Professor of Law and            Political Science, Yale Law School; Harry H.
