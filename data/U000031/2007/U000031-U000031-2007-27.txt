Lipinski and Ms. Harman. We are seeing efforts move. And we've learned already that if everyone did this across the country, we would save 65 billion kilowatts of energy, which is the equivalent of 80 coal-fired plants. Obviously this is something we want the Federal Government to do.  I compliment Chairman Obey and Ranking Member Lewis on the floor for allowing us to proceed without a lot of debate, knowing that we have strong support for this. I look forward to having this adopted.
