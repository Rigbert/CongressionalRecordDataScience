President, this morning the Senate will immediately begin a cloture vote on the committee amendment to the ISTEA legislation. It is the leader's hope that cloture will be invoked. Let me repeat that. It is the leader's hope that cloture will be invoked and the Senate will be able to consider and dispose of highway-related amendments. If cloture is not invoked, the Senate may consider any available appropriations conference reports--possibly the Interior conference report. Therefore, additional votes may occur during today's session.  As always, all Members will be notified as additional schedule information becomes available in regard to votes today, and the leader will update all Senators later today as to the schedule for Monday's session.                          ____________________
