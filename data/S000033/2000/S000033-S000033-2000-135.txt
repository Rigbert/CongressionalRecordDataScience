 Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding work done by participants in my Student Congressional Town Meeting held this summer. These participants were part of a group of high school students from around Vermont who testified about the concerns they have as teenagers, and about what they would like to see the government do regarding these concerns.  I submit these statements in the Congressional Record, as I believe that the views of these young persons will benefit my colleagues.          Hon. Bernard Sanders in the House of Representatives on behalf of HEATHER MOYLAN, GEORGE (BUD) VANA, IV and MATTHEW JENNESS    Regarding GENDER REQUIREMENT IN AFFIRMATIVE ACTION--May 26, 2000       HEATHER MOYLAN: Today we would like to propose that new      legislation be introduced regarding gender equity,      legislation that would repeal any sections of affirmative      action that make reference to gender in the workplace.      Affirmative action is defined as actions taken to provide      equal opportunities as an admission for employment for      minority groups or women.       Traditionally society has dominated by the male gender.      Today, however, advancements have been made for women in      regards to jobs, sports and education. Affirmative action      legislation and its close cousin, Title 9 have had a lot of      important and beneficial progress for women in all of their      endeavors. In most cases quality is already a reality.      Statistics show in some cases there is a female advantage and      of course there is still progress to be made. The legislation      and enforcement by the government, once crucial, has run its      course. The American people have become accustomed to gender      equality.       States have created their own legislation. Institutions and      public and private sectors have their own regulations, and in      summary the law has done all that it can do. The danger now      exists that the law may be abused with so-called reverse      discrimination suits.       MATTHEW JENNESS: Last night I went out and I found      information to back this up; with looking at the job rate      between male and female and I found that the participation      rate percentage was in 1948, 32 percent female and 86.9      percent male. In 1979, 50 percent female and 78 percent male,      and in this year, 2000, 75 percent male and 60 percent      female. So from that I figure that a 60 percent--there is a      pretty good margin there, it is close, and the ten percent      may be people who chose to be--females choosing to take      traditional roles in the family.       GEORGE VANA, IV: I get to show you some stuff, I guess. Now      this is a graph of high school attendance percentage. These      are 14- and 15-year-olds. This right here is the male bar and      that represents 80.2 percent attendance and this represents      female attendance which is 85.6 percent, and this is I guess      preliminary to what we are getting to here.       CONGRESSMAN SANDERS: So that chart shows there are more      girls in high school than boys.       GEORGE VANA, IV: This is college enrollment and it is the      same trend basically. 41.7 percent of 18- and 19-year-old      males attend college, and I guess it is 51.3 percent of      females, age 18 to 19 years old attend college. These are      based on the United States Census Bureau. And then we are      also going to look at male versus female education      accomplishments, and you can see here that education      attainment which basically signifies some degree of some sort      is much, much higher nowadays within females. These are      numbers in the thousands, 46,888,000 females now attain      higher educational status compared to 29,343,000 males. And      current college enrollment, also in the millions, is we have      about 6,905,000 males in college right now as opposed to      8,641,000 females, so a gap exists now I guess and that would      almost be in favor of females where affirmative action      legislation many years ago served to increase these numbers.                                  ____          Hon. Bernard Sanders in the House of Representatives      on behalf of FALINDA HOUGH, DANIELLE MORGAN and WENDY PRATT            Regarding HOUSING FOR TEEN MOTHERS--May 26, 2000       WENDY PRATT: My name is Wendy and we are teen moms, young      mothers who have a lot of problems with housing, and we would      like it if we had a program for us to work through to get      help with getting housing for     us. Our school put together a program called Independence and      it is for single mothers with one child and I have a child      and a child on the way, so that is not a program that I can      link, go through because I am going to have two children, and      it is just so hard for me to find someplace to stay.       DANIELLE MORGAN: I am 16 and I have an eleven-month-old      son. I live at my mother's house which includes me and my      son, my mother, my six-year-old little brother and my      stepfather, and that is somewhere that I really do not want      to be right now because one thing is that it is hard to      parent when you are also being parented. I can not do what I      want with my son because my parents are interfering with      that. And I have been told that because of past college      students and just younger people that rented apartments in      Burlington, they wrecked the apartments, we are not allowed      to do that anymore and I feel that is unfair to me and my      friends and whoever else is going through the same things I      am going through because I feel that I deserve my own space      for me and my child.       There is the Lund Home and I have lived there, I lived      there when I was pregnant, and I feel that is a very good      program. But then when you leave there, there are some people      that are ready for something more. And I will be 17 in August      and I feel like I could have my own apartment and my own      space to live in. I thank Lund is for a beginning process for      people that need to learn more things, but I have already      been there and now I am stuck. I have nowhere else to go.       FALINDA HOUGH: Actually I am in the same situation as      Danielle. It is hard to live in your house where you are also      being parented and your parents are trying to tell you how to      raise your kid. And there should be other opportunities for      us as far as the Lund Center, but you cannot go there if you      have two children, so it is hard for other people to go      there. And there should be more housing for us where we can      live.                                  ____                                            Hon. Bernard Sanders in the House of Representatives           on behalf of PAULA DUFRESNE and KATHLEEN SHEVCHIK             Regarding DATE/ACQUAINTANCE RAPE--May 26, 2000       KATHLEEN SHEVCHIK: Good morning, Congressman Sanders,      fellow students and those attending this event.       Today we come before you to express our concern about a      crisis: date and acquaintance rape. After researching in      depth about date and acquaintance rape, we feel a definite      need for change in the near future. In out society there      needs to be more awareness and knowledge available for      students. There are many factors leading to rape whether it      is alcohol, drugs or even Rapinol slipped into a drink, this      is a serious problem needing a definite solution.       Acquaintance rape is defined as any non-consensual sexual      activity between two or more people who know each other. Here      are some facts. 60 percent of all rape victims know their      assailants, but 92 percent of adolescent rape victims know      their assailants. On college campuses one in every four women      is a victim of rape. 84 percent of these women knew their      assailant and 57 percent of those rapes happened on a date.       Congressman Sanders, I will enroll as a freshman next year      in college, and after this research I am scared that I could      be another statistic. Date rape is about power and control,      not romance and passion. Many women think it could never      happen to them, but they are simply not educated enough on      this issue.       What we are proposing today is the need for schools to      provide more education on date and acquaintance rape. Women      need to become more aware of their surroundings and      situations that lead to rape. Men must be portrayed as a part      of the solution, not just the source of the problem.       PAULA DUFRESNE: We think there should be an educational      program nationwide. This program should inform both men and      women on all aspects of date rape. We feel this program      should be attended twice; once entering high school and once      entering college. We feel that this program should have group      discussions about when sexual activity is considered rape,      how to be more assertive, and to realize that no always means      no. There should also be the victims of date rape and even      possibly their assailants. This program would create more      awareness to everyone. It would bring so much positive to      schools and even to individuals. The knowledge should be      given out before the students have to use it. We strongly      believe that no action will only insure that an unacceptable      situation remains unchanged. In conclusion, we will leave you      with the words of Katie Ripley, a college student who wrote      The Morning After, Sex, Fear and Feminism on Campuses.      ``Today's definition of rape has stretched beyond bruises to      threats of death or violence to involve emotional pressure      and the influence of alcohol.''                               ____________________
