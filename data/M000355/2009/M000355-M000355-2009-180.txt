 President, again, the two consent agreements have a universe of six amendments on my friend's side and eight on our side. We are willing to agree to short time agreements on each amendment. I am fairly confident in saying it would not take much more floor time, if any, to pursue the underlying bill, which almost everyone supports, in a form that would encompass the opportunity to offer eight amendments.  With that, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to immediate consideration of H.R. 3548, which was received from the House, and that the following amendments be the only amendments in order:  Reid-Baucus substitute; Baucus side-by-side amendment for housing tax credit; Isakson-Dodd, home buyer tax credit; Johanns, alternative substitute; Vitter, ACORN; Bennett-Thune, TARP sunset; Corker-Warner, TARP; Sessions, E-Verify; Bunning, operating losses.  I further ask unanimous consent that following the disposition of the above-listed amendments, the bill, as amended, be read the third time, and the Senate proceed to a vote on passage.
