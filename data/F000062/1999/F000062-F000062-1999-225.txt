 President, the modification I have sent to the desk changes the penalty, and I will explain that in a moment.  The amendment, as I have just described it, would require persons who ship alcoholic beverages across State lines to: First, clearly and prominently label the contents as alcoholic beverages; second, state the full name of the person causing the package to be shipped; i.e., the seller; and third, state that an adult's signature is required. It would require the shippers--for example, Federal Express--to not deliver a package so labeled unless they can: One, verify that the person receiving the delivery is of legal age for purchasing alcoholic beverages; and, two, obtain that person's signature.  Mr. President, the amendment I sent to the desk to modify would simply provide that existing penalties would apply to this bill. Those are criminal penalties of up to 1 year imprisonment and fines of up to $200,000 for organizations or $100,000 for individuals. A seller who violates this requirement on three or more occasions may have their ATF basic permit revoked. That is the effect of the law today, and we would repeat that penalty in this particular instance.  I thank the Chair.
