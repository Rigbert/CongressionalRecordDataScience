Speaker, at a time when crime concerns are on every citizen's mind, those who have dedicated their lives to law enforcement are to be commended. I would like to make a special commendation to Sergeant Thomas J. Shanley, a devoted law enforcement officer from Indiana's First Congressional District. Sergeant Shanley retired from the Schererville Police Department in September of this year after 21\1/2\ years of dedicated service. Sergeant Shanley will be honored by his family, friends, and members of the Schererville Police Department at a testimonial dinner Friday, November 12, 1999 at Teibel's Restaurant in Schererville, Indiana.  Thomas Shanley joined the Schererville Police Department on February 28, 1978 and graduated from the 51st class of the Indiana Law Enforcement Academy in July of 1978. He began his duties at the Schererville Police Department in the Patrol Division where in February of 1980 he was promoted to 1st Class Patrolman. Five years later he was promoted to the rank of Corporal and in 1989 was promoted to Sergeant. During his career with the Schererville Police Department, Sergeant Shanley served as a Certified firearms Instructor, an Instructor for the citizens Policy Academy, Coordinator for the Field training program, and Coordinator for the Department Training program. He was most recently elected President of Training Coordinators for the Northwest Indiana Law Enforcement Training Center.  While Sergeant Shanley has dedicated considerable time and energy to his work with the Schererville Police Department, he has never limited the time he gives to his most important interest, his family. He and his wife Kathryn have one son, Patrick, age 10.  On this special day, I offer my heartfelt congratulations to Sergeant Shanley. His large circle of family and friends can be proud of the contributions this prominent individual has made to the law enforcement community and the First Congressional District of Indiana.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in commending Sergeant Thomas Shanley for his lifetime of service and dedication to the people of Northwest Indiana and the citizens of the United States. Sergeant Shanley can be proud of his service to Indiana's First Congressional district. He worked hard to make the Town of Schererville a safer place in which to live and work. I sincerely wish him a long, happy, healthy, and productive retirement.                          ____________________
