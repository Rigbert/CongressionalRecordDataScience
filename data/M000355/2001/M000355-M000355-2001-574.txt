 The deal will allow the President's top agenda items to be center stage prior to a discussion on campaign and election reform. And I agree that we will all work to keep the debate focused on these issues and that a wrap-around amendment would be a show of bad faith.  We may disagree on the public's interest in campaign reform, but I think that we can all certainly agree that there is a true public demand for election reform and political reform. The upcoming debate will in many respects be the equivalent of a bill mark-up on the Senate floor. I think we all agree that there should be a full opportunity for everyone who wants to offer an amendment to be allowed to do so and to get a vote on that amendment without any games played by either side. So I want to thank the majority leader and my colleague from Arizona for their willingness to ensure that an open and robust debate will occur on this matter. I also appreciate the willingness of my colleague from Arizona to work with the majority leader to ensure that no vote on final passage occur until all amendments are voted on. I, too, believe that this is a fair agreement and again, I congratulate the leader and the Senator from Arizona.                          ____________________
