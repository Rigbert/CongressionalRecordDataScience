President, this morning the Senate briefly debated and tabled the Feinstein amendment No. 27 to S. 420, the bankruptcy reform bill. I was unable to make that vote this morning, but I did want to make a brief statement for the record to register my opposition to the amendment. Under the Feinstein amendment, credit card companies would be forced to limit the debt a minor can carry on a credit card to $2,500, unless the minor demonstrates a means to pay back the debt or a parent cosigns for the debt. I oppose this amendment as unnecessary government intervention in the marketplace. Washington has no place in limiting or determining the financial needs of students and their ability to repay loans. The government has an abysmal track record when it meddles in the marketplace, and I strongly believe that these decisions should be made by individuals and families, not by the federal government.
