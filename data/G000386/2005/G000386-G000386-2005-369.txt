 President, I thank the Senator from Arkansas for her kind remarks. As I explained, because things have to be compromised in order to get anything done here, it tends to be the majority party's responsibility to move along reconciliation. In that vein, I am somewhat different from the Senator from Arkansas, even though I have sympathy and even though I have spoken in support of it and even though I have worked with Senator Baucus on what she wants to accomplish.  So momentarily and throughout this reconciliation bill I have to oppose the amendment by my friend and colleague from Arkansas.  We, of course, Mr. President, were all deeply moved by many of the stories that we have heard on the floor, particularly the stories that the senior Senator from Louisiana tells us about. And it is not only her State but Mississippi and Alabama, stories about people who have lost everything--their homes, their jobs, and, worst of all, more than 1,000 people have died. I am keenly aware that those who have suffered the most are our most vulnerable citizens: the infirm, the displaced, the disabled, and families on welfare. Our hearts go out, as well, to all the others who have suffered so much as a result of this terrible disaster.  I understand the need to act, and my colleague, Senator Baucus, and I came together very quickly--now I think 2 months ago almost--well, at least 6 weeks ago--very quickly, in a bipartisan way, in response to my own leader's desire that we move very quickly to respond to this, as he had a news conference the Wednesday after Labor Day, on behalf of those most vulnerable individuals and families who have suffered so greatly.  You know that it is a priority for me to assist those affected by Hurricane Katrina, and I think Senator Baucus and I came up with a very good package, and I remain committed to it.
