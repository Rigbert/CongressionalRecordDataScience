Speaker, today, I am joined by our colleague, Representative Charlie Stenholm, in introducing the Balanced Budget Enforcement Act of 1997. This legislation, which was originally introduced by former chairman of the Budget Committee, Leon Panetta, would put in place tough, new measures to reform the budget process and eliminate the Federal budget deficit by the year 2002.  It would do so by using a unique combination of an annual cap on appropriations, reconciliation, and sequestration, to pressure the President and the Congress to achieve annual deficit reduction goals, resulting in a balanced budget in 2002 and each year thereafter. Unlike similar pieces of legislation designed to produce a balanced budget, the Balanced Budget Enforcement Act contains no loopholes, and is designed to reward committees which meet their deficit-reduction responsibilities. A more detailed summary of the legislation appears after these remarks.  Like many of my colleagues, I am extremely concerned that we have failed to plan for this Nation's future and that we are about to saddle our children and our grandchildren with debts that they cannot possibly hope to pay. While we have made some progress in bringing the deficit under control over the past several years, the fact remains that in fiscal year (FY) 1996, the Federal Government spent $107 billion more than it took in. What's more, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that under current law, the deficit will begin rising again this year, climbing back to $278 billion by Fiscal Year 2007. The Balanced Budget Enforcement Act of 1997 would stop this destructive trend, and set us on the path to a budget that is truly balanced by 2002.  In closing, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this important legislation. The sooner we begin a serious effort to balance the budget, the better off our children and grandchildren will be.

The Board must choose either      CBO's or OMB's estimates of how much deficit reduction is      needed in that Session. The Board's choice would be binding      on the President and Congress, so that the deficit reduction      requirement for each would be identical. Finally, the Board      would meet again after adjournment to pick either CBO's or      OMB's estimates of how much deficit reduction was actually      accomplished by Congress during the Session.       (3) Requirement of President to Submit Balanced Budget: The      President must propose a budget that will reach balance by      2002. Further, the President's budget must use the      assumptions chosen by the Board of Estimates, meet all      discretionary caps and entitlement/revenue deficit reduction      targets, and achieve balance in 2002 and each year      thereafter, and be voted on by Congress.       (4) Requirement of Budget Committees to Report Balanced      Budget: Likewise, the congressional budget resolution must      lay out a plan to reach balance by 2002. In addition, budget      resolutions must use the estimating assumptions chosen by the      Board of Estimates, meet all discretionary caps and      entitlement/revenue deficit reduction targets, and achieve      balance by 2002 and each year thereafter.       (5) Enforcement: A. Discretionary savings--Appropriations.      The discretionary savings will be achieved by keeping      appropriations bills within an annual cap, and enforced by      across-the-board sequestrations of discretionary programs.       B. Entitlement/revenue savings--Reconciliation. The      entitlement/revenue deficit reduction priorities will be set      through the annual budget process. The budget resolution      (conference agreement) will include a reconciliation      directive targeting by committee the dollar amount of deficit      reduction to be achieved from entitlements and/or revenue and      will generate a ``spin-off bill'' (to be sent to the      President) putting those targets into law.       C. Sequestration--Overall reconciliation requirements will      be enforced by sequestration; the type of sequestration in      any year depends on whether a spin-off bill has been enacted.       (1) Targeted sequestration to enforce reconciliation:      (applies if a spin-off bill has been enacted, either as a      result of a budget resolution or, later, as a title in a      reconciliation bill). If a committee misses its entitlement      target, entitlement programs within that committee's      jurisdiction will be sequestered by a uniform percentage to      meet the target. If revenues do not meet the revenue target,      a uniform personal and corporate surtax will be imposed to      meet the target.       (2) Comprehensive sequestration: (applies if a spin-off      bill has not been enacted; this would generally occur if the      President first vetoes the spin-off bill, then vetoes a      reconciliation bill containing the committee targets). There      will be a comprehensive sequestration of entitlement spending      and some revenue provisions in the amount needed to hit the      overall target for entitlement/revenue deficit reduction. For      revenues, a surtax would be imposed upon personal annual      incomes greater than $250,000 and corporate incomes over $10      million. This formula will produce $4 in entitlement spending      cuts for every $1 in revenue increases.       (6) Tax cuts/Investment: Tax cuts and/or investment      policies can be enacted if they are paid for.                          ____________________
