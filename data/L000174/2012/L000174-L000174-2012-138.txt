President, I will vote for this resolution which reaffirms current U.S. policy towards Iran.  In doing so, I want to emphasize that it is my understanding that this Resolution, which is non-binding, is in no way intended by its sponsors to endorse, authorize, or otherwise encourage the use of military force against Iran.  Secretary of Defense Panetta, Secretary of State Clinton, former Secretary of Defense Gates, and other top Pentagon officials have strongly advised against the use of pre-emptive military force. They said it would, at best, only temporarily halt Iran's nuclear program, it would drive their program further underground, and it could ignite a wider war in the Middle East that could spin out of control.  I am as concerned as anyone about Iran. But while this Resolution reaffirms that concern, that is the extent of what it does. The policy of the Administration, and of our allies is to support sanctions, to use diplomacy, to resort to military force only if all other options fail. This Resolution does not change that.
