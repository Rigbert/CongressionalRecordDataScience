Mr. Chairman, I want to thank my friend and colleague for yielding time to me.  Mr. Chairman, this is a bad amendment. We do not need it. English is the predominant and common language of this Nation. English is used in government and courts throughout Puerto Rico. We must encourage everyone to speak English, but we must not discriminate against those who speak other languages.  Puerto Ricans are citizens of the United States. We must not deny the people of Puerto Rico their heritage. They contribute to the diversity and richness of our country. This amendment will make government more difficult. It will make communication more difficult.  Mr. Chairman, we should encourage everyone to learn English, but we should not deny Spanish-speaking Americans their tradition. English is the primary language of our Nation. In almost every corner of the world English is the language of international affairs, of international politics and business. We do not need this amendment. This amendment tells our citizens, deny your heritage, forget your roots. That is the wrong message for a great Nation, for a great people, a proud people to send.  Let us embrace diversity and learn from each other. This is how we have grown and prospered as a great Nation and a great people. I urge all of my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, to vote no on the Solomon amendment.
