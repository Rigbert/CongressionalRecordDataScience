President, I am pleased to support the Biden/Lugar amendment that restores the full amount of the President's request for the international affairs budget.  While American military engagement overseas is at an all time high, the strength of our ideas, diplomacy, generosity, and values is at an all time low.  For example, America's lead development agency, the U.S. Agency for International Development, at one point in its history had more than 5000 full time foreign service officers working on health, education, agricultural, and political development around the world.  Yet today, while engaged in a global war of ideas and values, USAID has only 1000 foreign service officers. Its budget in real dollars has been cut by 27 percent from a high in the 1980s.  Similarly, the Peace Corps, one of our most successful programs at both sharing American values and assistance while also exposing our young people to the peoples and cultures of other worlds, has seen its budget in real dollars cut by almost 40 percent since its inception in 1967.  At a time when more and more failed states are in need of international peacekeeping missions, the United States is more than $700 million in arrears in U.N. peacekeeping dues.  Tragically, we have all become more aware of what dangers failed states pose and what misery they bring to their own people.  These stark shortcomings in American nonmilitary engagement overseas--our smart power--not only threaten our own security, but also who we are as a nation and how we are viewed abroad.  Defense Secretary Gates and many former military officers have spoken publicly about the need for a greater emphasis on American smart power. They recognize that our diplomatic, development, and economic engagement around the world not only lift the lives of others but also make us safer at home.  These investments in bringing stability, maternal and child survival programs, clean water and sanitation, economic development, and sustainable democratic institutions and processes cost a fraction of potential military engagement.  This amendment will not address all our international engagement needs and challenges--that will only happen when we take such steps as closing Guantanamo, unequivocally renouncing torture, and taking responsibility for our contribution to global warming--but the amendment is an important step in the right direction.  Finally, I want to emphasize the importance of America's continued generosity in funding programs to fight HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria, diseases that kill over 6 million people each year.  Through its contribution to the global fund, the U.S. has helped save almost 2 million lives in over 100 countries during the last 5 years. This highly successful program, which uses contributions from around the world and works directly with individual country's health care providers and organizations, is a leading force for the fight against disease, improving the lives of others, and improving America's image around the world.  I believe America must work to meet a full one-third contribution to the fund's efforts and I hope funds from this amendment can help meet this important goal.  I similarly urge the Senate to support the upcoming reauthorization of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, commonly known as PEPFAR. The President deserves credit for supporting this effort--an effort that should be continued.                           Amendment No. 4232
