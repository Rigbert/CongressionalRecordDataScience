Mr. Chairman, I would like to say, yes, the gentlemen is accurate. Approximately $10 million is included within emergency funding for the Tulsa District of the Army Corps of Engineers as aid to combat damages suffered in last winter's ice storm. I would like to add that I really appreciate the gentleman's very persuasive presentation to the committee; and because of that, we did include the $10 million to deal with that issue.
