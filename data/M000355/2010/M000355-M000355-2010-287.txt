 President, I rise to thank Special Agent James Harold Sizemore for his many years of service to the people of Kentucky. For nearly three decades, he has worked in the dangerous field of law enforcement, risking his own well-being on behalf of his neighbors, and for that an entire State is grateful.  Harold was born and raised in Clay County, where his father was the sheriff. Harold followed in his father's footsteps and was elected sheriff of Clay County in 1982. He took a hard stand against illegal marijuana cultivation, a problem in that area, and conducted several successful eradication missions.  I first met Harold in 1989 when he was still serving as sheriff, and he described to me the devastating effect marijuana cultivation was having in Clay County. After that and right up to today I have given my full support to the Governor's Marijuana Strike Force, which coordinates local, State, and Federal law enforcement to combat the drug problem in Kentucky. This task force has been recognized by the President's Office of National Drug Control Policy for 5 consecutive years.  In 1990, Harold became a Federal law-enforcement officer with the U.S. Forest Service, a job he held for 20 years. In that capacity, he has conducted over 700 flight hours of surveillance and detection for marijuana eradication missions in Kentucky in support of State, local, and Federal task forces. His dedication and tireless efforts resulted in the eradication of over 100,000 marijuana plants, with a street value estimated at $600 million, many in small plots located in remote terrain to avoid detection.  In addition to these flight hours, Harold also participated in several missions in support of high-risk felony search and arrest warrants executed by State and Federal agencies. His professionalism and expertise, coupled with intimate knowledge of the local area, played a significant role in these missions being accomplished safely.  Harold provided key information in over 20 felony investigations, resulting in several Federal indictments and arrests. His personal knowledge of the Clay County area of the Daniel Boone National Forest played a decisive role in the identification of several suspects caught on surveillance, which was initiated as a result of Harold's aerial reconnaissance.  Throughout his career as a Federal law-enforcement officer, Harold's primary responsibility has been that of marijuana eradication officer for the Daniel Boone National Forest--and from that responsibility he has never wavered. In 2008, he was recognized by the U.S. Forest Service for a career of exceptionally meritorious service.  The U.S. Forest Service sometimes works with the Kentucky National Guard in their drug-control efforts, and Harold's dedication was clear to the soldiers he worked alongside. ``Harold is one of the driving forces behind the success of the Kentucky National Guard's efforts in support of these missions,'' says LTC Karlas Owens.  ``When observing marijuana in a helicopter, Harold possessed the patience of Job while maneuvering his ground element over difficult terrain . . . he guided officers cross-country as they walked to distant marijuana plots in the Daniel Boone National Forest and ensured they made a safe return. . . . Harold not only gives 110 percent to the [U.S.] Forest Service, but always supports the Kentucky National Guard and ensures we are successful as well.''  Lieutenant Colonel Owens also has these words for Harold, after working alongside him for 20 years on these dangerous but vital missions: ``For your teachings and friendship, I thank you, Sir.''  A countless number of Kentuckians owe their thanks to Harold as well. Upon his retirement, I know my colleagues in the U.S. Senate join me in thanking Special Agent James Harold Sizemore for his decades of service. The work he has done for so many years has bequeathed to all of us a safer, stronger Kentucky.                          ____________________
