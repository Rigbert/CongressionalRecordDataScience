Speaker, today, I am introducing legislation to set a permanent formula for calculation of the Federal contribution to the Federal employee health benefit plans. My bill would ensure that the Government contribution for civil servants and Federal retirees would remain at approximately 72 percent.  Under existing law, the contribution is set by a formula based on the premiums of five of the largest plans and a sixth, so-called phantom, premiums that represent a large plan that dropped out of FEHBP. This formula, passed in 1989, has held the Federal contribution near 72 percent but will expire at the end of calendar year 1998.  It is estimated that failure to extend or replace this formula would cost an enrollee about $20 a month or $240 per year. That is unacceptable--especially at a time when the budget resolution asks Federal employees to pay an additional five tenths of 1 percent into the CSRS and FERS retirement systems.  I want to thank the many people on the House Budget Committee and at the Office of Management and Budget who responded to my strenuous objections to not replacing the current formula. I am pleased that the budget agreement and resolution assume continuation of the 72-percent contribution. This legislation therefore has no budget implications and, according to preliminary OPM cost estimates, may actually save a small amount of money over the budget agreement baseline.  This bill will calculate, each year a weighted average of the subscription charges for all plans. The employee's or retiree's premium for each plan will be calculated by subtracting 72 percent of that weighted average from the total charge. Unlike previous formulas, this bill establishes a permanent formula that will automatically adjust as carriers enter or leave the FEHBP Program.  The concept of this stable fair share formula was developed by the Office of Personnel Management at my request. It has been refined through extensive discussions with Federal employee organizations, health plan carriers, and other interested parties. I am pleased that Mrs. Morella, Mr. Cummings, Mr. Moran of Virginia, Mr. Fazio of California, Mr. Ford, and Mr. Davis of Virginia have joined as original cosponsors.  I am hopeful that, working with Mrs. Morella and Mr. Cummings, we can add this important legislation to the reconciliation measure as it is marked up in the Government Reform and Oversight Committee. I invite Members who share my concern about protecting this critical benefit for Federal employees and retirees to join us as cosponsors of this legislation.                          ____________________
