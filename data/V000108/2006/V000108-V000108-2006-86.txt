Speaker, it is my distinct honor to take this time to recognize the members of the Gary, Indiana branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, NAACP. On Monday, October 30, 2006, the Gary NAACP held its 90th anniversary dinner, while also celebrating the 45th Annual Mary White Ovington Freedom Fund Awards at Saint Timothy Community Church's Fellowship Hall in Gary, Indiana.  The NAACP was founded on February 12, 1909, with the mission to end all racial discrimination and to secure the political, economic, and social rights of all African-Americans. As the Nation's oldest and largest civil rights organization, the NAACP has worked successfully with allies of all races who believe in and continue to carry out this mission still today. The Gary NAACP, the largest branch in the State of Indiana, was organized by those who felt there was a need for an organization that would monitor and defend the rights of African-Americans in northwest Indiana. The members of the Gary NAACP, who so selflessly serve the community, share the goals of the national organization. They fight each and every day to combat injustice, discrimination, and unfair treatment in their community.  This year's fundraiser event and anniversary dinner featured Dan Parker, Indiana State Democratic Committee chairman; and Murray Clark, Indiana State Republican Committee chairman, as the evening's keynote speakers. The theme for this year's event was, ``Remembering the Past. Preparing for the Future. Voting to make a Difference.'' The featured speakers addressed the importance of voting while promoting their respective party members.  This year, several honorees were recognized at the event with a special awards presentation. Denise Dillard, State Senator Earline Rogers, the Gary Cultural and Historical Society, Willie Watkins, New Mount Moriah Baptist Church, First African Methodist Episcopal Church, Saint Timothy Community Church, the Gary City Clerk's Office, and Marshanelle Hill were among those being honored with various awards for their service to the community and to the branch.  In addition, the Mary White Ovington Award, the most distinguished award of the evening, was presented to Gary residents Jonathan Comer and Cherrie B. White. This very special award annually recognizes those making the greatest contributions to sustaining civil rights.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in commending the members of the Gary NAACP for the efforts, activities, and leadership they have championed to improve the quality of life for all residents of Indiana's First Congressional District. I also ask that you join me in commending the community leaders who, through their unwavering commitment to their community, are so deserving of the special honors bestowed upon them.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Page E1995]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]           TRIBUTE TO THE GARY, INDIANA, BRANCH OF THE NAACP                                 ______                                                         HON.
