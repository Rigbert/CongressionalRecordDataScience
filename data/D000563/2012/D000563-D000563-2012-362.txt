We couldn't get past the first step because of the Republican filibuster.  Mr. McCAIN. I wish that when then-Senator Obama was running for President he would have said: But first I am coming over with the DREAM Act. He didn't. He said: My first act will be comprehensive immigration reform.  I was invited over to the White House in 2009. We talked about comprehensive immigration reform and I said: I will await a proposal from the administration on comprehensive immigration reform. My phone never rang.
