  The amendment, as further modified, is as follows:       On page 198, between lines 17 and 18, insert the following:         TITLE ____--NATO ENLARGEMENT FACILITATION ACT OF 1996     SEC. ____01. SHORT TITLE.       This title may be cited as the ``NATO Enlargement      Facilitation Act of 1996''.     SEC. ____02. FINDINGS.       The Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Since 1949, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization      (NATO) has played an essential role in guaranteeing the      security, freedom, and prosperity of the United States and      its partners in the Alliance.       (2) The NATO Alliance is, and has been since its inception,      purely defensive in character, and it poses no threat to any      nation. The enlargement of the NATO Alliance to include as      full and equal members emerging democracies in Central and      Eastern Europe will serve to reinforce stability and security      in Europe by fostering their integration into the structures      which have created and sustained peace in Europe since 1945.      Their admission into NATO will not threaten any nation.      America's security, freedom, and prosperity remain linked to      the security of the countries of Europe.       (3) The sustained commitment of the member countries of      NATO to a mutual defense has made possible the democratic      transformation of Central and Eastern Europe. Members of the      Alliance can and should play a critical role in addressing      the security challenges of the post-Cold War era and in      creating the stable environment needed for those emerging      democracies in Central and Eastern Europe to successfully      complete political and economic transformation.       (4) The United States continues to regard the political      independence and territorial integrity of all emerging      democracies in Central and Eastern Europe as vital to      European peace and security.       (5) The active involvement by the countries of Central and      Eastern Europe has made the Partnership for Peace program an      important forum to foster cooperation between NATO and those      countries seeking NATO membership.       (6) NATO has enlarged its membership on 3 different      occasions since 1949.       (7) Congress supports the admission of qualified new      members to NATO and the European Union at an early date and      has sought to facilitate the admission of qualified new      members into NATO.       (8) As new members of NATO assume the responsibilities of      Alliance membership, the costs of maintaining stability in      Europe should be shared more widely. Facilitation of the      enlargement process will require current members of NATO, and      the United States in particular, to demonstrate the political      will needed to build on successful ongoing programs such as      the Warsaw Initiative and the Partnership for Peace by making      available the resources necessary to supplement efforts      prospective new members are themselves undertaking.       (9) New members will be full members of the Alliance,      enjoying all rights and assuming all the obligations under      the Washington Treaty.       (10) Cooperative regional peacekeeping initiatives      involving emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe      that have expressed interest in joining NATO, such as the      Baltic Peacekeeping Battalion, the Polish-Lithuanian Joint      Peacekeeping Force, and the Polish-Ukrainian Peacekeeping      Force, can make an important contribution to European peace      and security and international peacekeeping efforts, can      assist those countries preparing to assume the      responsibilities of possible NATO membership, and accordingly      should receive appropriate support from the United States.       (11) NATO remains the only multilateral security      organization capable of conducting effective military      operations and preserving security and stability of the Euro-     Atlantic region.       (12) NATO is an important diplomatic forum and has played a      positive role in defusing tensions between members of the      Alliance and, as a result, no military action has occurred      between two Alliance member states since the inception of      NATO in 1949.       (13) The admission to NATO of emerging democracies in      Central and Eastern Europe which are found to be in a      position to further the principles of the North Atlantic      Treaty would contribute to international peace and enhance      the security of the region. Countries which have become      democracies and established market economies, which practice      good neighborly relations, and which have established      effective democratic civilian control over their defense      establishments and attained a degree of interoperability with      NATO, should be evaluated for their potential to further the      principles of the North Atlantic Treaty.       (14) A number of Central and Eastern European countries      have expressed interest in NATO membership, and have taken      concrete steps to demonstrate this commitment, including      their participation in Partnership for Peace activities.       (15) The Caucasus region remains important geographically      and politically to the future security of Central Europe. As      NATO proceeds with the process of enlargement, the United      States and NATO should continue to examine means to      strengthen the sovereignty and enhance the security of U.N.      recognized countries in that region.       (16) In recognition that not all countries which have      requested membership in NATO will necessarily qualify at the      same pace, the accession date for each new member will vary.       (17) The provision of additional NATO transition assistance      should include those emerging democracies most ready for      closer ties with NATO and should be designed to assist other      countries meeting specified criteria of eligibility to move      forward toward eventual NATO membership.       (18) The Congress of the United States finds in particular      that Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovenia have      made significant progress toward achieving the stated      criteria and should be eligible for the additional assistance      described in this bill.       (19) The evaluation of future membership in NATO for      emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe should be      based on the progress of those nations in meeting criteria      for NATO membership, which require enhancement of NATO's      security and the approval of all NATO members.       (20) The process of NATO enlargement entails the agreement      of the governments of all NATO members in accordance with      Article 10 of the Washington Treaty.       Some NATO members, such as Spain and Norway, do not allow      the deployment of nuclear weapons on their territory although      they are accorded the full collective security guarantees      provided by article V of the Washington Treaty. There is no      prior requirement for the stationing of nuclear weapons on      the territory of new NATO members, particularly in the      current security climate, however NATO retains the right to      alter its security posture at any time as circumstances      warrant.     SEC. ____03. UNITED STATES POLICY.       It is the policy of the United States--       (1) to join with the NATO allies of the United States to      adapt the role of the NATO Alliance in the post-Cold War      world;       (2) to actively assist the emerging democracies in Central      and Eastern Europe in their transition so that such countries      may eventually qualify for NATO membership; and       (3) to work to define a constructive and cooperative      political and security relationship between an enlarged NATO      and the Russian Federation.     SEC. ____04. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING FURTHER                    ENLARGEMENT OF NATO.       It is the sense of the Congress that in order to promote      economic stability and security in Slovakia, Estonia, Latvia,      Lithuania, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, Moldova, and Ukraine--       (1) the United States should continue and expand its      support for the full and active participation of these      countries in activities appropriate for qualifying for NATO      membership;       (2) the United States Government should use all diplomatic      means available to press the European Union to admit as soon      as possible any country which qualifies for membership;       (3) the United States Government and the North Atlantic      Treaty Organization should continue and expand their support      for military exercises and peacekeeping initiatives between      and among these nations, nations of the North Atlantic Treaty      Organization, and Russia; and       (4) the process of enlarging NATO to include emerging      democracies in Central and Eastern Europe should not be      limited to consideration of admitting Poland, Hungary, the      Czech Republic, and Slovenia as full members to the NATO      Alliance.     SEC. ____05. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING ESTONIA, LATVIA,                    AND LITHUANIA.       In view of the forcible incorporation of Estonia, Latvia,      Lithuania into the Soviet Union in 1940 under the Molotov-     Ribbentrop Pact and the refusal of the United States and      other countries to recognize that incorporation for over 50      years, it is the sense of the Congress that--       (1) Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania have valid historical      security concerns that must be taken into account by the      United States; and       (2) Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania should not be      disadvantaged in seeking to join NATO by virtue of their      forcible incorporation into the Soviet Union.
