President, concern over privacy is reaching an all time high. In 1978, 64 percent of Americans reported that they were ``very concerned'' or ``somewhat concerned'' about threats to their personal privacy. By 1998, this number had skyrocketed. According to the Center for Social and Legal Research, 88 percent of Americans reported being ``very'' or ``somewhat concerned'' about threats to their personal privacy. We in Congress must take this concern seriously, and in this regard I look forward to examining the privacy issues confronting us in hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee.  Good privacy policies make good business policies. New technologies bring with them new opportunities, both for the businesses that develop and market them, and for consumers. It does not do anyone any good for consumers to hesitate to use any particular technology because they have concerns over privacy. That is why I believe that good privacy policies make good business policies.  Protecting privacy plays an important role in the exercise of First Amendment rights. Ensuring that we have adequate privacy laws has a more significant and important role in our democracy than just fostering hi-tech businesses, however. We also must defend our on-line free speech rights from heavy-handed content regulation. That was my purpose in voting against the unconstitutional Communications Decency Act that became law in 1996.  Stopping efforts to create government censors is critical to allow our First Amendment rights to flourish, but it is not enough. For people to feel comfortable in exercising their First Amendment rights--by speaking, traveling and associating freely online or in physical space--they must be able to keep their activities confidential and private. When Big Brother is watching, the exercise of First Amendment rights is chilled no less than the threat of a government censor.  It is therefore not surprising that our country has a long and honorable tradition of keeping our identities private when we exercise our First Amendment rights. The Federalist Papers, which is probably the most important political document ever written about our Constitution, was authored anonymously by James Madison, John Jay and Alexander Hamilton and published under a pseudonym.  Healthy advocacy and debate often rests on the ability of participants to keep their identities private and to act anonymously. Indeed, the Supreme Court has said, ``Anonymity is a shield from the tyranny of the majority.''  Healthy commerce also depends on satisfying consumers' desire to keep their business affairs private and secure. A report I released last month on Vermont Internet commerce is very telling on this point. The strongest obstacle among consumers from shopping and doing business online was their fear of the online security risks. This is why promoting the use of encryption is so important, so that businesses and consumers can use this technology to provide the privacy and security they want and best suits their needs.  The legislation I introduce today would help ensure that Americans' Fourth Amendment rights to be securein their persons, houses, papers and effects against unreasonable government searches and seizures are given ample protection in a networked computer environment. In addition, several provisions address the concern Americans have about the use and handling of their personally identifiable records and information by businesses, satellite carriers, libraries and book sellers.  Industry self-regulation efforts should be encouraged. In contrast to a citizen's relationship with his or her government, consumers have a choice of whether they want to deal or interact with those in the private sector. In my view, this choice should be generally recognized in the law by allowing consumers and businesses in the marketplace to set the terms of their interaction. This is an area where the Congress should tread cautiously before regulating. Online businesses are engaging in serious efforts to make available to consumers information on privacy policies so that consumers are able to make more educated choices on whether they want to deal. I commend and applaud those efforts.  That being said, however, current laws do not apply privacy principles in an even-handed manner. Video rental stores and cable operators are subject to privacy laws to protect our right to keep our viewing habits private, but no protections exist for the books we borrow from the library or buy from a bookstore, or the shows we watch via satellite. This bill would provide more uniform privacy protection for both books and videos, no matter the medium of delivery.  Similarly, telephone companies and cable operators are subject to legal restrictions on how they may use personally identifiable information about their Internet subscribers, while other Internet and online service providers are not. The E-RIGHTS bill promotes a more level playing field in terms of the privacy protections available to Internet users, no matter whether they obtain their Internet access from AOL, their cable company or their local phone company.  This legislation addresses a broad range of emerging hi-tech privacy issues. For example:  When should the FBI be allowed to use cell phones to track a user's movements?  Should Kosovo human rights organizations that use a Web site to correct government misinformation be able to get a domain name without having their names publicly available on a database? Should we have the same ability to get an ``unlisted'' domain name (or Internet address) as we are able to get an ``unlisted'' phone number?  Should we allow other federal prosecutors to act like Special Prosecutor Kenneth Starr and go on fishing expeditions with subpoenas issued to bookstores to find out what we are reading? Should we protect our choices of reading and viewing materials the same way we protect our choice of videotapes that we rent from our local Blockbuster?  Should an Internet user who maintains a calendar on Yahoo! get the same privacy protection as people who keep their calendars on their desk or on their PCs' hard-drive? Will people avoid certain network services offered by Netscape or new Internet start-ups because they get less privacy protection for the information stored on the network than on their own PCs?  These are all important issues, and I have worked to propose solutions to each of these and to other questions, as well, in the E-RIGHTS bill. This bill has the following four titles:  Title I: Privacy Protection for Communications and Electronic Information. This title has ten sections that propose certain Fourth Amendment protections to guide the government's access to, or exercise of, law enforcement's enhanced surveillance capabilities due to new technologies. In addition, this title also contains sections that limit how domain name registrars and Internet/Online service providers may use information collected on Internet users.  Network Stored Information.--The bill would require that law enforcement give a subscriber notice of a subpoena or warrant before seizing electronic information stored on a network service. This is the same notice that the subscriber would get if the information were stored on his or her own computer.  Cell Phone Location Information.--Before law enforcement may use a person's cell phone as a tracking device, the bill would require a court order based on probable cause that the person is committing a crime.  A related provision that has already passed the House in February as part of the ``Wireless Communications and Public Safety Act of 1999,'' H.R. 438, would require wireless phone providers to inform a cell phone user's family and emergency services of their location in emergency situations, while requiring the prior customer consent before that location information may be used for any other purpose.  Pen Registers.--The bill would authorize a judge to review information presented by a federal prosecutor to determine whether the pen register is likely to produce information relevant to an ongoing criminal investigation, since under current law the judge plays only a ministerial role and must approve any order upon presentation by a prosecutor. Current law compels judges to be only a rubber stamp.  Conference Calls.--The FBI has claimed that the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) requires that they be given the capability to monitor conference calls which continue even after the target of a wiretap order has dropped out of the call. This provision would require that a court authorize such continued monitoring of conference calls in the absence of the target.  Roving Wiretaps.--A substantial change that provides easier access to roving wiretaps was inserted without debate or hearings into last year's Intelligence Authorization Act. With this change, the FBI is able to get a roving wiretap whenever a person's action could have the effect of thwarting interception. The bill would rectify this change to permit roving wiretaps only when the person actually changes phones in a way which has the effect of thwarting surveillance.  Domain Name Registrars.--Internet users or businesses who get an Internet address with a second level domain name must also provide information about contact names, physical and E-mail addresses, network location, and other information that is posted in a publicly available database called WHOIS. The bill would give users registering for a domain name/Internet address authority to prohibit disclosure of the information, and keep the information confidential. Of course, the registrar would be able to override the user's choice of confidentiality and to disclose the information as necessary to provide service or in response to a subpoena or court order.  Internet users who want an ``unlisted'' Internet address just as they have the choice of getting an ``unlisted'' telephone number will be able to do so.  Internet and Online Service Providers.--The 1986 Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) set up procedures for law enforcement to obtain records about subscribers from ``electronic communication service providers'', but contained a blanket exemption allowing such providers to disclose a record or other information pertaining to a subscriber or customer to any non-governmental entity. Due to this exemption, ISPs and OSPs may sell their subscriber lists or track the online movements of their subscribers and sell that information--all without the subscribers' knowledge or consent.  The bill would cut back on this blanket exemption. The bill would require electronic communication service providers to give their subscribers an opportunity to prohibit disclosure of their personal information, and enumerates the situations in which the information may be used or disclosed without the subscriber's approval. These proposed rules are generally analogous to restrictions already in place for other providers of Internet services, including cable operators and phone companies, which are restricted in how they may use personally identifiable information about customers without the customers' approval.  No criminal penalties attach for violation. ECPA currently authorizes an aggrieved person to bring a civil action.  Title II: Promoting the Use of Encryption. This title contains three sections: (1) prohibiting domestic controls on encryption and government-compelled key escrow encryption; (2) requiring encryption products used by federal agencies to interoperate with commercial encryption products; and (3) adding a chapter to the federal criminal code detailing procedures to law enforcement and foreign government access to decryption assistance.  Specifically, the bill would require the release of decryption keys or assistance to law enforcement in response to a court order based upon a finding that the key or assistance is necessary to decrypt lawfully intercepted encrypted messages or data.  Title III: Privacy Protection for Library Loan and Book Sales Records. This title would extend the privacy protection in current law for video rental and sale records to library loan and book sale records.  Library.--The library provisions are a reprise of sections that were dropped from the Video Privacy Protection Act enacted in 1988. This provision would prohibit libraries from disclosing personally identifiable information about patrons without the written consent of the patron or in response to a court order to release the information to a law enforcement agency, with prior notice to the patron, if there is probable cause to believe a crime is being committed and the information sought is material to the investigation.  Booksellers.--The public outcry over Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's subpoena in March 1988 to Kramerbooks & Afterwords for any books purchased by Monica Lewinsky, and the potential threat such government fishing expeditions pose to First Amendment rights, prompted examination of the privacy rules protecting the records maintained by bookstores. There are no rules barring book sellers from disclosing records about their customers.  This section would impose the same nondisclosure rules on booksellers--whether online or in physical spaces--that apply to video rental stores. Generally, book sellers would be barred from disclosing personally identifiable information concerning a book purchaser without that purchasers' written consent given at the time the disclosure is sought.  Title IV: Privacy Protection for Satellite Home Viewers. In the 1984 Cable Act, Congress established a nationwide standard for the privacy protection of cable subscribers. Since the Cable Act was adopted, an entirely new form of access to television has emerged--home satellite viewing--which is especially popular in rural areas not served by cable. Yet there is no statutory privacy protection for information collected by home satellite viewing services about their customers or subscribers. This title fills this gap by amending the privacy provisions of the Cable Act to cover home satellite viewing.  The amendments do not change the rules governing access to cable subscriber information. Instead, they merely add the words ``satellite home viewing service'' and ``satellite carrier or distributor'' where appropriate.  The amendment does not address another inconsistency in the law, which bears mentioning: should a cable company that provides Internet services to its customers be subject to the privacy safeguards in the Cable Act or in the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA), which normally applies to Internet service providers and contains obligations regarding the disclosure of personally identifiable information to both governmental and nongovernmental entities different from those in the Cable Act? One court has described this as a ``statutory riddle raised by the entrance of cable operators into the Internet services market.''  New technologies and new uses for old technologies pose challenging ``riddles'' for privacy, but they are solvable in ways that balance competing commerce, civil rights, and law enforcement interests. The E-RIGHTS bill proposes balanced solutions that protect our privacy rights. I invite others to share their ideas on these matters. There are few matters more important than privacy in maintaining our core democratic values, so I look forward to hearing their comments on ways to improve this legislation.  I ask unanimous consent that the E-RIGHTS bill and the sectional analysis be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 854       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

PURPOSES.       The purposes of this Act are--       (1) to promote the privacy and constitutional rights of      individuals and organizations in networked computer systems      and other digital environments, protect the confidentiality      of information and security of critical infrastructure      systems relied on by individuals, businesses and government      agencies, and properly balance the needs of law enforcement      to have the access to electronic communications and      information in appropriate circumstances;       (2) to encourage Americans to develop and deploy encryption      technology and to promote the use of encryption by Americans      to protect the security, confidentiality, and privacy of      their lawful wire and electronic communications and stored      electronic information; and       (3) to establish privacy standards and procedures by which      investigative or law enforcement officers and foreign      governments may obtain decryption assistance for encrypted      communications and stored electronic information.     SEC. 3. FINDINGS.       Congress finds that--       (1) the digitization of information and the explosion in      the growth of computing and electronic networking offers      tremendous potential benefits to the way Americans live,      work, and are entertained, but also raises new threats to the      privacy of the American people and the competitiveness of      American businesses;       (2) a secure, private, and trusted national and global      information infrastructure is essential to promote economic      growth, protect privacy, and meet the needs of the American      people and businesses;       (3) the rights of Americans to the privacy and security of      their communications and in the conducting of personal and      business affairs should be promoted and protected;       (4) the authority and ability of investigative and law      enforcement officers to access and decipher, in a timely      manner and as provided by law, wire and electronic      communications, and stored electronic information necessary      to provide for public safety and national security should      also be preserved;       (5) individuals will not entrust their sensitive personal,      medical, financial, and other information to computers and      computer networks unless the security and privacy of that      information is assured;       (6) businesses will not entrust their proprietary and      sensitive corporate information, including information about      products, processes, customers, finances, and employees, to      computers and computer networks unless the security and      privacy of that information is assured;       (7) America's critical infrastructures, including its      telecommunications system, banking and financial      infrastructure, and power and transportation infrastructure,      increasingly rely on vulnerable information     systems, and will represent a growing risk to national      security and public safety unless the security and privacy of      those information systems is assured;       (8) encryption technology is an essential tool to promote      and protect the privacy, security, confidentiality,      integrity, and authenticity of wire and electronic      communications and stored electronic information;       (9) encryption techniques, technology, programs, and      products are widely available worldwide;       (10) Americans should be free to use lawfully whatever      particular encryption techniques, technologies, programs, or      products developed in the marketplace that best suits their      needs in order to interact electronically with the government      and others worldwide in a secure, private, and confidential      manner;       (11) government mandates for, or otherwise compelled use      of, third-party key recovery systems or other systems that      provide surreptitious access to encrypted data threatens the      security and privacy of information systems;       (12) a national encryption policy is needed to advance the      development of the national and global information      infrastructure, and preserve the right to privacy of      Americans and the public safety and national security of the      United States;       (13) Congress and the American people have recognized the      need to balance the right to privacy and the protection of      the public safety with national security;       (14) the Constitution of the United States permits lawful      electronic surveillance and the use of other investigative      tools by law enforcement officers and the seizure of stored      electronic information only upon compliance with stringent      standards and procedures designed to protect the right to      privacy and other rights protected under the fourth amendment      of the Constitution of the United States;       (15) there is a need to clarify the standards and      procedures by which investigative or law enforcement officers      obtain decryption assistance from persons--       (A) who are voluntarily entrusted with the means to decrypt      wire and electronic communications and stored electronic      information; or       (B) have information that enables the decryption of such      communications and information;       (16) Americans are increasingly shopping online and      purchasing books from online vendors, and expect that their      choices of reading or viewing materials will be kept      confidential;       (17) protecting the confidentiality and privacy of the      books, other written materials, and movies that a person      chooses to read or view should be protected to ensure the      free exercise of first amendment rights regardless of medium;       (18) generally, under current law, telecommunications      carriers may not disclose individually identifiable customer      proprietary network information without their customers'      approval, while providers of electronic communications      services and remote computing services may make such      disclosure to anyone other than a governmental entity and      have no legal obligation to notify their subscribers when      they do so;       (19) subscribers of Internet services through facilities of      cable operators must be given notice and an opportunity to      prohibit disclosure before the cable operator may disclose      any personally identifiable information, including name or      address, about a subscriber to any other person, while      providers of electronic communications services and remote      computing services have no similar legal obligation to      protect the privacy of their subscribers; and       (20) given the convergence among wireless, wire line,      cable, broadcast, and satellite services, privacy safeguards      should be applied more uniformly across different media in      order to provide a level competitive playing field and      consistent privacy protections.

Short Title.--The Act may be cited as the      ``Electronic Rights (E-RIGHTS) for the 21st Century Act.''       Sec. 2. Purposes.--The Act has three general purposes: (1)      promoting the privacy and constitutional rights of      individuals and organizations in networked computer systems,      and the security of critical information infrastructures,      while properly balancing law enforcement access needs; (2)      encouraging Americans to develop and deploy encryption      technology and to promote the use of encryption by Americans      to protect the security, confidentiality and privacy of their      lawful wire and electronic communications and stored      electronic information; and (3) establishing privacy      standards and procedures for law enforcement officers to      obtain decryption assistance for encrypted communications and      information.       Sec. 3. Findings.--The Act enumerates twenty congressional      findings that law enforcement investigative and electronic      surveillance needs must be balanced with the right to privacy      and other rights protected under the Fourth Amendment of the      Constitution; encryption technology, which is widely      available worldwide, is useful in protecting the privacy,      security, and confidentiality of the national and global      information infrastructure; Americans should be free to use,      and American businesses free to compete and sell, encryption      technology, programs and products; and given the convergence      among digital media, privacy safeguards should be applied      more uniformly to provide a level competitive playing field.       Sec. 4. Definitions.--The terms ``agency'', ``person'' and      ``state'' have the same meaning given those terms in      specified sections of title 18, United States Code, except      that the term ``agency'' also includes the United States      Postal Service.       Additional definitions are provided for the following      terms:       The terms ``encrypt'' and ``encryption'' mean the use of      mathematical formulas or algorithms to scramble or unscramble      electronic data or communications for purposes of      confidentiality, integrity, or authenticity. As defined, the      terms cover a broad range of scrambling techniques and      applications including cryptographic applications such as PGP      or RSA's encryption algorithms; steganography;      authentication; and winnowing and chafing.       The term ``encryption product'' includes any hardware,      software, devices, or other technology with encryption      capabilities, whether or not offered for sale or      distribution.       The term ``key'' means the variable information used in or      produced by a mathematical formula to encrypt or decrypt wire      or electronic communications or electronically stored      information.       The term ``United States person'' means any citizen of the      United States or legal entity organized under U.S. law that      has its principal place of business in this country.     TITLE I--PRIVACY PROTECTION FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONIC                               INFORMATION       Sec. 101. Enhanced Privacy Protection for Information on      Computer Networks.--The Act modifies subsection (b) of      section 2703 of title 18, United States Code, to extend      privacy protections to electronic information stored on      computer networks.       When held in a person's home, records may only be seized      pursuant to a warrant based upon probable cause, or compelled      under a subpoena, which may be challenged and quashed. In      both instances, the record owner has notice of the search and      an opportunity to challenge it. By contrast, under United      States v. Miller, 425 U.S. 435 (1976) (customer has no      standing to object to bank disclosure of customer records),      and its progeny, records in the possession of third parties      do not receive Fourth Amendment protection. A governmental      agent with a subpoena based upon mere relevance may compel a      third party to produce records originating with or belonging      to another person, without notice to the person to whom the      records pertain. The record subject may never receive notice      or any meaningful opportunity to challenge the production.       This lack of protection for records held by third parties      presents new privacy problems in the information age. With      the rise of network computing, electronic information that      was previously held on a person's own computer is      increasingly stored elsewhere, such as on a network server.      In many cases the location of such information is not even      known to the record's owner.       Furthermore, Web-based information services are attracting      customers by offering free storage and services accessible      from any computer. Companies like When.com, Briefcase.com,      Yahoo and Netscape offer calendars, address books, ``to do''      lists, stock portfolios and storage space, while more      targeted companies, like dietwatch.com let users keep track      of their diets. Potential customers of such services should      not be discouraged from subscribing due to the weaker privacy      and confidentiality protections afforded their remotely      stored records than if those records were stored on the      customer's own laptop or PC.       Under current law, these services are covered by the remote      computing service provision in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2703(b), which      authorizes a governmental entity to require disclosure of      those communications without notice to the subscriber. A      remote computing service provides storage or computer      processing services to customers and is not authorized to      access the contents of the electronic communications      created by the customer.       The Act amends section 2703(b) to extend the same privacy      protections to a person's records whether storage takes place      on that person's personal computer in their possession or in      networked electronic storage. The amendment to section      2703(b) would authorize a governmental entity to require      disclosure of electronic communications or records stored by      a remote computing service pursuant to (i) a state or federal      warrant (based upon probable cause), with a copy to be served      on the customer or record owner at the same time the warrant      is served on the remote computing service holding the record;      or (ii) a subpoena that must also be served on the customer      or record owner with a meaningful opportunity to challenge      the subpoena.       The penalties for violating this section would not change      and do not currently carry criminal fines or any term of      imprisonment. (See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2701(c) (criminal offense      provision does not apply to ``conduct authorized . . . in      section 2703''). Instead, under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2707, a      government agent that violates this section is subject to      disciplinary action, and a service provider that violates      this section is subject to civil action for appropriate      relief.       Sec. 102. Government Access to Location Information.--The      Act adds a new subsection (g) to section 2703 of title 18,      United States Code, to extend privacy protections for      physical location information generated on a real time basis      by mobile electronic communications services, such as      cellular telephones. This section requires that physical      location information generated by a wireless service provider      may only be released to a governmental entity pursuant to a      court order based upon probable cause.       Location information on wireless telephones is      fundamentally different from the type of location information      that can be associated with a wireline telephone. Wireless      telephones are normally directly associated with the physical      presence of the individual user, and are carried by those      users into places where there is a reasonable expectation of      privacy. Tracking of cellular telephones, even more-so than      automobiles, implicates the movements of a person going about      his or her business and personal life.       Should the government seek to track a person by      surreptitiously placing a mobile tracking device on that      person's automobile, a court order would be required based      upon a finding of probable cause. (See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3117;      Fed. R. Cr. P. 41; U.S. v. In re Application, 155 F.R.D. 401,      402 (D. MA 1994)). No less should be required for use by the      government of a wireless telephone as a tracking device.       Civil liberties experts have noted that cellular telephone      technology ``is proceeding in the direction of providing more      precise location information, a trend that has been boosted      by the rulings of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)      in its ``E911'' (Enhanced 911) proceeding, which requires      service providers to develop a locator capability for medical      emergency and rescue purposes.'' (Testimony of Deirdre      Mulligan, Center for Democracy and Technology, before the      House Committee on the Judiciary, Subcommittee on Courts and      Intellectual Property, March 26, 1998). Specifically, the FCC      is requiring wireless service providers to modify their      systems to enable them to relay to public safety authorities      the cell site location of 911 callers. Carriers must also      take steps to deploy the capability to provide latitude and      longitude information of wireless telephone callers within      125 meters and, ultimately, to locate a caller within a 40-     foot radius for longitude, latitude and altitude, to enable      locating a caller within a tall building. (See In re Revision      of the Commission's Rules to Ensure Compatibility with      Enhanced 911 Emergency Calling Sys., CC Docket No. 94-102,      Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking      (last modified Jan. 2, 1997)).       In a separate proceeding, the FCC in October 1998 proposed      ruling that a location tracking capability for wireless      telephones was required under the Communications Assistance      for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA). The FCC has tentatively      concluded that carriers must have the capability of providing      to law enforcement a caller's cell site location at the      beginning and termination of a call. (See In re CALEA, CC      Docket No. 97-213, Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking      (adopted October 22, 1998), 63 Fed. Reg. 63639, November 16,      1998). Whether this capability is ultimately required by the      FCC as part of CALEA, there is no doubt that real-time      location information will be increasingly available to law      enforcement agencies. Accordingly, the appropriate standard      for law enforcement access to such location information      should be clarified.       Sec. 103. Enhanced Privacy Protection for Transactional      Information Obtained From Pen Registers or Trap and Trace      Devices.--The Act enhances privacy protections for      information obtained from pen register and trap and trace      devices by amending section 3123(a) of title 18, United      States Code. Under current law, the court is relegated to a      mere ministerial function and must issue a pen register or      trap and trace order whenever presented with a signed      certification of a prosecutor.       This amendment authorize the court to review the      information presented in the certification to determine      whether the information likely to be obtained is relevant to      an ongoing criminal investigation. The amendment would not      change the standard for issuance of an ex parte order      authorizing use of a pen register or trap and trace      device.       In addition, the amendment would require law enforcement to      minimize the information obtained from the pen register or      trap and trace device that is not related to the dialing and      signaling information utilized in call processing.       Currently, pen registers capture not just such dialing      information but also any other dialed digits after a call has      been connected. The Department of Justice has taken the      position in connection with legislation pending in the 105th      Congress regarding law enforcement access to clone numeric      pagers that digits dialed and transmitted after a call has      been placed may consist of electronic impulses but ``are the      `contents' of the call,'' subject to more stringent privacy      protections under the Fourth Amendment. This provision would      provide protection for those ``contents.''       Sec. 104. Privacy Protection for Conference Calls.--This      section clarifies the circumstances under which the      government may continue monitoring a three-way call or      conference call after a facility specified in the wiretap      order is no longer connected to the call. The Fourth      Amendment requires the government when conducting a search      and seizure to have a warrant ``particularly describing the      place to be searched, and the person or things to be      seized.'' Under the terminology of the wiretap laws, the      place to be searched is called a ``facility,'' which has      generally been interpreted to mean a subscriber telephone      line.       Modern three-way and conference calling technology allows      an individual to initiate a three-way or conference call with      two or more other parties and then to ``drop off'' the call      while the other parties continue communicating. At that      point, the telephone line specified in the order is no longer      connected to the call. This section makes it clear that the      government may continue monitoring the communications of      parties remaining on a conference call when the facility      identified in the wiretap order is no longer participating      only if the government has shown and the authorizing judge      has found that an individual who remains a party to the      communication is committing, has committed or is about to      commit a particular offense enumerated in the wiretap order      and that communications concerning that offense will be      obtained through the     continuing interception. Since these are the basic standards      of the wiretap law, which the government must satisfy for any      interception, the effect of the change is to make it clear      that the interception of the remaining parties to a three-way      or conference call must satisfy the basic requirements of the      wiretap law.       Sec. 105. Enhanced Privacy Protection for Packet Networks,      Including the Internet.--This section amends subsection      3121(c) of title 18 to require law enforcement agencies      conducting pen register or trap and trace investigations on      packet communications to use reasonably available technology      to ensure that they do not intercept the content of      communications without a Title III order. The electronic      surveillance laws draw a distinction between the interception      of content, which requires a court order based on the high      probable cause standard, and the interception of call routing      information, which is obtained under the lower pen register      or trap and trace authority in sections 3121-3127. The      Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act of 1994      requires carriers, to the extent reasonably achievable, to      design their systems to ensure that law enforcement agencies      conducting pen register and trap and trace investigations do      not intercept the content of communications. Subsection      3121(c), originally added by CALEA, imposed a mirror      obligation on law enforcement to use pen register or trap and      trace equipment that does not record or decode content.       Sec. 105 amends 3121(c) to make it clear that obligation      applies to packet switched communications, which are based on      technology that breaks a digital message into many small      packets, each consisting of addressing or routing information      plus a segment of content. This change makes it clear that      law enforcement agencies using pen registers or trap and      trace devices in packet switched environments must, if the      technology is reasonably available, record or decode only      addressing information, not content.       Sec. 106. Privacy Safeguards for Information Collected by      Internet Registrars.--The Act would amend section 2703 of      title 18, United States Code, to add a new subsection (g)      protecting the privacy of records pertaining to persons who      register for a second-level domain name, which serves as an      Internet address. Just as consumers may, by obtaining an      unlisted telephone number for privacy, safety or other      reasons, keep confidential personally identifiable      information associated with telephone numbers, such as name      and address, Internet users should be able to get an      ``unlisted'' Internet address. A domain name registration      service provider that violates this section would be subject      to civil action for appropriate relief, under 18 U.S.C.      Sec. 2707.       Internet domain names are the unique identifiers or      addresses that enables businesses, organizations, and      individuals to communicate and conduct commerce on the      Internet.       Until recently, pursuant to a cooperative agreement with      the Department of Commerce, Network Solutions, Inc. (NSI),      was the exclusive registrar assigning domain names ending in      .com, .net, .org and .edu. As a registrar, NSI enters new      domain names into the master directory or registry.       The U.S. government is in the process of privatizing the      administration of the Internet domain name system (DNS) to      increase competition in the registration of domain names.      With the advent of competition in the DNS, NSI will continue      to operate the .com, .net, .org registries, but other      companies, including domain name registration resellers,      country code registries, ISPs, and major telecommunications      firms, may be able to offer competing registrar services or      registry/registrar services using other top level domains.       Normally, in order to process a request for a domain name,      registrars and registries must collect personal information      for billing and other purposes. The information currently      collected by NSI includes: name, organization, address,      country, contacts for administrative, technical and billing      matters, telephone and fax numbers, and e-mail address. This      information, along with the date on which the name was      registered and information on the computer network used by      the registrant to connect to the Internet, is compiled in a      registry and made publicly available on an Internet-     accessible ``WHOIS'' database.       This database provides an efficient way of identifying and      contacting persons operating Web sites for both legitimate or      illegitimate purposes, such as online trademark and copyright      infringement. The personally identifiable information placed      on the WHOIS database has been misused for ``spamming'', or      sending unsolicited and unwanted e-mail messages to the      persons who are registered with domain names. In addition,      this information has been used by ``cyber-squatters'' to      appropriate domain names for resale to the rightful owners.      Despite these misuses and abuses of the WHOIS database, this      information is valuable to marketers, news organizations,      governments, and intellectual property owners.       Personally identifiable information collected by domain      name registrars has privacy implications. For example, when      human rights organizations obtain a domain name to use the      Internet for political activities, disclosure of the required      mailing and contact information may be dangerous. The      importance of anonymity is amply demonstrated by the recent      example of people in Kosovo, who are using anonymous remail      services to try to maintain confidential communications and      avoid detection by Serbian forces. (See New York Times, at      C4, April 19, 1998). As one civil liberties organization has      said, ``Internet users should not have to sacrifice their      privacy and personal safety to exercise their right to free      speech and expression.''       The amendment seeks to balance these competing interests by      setting procedures for access to personally identifiable      information regarding domain name holders. The procedures      allow continued public access to information identifying the      service provider hosting the website of the subscriber or      customer, and are consistent with procedures adopted by the      Congress in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), P.L.      105-304, 112 STAT. 2883 (1998), which authorizes copyright      owners to obtain information identifying the operators of Web      sites or other Internet addresses engaged in possible      copyright infringements through use of an expedited subpoena      process. The DMCA provides that copyright owners ``may      request a clerk of any U.S. district court to issue a      subpoena to a service provider for identification of an      alleged infringer.'' 17 U.S.C. Sec.  512(h)(1).       Sec. 107. Reports Concerning Governmental Access to      Electronic Communications.--This section requires the      Attorney General to provide to Congress annual reports on the      number and nature of government interceptions of E-mail and      other electronic communications. To provide the appropriate      oversight, the Congress, other policy makers and the public      need information about government practices under the law.      While the wiretap provisions of Title III require detailed      reports by the courts and prosecutors on the number of      wiretap orders issued, there is no similar requirement for      collecting and publishing information on the nature and      extent of government access to E-mail and other electronic      communications under section 2703. Section 107 corrects this      deficiency by requiring the Attorney General to transmit to      Congress on an annual basis a report on the warrants, court      orders and subpoenas applied for and issued under section      2703.       Sec. 108. Roving Wiretaps.--This section amends subsection      (11)(b) of section 2518 of title 18, United States Code,      concerning the standard for issuance of a roving wiretap.      This standard was modified without debate or hearing in the      Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999, P.L.      105-272, that passed in the final days of the 105th Congress,      to address the concern of the Department of Justice that the      prior standard for roving taps was too difficult to meet      because it required the government to demonstrate that the      subjective intent of the target was to avoid surveillance.      However, the modification eliminated virtually any standard      at all.       This section would amend the roving wiretap provision by      preserving the central rationale for roving taps: that they      are only appropriate where the subject is changing facilities      in a way that thwarts interception. As amended by this      section, (b)(i) does not require the government to prove      intent; it only requires the government to show effect.      Alternatively, under (b)(ii), the government can obtain a      roving tap where it can show the intent of the target, e.g.,      where an associate of the target informs the government that      the target intends to evade surveillance by changing      facilities.       Sec. 109. Authority to Provide Customer Location      Information For Emergency Purposes.--This section amends      section 222 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 222)      to authorize telecommunications carriers to: (1) provide      call location information concerning the user of a      commercial mobile service to providers of emergency      services, to inform such user's legal guardian or family      members of the user's location in an emergency situation      involving the risk of death or serious bodily injury, or      to providers of information services to assist in the      delivery of emergency response services; and (2) transmit      automatic crash notification system information as part of      the operation of such a system. In addition, this      amendment requires the express prior customer      authorization of the use of either of the above      information for other than the stated purposes.       Finally, the amendment requires a telecommunications      carrier that provides telephone exchange service to provide      subscriber list information (including information on      unlisted subscribers) that is in its sole possession or      control to providers of emergency services and emergency      support services for use solely in delivering, or assisting      in delivering, emergency services.       This provision was included by Representative Markey (D-MA)      to the ``Wireless Communications and Public Safety Act of      1999,'' H.R. 438, which passed the House on February 23,      1999.       Sec. 110. Confidentiality of Subscriber Information.--This      section amends section 2703(c) of title 18, United States      Code, to protect the confidentiality of information provided      to and collected by electronic communication and remote      computing services about their subscribers. Under current      law, these service providers may disclose a record or other      information pertaining to a subscriber or customer to any      person other than a governmental entity.       By contrast, cable operators may not release to any person,      including the government, ``personally identifiable      information''     about a customer'' without the prior written or electronic      consent of the subscriber concerned and shall take such      actions as are necessary to prevent unauthorized access to      such information by a person other than the subscriber or      cable operator.'' 47 U.S.C. Sec.  551(c)(1). Similarly,      telecommunications carriers are generally barred from using,      disclosing or permitting access to individually identifiable      customer proprietary network information, such as the      services used and billing information, except ``with the      approval of the customer.'' 47 U.S.C. Sec.  222(c)(1).      Telecommunications carriers are now offering online and      Internet access services. In addition, digital convergence is      allowing cable operators to provide Internet services. These      developments only highlight the disparities in the privacy      regimes applicable to different providers.       This section would authorize providers of electronic      communication and remote computing services to disclose      records or information pertaining to their subscribers or      customers only if such disclosure is: (1) necessary in      connection with rendering services; (2) necessary to protect      the rights or property of the provider; (3) required by law;      (4) requested by the subscriber; or (5) if the provider has      provided the subscriber with the opportunity in a clear and      conspicuous manner, to prohibit such disclosure. In addition,      providers of electronic communication and remote computing      services are authorized to use aggregate subscriber      information from which individual subscriber identities have      been removed in any manner they wish.               TITLE II--PROMOTING THE USE OF ENCRYPTION       Sec. 201. Freedom To Use Encryption.       (a) No Domestic Encryption Controls.--The Act legislatively      confirms current practice in the United States that any      person in this country may lawfully use any encryption      method, regardless of encryption algorithm, key length,      existence of key recovery or other plaintext access      capability, or implementation selected. Specifically, the Act      states the freedom of any person in the U.S., as well as U.S.      persons in a foreign country, to make, use, import, and      distribute any encryption product without regard to its      strength or the use of key recovery, subject to the other      provisions of the Act.       (b) Prohibition on Government-Compelled Key Escrow or Key      Recovery Encryption.--The Act prohibits any federal or state      agency from compelling the use of key recovery systems or      other plaintext access systems. Agencies may not set      standards, or condition approval or benefits, to compel use      of these systems. U.S. agencies may not require persons to      use particular key recovery products for interaction with the      government. These prohibitions do not apply to systems for      use solely for the internal operations and telecommunications      systems of a U.S. or a State government agency.       (c) Use of Encryption For Authentication or Integrity      Purposes.--The Act requires that the use of encryption      products shall be voluntary and that no federal or state      agency may link the use of encryption for authentication or      identity (such as through certificate authority and digital      signature systems) to the use of encryption for      confidentiality purposes. For example, conditioning receipt      of a digital certificate from a licensed certificate      authority on the use of key recovery would be prohibited.       Sec. 202. Purchase and Use of Encryption Products by the      Federal Government.--The Act authorizes agencies of the      United States to purchase encryption products for internal      governmental operations and telecommunications systems. To      ensure that secure electronic access to the Government is      available to persons outside of and not operating under      contract with Federal agencies, the Act requires that any key      recovery features in encryption products used by the      Government interoperate with commercial encryption      products.       Sec. 203. Law Enforcement Decryption Assistance.--The Act      adds a new chapter 124 to Title 18, Part I, governing the      procedures for governmental access, including by foreign      governments, to decryption assistance from third parties.       (a) In General.--New chapter 124 has four sections. This      chapter applies to wire or electronic communications and      communications in electronic storage, as defined in 18 U.S.C.      Sec.  2510, and to stored electronic data. It proscribes      procedures for law enforcement to obtain assistance in      decrypting encrypted electronic mail messages, encrypted      telephone conversations, encrypted facsimile transmissions,      encrypted computer transmissions and encrypted file transfers      over the Internet that are lawfully intercepted pursuant to a      wiretap order, under 18 U.S.C. Sec.  2518, or obtained      pursuant to lawful process, under 18 U.S.C. Sec.  2703, and      encrypted information stored on computers that are seized      pursuant to a search warrant or other lawful process.       Sec.  2801. Definitions. Generally, the terms used in the      new chapter have the same meanings as in the federal wiretap      statute, 18 U.S.C. Sec.  2510. Definitions are provided for      ``decryption assistance'', ``decryption key'', ``encrypt;      encryption'', ``foreign government'' and ``official      request''.       Sec.  2802. Access to decryption assistance for      communications. In the United States today, decryption keys      and other decryption assistance held by third parties      constitute third party records and may be disclosed to a      governmental entity with a subpoena or an administrative      request, and without any notice to the owner of the encrypted      data. Such a low standard of access creates new problems in      the information age because encryption users rely heavily on      the integrity of keys to protect personal information or      sensitive trade secrets, even when those keys are placed in      the hands of trusted agents for recovery purposes.       Under new section 2802, in criminal investigations a third      party holding decryption keys or other decryption assistance      for wire or electronic communications may be required to      release such assistance pursuant to a court order, if the      court issuing the order finds that such assistance is needed      for the decryption of communications covered by the order.      Specifically, such an order for decryption assistance may be      issued upon a finding that the key or assistance is necessary      to decrypt communications or stored data lawfully intercepted      or seized. The standard for release of the key or provision      of decryption assistance is tied directly to the problem at      hand: the need to decrypt a message or information that the      government is otherwise authorized to intercept or obtain.       This will ensure that third parties holding decryption keys      or decryption information need respond to only one type of      compulsory process--a court order. Moreover, this Act will      set a single standard for law enforcement, removing any extra      burden on law enforcement to demonstrate, for example,      probable cause for two separate orders (i.e., for the      encrypted communications or information and for decryption      assistance) and possibly before two different judges (i.e.,      the judge issuing the order for the encrypted communications      or information and the judge issuing the order to the third      party able to provide decryption assistance).       The Act reinforces the principle of minimization. The      decryption assistance provided is limited to the minimum      necessary to access the particular communications or      information specified by court order. Under some key recovery      schemes, release of a key holder's private key--rather than      an individual session key--might provide the ability to      decrypt every communication or stored file ever encrypted by      a particular key owner, or by every user in an entire      corporation, or by every user who was ever a customer of the      key holder. The Act protects against such over broad releases      of keys by requiring the court issuing the order to find that      the decryption assistance being sought is necessary. Private      keys may only be released if no other form of decryption      assistance is available.       Notice of the assistance given will be included as part of      the inventory provided to subjects of the interception      pursuant to current wiretap law standards.       For foreign intelligence investigations, new section 2802      allows FISA orders to direct third-party holders to release      decryption assistance if the court finds the assistance is      needed to decrypt covered communications. Minimization is      also required, though no notice is provided to the target of      the investigation.       Under new section 2802, decryption assistance is only      required from third-parties (i.e., other than those whose      communications are the subject of interception), thereby      avoiding self-incrimination problems.       Finally, new section 2802 generally prohibits any person      from providing decryption assistance for another person's      communications to a governmental entity, except pursuant to      the orders described.       Sec.  2803. Access to decryption assistance for stored      electronic communications or records. New section 2803      governs access to decryption assistance for stored electronic      communications and records.       As noted above, under current law third party decryption      assistance may be disclosed to a governmental entity with      a subpoena or even a mere request and without notice. This      standard is particularly problematic for stored encrypted      data, which may exist in insecure media but rely on      encryption to maintain security; in such cases easy access      to keys destroys the encryption security so heavily relied      upon.       Under new section 2803, third parties holding decryption      keys or other decryption assistance for stored electronic      communications may only release such assistance to a      governmental entity pursuant to (1) a state or federal      warrant (based upon probable cause), with a copy to be served      on the record owner at the same time the warrant is served on      the record holder; (2) a subpoena that must also be served on      the record owner with a meaningful opportunity to challenge      the subpoena; or (3) the consent of the record owner. This      standard closely mirrors the protection that would be      afforded to encryption keys that are actually kept in the      possession of those whose records were encrypted. In the      specific case of decryption assistance for communications      stored incident to transit (such as e-mail), notice may be      delayed under the standards laid out for delayed notice under      current law in section 2705(a)(2) of title 18, United States      Code.       Sec.  2804. Foreign government access to decryption      assistance. New section 2804 creates standards for the U.S.      government to provide decryption assistance to foreign      governments. No law enforcement officer would be permitted to      release decryption keys to a foreign government, but only to      provide     decryption assistance in the form of producing plaintext. No      officer would be permitted to provide decryption assistance      except upon an order requested by the Attorney General or      designee. Such an order could require the production of      decryption keys or assistance to the Attorney General only if      the court finds that (1) the assistance is necessary to      decrypt data the foreign government is authorized to      intercept under foreign law; (2) the foreign country's laws      provide ``adequate protection against arbitrary interference      with respect to privacy rights''; and (3) the assistance is      sought for a criminal investigation of conduct that would      violate U.S. criminal law if committed in the United States.    TITLE III--PRIVACY PROTECTION FOR LIBRARY AND BOOKSTORE RECORDS.       Sec. 301. Wrongful Disclosure of Library and Bookstore      Records.--The Act amends section 2710 of title 18, United      States Code, to extend the privacy protections currently in      place for video rental and sale records to library and book      sale records, whether the transactions take place on-line or      in a physical store.       Section 2710(a) is amended with definitions for the      following new terms: (1) ``book seller'' means any person      engaged in the business of selling books, magazines or other      printed material; (2) ``library'' means an institution which      operates as a public, university, college, or school library;      and (3) ``patron'' means a person who requests or receives      services within, or books or other materials on loan from, a      library.       Section 2710(b) is amended by applying the same privacy      safeguards that apply to video tape rental and sale records      to book sale records. As amended, a book seller who knowingly      discloses personally identifiable information about a      consumer of such seller is liable to an aggrieved person in a      civil action. A book seller is authorized to disclose such      information: (1) to the consumer; (2) with the informed,      written consent of the consumer; (3) to a law enforcement      agency pursuant to a warrant or a court order based upon      probable cause to believe a person is engaging in criminal      activity and the records sought are material to the      investigation of such activity; (4) to any person, if the      disclosure is limited to the names and addresses of consumers      and these consumers have been given the opportunity to      prohibit such disclosure, which does not identify the subject      matter of the material purchased or rented by the consumers;      (5) to any person, if the disclosure is incident to the      ordinary course of business; or (6) pursuant to a court order      in a civil proceeding upon a showing of compelling need and      if the consumer is given reasonable notice and an opportunity      to appear and contest the claim of the person seeking      disclosure.       A new section 2710(c) is added to address privacy      protections for library records. This new subsection provides      that a library which knowingly discloses personally      identifiable information about a patron is liable to the      aggrieved person in a civil action. A library is authorized      to disclose such information: (1) to the patron; (2) with the      informed, written consent of the patron; (3) to a law      enforcement agency pursuant to a warrant or court order based      upon probable cause to believe a person is engaging in      criminal activity and the records sought are material to the      investigation of such activity; (4) to any person, if the      disclosure is limited to the names and addresses of patrons      and the patrons have been given the opportunity to prohibit      such disclosure, which does not identify the subject matter      of the library services used by the patrons; (5) to any      person, if the disclosure is necessary for the retrieval of      overdue materials or the recoupment of compensation for      damaged or lost library materials; or (6) pursuant to a court      order in a civil proceeding upon a showing of compelling need      and if the patron is given reasonable notice and an      opportunity to appear and contest the claim of the person      seeking disclosure.        TITLE IV--PRIVACY PROTECTION FOR SATELLITE HOME VIEWERS       Sec. 401. Privacy Protection for Subscribers of Satellite      Services for Private Home Viewing.--This section amends      section 631 of the Communications Act of 1934 (codified at 47      U.S.C. Sec.  551), to extend the privacy protections      currently in place for subscribers of cable service to      subscribers of satellite home viewing services or other      services offered by cable or satellite carriers or      distributors.       In the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984 (``Cable      Act''), Congress established a nationwide standard for the      privacy protection of cable subscribers. (See H.R. Rep. No.      98-934, at 76, reprinted in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 4655, 4713).      Since the Cable Act was adopted, an entirely new form of      access to television has emerged--home satellite viewing--     which is especially popular in areas not served by cable. Yet      there is no statutory privacy protection for information      collected by home satellite viewing services about their      customers or subscribers. This title fills this gap by      amending the privacy provisions of the Cable Act to cover      home satellite viewing.       The amendments do not change the rules governing access to      cable subscriber information. Instead, they merely rewrite      section 631 to add the words ``satellite home viewing      service'' and ``satellite carrier or distributor'' where      appropriate.       The amendment does not address another inconsistency in the      law, which bears mentioning: should a cable company that      provides Internet services to its customers be subject to the      privacy safeguards in the Cable Act or in the Electronic      Communications Privacy (ECPA), which normally applies to      Internet service providers and contains obligations regarding      the disclosure of personally identifiable information to both      governmental and nongovernmental entities different from      those in the Cable Act? At least one court has noted the      ``statutory riddle raised by the entrance of cable operators      into the Internet services market,'' but declined ``to      resolve such ephemeral puzzles.'' In re Application of the      United States,--F.Supp.2d--, 1999 WL 74192 (D.Mass. Feb. 9,      1999).                                 ______                                       By
