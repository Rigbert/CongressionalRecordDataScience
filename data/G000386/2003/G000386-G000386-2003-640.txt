 President, I have already complimented Senator Santorum and Senator Lieberman for their joint work on most of the provisions of this legislation. I am happy to have Senator Santorum, who is also a member of the Senate Finance Committee, manage a bill that he has been central to getting those provisions into law.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
