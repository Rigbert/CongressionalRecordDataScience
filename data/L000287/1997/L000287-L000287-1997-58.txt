Mr. Speaker, as the House considers legislation which does not allow a fair and open debate, and vote, on the National Endowment for the Arts, I urge my colleagues to consider the words of Elliott Levitas, writer, attorney, former member of the Georgia House of Representatives and former United States Congressman representing the Fourth Congressional District of Georgia:Cultural War Rages in America--All Great Civilizations of The Past Have                   Provided Public Support For The Arts                          (By Elliott Levitas)       Proposals in Congress to abolish the relatively minuscule      public funding for the arts, humanities and noncommercial      public TV and radio lie at the heart of a cultural war raging      in America.       In the face of charges of elitism, budget deficits and      controversial subject matter, the real issue is whether there      is a vital role for government to seed and supplement the      private sector in promoting, preserving and transmitting      American culture.       Every great civilization has provided public support for      its arts and culture. Whether it was Egyptian, Babylonian,      Greek, Roman, Spanish, French, British or whatever, these      towering forebears of our culture all provided essential      support for their artists, writers, thinkers, architects and      dramatists, in addition to funds made available through      private sponsorship by patrons.       The great art traditions of China, Japan, India and the      ancient civilizations of Central and South America, all      derived support and encouragement from the governments.       Societies which did not provide this institutionalized      support did not attain the heights of great artistic      creativity, nor pass it on. We look at the Visigoths, the      Huns, the Tartars and other societies long forgotten because      they did not do so.       Do we believe our American cultures, which enrich the      spiritual life of our people, should be cultivated? If so,      history teaches us that there is an essential role for      government, albeit small. Whom do we wish to emulate, the      Visigoths or the Greeks?       The suggestion that budget deficits can be fought by      eliminating cultural funding is a blatant fraud on an anxious      and credulous public. The total amount of budget support for      the National Endowment for the Arts is less than .009 percent      of governmental expenditures. To eliminate that amount does      not even meet the test of ``every little bit helps.''       Should the arts share across-the-board budget reductions?      Yes. Eliminate the arts funding? No.       Indeed, if we apply the ``cost-benefit'' test, the small      cost returns great benefit to cultural creativity.       No, this issue is not budget deficits, but cultural war.      Groups of modern-day ``know-nothings,'' advocates of thought      control and would-be cultural dictators would just as soon      see the richness of American culture disappear with a new      Dark Age. Their fear of cultural diversity and their demand      for uniformity of mind is what the cultural war is all about.       Nor is elitism a serious argument. Government support for      American culture not only reflects Shakespeare, Beethoven and      Picasso, but also provides for Howard Fenster, folk music,      cowboy poets, Native American crafts and jazz. The issue of      elitism is phony.       Even though in recent years the endowments have vastly      expanded the audiences in the countryside, it has never been      a mass audience, even among the Romans and Greeks. But the      few have usually preserved the gifts of culture for the many.      Those few, who may be more numerous than some politicians      believe, can distill and pass on the essence of our national      cultural treasures.       If we want to avoid the errors of the past and benefit from      its achievement, let us follow the path that all great      civilizations traveled. Let our government continue its      small, but essential, role in providing the seed to ensure      that our diverse American cultures will continue to find      greatness and will be there for future generations as they      enrich our lives today.       Let us follow the Greeks and not the Visigoths.
