President, I wish to congratulate Dr. Susan J. Hunter, president of the University of Maine, on her retirement after 27 years of outstanding service in higher education. Dr. Hunter joined the faculty of the University of Maine at Orono in 1991 as a researcher in cell biology. In 2014, she was named the university's 20th president, the first woman to hold that position.  It is a pleasure to join the people of Maine in expressing gratitude for Dr. Hunter's commitment to higher education. In her many roles during a truly distinguished career--from researcher, to professor, provost, and president--she has been an inspiring leader.  Even if Dr. Hunter had remained solely in the research field, her contributions would be worthy of accolades. In addition to invaluable work in bone cell biology, she served as coprincipal investigator of an award-winning National Science Foundation grant that placed graduate teaching fellows in primary and secondary schools as science demonstrators. She also led the establishment of UMaine's Rising Tide Center, an important initiative to enhance opportunities for women faculty members in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and social-behavioral sciences.  Dr. Hunter's service as an administrator includes chair of the department of biological sciences, associate provost and dean for undergraduate education, executive vice president for academic affairs and provost, and vice chancellor for academic affairs for the entire University of Maine System. Last year, while serving as president of UMaine's flagship campus at Orono, she also became president of the university's regional campus at Machias.  Dr. Hunter's leadership at UMaine played a key role in bringing about advancements in enrollment, fundraising, and advocacy and partnerships. During her presidency, UMaine has recruited its largest incoming classes and the largest number of out-of-state students in the university's 153-year history, and the university has seen a 22-percent increase in private giving to its annual fund. Students and supporters have expressed their confidence in Dr. Hunter's leadership in the most meaningful ways.  Dr. Hunter's contributions reach far beyond the campus. In the community, she has served on the boards of directors of the Maine School of Science and Mathematics, the Bangor Symphony Orchestra, and the Maine Mathematics and Science Alliance, and she worked with the Maine Arts Commission to develop a cultural strategic plan for the State of Maine. Currently, she serves on the boards of Maine & Company and the Maine Development Foundation to foster economic growth and job creation and on the advisory network for the Olympia Snowe Women's Leadership Institute.  Her achievements have been widely recognized. In 2016, Dr. Hunter was inducted into the Deborah Morton Society at the University of New England in honor of her work to advance women in scientific fields. Last year, she received the Wilma Award from the Collins Center for the Arts at the University of Maine for her promotion and enhancement of cultural activities and the Kenneth M. Curtis Leadership Award from the Maine Development Foundation for her commitment to economic opportunity.  In a recent interview, Dr. Hunter said that her leadership decisions have always been guided by the best interests of students and the people of Maine. Her decades of distinguished service and reverence for education have created a legacy that demonstrates how faithfully she has followed that guidance, and that will benefit our great State for many decades to come.                          ____________________
