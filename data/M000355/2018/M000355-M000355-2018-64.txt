 President, after leading the Monroe County government for nearly a decade, my friend County judge-executive Tommy Willett will retire at the end of his term. I would like to take a moment to congratulate him on his accomplishments during his time in office and to thank him for his leadership.  In 2011, Tommy answered the call of public service, stepping away from his successful business career to run for office. The job isn't an easy one. Speaking as a former judge-executive myself, I know firsthand the broad range of responsibilities that fall into the job description. But whatever the challenge, Tommy always worked to better the lives of the men and women of Monroe County.  I would like to mention one particular project I had the privilege to work on with Tommy. More than a decade ago, the community began discussing plans to construct its own water treatment facility. At that time, the county was purchasing water from the city of Tompkinsville, eventually reaching a high cost of nearly $80,000 per month. When county officials brought the idea to my attention, I stepped in to help. In addition to funds raised by the community and at the State level, I directed Federal resources to the project to help complete it. Working together with Tommy for a number of years, I was delighted to see the facility become fully functional earlier this year, with the capacity to pump 2 million gallons of water per day.  The Monroe County Water District's treatment plant is just one example of Tommy's lasting impact on behalf of his constituents. With a constant drive to help Kentuckians however possible, he should be proud of his time in office. As he ends his public service, I extend my warm wishes for a restful retirement. Whatever the future may hold for Tommy, I hope he enjoys more time with his sons, Scott and James, and his four grandchildren, I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in congratulating Judge-Executive Tommy Willett for his public service in Kentucky.
