 President, I would like to take a moment to congratulate two Iowa educators, Kelly Smith Arickx, a teacher at Rockford High School in Nora Springs, IA and Naomi Peuse, an educator at the State Historical Society of Iowa in Des Moines, IA. They were part of a group of 25 educators selected from across America to participate in the National History Day 2004 Summer Teacher Institute, ``Politics and the Press: The Influence of the Media on History.'' The institute took place from July 25 to July 30, 2004, at the University of Maryland in College Park, Maryland.  This select group of participants from across the country had the opportunity to work with prominent journalists and historians. They were exposed to an array of resources, including oral histories and discussions, learning about various primary source materials that can be incorporated into teaching.  I am pleased to recognize Kelly Smith Arickx and Naomi Peuse for their accomplishment in having been selected to participate in the National History Day Summer Teacher Institute. I am proud to have had them representing my home State of Iowa.                          ____________________
