President, we have had 2 weeks of a lot of discussion. We haven't had a chance to vote on amendments mostly because there are some Members who have been objecting to moving forward to consideration of amendments. I think that is regrettable.  We are now to the point where we are going to have a vote on cloture. It is absolutely necessary.
