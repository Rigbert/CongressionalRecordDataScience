Speaker, what is wrong with this picture? Regardless of the yen-dollar exchange rate, United States market share of the Japanese [[Page H5631]] auto and auto part market has remained flat for nearly two decades. As a matter of fact, the import share for all foreign manufacturers in Japan has remained stuck at 4.6 percent for autos and 2.6 percent for auto parts.  The gigantic United States automotive deficit with Japan defies all economic rationale. In 1985, when the yen was 240 to the dollar, the United States had an automotive deficit with Japan of $23.9 billion. Now, with the yen hovering around 80 to the dollar--a 300-percent decrease in the dollar's value against the yen--our automotive trade deficit is on track to break last year's record of $37 billion.  As this chart shows, the facts are on our side. The United States has a trade surplus in the automotive sector with the rest of the world. Isn't it time for Japan to play fair?                          ____________________
