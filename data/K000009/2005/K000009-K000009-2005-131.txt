Chairman, I thank the able gentleman from Cleveland and say that the north coast of Ohio is well represented here today as we help America, through the Kucinich-Kaptur amendment, take another small step for humankind toward energy independence.  This program is budget neutral. All it does is it allows for 30 communities in our country to adapt alternatively fueled vehicles in their public fleets, as well as some of the infrastructure to support it. It allows for those competitive grants to be in the amount up to $15 million as opposed to $20 million. So we reduce the actual amount, and we increase the number of communities, so we at least have an additional 30. It allows greater energy security, greater economic security and, without a doubt, greater environmental security.                              {time}  1045  I want to say thank you to the gentleman, who has been such a leader on this issue, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Kucinich), for Cleveland and for our country. It is important to think about new ways of doing things, to close the book on the 20th century, the petroleum age, and move toward a new energy age for America and the world.  Sixty-two percent of what powers our vehicles today is imported, that is, two-thirds. This is not a sustainable position for the United States, particularly when spot markets in oil are ringing in at over $50, and $55 a barrel. Every family in America is feeling the pain of this. So this program will help us move forward millions of vehicles in the public realm that can help us transition to a new age of energy independence.  I am very sensitive to the gentleman's time and do not want to impose.
