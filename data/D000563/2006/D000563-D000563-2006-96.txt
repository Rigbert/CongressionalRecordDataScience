President, imagine that, observing the fourth anniversary of the death of one of our colleagues, acknowledging his life of public service, and simply asking that the next Congress take up his bill to try to make sure those suffering from mental illness will get fair treatment and compensation under their health insurance plans, I find it hard to believe. But if that is the nature of our business, if we have reached that level of partisanship, then it is regrettable.  I yield the floor.
