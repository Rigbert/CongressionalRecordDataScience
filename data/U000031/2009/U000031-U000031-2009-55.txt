. 3183, the Energy and Water Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2010.  St. Joseph Harbor O&M Dredging  Department: Army Corps of Engineers  Account: Operations & Maintenance  Legal Name of Requesting Entity: Berrien County, Michigan  Address of Requesting Entity: Berrien County Administration Center, 701 Main St., St. Joseph, MI 49085  This request is for securing funds fur dredging both the inner and outer harbor of St. Joseph, Michigan, as well as performing much-needed structural repairs. The inner harbor is a key port for raw materials such as limestone, sand and gravel for state highways. Road and building construction projects in the area receive a majority of their aggregate materials through the three commercial docks located in this harbor. Additionally, it is a major hub for recreational boaters, with over 1,600 boat slips. This project has been authorized through many WRDA acts, is vital to the economic viability of Southwest Michigan, and has the support of the entire community.  The St. Joseph Harbor is an integral cog in the region's economic engine. A recent study by Purdue University gauged the harbor's economic impact at more than $5.5 million dollars and more than 35 local jobs. The St. Joseph Harbor is among the top 50 in commercial activity among Great Lakes Harbors.  Amount: $750,000  Funding Breakdown: The entirety of this funding will go towards dredging to the entrance, inner channel of the harbor and outer harbor. Supplemental funds will be provided by Berrien County and local municipalities.  New Buffalo Federal Channel O&M Dredging  Department: Army Corps of Engineers  Account: Operations & Maintenance  Legal Name of Requesting Entity: City of New Buffalo, Michigan  Address of Requesting Entity: City of New Buffalo, 244 W. Buffalo St., New Buffalo, MI 49117  This request is to secure funds for the dredging of the Federal Channel in New Buffalo Harbor, from the Whittaker Street Bridge to Lake Michigan. The floodwaters from the September 14, 2008 storm event discharged an immense amount of sediment into the federal channel which has restricted the access to Lake Michigan. The project would dredge the federal channel to remove the shoals (much worse then what normal dredging handles) which prevent boats from accessing Lake Michigan. Dredged material would be used to supplement a beach nourishment area established by the ACOE. The federal channel serves boat traffic for the south Lake Michigan area, including residents of Chicagoland and Northern Indiana. New Buffalo is a boating community with an economy that relies entirely on its harbor's access to Lake Michigan via the Gallen River. Without the dredging, the City and surrounding area will see a significant decline in tourism and related jobs. This project is authorized through the River and Harbor Act of 1962.  Amount: $139,000  Funding Breakdown: The entirety of this funding will go toward the dredging of the Federal Channel in New Buffalo Harbor, from the Whittaker Street Bridge to Lake Michigan  Western Michigan University Green Manufacturing and Energy Conscious Design Program  Department: Energy  Account: Office of Science and Biological Research  Legal Name of Requesting Entity: Western Michigan University  Address of Requesting Entity: 1903 W. Michigan Ave., Kalamazoo, MI 49008  This project will assist companies (small companies in particular) to take advantage of environmentally benign and energy conscious materials in their design and manufacturing processes. The proposal is a collaborative project involving WMU College of Engineering, College of Arts and Sciences, College of Business, industry partners and community participants and seeks to enhance economic and workforce development and technology transfer through the advancement and use of environmentally friendly materials, designs, products and manufacturing processes and systems, building upon the already successful manufacturing, environment and energy research centers and programs at WMU.  Amount: $1,000,000  Funding Breakdown: One third of this funding will go to equipment, one third to educational materials development and delivery to employees and students, and one third to program support. Western Michigan University will provide supplemental funding for this S3 million project.                          ____________________
