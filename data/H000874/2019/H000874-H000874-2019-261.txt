 Mr. Speaker, I want to place in historical context, again, this Housepassed a DREAM Act, and we sent it to the Senate and the Senate didn't pass it. So this House, when we were in the majority, did do that, but we couldn't get 60 votes in the Senate. We know that problem. It so happens we were in the majority, but we couldn't get 60 votes for that at that point in time.  We could go on a long time about pointing fingers at who has done what and when, but the fact of the matter is we have some people in real distress. We have some Federal employees who have a responsibility who are being greatly challenged. We need to address that, and I am urging that we do that as quickly as we possibly can.
