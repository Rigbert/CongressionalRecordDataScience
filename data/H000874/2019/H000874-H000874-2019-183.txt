Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I know that Mr. Clyburn and the Clyburn family very much appreciate his condolences and his remarks.   Jim Clyburn and I have known each other for over half a century. His wife, Emily, he met during the course of the civil rights struggle. She, too, was a drum major for justice, as  Jim Clyburn has been.  She has, as the gentleman pointed out, been facing health challenges for some period of time. And, yes, she is in a better place. But as one who has lost his spouse, I know what a difficult time this is for  Jim Clyburn.  I would let all the Members know that there will be a service in Columbia, a wake, on Sunday at 5 o'clock, and the funeral will be in Charleston at 11 a.m. I intend to be in attendance. Any Member, I know, would be welcome to be there as well.   Jim Clyburn has been a giant in this body. He has been a leader on our side of the aisle now for almost 20 years, and before that, a leader of the Congressional Black Caucus and somebody who has been a strong voice, particularly for rural communities and for people who are challenged either because of the color of their skin or their economic status.  I know that Emily was his partner in those efforts, as the gentleman knows. She was a wonderful, warm woman and will be greatly missed. But the gentleman's observation that she is in a better place is one with which I agree, and I know that  Jim Clyburn agrees as well.  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments. I know that all Members join us in sending  Jim Clyburn and the family our deepest sympathy and condolences.
