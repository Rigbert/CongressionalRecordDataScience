President, yesterday, in the New York Times, William Safire had an essay called ``Cut the Apologies.'' I am shortly going to ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record. It perhaps says some things beyond what I might, but I am concerned. I have watched what has happened and the reactions of China to the accidental bombing of their Embassy in Belgrade. I hold no brief for the totally negligent--I might even say stupid--mistake made in the bombing of that Embassy. It is as inexcusable and unexplainable as the maps that brought about the death of the people in the cable car in northern Italy.  Having said that, however, for the Chinese, who will not allow any kind of demonstrations--and haven't since Tiananmen Square--criticizing their own government, to whip people into a frenzy and let them go and destroy much of our Embassy and the British Embassy in Beijing, and to say how shocked they are that this is going on, and that we have done that, demanding all kinds of apologies, frankly, is irresponsible and unimaginable. I can't accept it. I don't know how many people would.  If the Chinese think that by doing this somehow we are now going to jump in and let them join the WTO and everything else, that is a sad mistake. Their conduct is incomprehensible. We have apologized for bombing the Embassy, which we would expect somebody to do with a similar mistake damaging ours. This is a war going on, and things happen, as General Schwarzkopf said, in the fog of war.  China is not the one to lecture the world on free and open demonstrations. China is not the one to lecture us on how we should conduct our economy. China has a great deal to explain on everything from their attempt to steal our secrets, spying on our country, and human rights violations in their own country and their own repression.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Safire's column be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, May 17, 1999]                           Cut the Apologies                          (By William Safire)       Washington.--After a week of whipping up hatred of      Americans by accusing us of deliberately murdering Chinese      journalists in Belgrade, President Jiang Zemin Deigned to      accept a call from The Great Apologizer.       For the fifth time, President Clinton apologized, expressed      regrets, sent condolences, kowtowed and groveled, begging to      be believed that we did not bomb China's embassy on purpose.       But it is America that is owed an apology. After an      accident of war, we have been falsely accused of killing      Chinese with malice aforethought. That is a great insult,      compounded by the calculated trashing of our embassy by a      bused-in mob encouraged by police.       The truth is that Beijing's leaders, worried about      demonstrations on the 10th anniversary next month of the      Tiananmen massacre, are milking this mistake for all it is      worth.       By lying about our intent and suppressing coverage of our      prompt admission of error, the nervous rulers are diverting      their people's anger toward us and away from themselves.       By demanding we investigate the accident, they seek to      water down the current Congressional investigations of their      nuclear spying--a series of penetrations of our laboratories      and political campaigns that was no accident.       By making Clinton beg forgiveness, they are able to cancel      human rights talks while extracting new trade concessions.      The deal: they will accept Clinton's apologies when he caves      in on their application to the World Trade Organizations.       No wonder that no reputable diplomat would accept the      President's pleas to replace our fed-up ambassador in      Beijing. Clinton is now trying to appoint an admiral whose      amiable association with the Chinese military and U.S. arms      contractors will be closely examined by the Senate.       Though Clinton is softer than ever on China, he's taken a      hard line in resisting Congress's investigations into      Beijing's penetration of our nuclear labs and our political      process. His latest trick: the improper use of documents      submitted for intelligence declassification to prepare      advance refutations of evidence of security lapses.       The White House has delayed for four months the three-     volume report on security laxity by the House select      committee headed by Representative Chris Cox. Clinton      spinners are already distributing a packet of reprints of      derogations by offended scientists, China-defenders and      favorite journalists.       Cox has used the ``clearance'' delay to rewrite the turgid      prose and to enliven the report with photographs and diagrams      showing what missiles and satellites were stolen; that might      even awaken television interest.       The Senate Intelligence Committee, headed by Richard Shelby      and Robert Kerrey, is not about to hold still for the abuse      of clearance. After it submitted one of its reports on      nuclear lab laxity for review to protect intelligence      sources, it learned of a refutation of that bipartisan report      in work by the National security Council response machine.       The White House was told that the submission of documents      was for security clearance only. It was not to be used for      (a) advance policy review so that ``rapid response'' would      occur in the same news cycle as the reports' release, or for      (b) leakage of portions to the press for ``inoculation'' to      later reduce its impact as ``old news.''       The intelligence business is not the publicity business.      National security reports are not to be equated with the      Starr report about hanky-panky. The Shelby committee made      plain to the Berger Rapid-Apology Center that if this      undermining of inter-branch comity did not stop forthwith,      ``we're going to zero out the N.S.C. staff budget.'' (By      withholding some $15 million, Congress could force the      spinners onto the Department of Defense payroll or cause      agonizing layoffs in the White House basement).       In both House and Senate, bipartisan committees are      discovering serious intelligence weaknesses: too little      analysis of too much collection. ``If there's a flare-up in      Iraq, North Korea or the Andes,'' worries an investigator,      ``we could not handle it and Kosovo, too.''       The most troubling breakdown is in counterespionage. The      F.B.I. and C.I.A., which are not blameless, are telling      Congress the weakest link is the Department of Justice. What      began as corrupt political protection became dangerous      national security laxity. Who will apologize for that?
