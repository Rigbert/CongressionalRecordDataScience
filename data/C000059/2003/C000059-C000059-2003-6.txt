Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  H.R. 135, introduced by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Linder), and cosponsored by a wide range of Members from both parties, creates a national commission to develop increased water supplies. The gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Linder) and his colleagues have properly recognized that drought is a national problem, not just a Western issue.  This bill creates a process while adhering to States' rights to address this problem. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                              {time}  1100
