I thank my colleagues from Massachusetts and New Jersey.  Understand the situation we are talking about. This is not ordinary life in America. It is a time of a national emergency. It is a time of disaster. God forbid something like 9/11 should occur again; or Hurricane Katrina. It is an extraordinary circumstance where ordinary life is challenged, and we are just this close to seeing our society disintegrate, and the law enforcement officials are trying to keep things together. People are injured. People are pushed out of their homes. Fires are taking place. Chaos is reigning, and they are trying to keep the society together. So they make it clear that in some places, you can't use guns. Where you might have been able to use them under ordinary circumstances, because of a disaster, you cannot use them.
