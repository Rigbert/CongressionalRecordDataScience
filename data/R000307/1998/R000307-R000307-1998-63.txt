President, I thank my distinguished friend, the esteemed chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee. Let me say how much I appreciate his perseverance and patience as we work to try to get what I think is a very good agriculture appropriations bill.  I made some remarks yesterday. I will not take up much time of the Senate to go over that again. But I do have some comments, more especially as to the criticism by those across the aisle in regard to the loan rate and in regard to the Daschle amendment which, I understand, is intended to be of help to the farmers and, more especially, the farmers in the northern plains who are going through a very difficult time.  Mr. President, we have heard that there is no longer a ``safety-net'' for America's farmers. Advocates of this position argue that we must extend marketing loans and remove the caps on loan rates. Based upon recent figures, it is estimated the loan rate for wheat would rise to $3.17 per bushel from its current level of $2.58. However, when you add the transition payments of 63 cents per bushel on the historical base that farmers are receiving for wheat, you have a new safety net of $3.21. We are told raising the loan cap will cost nearly $1.5 billion for one year. And, if we were to come back and make the increase permanent, we are told it would cost $3.5 billion to $4 billion over five years. Why should we approve amendments that will bust the budget when they provide a lower safety net than the current program?  Raising and extending loan rates will not improve prices and producer incomes. Extending the loan rate actually results in lower prices in the long-run. Extending the loan for six months simply gives producers another false hope for holding onto the remainder of last year's crop. Farmers will be holding onto a portion of the 1997 crop, while at the same time harvesting another bumper crop in 1998.  Thus, rolling over the loan rate actually increases the amount of wheat on the market and results in lower prices--not higher prices. Since excess stocks will continue to depress prices, will we then extend the rate again? It will become an endless cycle that will cost billions of dollars, and which will eventually lead to a return to planting requirements and set-aside acres in an attempt to control agricultural output and limit the budgetary effects. Where will we get the offsets the Senate and House will require?  Extending and raising loan rates will only serve to exacerbate the lack of storage associated with the transportation problems in middle America, because it simply causes farmers to hold onto their crops and fill elevator storage spaces. Kansas just harvested its second largest wheat crop in history and there are predictions of record corn and soybean crops in the fall. If we do not move the wheat crop now, it will create transportation problems in the fall that will surpass anything we experienced last year.  I feel it should also be mentioned that advocates of higher or extended loan rates argue that it will allow farmers to hold their crops until after the harvest when prices will rise. To those who advocate this position, I would point out that Kansas State University recently published a reportwhich looked at the years 1981 through 1997 and compared farmers earnings if they held wheat in storage until mid-November versus selling at harvest. In all but five years, farmers ended up with a net loss as storage and interest costs exceeded the gains in price. Simply put, extending and raising the rates provides a false hope for higher profits that most often does not exist.  Mr. President, we must ask what is the purpose of loan rates? Are they intended to be a marketing clearing device or a price support? They cannot be both as the other side of the aisle would. And, if we set price at $3.17 it very well may become a ceiling on price.  Mr. President, raising loan rates is simply not the answer. We need to continue on course and continue to pursue the new trade markets and tax relief that farmers need. And, as I mentioned yesterday, I would remind my colleagues of the meeting 14 Senators had with 12 major farm organizations approximately one month ago. At the top of every organizations wish list was trade, trade, and more trade.  Mr. President, I mentioned yesterday that I like to think I have spent more time on the wagon tongue listening to our farmers than any Member of Congress. And, farmers tell me to leave loan rates alone. They want export markets opened. They want sanctions that shoot them in the foot removed. These are the policies we should be pursuing, not the policies of the past that put our farmers at a competitive disadvantage in the world market.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that two articles, which fit within the restrictions of Senate rules, by Pro Farmer's Washington Bureau Chief Jim Wiesemeyer, be printed in the Record. One is regarding failed policies of the past, and the second one is regarding trade policy.  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From Inside Washington Today, June 18, 1998]       Populist Democrats Again Push Failed Policies of the Past                          (By Jim Wiesemeyer)       Saying ``I told you so'' to any lawmaker and any person or      farmer who either voted for or pushed for the 1996 Freedom to      Farm legislation, a group of decidedly populist Democrat      senators on Wednesday railed at the omnibus farm policy      contained in that legislation and said it was that measure      and not trade problems which alone is the reason for      slumbering U.S. commodity prices.       The group of naysayers to Freedom to Farm who showed up at      a press briefing with very few answers to questions were:      former House Speaker and very likely presidential candidate      Rep. Dick Gephardt (D-Missouri), Senate Minority Leader Tom      Daschle (D-S.D.), and Democrat Sens. Tom Harkin (Iowa), Paul      Wellstone (Minnesota), Kent Conrad (N.D.), Tim Johnson (S.D.)      and Byron Dorgan (N.D.).       What they said and didn't say: Headed by Daschle, the group      squarely and wrongly laid the blame for the current farm      price doldrums with the Freedom to Farm concept enacted into      law in 1996 and signed by President Bill Clinton who did not      receive a veto recommendation from his Secretary of      Agriculture Dan Glickman.       Displaying price charts showing the decline in commodity      prices since 1996, the lawmakers took turns ``briefing'' the      Washington press corps (but very few took questions),      claiming the 1996 Farm Act failed and they could all say ``I      told you so'' to those who voted for the package.       ``This was radical, extreme policy brought on by (House      Majority Leader) Dick Armey (R-Tex.), Gephardt charged.      Others at the gathering quickly chimed in to say it was      merely a ``Republican farm bill.''       Sen. Wellstone pledged an ``all-out, full-court press'' to      get the following four main components of the group's plan      enacted into law: dramatically increasing commodity loans      rates and allowing 6-month loan extensions; addressing      livestock concentration and requiring labels on imported      meat; waiving of sanctions on agricultural trade; making      indemnity payments to farmers.       Where's the proof? The senators cited dramatic downturns in      farm income but based that on data from the Bureau of      Economic Analysis (Commerce Department) regarding personal      income derived from farming.       The group should have referred to a recently completed USDA      analysis of spring wheat farms in the Plains states. That      survey shows that in 1996, the average net cash farm income      for these spring wheat farms was $37,500; in 1997 it was      $14,500; and a projected 1998 net cash farm income of only      $5,000.       The USDA info clearly shows pain, and a crisis for spring      wheat producers in a specific area of the country. But as one      USDA official told me this morning, ``Do we have a crisis in      U.S. agriculture today or a regional crisis, and if we do,      what is the best way to deal with it?''       Certainly a blunt instrument of help would not be to jack      up wheat loan rates to over $4 as proposed by Sen. Conrad.       Populist Democrat senators didn't note popular Freedom to      Farm transition payments. USDA data show that for the 1996,      1997 and 1998 crops (combined), Freedom to Farm legislation      will provide $7 billion to $8 billion in additional payments      to farmers that would have been the case under the prior farm      policy. Talk about indemnity payments!       Sure, if loan rates would not have been capped via the 1996      farm bill, there would have been a larger cash infusion this      year especially for wheat producers, but certainly not the      prior two years relative to those payments I previously      mentioned, and when wheat prices were higher to much higher      than current values.       I asked several USDA analysts to list reasons why U.S.      commodity prices are lower. They listed the following two      major reasons:       1. Lack of export growth.       2. Good grain crops around the world the last three years.       What does the above have to do with Freedom to Farm?      Nothing.       Questions for the populist senators. While the senators      didn't take much if any time to answer reporter questions,      here are a few they should ponder:       Rep. Gephardt labeled Freedom to Farm legislation as a      ``radical extreme policy brought on by (House Majority      Leader) Dick Armey'' (R-Tex.).       Question: Since you will very likely run for president in      the year 2000, why didn't you say that President Clinton      should have vetoed the farm bill? Why didn't you say that      USDA Secretary Glickman should have recommended a veto?       Another question: Rep. Gephardt in the 1985 farm bill      debate, along what Sen. Harkins, pushed mandatory supply      controls. That was soundly repudiated by Congress, which just      so happened to be controlled at the time by Democrats. If      there is one major aspect of Freedom to Farm that most non-     dissident farmers love, it is the planting flexibility      contained in that legislation. Do you agree?       Sen. Byron Dorgan said the group ``didn't have the      details'' regarding their proposals and thus did not know the      costs. ``We're working on a number of things,'' Dorgan said.       Question: It would be costly, and not just in budget      outlays, but in a return to failed farm policies of the past.      Why don't you agree?       A specific question for Sen. Dorgan: You keep pushing for      targeted farm program payments, having done so for what      appears to be over 10 years. Some analysts told me to ask      you, ``What chances do you think of this happening? And are      they simply to provide feel-good comments for the folks back      home?''       Questin to all Democrats: Many Democrats in Congress      honestly say they are showing some fiscal discipline. But to      propose major changes in farm policy without any budget      assumptions runs counter with the previous goal. Question:      What are the costs? And to the extent the agriculture      committees boost spending on any of the Democrat senators'      proposals means a budget offset would have to be found. What      will be cut to pay for your proposals?       Sen. Harkin said that by just removing the loan cap on      wheat, prices for wheat would be 25% higher than current      levels and corn prices would be up 20% from their current      level. Question: U.S. commodities are already having trouble      competing in the export market, why do you think higher      prices at this time would bode well for exports? And would      this not also provide incentive for increased production for      wheat and corn outside the United States, as was the case      under prior U.S. farm policy when loan rates (not an income      transfer tool) were set much higher than market-clearing      levels? And, wouldn't such a scenario cause prices to      eventually be lower than the track they currently are on?       Also, why wouldn't pushing prices far above market-clearing      levels result in government-owned surplus wheat that no one      wants and lead to calls for a return to an ever upward spiral      of set-aside requirements to slow the growth in the mountain      of government-owned grain? Usually the answer is, ``Marketing      loans will take care of that?'' But that raises the question      again: ``At what cost?'' And if marketing loans shouldered      those significant costs, wouldn't they be seen as a subsidy      by the rest of the world and completely undo many years of      work on trade issues and renew the race toward subsidized      production and subsidized exports worldwide?       What many farmers say are the big-ticket issues: Ask a      group of farmers what their long-term issues and concerns are      and you will surely find disagreement, but based on many      conversations with this great industry, they boil down to the      following three areas:       1. Taxes.       2. Environmental regulatory reform.       3. Trade issues (sanctions, denied market access, etc.).       To repeat, farmers in the Northern Plains are hurting and      hurting bad. I met Wednesday with several North Dakota      farmers at the Washington office of the National Farmers      Union. It didn't take many testimonials to feel their pain.      As for the reasons why, they centered on low yields, scab and      drought--compounded by those events happening in successive      years with a crop insurance program unable to cope with those      events. Solution: fix crop insurance.       Is this just an aberration of bad luck? Or, should the      United States come up with a regional assistance program      rather than changing comprehensive U.S. farm policy?       Northern tier farmers need help, but they're certainly not      going to get it based on the political-platform briefing the      stated Democrat senators provided on June 17.       We asked USDA Secretary Glickman to comment on remarks the      Democrat senators made Wednesday. Glickman said current farm      policy needs some modifications to address low prices and      growing problems in some regions.       ``I think the best view is to not engage in recriminations,      but to recognize that there are strengths and weaknesses in      the Freedom to Farm legislation,'' Glickman said. `One of the      weaknesses,'' he added, ``is the inability of my office to      respond when prices are weak and supplies are high. I think      that Freedom to Farm needs some modifications to it, and      we're working on it now.''       Asked how much in payments farmers have received in the      past several years under the Freedom to Farm compared to what      would have been the case under the previous farm policy,      Glickman replied, ``Many billions (of dollars)--I can't tell      you how much. (I've provided him the answer, above.) The      first two years (of current farm policy), there was much more      (paid to farmers via market transition payments) than (would      have been the case) under the old program. This year, it's      hard to tell, but I think in some of the crops it might be      less.''       Regarding current prices and global supply and demand,      Glickman said grain supplies are high for a lot of reasons--     Asian markets are weaker and higher U.S. dollar valuations      have reduced exports, resulting in higher domestic supplies.       Also, Glickman said he lacks the marketing tools available      to previous ag secretaries.       ``I don't have the power to deal with the marketing of      commodities in the way that prior (USDA) secretaries have      had,'' Glickman stated. ``I think those things need to be      fixed.''       Glickman pointed out that the lack of federal disaster      programs for farmers and a crop insurance program that works      better in some parts of the country and not so good in other      regions as a difference in the tools he has available versus      previous USDA chiefs.       ``So, without any kind of intermediate assistance,''      Glickman concluded, ``it makes it difficult to respond to      certain conditions in some regions of the country that have      been currently (adversely) affected.''       Bottom line regarding the populist Democrat senators'      proposals: A wise man once said that one form of insanity is      doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different      result.                                  ____             [From Inside Washington Today, June 19, 1998]               Fast-track Approval Part of Top Ag Agenda                          [By Jim Wiesemeyer)       What a difference a day and different senators make when it      comes to the focus of U.S. agriculture and trade policy.      Thursday we highlighted the drive by some Democrat farm-state      senators to change U.S. farm policy to address the current      very low price and income situation in parts of the country      but especially the Northern Plains. Their plan focused on      higher loan rates, extending commodity loans and making      indemnity payments to producers.       By stark contrast, some Republican farm-state Senators      Thursday morning met with 12 farm and commodity groups to      prioritize the farm policy agenda. These lawmakers and farm      group representatives did not recommend wholesale if any      changes to the 1996 farm act. Instead, they focused on what      can be done in trade and trade policy to keep U.S.      agriculture products moving to overseas markets.       Republican senators huddle with farm commodity groups on      priority agenda. In a meeting Thursday with major farm      groups, the session concluded with the following list of      priorities: Reauthorization of presidential fast-track      trading authority; IMF funding and reforms; passage of      sanctions reform legislation; Most Favored Nation (MFN)      trading designation for China; stronger oversight on GMO and      biotechnology negotiations; full funding for Sen. Dick      Lugar's agricultural research bill; estate tax reform; and      reform of the farm savings system       Farm groups represented at the session: American Farm      Bureau Federation; American Soybean Association; National      Association of Wheat Growers; National Barley Growers      Association; National Corn Growers Association; National      Cattlemen's Beef Association; National Cotton Council of      America; National Grain Sorghum Association; National Grange;      National Oilseed Processors Association; National Pork      Producers Council; and National Sunflower Association.       Senators participating in the agenda-setting confab:      Majority Leader Trend Lott (R-Miss.); Senate Ag Committee      Chairman Dick Lugar (R-Ind.); Senate Ag Appropriations      Chairman Thad Cochran (R-Miss.); Pat Roberts (R-Kan.); Conrad      Burns (R-Mont.); Larry Craig (R-Idaho); Craig Thomas (R-     Wyo.); Rod Grams (R-Minn.); Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa); Dick      Kempthorne (R-Idaho); Chuck Hagel (R-Neb.); Wayne Allard (R-     Colo.); and Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).       What was said and wasn't said: ``Farmers and ranchers tell      us they don't want the government back in their back      pockets,'' says Sen. Burns. ``That means doing everything we      can to open up markets to them and to provide more of the      agricultural dollar to the producer level. We've also      determined that while trade is very important, issues such as      fast track are worthless unless the (Clinton) administration      commits to sending trade negotiators abroad who are sensitive      to the needs of agriculture.''       Burns said that while income averaging and some estate tax      relief has come for farmers, more still needs to be done.       Sen. Lugar says the group agreed that ``the current debate      should not be about changes to the 1996 Farm Bill, as some      are proposing, but what can be done in this new farm      environment to move ahead.'' The Senate ag panel chairman      noted ``there are some, even in the Senate, who are talking      about supply management,'' a policy that Lugar labeled as ``a      defeatist, defensive policy.''       Lugar was asked to comment on proposals unveiled Wednesday      by a group of Democrat senators which included a call to      raise loan rates and to make indemnity payments to farmers.      ``These would not be helpful,'' Lugar responded. ``We've gone      down that trail before. They led to an increase in supplies      so that the price was depressed for years, not just a few      months.''       ``Why people want to repeat history . . .'' Lugar continued      in his pointed comments regarding some Senate Democrats' farm      policy proposals. ``My own view,'' he said, ``is that we      would not change the loan rate, we should not extend the loan      (term), we should not be sending indemnities out, we should      not be sending massive amounts of money. We've got a good,      solid farm policy.''       Sen. Pat Roberts, the ``father of Freedom to Farm'' when he      was House Ag Committee chairman, also responded to      alternative farm policy proposals from a small group of      Democrat senators. He said he would be the first one in line      to back raising loan rates if that was a sound idea. Key word      there is if.       The issue of loan rates, Roberts continued, comes down to a      debate on the purpose of the loan program. ``You have to have      a policy judgment,'' Roberts stated. ``Do you want the loan      rate to be a market-clearing device, or an income protection      device?'' He noted that today, farmers are receiving      ``transition payments that are twice as much as they would      have had under the previous (farm policy) program.''       Roberts zeroed in on farm woes in the Northern Plains. He      said a look at what is causing the trouble in this region      shows: ``Number one, you've had bad weather; ``Number two,      you've had wheat disease for six years; ``Number three,      you've got some real border problems with Canada; ``Number      four, (Northern Plains) cost of production is historically      higher.''       ``There is a serious problem'' in the Northern Plains,      Roberts stressed. ``But what is the answer?'' he asked. He      said a return to the failed policies of the past such as      raising the loan rates ``is a dead-end street.''       Roberts signaled a possible assistance tool ahead for needy      producers when he said he has talked to USDA Secretary Dan      Glickman about credit issues such as getting loans on coming      Freedom to Farm transition payments.       Sen. Chuck Hagel focused on getting the IMF funding package      and fast-track negotiating authority as top priorities.       Hagel admitted that the House Republican leadership will      have to be encouraged to bring these measures up for votes.      But he quickly added, ``Let's recall that all trade issues      have been non-partisan,'' noting that he certainly hopes the      situation remains that way.       Fast-track gets new life. One of the top agenda items Lugar      and other senators mentioned was getting the administration      fast-track trade negotiating authority. Consider the      following recent developments:       Sen. Roberts said that while he can't and won't speak for      House Speaker Newt Gingrich, discussions he's held with      Gingrich indicate a plant to bring fast track to a vote in      the House in September. Roberts says, ``Why wait? Let's do it      now!''       Gingrich, in an interview with CongressDaily earlier this      week, confirmed that Congress will consider fast-track trade      legislation sometime before adjourning this fall. He cited      the ongoing Asian financial crisis as a reason to bolster the      United States' trade position. He said renewing this      authority to negotiate trade deals via fast track would be      good for U.S. business, particularly agriculture.       House Ag Committee Chairman Bob Smith (R-Oregon) said he is      waiting for a response from the Clinton administration to a      previous proposal he made that he estimates could deliver up      to 30 votes for fast track. That could be enough to pass the      contentious trade measure.       Smith sent a letter last month to U.S. Trade Representative      Charlene Barshefsky proposing the administration change      authorizing language in the measure so the House and Senate      Ag panels would have greater authority to review implementing      agreements related to fast track. (In Beijing this week,      Barshefsky welcomed Gingrich's call for a vote on fast-track      trade legislation this year.)       ``If they give me the go-ahead,'' Smith said he could      ``deliver the votes.'' Noting the fast-track measure was      within around 10 votes of achieving House passage last year,      Smith said his idea could help switch as many as 30 votes. He      said his approach would allow members to ``cross over and      they could then go back home and answer the people who say      that agriculture always gets traded out.''       Sen. Grassley this week called on President Clinton to      ``back up his speech that he made in Geneva'' on the      importance of trade. He further called on Clinton to use      ``his power of persuasion'' and the ``power of the office''      to muscle up support for fast track.       Sen. Bob Kerrey (D-Neb.) said that without the ability to      negotiate trade deals and keep U.S. ag trade moving,      ``serious problems facing U.S. agriculture today are apt to      get worse.'' He added that U.S. agriculture is relying      heavily on ``demand in foreign markets.''       Bottom line: sooner or later in this town common sense      prevails. Momentum for getting congressional approval of      fast-track trade negotiating authority is growing. But in the      past, fast-track proponents didn't keep the issue front-and-     center. It looks like farm groups and others have learned      some hard lessons. Frankly, I think fast track would have      passed before if there would have been an actual vote on the      floors of Congress (a minority viewpoint, for sure). Let's      just hope a vote occurs this time, this year. We need to see      the true Hall of Shame of those lawmakers who vote against      authority to simply negotiate. Any trade agreement can be      voted down. But not to give U.S. trade negotiators a chance      can only be deemed for what it is: protectionism in disguise.       And if Rep. Smith gets his worthwhile proposal okayed, then      farm-state lawmakers voting against fast-track would have a      lot of fast explaining to do--to their agribusiness      constituents.
