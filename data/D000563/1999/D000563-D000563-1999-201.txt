MURRAY. The Senator from Illinois is correct; we will not be able to. If our proposal is second degreed, we will not be able to win my amendment and we will not have any accountability. We will not know a year from now how that money was used; we won't know if it made a difference. We will have no accountability; and, frankly, we will not see class sizes reduced in a way that we want them reduced. We know it is important.
