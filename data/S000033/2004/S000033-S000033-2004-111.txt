 Speaker, I am saddened by the degree to which the Republican Leadership has turned this resolution into a partisan political defense of President Bush's view of the war in Iraq. Instead of commending and thanking the men and women in our Armed Forces who are serving so bravely in Iraq, a resolution that would have probably been passed unanimously, this resolution re-writes history and justifies a war that need not have been fought. Yes. Saddam was a terrible dictator, but getting rid of him was not the reason why President Bush told us we had to go to war. The American people were told that we had to invade Iraq because Saddam had weapons of mass destruction that could be used against us, something which turned out not to be true. It is particularly outrageous that, in order to spin the war in as positive light as possible, this resolution does not say one word about our gratitude to the over 560 families who have lost a loved one in Iraq--including six Vermont families--or the over 2,800 soldiers who have been injured. What must these families be thinking when the sacrifice of their loved ones are not even acknowledged in this resolution? If Congressional Republicans really want to say thanks to the troops they should adequately fund veterans' benefits, increase military pay and provide the money to buy the body armor and other equipment our troops need. But using the sacrifice of our troops for partisan political advantage is something that I cannot support.                          ____________________
