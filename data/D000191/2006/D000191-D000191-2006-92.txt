Unfortunately, that would mean that we would have to replicate the debate. It would be better if the chairman just rose in opposition as he is going to later and he voted ``no'' and I voted ``aye'' and we had a recorded vote.  If the gentleman insists on his point of order, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment at this point in time and offer the amendment later. I was offering a way to save the body time.
