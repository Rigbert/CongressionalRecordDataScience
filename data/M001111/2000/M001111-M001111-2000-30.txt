 President, as my colleagues know, I had to return home to Washington state on Thursday of last week to attend the funeral of Mr. Bernie Whitebear. Unfortunately, I missed a series of roll call votes on H.R. 4461, the fiscal year 2001 agriculture appropriations bill, and the vote on the Conference Report of H.R. 4810, marriage tax penalty legislation. I wanted to take this opportunity to state for the Record how I would have voted had I been present.  On Roll Call Vote Number 221, the Harkin Amendment Number 3938, I would have voted ``Yea.''  On Roll Call Vote Number 222, the Wellstone Amendment Number 3919, I would have voted ``Yea.''  On Roll Call Vote Number 223, the Specter Amendment Number 3958, I would have voted ``Yea.''  On Roll Call Vote Number 224, on the question of whether the Durbin Amendment Number 3980 is germane to H.R. 4461, I would have voted ``Yea.''  On Roll Call Vote Number 225, on final passage of H.R. 4461, I would have voted ``Yea.''  On Roll Call Vote Number 226, on final passage of the Conference Report of H.R. 4810, I would have voted ``Nay.''                          ____________________
