Speaker, I rise today as a cosponsor and strong supporter of H.R. 545--the Native American Methamphetamine Enforcement and Treatment Act of 2007.  As a cofounder and co-chair of the bipartisan Congressional Caucus to Fight and Control Methamphetamine, I am keenly aware of the threat that is our Nation's meth epidemic.  Methamphetamine has devastating societal costs. It is the source of violent crimes against people and property; increased suicide rates; heightened risks of hepatitis C and HIV/AIDS; increased need for more foster care placements for children of users; and environmental impacts from manufacturing facilities.  This highly addictive drug is a killer that shows no deference to region, race or ethnicity--it preys on all mankind.  Unfortunately, meth use thrives in some communities more than others. Native Americans suffer from higher than average rates of drug use as found in a recent NIH study. The Department of Health and Human Services estimates that 1.7 percent of Native Americans used meth in 2004--a per capita rate more than double that of Whites--the largest user population.  It is imperative that we assist our Native American communities and that is exactly what this bill does.  A year ago the President signed into law the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005 as part of the PATRIOT Act Reauthorization bill. The bill was a true bipartisan, bicameral effort that has provided comprehensive measures to address our Nation's methamphetamine problem. However, the bill did not specify that Native Americans would be eligible for funding within the three grant programs authorized and mentioned by my colleagues. H.R. 545 ensures that Native Americans will have access to the grant funds.  I urge unanimous support for this commonsense legislation.
