Seventy-five families came together, and plans were laid to build a church for the small but growing community of new Americans.  Before year's end, just in time for Christmas mass, an old stable was transformed into a chapel at a cost of just under $2,800 and much hard work. That modest chapel was named St. Peter's--the rock of the Church on the rocky coast of Maine.  By the mid-1920s, the parish numbered nearly 1,000 families and the thriving Italian-American community needed a larger spiritual home. Father Teresio DiMingo, who took the reins of the congregation in 1927, went house-to-house throughout Portland's Little Italy neighborhood soliciting funds, and found generosity at every door.  The new church was under construction in 1929 when disaster struck--the stock market crash and the ensuing Great Depression. Father DiMingo returned the contributions to those in need. He matched that act of compassion with determination, and continued the construction with his own life savings.  The Church of St. Peter was dedicated that August. That great celebration included the blessing of Father DiMingo's second great gift to his parish--a cross made from fragments of the True Cross.  Since that day, worshipers have noticed a curious inscription above the doorway--the letters ``L & L.'' That was yet another gift from Father DiMingo. Those letters represent the Latin words for ``him'' and ``her.'' St. Peter's was then, and is today, a church for families.  Today, in this centennial year, the families of St. Peter's continue to build on that solid foundation. Their vibrant church remains a rock of faith.  And it grows as a center of charity and caring. In the early 1950s, an Italian priest came to America seeking aid for children orphaned during the Second World War. The generous response from Portland led to the founding of the Italian Heritage Center, which continues to enrich the city with a culture of great food, music, and festivals.  That a small fellowship of faith was born in a stable and grew into a something mighty and lasting is more than powerful symbolism. It is a testament to the spirit, the resolve, and the energy of Portland's Italian-American community. On the 100th anniversary of St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church, I offer the members of that parish the traditional Italian wish for a long life of health and happiness--``Cent'anni!''                          ____________________
