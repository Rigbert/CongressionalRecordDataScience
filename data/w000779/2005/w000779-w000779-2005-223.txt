President, several weeks ago, I outlined what I believed this country needs to do in order to address the true issues related to how we care for those who are dying. Today, I am introducing 3 bills to improve access to pain management, increase the number of providers trained to care for those with life-threatening illness, and improve the Medicare hospice benefit.  Our medical system is geared towards curing patients, and gives short shrift to those we cannot cure. Modern advances in technology allow us to live longer, but that also means that many of us will live longer with chronic diseases including pain.  The Conquering Pain Act will help those patients living and dying in pain, support their families and assist providers in getting information and guidance. This legislation will provide an opportunity for the country to develop and test different ways of providing pain management to patients 24 hours a day, seven days a week. It would create and fund regional networks to assist patients so they would not have to wait until normal business hours to get relief and help providers receive timely information and guidance as they treat difficult cases. This bill would create a website and require access to it in health care settings so families, patients and providers can have instant information. In addition, the bill requires several studies so we can better understand the other roadblocks for patients seeking pain management. These roadblocks include the lack of health insurance coverage for pain management and the interaction of the enforcement of laws concerning controlled substances and the delivery of appropriate pain management. I am pleased that my colleague from Oregon is cosponsoring the Conquering Pain Act.  Another aspect of our health care system that needs strengthening, is in assuring that we have providers who know how to provide support and comfort care to the dying. The Palliative Care Training Act will increase the number of providers trained in palliative care. Palliative care is an approach that improves the quality of life of patients and their families facing the problems associated with life-threatening illness. It does so through the prevention and relief of suffering by early identification, assessment and treatment of pain and other problems. Palliative care affirms life and regards dying as a normal process. It neither hastens nor postpones death and is applicable early in the course of illness, in conjunction with other therapies that are intended to prolong life, such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy, and offers a support system to help patients live as actively as possible until death.  My legislation provides grants to individuals with appointments as junior faculty at accredited medical schools so they will teach other providers palliative care. This is modeled after existing awards for the training of other specialties. When it comes down to it, assuring there is faculty in schools to teach this area of medicine, is an inexpensive way of strengthening the health care system in providing this needed care. I am pleased to note that when the National Hospice and Palliative Care Association recently testified before the Senate Health, Education and Labor Committee, they identified this legislation as addressing an important need.  As we look at how to better care for those at the end of life, Medicare's hospice benefit bears examination. When the benefit was added to Medicare, it was hailed as a cost effective benefit that would assist many. In truth, few Americans know what hospice really is and the benefits it can provide. Too often seniors are advised of the benefits too late to get the full effect of the medical, social and spiritual support this benefit can provide. Part of the reason for this is Medicare requires the patient to choose between continuing to seek ``curative'' care or hospice and palliative care. This means that literally the patient must choose between the hope of a cure and accepting that they are dying. Not many of us would want to give up seeking a cure or want to give up hope. However, that is what the Medicare program requires now. The Medicare Hospice Demonstration Act tests the idea that patients would not have to give up seeking ``curative'' care, to get hospice. It is my belief that as people experience what hospice can do for them and for their families, they will find they can accept living the end of their lives with hospice and palliative care instead of seeking less effective care that will not cure them or enhance the quality of their life.  It the U.S. Senate is going to examine end of life issues, we should not just look at legal issues. I believe these proposals are essential elements of the health care system that need to be supported and strengthened.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bills be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 999       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

Congress finds that--       (1) pain is often left untreated or under-treated      especially among older patients, African Americans, Hispanics      and other minorities, and children;       (2) chronic pain is a public health problem affecting at      least 50,000,000 Americans through some form of persisting or      recurring symptom;       (3) 40 to 50 percent of patients experience moderate to      severe pain at least half the time in their last days of      life;       (4) 70 to 80 percent of cancer patients experience      significant pain during their illness;       (5) one in 7 nursing home residents experience persistent      pain that may diminish their quality of life;       (6) despite the best intentions of physicians, nurses,      pharmacists, and other health care professionals, pain is      often under-treated because of the inadequate training of      clinicians in pain management;       (7) despite the best intentions of physicians, nurses,      pharmacists, mental health professionals, and other health      care professionals, pain and symptom management is often      suboptimal because the health care system has focused on cure      of disease rather than the management of a patient's pain and      other symptoms;       (8) the technology and scientific basis to adequately      manage most pain is known;       (9) pain should be considered the fifth vital sign; and       (10) coordination of Federal efforts is needed to improve      access to high quality effective pain and symptom management      in order to assure the needs of chronic pain patients and      those who are terminally ill are met.     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.       In this Act:       (1) Chronic pain.--The term ``chronic pain'' means a pain      state that is persistent and in which the cause of the pain      cannot be removed or otherwise alleviated.

GUIDELINES FOR THE TREATMENT OF PAIN.       (a) Development of Website.--Not later than 2 months after      the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary, acting      through the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, shall      develop and maintain an Internet website to provide      information to individuals, health care practitioners, and      health facilities concerning evidence-based practice      guidelines developed for the treatment of physical and      psychological pain. Websites in existence on such date may be      used if such websites meet the requirements of this section.       (b) Requirements.--The website established under subsection      (a) shall--       (1) be designed to be quickly referenced by health care      practitioners; and       (2) provide for the updating of guidelines as scientific      data warrants.       (c) Provider Access to Guidelines.--       (1) In general.--In establishing the website under      subsection (a), the Secretary shall ensure that health care      facilities have made the website known to health care      practitioners and that the website is easily available to all      health care personnel providing care or services at a health      care facility.       (2) Use of certain equipment.--In making the information      described in paragraph (1) available to health care      personnel, the facility involved shall--       (A) ensure that such personnel have access to the website      through the computer equipment of the facility;       (B) carry out efforts to inform personnel at the facility      of the location of such equipment; and       (C) ensure that patients, caregivers, and support groups      are provided with access to the website.       (3) Rural areas.--       (A) In general.--A health care facility, particularly a      facility located in a rural or underserved area, without      access to the Internet shall provide an alternative means of      providing practice guideline information to all health care      personnel.       (B) Alternative means.--The Secretary shall determine      appropriate alternative means by which a health care facility      may make available practice guideline information on a 24-     hour basis, 7 days a week if the facility does not have      Internet access. The criteria for adopting such alternative      means should be clear in permitting facilities to develop      alternative means without placing a significant financial      burden on the facility and in permitting flexibility for      facilities to develop alternative means of making guidelines      available. Such criteria shall be published in the Federal      Register.     SEC. 102. PATIENT EXPECTATIONS TO HAVE PAIN AND SYMPTOM                    MANAGEMENT.

Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Each year more than \1/3\ of the people who die suffer      from a chronic illness.       (2) Approximately \1/3\ of Americans are unsure about whom      to contact to get the best care during life's last stages.       (3) Americans want a team of professionals to care for the      patient at the end of life.       (4) Americans want emotional and spiritual support for the      patient and family.       (5) Ninety percent of Americans do not realize that hospice      care is a benefit provided under the medicare program under      title XVIII of the Social Security Act.       (6) Data of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services      show that beneficiaries were enrolled in hospice for an      average of less than 7 weeks in 1998, far less than the full      6-month benefit under the medicare program.       (7) According to the most recent data available, although      more medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in hospice, the      medicare length of stay has declined.       (8) Use of hospice among medicare beneficiaries has been      decreasing, from a high of 59 days in 1995 to less than 48      days in 1998.     SEC. 3.
