Chairman, I thank the gentleman for asking that important question. Let me first say that it is clearly the intent of Congress that the market transition payment provided by the 7-year production flexibility contract is an express and unmistakable contract between the United States and the owner and operator of farmland. Because the market transition payment is based on the 7-year contract it is the intent of the legislation that the payment is guaranteed.
