' Only one out of three kids is currently enrolled in Head Start--that early learning experience which gives kids a chance to be successful in the classroom. Only a third of the kids who are struggling in school because of poverty in their family and circumstances beyond their control receive any help whatsoever from the Federal Government. What we are told by the Senator from North Dakota is there are no additional funds; we will still be stuck at one out of three when this is all over. I say to the Senator from Minnesota, two out of three kids are going to be left behind by the Republican budget resolution which we are going to be asked to vote for tomorrow.  I do not know if the Senator sees it that way. We certainly aren't getting the resources necessary to making sure no child is left behind.
