 I certainly hope that we can do so. And I am pleased to hear that we are having discussions so that that will not be a matter of contention. As you know, we had 4,000 FAA employees and about 71,000 or so contractor, private sector employees who were laid off for a period of time because of the failure to get agreement with the rider that was included in the bill that we passed over to them. I'm hopeful that we don't have a recurrence of that situation because it would be very harmful not just to those 75,000 people but to the FAA and generally, so I'm hopeful that we can work that out.  The President, Mr. Leader, spoke to us last night about a jobs program. I know that you have made comments with reference to shifting focus from cuts to jobs. We think that's appropriate; we appreciate that observation. But do you have any idea of how soon we may get to the President's proposal on job creation and trying to get our economy growing again? You made some, I think, positive comments and the Speaker has made some positive comments. I think those are welcome. But can you give me some idea, given the President's sense of urgency and I think the sense of the American people of the urgency of trying to create jobs and give them some more resources with which to support themselves and their families, and to invest and to comprehensively try to staunch the loss of teachers and police and fire personnel that each one of our communities is experiencing?  I yield to my friend.
