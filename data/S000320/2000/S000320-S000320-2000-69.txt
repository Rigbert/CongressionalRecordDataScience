 President, I was not going to comment on this provision today, as I am trying to expedite consideration of the transportation appropriations bill and did not want any statement by me to delay the conclusion of the Senate's consideration of the measure.  However, since I heard the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee and the ranking member of the Environment and Public Works Committee come out in opposition to this measure, I could not miss the opportunity to stand with them in opposition to include this provision on the Transportation appropriations bill. Often we find ourselves in disagreement on individual amendments, so when the chance arises to be on the same side with them, I did not want to miss the chance.  Further, I do believe that in this particular instance flexibility is a dangerous tool to be giving Amtrak. It is one thing to grant special dispensation in the case of increasing service or in unique circumstances, but my concern here is that Amtrak will use the provision to leverage State to shift badly needed highway dollars to simply maintaining already failing Amtrak service.  This is one of those circumstances of needing to be careful what you wish for--many States may find the they have fewer highway dollars and the same Amtrak service at the end of the day if this provision were to pass.  I urge my colleagues to reject this provision on this bill.
