Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, I will be brief. In this title, unfortunately, as I mentioned in my opening statement, we find a number of cuts that I think are inappropriate.  Mr. Chairman, I am not, frankly, going to offer any amendments. Some are not in order and I understand that and I have discussed with the gentleman from Iowa [Mr. Lightfoot], my friend the gentleman's perception that a couple of these are not in order.  For instance, asking to reinstate the funding for the Council of Economic Advisors, the White House residents, the special assistants to the President, the National Security Council, the Office of Administration and the Office of Management and Budget, all of which have been cut.  Mr. Chairman, I simply rise to express opposition to some of these cuts; not all. The OMB, obviously, is subject to scrutiny review and to such budget action as we deem appropriate. But in terms of the internal agencies of the White House itself, that is the President's personal staff to accomplish his objectives as President, not as leader of the executive department but as President and chief policymaker of the land.  The fact of the matter is, Mr. Chairman, I said earlier, in times past we did not cut those sums under President Reagan and President Bush. There were some exceptions to that statement that I have just made, but it proved the rule.  I regret that we had these cuts, contrary to my chairman, I believe some of them are pretty significant, but we will not be offering amendments at this time and I will hope that we can restore these in conference.
