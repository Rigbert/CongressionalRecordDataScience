 President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time to be determined by the majority leader, in consultation with the Democratic leader, the Senate proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 28, S. 754; I further ask that Senator Burr then be recognized to offer the Burr-Feinstein substitute amendment and that it be in order for the bill managers or their designees to offer up to 10 first-degree amendments relevant to the subject matter per side.
