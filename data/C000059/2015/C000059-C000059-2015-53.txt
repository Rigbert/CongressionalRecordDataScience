Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I thank the gentleman.  Again, Mr. Chairman, I think this is a program that has worked, continues to work, and has had significant improvement in my area in California and, I know, throughout the United States, where we have a program that actually does work.  Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. McCollum), my ranking member, who has a couple of comments.  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the gentleman from California's opposition to this amendment.  It has been used in my State and States all over to improve air quality, and, yes, pollutants have been cut. But as I just pointed out, Mr. Chairman, we still have a long way to go before we can turn to our children and say that we did everything we could to make sure that respiratory illness is decreased and that the air quality in this country is better.  So I strongly oppose this amendment, and I thank the gentleman from California for his opposition to it as well.
