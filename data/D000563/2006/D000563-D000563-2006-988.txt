President, the Inhofe language in this amendmentcontains two basic parts. In the first part, we can talk about changing a word or two, but we all basically agree on it. We basically agree that to be successful in America, you must speak English. I imagine there are people on the margins of our society who survive without a command of English, but that is where they will remain. It is rare that a person in America reaches a level of success without a mastery of English. As I go about the State of Illinois and the city of Chicago, where so many people speak many different languages, it is well understood that learning English is the first step toward becoming an American and becoming successful in America. We don't argue about that.
