Speaker, the rule before us contains a brutal breach of contract with America's public servants. Markup of similar legislation, as the ranking member, the gentlewoman from Illinois [Mrs. Collins], has said, was rejected on March 15 because a majority did not support this provision.  The chairman of this committee who brings this bill to the floor said that 2 million Americans were getting a tax increase so that the wealthiest in America could get a tax decrease, because retirement benefits are an integral part of the retirement package that we offer to attract and retain top-quality Federal personnel. We should not make hasty, ill-considered, and not supported by a majority of the committee of jurisdiction decisions by the Committee on Rules, by the chairman's own admission, not having jurisdiction over this matter.  The chairman said it is traditional not to have amendments to tax bills. If this is a tax bill and if title IV is a tax bill, it should take three-fifths of this body to increase the taxes on 2 million Americans.  Proponents of this proposal have offered only one justification: We need to pay for the tax cut. There has been some argument about an unfunded liability, but the Congressional Research Service looked at this issue, is the unfunded liability of CRS a problem? And their answer was no, we have a system that is paid for. But everybody agrees that the Federal Employment Retirement System [FERS] is fully paid for, and it is included in this, a brutal breach of contract, my friends, in this, your last item.  Reject this rule. Reject this brutal breach of contract. Reject this ill-considered tax policy.
