San Clemente has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Susan Ritschel is one of these individuals. On February 19, 2009, the San Clemente Chamber of Commerce will honor Susan as the ``2008 Citizen of the Year.''  I've known Susan for several years and can attest to all that she does for the community of San Clemente. Susan served on the San Clemente Planning Commission as Commissioner after which she served on the San Clemente City Council for two terms and was mayor of the city. Susan is a former president of the Orange County Division of the League of California Cities and a board member and chair of the San Diego Regional Water Quality Control Board and was the Orange County planning commissioner.  Susan's accomplishments in 2008 are extraordinary. She was the honorary chair of the Capital Campaign for the new Dorothy Visser Senior Center in San Clemente. I was honored to join Susan for a short leg of her 1,000 miles to raise funds for the Senior Center. She also planned and held a major fundraiser entitled ``Cruising to our Destination'' as well as oversaw and coordinated outreach to foundations. Susan's passion for helping seniors in our community was the driving force in gathering support for the Dorothy Visser Senior Center from legislators at all levels as well as businesses, service clubs and other entities. Susan developed and implemented a Capital Campaign, which raised over 2.1 million dollars in pledges and payments to meet the Campaign goal.  In short, there is nothing Susan cannot do once she puts her mind to it. Susan Ritschel is a model citizen and in 2008 she worked untiringly to improve the lives of San Clemente seniors. She is held in high esteem by the city of San Clemente, the business community and the many people that she impacts everyday in a positive way.  Susan's tireless passion for community service has contributed immensely to the betterment of the community of San Clemente, California, and especially to the senior community. I am proud to call Susan a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for her service and salute her as she receives the much-deserved ``2008 Citizen of the Year'' Award.                          ____________________
