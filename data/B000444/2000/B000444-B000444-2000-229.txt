 For 20 years, it has enabled the FBI to keep track of major threats to our security while preserving the constitutional rights of Americans. Basically, it provides for a sort of super search warrant, allowing the FBI, under certain unique circumstances, to eavesdrop upon activities, after showing a probable cause to a Federal judge, without having to disclose this eavesdropping in ways that they would have to under a normal warrant for a wiretap or a physical search.  FISA has been very useful to deal with terrorism, and also with espionage cases.  Senator Specter has undertaken an effort to look into what may or may not have transpired at our National Laboratories in the celebrated case of Wen Ho Lee and others. This has been the subject of some very legitimate discussion, and occasionally some partisan discussion. But knowing Senator Specter as long as I have, I do not doubt his desire to look into these cases that have transpired, and the consequences of any leakage of classified information from any of our National Laboratories, for the primary purpose of seeing to it that it does not happen again, if in fact it did happen, as well as to determine what did happen.  Senator Specter and Senator Torricelli have been looking into these recent cases, especially, as I said, the case of Wen Ho Lee at Los Alamos National Laboratory. As a result of that inquiry, Senator Specter is proposing what I think is a very important series of sensible amendments to this act we call FISA. I am pleased to cosponsor this bill, having been an original author of that legislation in 1978, along with Birch Bayh and others.  The initial bill with which Senator Specter approached me and others had a few areas where I thought it could be improved. I wish to publicly thank Senator Specter for agreeing to the changes I suggested in his proposed legislation.  One of the dilemmas that exists, in the debate about whether the Attorney General and the Justice Department and/or the FBI were reading from the same page in the hymnal on how to investigate the Wen Ho Lee case, is the issue of whether the FBI communicated enough information to the Attorney General so that, under the reading of the FISA law, the Attorney General could conclude that there was sufficient reason to get a search or electronic surveillance court order. There has been a little bit of disagreement, at a minimum, between the FBI and the Justice Department as to who said what, when, and what request was made when. It has led to a serious political controversy. I think it has also led, as a consequence, on both sides of the aisle, to some posturing and partisanship about a significant national security issue.  One of Senator Specter's most important ideas in this bill, one which is going to seem commonsensical to most Americans, is to make it clear that if something is of such consequence that the Director of the FBI believes there should be a FISA hearing and authority granted to allow the FBI to use invasive measures to eavesdrop upon conversations and/or get records, for example, from computer data and the like, if it is that important, the FBI Director can, under this new amendment to FISA, put that request in writing to the Attorney General and the Attorney General, whoever that may be, then has to personally sign off or not sign off, so we avoid this debate that is taking place now about whether second level people or third level people made the right judgment or wrong judgment, and whether or not there was any malfeasance.  So this is a very practical solution. If this legislation had been in place 3 years ago, 5 years ago, there would be no doubt as to what happened. Had the FBI said this is critical and this is national security, the Attorney General personally would have had to say yes or no. That is where the record is unclear in the Wen Ho Lee case. This bill would eliminate such doubt in future similar cases if and when they arise, and they surely will arise.  Section 2 of this bill permits the judge to consider the past activities of the target of an investigation--that is, the person upon whom they want to eavesdrop and/or whose records they want to secretly examine. So, for example, the Attorney General would be able to say, in a closed FISA hearing: Your Honor, not only do we think this is justified because of some current activity, but we can show you evidence that in 1991 they were engaged in this suspicious activity, in 1993 they were engaged in that, in 1995 they were engaged in this, therefore lending greater credibility to the argument that a FISA court order should be issued by the judge.  Again, in this Wen Ho Lee case, and other cases that Senator Specter has examined, there has been discussion of the fact that sometimes these folks had been under investigation before. Would that not lend greater weight to the need for this FISA request to be granted? So we clear that up in this legislation, rather than only allowing the target's current activity to be brought up.  Section 3 of this proposal requires the FISA court to be told if the target of a proposed search or surveillance has a relationship with a Federal law enforcement or intelligence agency. This came up in this case as well. The case is being investigated. It turns out at some point one of the persons in the past had been also a source for the FBI. The FBI had gone to this person and said: Will you be a source for us, looking into the possibility of some illegal activity? Then that very person becomes the target, and that very person is never able to tell, nor does the FBI or the CIA say: By the way, Your Honor, we were working with them. That is why they went ahead and did the following.  Up to now, when the Federal Government has asked for a FISA court judge to give this surveillance authority, it has not been required to say: By the way, Your Honor, this person in the past had worked with us as a source, as a person cooperating with us.  This is a new and useful protection for Americans, because the conduct that might seem suspicious could be a result of what the law enforcement agency had actually asked them to do. It seems only fair to the target to be able to have that information known to the judge.  This is typical of the Senator from Pennsylvania, that he looks out for individual rights as well as the interests of law enforcement.  There are several other interesting provisions in this bill, including some to improve relations between the FBI and other agencies, and I am sure there will be further refinements in this bill when it is considered by the Judiciary Committee. The important thing is that Senator Specter is working, I think effectively and in a bipartisan manner, to ensure that his inquiry into the Wen Ho Lee case leads to useful changes and not just to partisan recriminations. I compliment him on that, because the purpose of oversight is not only to find out who struck John but, in the national interest, to find the best way to prevent something such as this from happening again. So I compliment him and again thank him for acceding to the more than several changes I asked for in this legislation.  I think the amendments to existing law that this bill will enact are good amendments. I think America will be well served, and I would argue that the individual rights of Americans will be in no greater jeopardy after this passes than they ever were. They are protected; they will continue to be protected; and some of these changes willeven help to further protect the rights of individual Americans.  I yield the floor.                                 ______                                       By
