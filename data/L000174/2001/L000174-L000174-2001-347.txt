President, I rise today to congratulate Senator Carnahan on the introduction of S. 1250. I am an original co-sponsor of her legislation that deals with health care shortfalls among members of the National Guard and Reserve. This bill will enable citizen-soldiers to receive health insurance coverage for up to one year following an extended deployment. It is an important part of a larger effort to ensure that all members of the National Guard and Reserve have adequate health insurance.  This bill arises out of the changing role of the National Guard and Reserve in defending our Nation. During the Cold War, the military reserves served as an ace-in-the-hole, ready to fight but held back as a force of last resort. As our military posture has shifted, reservists have started supplementing active forces and taken up a greater share of the burden of projecting our national military presence abroad.  In many cases, these proud men and women are serving side-by-side with their active duty counterparts in deployments that can last upward of six months. I will not repeat many of the facts and figures that Senator Carnahan so adeptly underscored in her statement, but, suffice to say here, our citizen-soldiers are experiencing all of the same hardships, challenges, dangers that full-time servicemembers go through every time they leave their barracks or launch into the skies.  This courage and sacrifice deserves our support, both in symbolic and concrete terms. Unfortunately, many are experiencing difficulties as they transition back-and-forth between their usual, employer-provided health coverage and the military TRICARE Prime coverage they receive when they deploy longer than 60 days. More disturbing are the cases where a reservist might be between jobs in their professions, go on an extended deployment, and return to that unemployed status with no health insurance coverage at all. There are innumerable variations on each one of these stories, but each points towards a larger problem.  Cases like those add up, inevitably impacting military readiness and raising troubling moral questions. Military readiness diminishes when soldiers, sailors, Marines, and airmen arrive for deployment less healthy than possible. Basic questions of fairness come into play when two people can do exactly the same job, but receive different levels of respect and gratitude from the country. Congress has the responsibility to deal with these inequities and tailor a solution to address the problem.  Recently, Senators Carnahan, DeWine, Daschle, Cochran, Johnson, and Snowe joined me to introducing S. 1119, the Selected Reserve Health Care Act. This bill commissions an independent, detailed study of the health insurance needs of our citizen-soldiers, but, more importantly, expresses the sense of Congress that every reservist should have full health care coverage. This is a long-term goal that may take some time to achieve. In the meantime, though, we should take steps to move us in the right direction.  Senator Carnahan's legislation will ensure a smooth transition back to civilian employment after an extended deployment. It increases the time that a member of the reserve can remain on TRICARE following deployment from one month to a year. Though it merely extends an existing benefit, it will provide a much-needed stopgap for those who are unemployed or facing difficulties with their civilian insurance providers. This legislation is sensible and affordable, finding a balance between our responsibilities to our servicemembers and our responsibilities as caretakers of the national treasury.  Senator Carnahan has shown tremendous leadership on this issue, not only co-sponsoring a companion legislation that I introduced almost a month ago, but, more importantly, by coming up with a realistic, concrete step to start addressing this complex problem today. I am happy to be an original co-sponsor of this legislation, and I look forward to working with her to enact both of these bills.                                 ______                                       By
