I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time.  Mr. Speaker, I would ask the gentlewoman if she would just respond. Again, I am a proponent of prospective flow control. We did not win that one. We tried hard. There are a sufficient number of Members who disagree with that that we were unable to get that in there.  The compromise that is struck here says that anybody who obligated funds, expended funds, or sold bonds prior to the Carbone decision on May 16, 1994, they are included, they are grandfathered. It is my understanding that those in your locale did so after the fact, after Carbone had been handed down.
