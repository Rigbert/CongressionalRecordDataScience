 President, today I have the distinct honor of welcoming my dear friend, Burmese State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, as she visits the Capitol.  Daw Suu is an incredible woman with an incredible life story. She has endured much since prodemocracy protests first swept her country many years ago. What followed was a story made for Hollywood. In fact, it is a story that Hollywood has made. The story of Aung San Suu Kyi--of the longtime political prisoner who had become the voice of her people, then de facto leader of her country--is about more than ``The Lady'' herself; it is about the journey of a country and a people.  I first learned of that journey decades ago as I read of Daw Suu's heroic support for democratic reform, peaceful reconciliation, and human rights in her country. It may not have been the most popular political call back then, but it was important. I decided then to make this cause my own whenever possible. Over the years, that has meant sponsoring needed sanctions on the previous Burmese regime, it has meant promoting political and constitutional reforms and meeting with Burmese leaders, and it has meant keeping in close contact with Daw Suu. Whatever the task, it has been an honor to do my own small part to advocate for change in Burma and support my friend.  It has been truly remarkable to see the changes that have taken hold in Burma in recent years--changes that once seemed literally unattainable. Last year the world looked on as Daw Suu led her National League for Democracy to victory in Burma's general election. For those keeping score, this was actually the second time she had done this, but, unlike the election in 1990, these results were actually accepted by the regime. It was a moment many of us had eagerly awaited for decades, and in many ways it reaffirmed the purpose behind Daw Suu's life's work, her great sacrifice, and her indestructible resolve. It was also a reminder of the many challenges that still face the Burmese people, such as addressing much needed constitutional reform and the military's disproportionate power in Parliament, ending decades-long conflicts and promoting peaceful reconciliation among ethnic groups, and encouraging economic development.  As Daw Suu knows best of all, Burma is still a country with many challenges to hurdle as it strives to achieve a more representational government. The Burmese people are not alone. They, and she, have many friends here in Washington as they work toward reform and reconciliation.  It has been 4 years since Daw Suu last visited us. It was a privilege then to help bestow her with the Congressional Gold Medal she had earned many years before. It is a privilege to welcome her back now in this new capacity. I look forward to meeting with her later today and again wishing her all the best and reaffirming my own commitment to support her and her country on their path ahead.                          ____________________
