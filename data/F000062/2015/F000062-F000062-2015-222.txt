 President, I rise today to introduce a bill to fully repeal the Defense of Marriage Act, DOMA, and ensure that married same-sex couples are accorded equal treatment by the federal government.  When I first introduced this bill in 2011, only 5 States and the District of Columbia recognized same-sex marriage.  Today, due to a combination of actions by legislatures, voters, and the courts, 36 States and D.C. recognize same-sex marriage. Florida joined the group just this week.  This progress is nothing short of amazing. Over 70 percent of Americans now live in a State where same-sex couples can marry.  The Supreme Court's landmark decision in United States v. Windsor, which struck down Section 3 of DOMA, has caused most federal agencies to accord equal rights and responsibilities to married same-sex couples.  But, despite this progress, the mission of ensuring full equality under Federal law for married same-sex couples is still unaccomplished.  This bill will accomplish that mission. It will strike DOMA from Federal law, and ensure that legally married same-sex couples are treated equally by the federal government, period.  I want to thank my 41 colleagues who have cosponsored this bill.  For my colleagues who have not yet supported this bill: if you believe that couples who are married should be treated that way by the federal government, you should cosponsor this bill. It is as simple as that.  Two major agencies, which serve millions and millions of Americans--the Social Security Administration and Department of Veterans Affairs--still deny benefits to some married couples depending on where the couple has lived. This bill would fix that problem.  Let me address Social Security first. An example of the discrimination married same-sex couples still face is the case of Kathy Murphy and Sara Barker. According to a legal filing, this couple married in Massachusetts and shared a ranch house in Texas for nearly 30 years.  In 2010, when Sara was 60 years old, she was diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer. Sara went through several surgeries and chemotherapy, and Kathy was Sara's caregiver.  Sara passed away on March 10, 2012. As the complaint states: ``Kathy lost her partner of more than thirty years and the love of her life.''  In July 2014--over a year after she applied--Kathy's application for survivor's benefits from Social Security was denied because they lived in Texas together, and Texas does not recognize them as married.  This cost her an estimated $1,200 per month in Federal survivor's benefits.  Veterans and active-duty military personnel in same-sex marriages also are being denied equal treatment by the Department of Veterans Affairs.  Many of these brave individuals have served our country overseas or in war zones, but they may nevertheless be denied a huge range of benefits our nation grants to those who have served in the Armed Forces.  A court filing by the American Military Partners Association explains that:       lesbian and gay veterans and their spouses and survivors .      . . will be denied or disadvantaged in obtaining spousal      veterans benefits such as disability compensation, death      pension benefits, home loan guarantees, and rights to burial      together in national cemeteries.  This is wrong. Our married gay and lesbian soldiers put their lives on the line for our country the same way other soldiers do.  We owe them the same debt of gratitude we owe to all other men and women who serve, and this bill would ensure that we fulfill that solemn obligation.  Continued discrimination against married same-sex couples is not limited to these benefits programs.  Other Federal laws are not part of programs administered by agencies, but they nevertheless are designed to protect families, including spouses.  Let me just give one example--Section 115 of Title 18. Among other things, this law makes it a crime to assault, kidnap, or murder a spouse of Federal law  enforcement officer, with the intent to influence or retaliate against the officer.  This law protects the ability of people like FBI agents and federal prosecutors to serve the public knowing there is protection from violence against their families.  These agents and prosecutors investigate and prosecute people like drug kingpins, terrorists, and organized crime figures.  But, even today, it is not clear whether this vital protection for these officers covers those in lawful same- sex marriages everywhere in the country.  These public servants, who protect all of us, should not have to worry that they lack the full protection we provide to their colleagues--but that is the situation we confront today. This bill would fix it.  In addition, Section 2 of DOMA--which was not expressly addressed by the Supreme Court--continues to pose a serious risk to legal relief received by victims of crime and civil wrongs. This bill would repeal it.  Section 2 of DOMA is the full faith and credit provision of DOMA, and it has been the subject of many misconceptions.  When DOMA was enacted, some claimed Section 2 was designed to prevent the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the Constitution from forcing a state to recognize a marriage from another state.  But states have never needed permission from Congress to decide whether to recognize an out-of-state marriage. States have done that under their own laws, subject to other constitutional guarantees like the Equal Protection Clause.  Thus, repealing Section 2 of DOMA simply would not force a State, or a religious institution, to recognize a particular marriage.  While it is on the books, Section 2 may have a very serious impact: it may nullify legal relief awarded to victims of crime and other civil wrongs.  There is a general rule that the judgments of one state's courts will be enforced in another state's courts.  But Section 2 purports to exempt any ``right or claim arising from'' a same-sex marriage from this rule.  Imagine a woman killed by a drunk driver. Her surviving spouse would have a civil claim for wrongful death, or might obtain restitution in a criminal case.  But DOMA could prevent the court judgments in those cases from being enforced in the perpetrator's home State, allowing him to avoid the consequences of his actions.  The same problem could arise in numerous types of cases, such as assaults, batteries, and insurance claims.  Same-sex married couples are the only class of people who are burdened by this sort of legal disability, which hinders the court system from protecting them the same way that it does other citizens.  This is wrong, and it must be repealed.  As a Senator from California, I come to this bill with a strong sense of history.  In 1948, the California Supreme Court became the first state court to find that a ban on interracial marriage violates the Equal Protection Clause. At the time, 29 states still prohibited interracial marriage.  Prohibitions on interracial marriage then were eliminated in 13 other states, so that when the Supreme Court decided Loving v. Virginia in 1967, only 16 states retained bans on interracial marriage.  I very much hope that is where we are today on same-sex marriage.  People of all stripes have come to believe that loving and committed same-sex couples are worthy of the same dignity and respect other couples receive. Public opinion has changed dramatically, and 36 states now recognize same-sex marriage.  The tide has shifted, I hope irreversibly so.  But here, in Congress, we still have work to do.  We must end the discrimination married same-sex couples continue to face at the federal level.  DOMA remains on the books, where it should never have been placed. It could be revived by a different Supreme Court majority.  A future administration also could interpret other laws differently than this Administration has done, potentially restricting the availability of key benefits even further.  The solution is simple: pass this bill, which would eliminate DOMA and accord equal treatment under Federal law for married same-sex couples.  Let me again thank my cosponsors for joining me in this effort, and to urge my other colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this legislation.                                 ______                                       By
