  Assuming the amendment of the Senator from Illinois is agreed to, this is going to use up close to $1 billion of the $3.5 billion authorized in this bill. Then I wouldn't be surprised to see other Senators coming over, offering amendments to mandate other kinds of voting machines.  So I think this amendment should be opposed. I think it begins to unravel the bill. I hope our colleagues will not support the Durbin amendment.  Is all time yielded back?  I reserve the time.
