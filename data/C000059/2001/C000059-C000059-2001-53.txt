Speaker, Mr. Speaker, I am honored today to pay tribute to the Norco Lions Club as they prepare for their 50th Anniversary Celebration to be held on Saturday, April 28th. In my congressional district of Riverside, California, we are fortunate to have numerous community service organizations that not only unselfishly give their time and talents to the community but find their own lives enriched in return. The Norco Lions Club epitomizes this and more.  Lions Clubs International, the world's largest service club association with over 1.6 million members, was founded in 1917 by Melvin Jones with a simple mission--``We Serve.'' Ever since, Lions Clubs across the world have been dedicated to helping those less fortunate in their communities and around the world. Lions Clubs International's goals pivot on their commitment to aiding the blind and visually impaired, followed by their dedication to serving young people--encouraging youth to serve their community without personal financial reward, with efficiency and high ethical standards in commerce, industry, professions, public works and private endeavors.  The Norco Lions Club, the largest in their district, encompasses the majority of both Riverside and San Bernardino Counties. Services to the community are eye-sight programs, including eye exams and eye-glasses for children in need, and blood drives. Additionally, Norco Lions Club has founded or helped to establish the Norco Boy Scout Troop 33, Mira Loma Swan Lake Lions Club, Norco Lioness Club, Swan Lake Lioness Club, Norco Leo Club and other local community organizations. Youth outreach offers a Student Speakers scholarship program, International Peace Poster Contest, 4-H Clubs, Boy Scouts, Future Farmers of America Scholarships, D.A.R.E. programs, sports programs and local high school programs.  Mr. Speaker, volunteers are critical to fostering a spirit of understanding, good citizenship and good government in the United States and worldwide. By working so closely with the youth of today, Norco Lions Clubs, and the clubs around the world are assuring that ``an active interest in the civic, culture, social and moral welfare'' of our communities is passed on from generation to generation. I congratulate the Norco Lions Club on its 50th anniversary, commend its local community and international service, and wish them success for another 50 years to come.                          ____________________
