President, our friend, Marion Burros, a superb writer on all matters culinary and otherwise, has written a most entertaining profile of John Podesta for Politico.  John Podesta is a friend of decades and someone Marcelle and I admire greatly. It is not only his and his wife Mary's talent in everything from the law to politics, but it is also the Podestas a privileged few see when they are preparing feasts in their District of Columbia home. Watching them is like watching a symphony where the enjoyment continues throughout the evening.  I can think of a number of times we settled all the problems of the world through laughter, food, discussions of our families, and on, in their kitchen. Anyone who doesn't relish such a feast for weeks after has no sense of culinary excellence--and I have never known anyone to leave disappointed.  Mr. President, so others might enjoy the Politico article, I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                     [From Politico, July 10, 2009]                     John Podesta, a Seasoned Hand                           (By Marian Burros)       John Podesta may be best known as one of Washington's      consummate inside players. But he is also his family's chief      cook, grocery shopper and, apparently, bottle washer--and can      put on a five-course meal for six in the space of three hours      without assistance, and with a bare minimum of advance      preparation.       The adjectives used to describe Podesta's political      skills--methodical and disciplined--apply equally to his      well-honed cooking techniques, learned from his mother long      before he became one of the capital's most influential      Democratic power brokers.       No recipes, no timing notes. ``I consult cookbooks for      ideas,'' he said. ``I don't use recipes. I don't tend to cook      like a chemist.''       What he does do is cook and talk at the same time, a skill      generally found only among professionals. And he talks the      game of a seasoned cook while he chops, using the proper      knife technique. Interspersed are funny, self-deprecating      stories, including tales of his tour of duty as a guide      wearing an 18th-century costume that involved slaughtering      and roasting pigs.       But more on that later.       Hard-driving is the adjective often applied to Podesta's      style in all of the various incarnations of his Washington      career--as a lobbyist with his brother Tony, as a staffer for      Sen. Pat Leahy (D-Vt.), as chief of staff in the Clinton      White House, as co-chairman of the Obama transition team and      as chief executive of the Center for American Progress, a      liberal think tank he helped found. When he relaxes, if that      is a word that can be applied to the tightly wound Podesta,      it's through two favorite pursuits: jogging and cooking.       He also collects contemporary art, is a UFO aficionado and      loves nothing more than to sit in the front car of a roller      coaster with his wife, Mary, as they hurtle along, holding      hands above their heads. A feat, he notes proudly, achieved      with the purchase of senior citizen tickets. He runs      marathons, completing his latest in Rome in 4:06. In fact, he      plans his menus while he runs. ``I kept going back and forth      between pork and fish,'' he said about dinner on a recent      evening.       ``Cooking is what I do to relax,'' he said. ``It's much      easier to see the fruits of your labor. It's fun.''       Even better is cooking for crowds. ``Cooking for 50 needs      organization, preparation and thought,'' Podesta said. ``One      part is creative; one part you have to get your mind focused.      That's challenging.''       As a young boy, he was expected to finish the dinners his      mother, who worked at night, left on the stove. Mary Podesta      was Greek-American, his father Italian-American, so he      learned to cook dishes from both cultures. ``I make a pretty      mean moussaka, pastitsio, baklava and spanakopita,'' he said,      reeling off Greek dishes that are complicated, the latter two      made with the paper-thin phyllo dough, requiring great manual      dexterity.       ``My mother had an intuitive sense of cooking and      chemistry,'' he said. ``She was a fixture in Washington. When      my brother was hosting a fundraiser, she would cook and sit      in the kitchen. She was very liberal and very opinionated,      and this was the age of Republican control of Congress.       ``A reporter was talking to her, and she was going off on      Trent Lott, [Newt] Gingrich and [Tom] DeLay. It was the most      embarrassing moment for us, but the reporter took pity on her      and didn't write about it.''       As Podesta explains it, with a Greek mother and Italian      father, speaking your mind was a core value of his childhood.      ``We were a blue-collar Chicago family,'' he said. ``The      kitchen table was not a model of decorum. It was all right to      yell.''       His heritage, he once told an interviewer, also explains      his hot temper and accounts for the occasional appearance of      Skippy, his sarcastic and ill-humored alter ego.       Flashing a touch of his well-known wit, he said it also      explains ``why I can't understand why Obama doesn't hold      grudges.''       The meal began with the risotto, topped with chopped fresh      radicchio and basil and served with a 2004 Fonterutoli      Chianti Classico. Podesta put the tilapia on to cook while      the guests finished the risotto. It was served with all of      the vegetable dishes and a 2006 Kistler Carneros chardonnay.       He wondered aloud if he should serve the salad and then      disappeared into the basement for the mandoline to slice the      fennel and red peppers, which he dressed with olive oil and      lemon juice.       His wife, Mary, arrived home from her book club just in      time for the dessert of berries in prosecco, which was served      with Perrier Jouet rose. She confirmed that he did most of      the cooking and the dishes.       ``Having a husband who does all the cooking is pretty      great,'' said Mary Podesta, who is also a lawyer. Asked if      she had a say in what is served, there was a pause: ``We      negotiate.''       Podesta cooks dinner every night he is in town, as he did      when his three children lived at home, and thought nothing of      introducing them to exotic foods like frogs' legs,      sweetbreads and squid. He and his wife seldom eat out and      entertain about once a week.       It's no different from his remarkable ability to impose      discipline on a bunch of unruly Democrats--or the fractious      factions of the Clinton West Wing.       For this informal Sunday dinner for six, the 60-year-old      Podesta was dressed in a polo shirt, shorts, sports socks and      sneakers. He led his guests directly to the modest kitchen in      his Northwest D.C. home, where most surfaces were covered      with what was soon to be dinner. There were tomato halves      soon to be topped with pesto (the one recipe he had made in      advance); arborio rice simmering on the stove, on its way to      being risotto; a pan of sauteed leeks and radicchio to be      added to the risotto; Brussels sprouts to be roasted with      thyme; bok choy and a baking dish, which would soon hold      tilapia sprinkled with olives and capers and cooked in      parchment.       Cocktails, or the kibitzing hour, took place in the      kitchen, where simple snacks to go with the Jacob's Creek      sparkling wine included dried apricots stuffed with goat      cheese.       Podesta likened dinner preparations to training for ``Iron      Chef,'' though there was no secret ingredient and his only      competition was with himself, to pull off the dinner without      a hitch.       He has been, however, prevailed upon to participate in      celebrity cook-offs that Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) holds to      raise campaign cash. He had only this to say about the      results: ``When the lobbyists judge, usually a member of      Congress wins. When Nora Pouillon (the chef and owner of      Restaurant Nora) judged it, I won.'' His winning dish was      grilled tuna in the style of vitello tonnato.       Running 30 miles a week explains, in part, why he is reed-     thin, despite his love of food. But then, he has never liked      breakfast and hardly ever goes out to business lunches,      considering them ``an occupational hazard.''       As Podesta talked, he went back and forth between the      dishes, his timing impeccable. He doesn't rattle easily.       A few things were bought the day before, the rest that      morning. His choice of grocery stores reflects his frugal      nature as much as his cooking skills. Before Balducci's bit      the dust, he avoided it. ``Too expensive,'' he said. While he      goes to Magruder's and Whole Foods, he also goes to Costco      and Rodman's, a drugstore better known for its discounted      gourmet products than for filling prescriptions.       His stove also makes a statement about his frugality. ``I'm      not into the whole Vulcan thing and all that,'' he said. ``I      do very well with a Sears stove. I'm always bargain hunting;      I could totally live on Social Security.'' Not counting his      fine wine collection or his contemporary art, perhaps--though      continuing the frugal theme, he insists the art is ``mostly      picked up at bargain-basement prices.''       The hunt for bargains is a testament to his mother's      influence. ``My parents were completely Depression people,      but we always ate well, even during the war,'' he said. ``My      mother scrounged around for bargains till the day she died.''       They even cooked their own wedding supper for 80--with the      help of a few relatives.       Talk of pig roasting and slaughter kept popping up during      dinner and was the last tale Podesta told before the guests      left. To earn money while attending law school at Georgetown,      he spent two years working at Turkey Run Farm in McLean, now      called the Claude Moore Colonial Farm, an 18th-century re-     creation.       He dressed in britches, a blousy linen shirt, floppy hat      and homemade shoes and learned how to butcher and roast a      pig.       Standing in the kitchen and acting out his role, Podesta      explained: ``It's best to do the butchering at 4 a.m.,      ``because pigs should be slaughtered when it is cool, and it      takes a long time to roast them. The pig is hauled on a      front-end loader in order to split and gut it. It's most      important to slow the pig down by shooting it between the      eyes so you can cut its throat. It makes the pig less ornery      and a whole lot more cooperative than if you just stick a      knife in its throat.''       In homage to these skills, Podesta used to have a picture      of a pig on a spit as his screen saver, but his staffers made      him get rid of it, because he said: ``They couldn't stand      looking into the pig's eyes during meetings.''       The powerful John Podesta does not always get his way.                          ____________________
