Any weapon does. But to those who would argue that whatever use they have outweighs the devastation they inflict on whole societies, I would answer that the commanders of our forces in South Korea, Vietnam, NATO, and Desert Storm say otherwise.  They say we can get rid of these landmines. These generals have used antipersonnel landmines and have seen what they do. They say these indiscriminate weapons made their jobs more dangerous, not safer. They remember their troops being blown up by their own minefields.  Today, it is landmines that our troops fear the most in Bosnia. No army is going to challenge our men and women in Bosnia, but there are hidden killers everywhere. A $2 antipersonnel mine will blow the leg off the best-trained, the best-equipped, the best-motivated American soldier.  In the 2 months since February, Canada, the Netherlands, Australia and, yesterday, Germany, have announced they will unilaterally, effective immediately, ban their use of antipersonnel landmines. These countries have gone way out ahead of the United States in showing leadership to ban landmines. Several, like Germany, said they will destroy their stockpile of these weapons. They are taking this action, which far surpasses what the United States has done, to lead the rest of the world.  Mr. President, next Monday, the United States will join over 50 countries in Geneva in the final session of negotiations on a treaty to limit the use of antipersonnel landmines. We already know that any agreement is going to fall far short of what is needed to solve this problem. Countries have insisted on exceptions and loopholes that are just going to assure that landmines will continue to maim and kill innocent civilians for decades to come.  In the weeks of negotiations there have not been more than 2 minutes of discussion on the banning of these weapons--the simplest and easiest thing to do, and what all of these distinguished retired American generals asked us to do. The only way we are going to get rid of antipersonnel landmines is by leadership that energizes the rest of the world.  A year and a half ago in a historic speech at the United Nations, President Clinton declared the goal of ridding the world of antipersonnel landmines.  There is no reason why today, with the world's attention focused on Bosnia, where we are spending tens of millions of dollars just to try to find the mines, we cannot join with our NATO partners, who have gone way out ahead of the United States, and renounce these insidious weapons. Let the United States--the most powerful nation on Earth--instead of being a follower in this, become the leader. A law we voted for in the Senate, now on the books, says we will halt our use of these landmines in 3 years. It should happen immediately, and it should be permanent, as Germany, Canada, and the others have done. Our senior retired combat officers support it. Hundreds of humanitarian organizations support it. They have seen the limbs torn off children at the knee.  If I have anything to do with it--and I intend to--this country is going to end this century having banned these terrible weapons once and for all. I hope the President and his administration will do what the United States Senate has already done--shown leadership in this. I hope that the rest of the Congress will do that, and then I hope that the United States will come back into a leadership role in banning landmines. It is what our NATO allies want, it is what our retired generals want, and it is what our men and women in the Armed Forces want.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article in the April 8 edition of Newsweek magazine, by David Hackworth, America's most decorated soldier, entitled, ``One Weapon We Don't Need,'' be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                     [From Newsweek, Apr. 8, 1996]                        One Weapon We Don't Need                        (By David H. Hackworth)       Last February, Sgt. 1/C Donald A. Dugan was killed      instantly on a snowy patch of ground in Bosnia. An      antipersonnel mine exploded while the veteran U.S. Army      reconnaissance sergeant was attempting to disarm it. The      explosion drove a piece of the steel disarming tool into his      forehead. On a dozen different killing fields around the      world in the past 50 years. I've seen thousands of soldiers      and civilians blasted apart by land mines. In northern Italy,      where I served as a 15-year-old soldier boy at the end of      World War II, I saw an army captain's legs ripped off by a      land mine. In Bosnia last January, I came within minutes of      becoming a casualty myself from a land-mine explosion. But      I've never seen a battle in which land mines made a      difference to the outcome. They are ugly and ineffective      weapons, and they ought to be outlawed.       Land mines are indiscriminate killers. They kill not only      during the conflict, but decades after the last shot was      fired. The technology has improved; a modern mine can be      programmed to blow itself up after a few weeks or months,      reducing the postwar threat to civilians. But anti-personnel      mines are still not ``smart.'' They can't tell a good guy      from a bad guy, a soldier from a civilian, an adult from a      child. And some fail to blow themselves up. When millions of      mines are     scattered across a battlefield by air and artillery, even a      tiny ``dud rate'' will leave a substantial number lying in      wait for innocent victims.       Of all the instruments of terror used on the battlefield,      mines are the most inhumane. The wartime casualties are young      men whose lives are either snuffed out or ruined forever by      crippling injuries. Even soldiers who escape from a minefield      unscathed are haunted by the experience. Many cases of      posttraumatic stress disorder, a serious psychological      malady, were caused by the preying fear of mines and booby      traps. Years later, a walk across an open field bring back      the old dread: What's under those leaves? Do I dare put my      foot on that freshly turned earth? Walk through a minefield,      and you'll never be young again.       During the Korean War, tens of thousands of soldiers on      both sides were felled by land mines. Many of them were      killed by their own mines, recklessly thrown down in haste,      their location unrecorded. In 1952, as a 21-year-old      lieutenant, I was ordered to clear a path through an unmapped      minefield--one of our own. I argued with my colonel about the      advisability of doing such work on frozen, snow-covered      ground. Lieutenants seldom win disputes with colonels, so the      mine-clearing detail proceeded as ordered until a fine black      sergeant named Simmons tripped the wire on a ``Bouncing      Betty'' mine. It popped up from the ground and blew off the      top of his head, covering me with his blood and brains.      Moments later, another noncom went nuts and stomped out      into the minefield, screaming: ``I'll find the f------      mines, I'll find the f------ mines!'' He was tackled,      restrained and led away.       In Vietnam, the U.S. Armed Forces also used land mines      irresponsibly, dropping millions of them at random by air.      The enemy quickly learned how to disarm these weapons and      recycle them for use against us. The infantry battalion I      commanded in the Ninth Division took more than 1,800      casualties in a year and a half, most of them caused by      recycled U.S. ordnance. Mines cannot secure a flank or defend      a position by themselves. For a minefield to be even      marginally effective, it must be protected by friendly      troops, to knock off the bad guys who want to clear a path or      use the mines against you.       Mines never stopped any unit of mine from taking its      objective--or the enemy from getting inside my wire. Anyone      who has ever been in battle, especially in Korea or Vietnam,      has seen enemy sappers crawl through mines and barbed wire      and get into their positions. I once faced a Chinese ``human      wave'' attack in Korea. My company was dug in on high ground,      with plenty of weapons, ammo and artillery support. Out in      front of our position we laid a carpet of mines and flares.      The enemy attacked in regimental strength, outnumbering us 9      to 1. They walked through our minefield--and our gunfire--     without missing a beat. They cut my company in half and      within an hour were two miles to the south, in our rear. The      only way out was to move north, so we trudged through our own      somewhat depleted minefield to escape, losing two men in the      process.       Most serving generals especially the desk jockeys, are in      favor of mines. The real war-fighters usually want to get rid      of them. Whatever defensive punch is lost would be more than      offset by the new firearms and missiles that give today's      infantry platoon more killing power than a Korea-vintage      battalion. ``Mines are not mission-essential,'' says one      general, ``but they are budget-essential.'' In 1996, the U.S.      Army budgeted $89 million for land-mine warfare. Now the army      is fighting to protect every nickel.       Still, some retired generals want to ban mines, and I agree      with them. Governments can declare land mines illegal, just      as chemical weapons were prohibited. Sure, thugs like Saddam      Hussein or Ratko Mladic will continue to use them. But users      (along with manufacturers and dealers) can be hunted down and      punished by an international court. If that happens just a      few times, anti-personnel mines will go the way of mustard      gas. I'll drink to that, and so will most veterans of foreign      wars.
