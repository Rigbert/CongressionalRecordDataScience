President, I will make this very brief, because several questions have come up concerning Social Security. I think it is a very critical thing. I happen to have been privileged to be presiding yesterday when the distinguished Senator from Wyoming, the senior Senator, Senator Simpson, who is the chairman of the Social Security Subcommittee and, I think we all agree, is the authority in this body on Social Security--he is here and will be responding to these questions in a much more informed and eloquent way than I would be able to respond to them. But I do have to respond to a few things that have been said by both my good friend, the Senator from North Dakota, and the Senator from Kentucky.  First of all, it was implied--I am sure it was not intentional--that I was only concerned about Republican grandchildren. Obviously, we are all concerned about our own. I opened my remarks yesterday on the floor making a reference to Senator Simon, who had talked about Nicholas Simon, his grandchild. I said I know he is just as emotionally involved with his children and grandchildren as I am, and Democrats are as much as Republicans. I hope that is understood.  But, when the distinguished Senator from North Dakota used the example of government control, with the rats eating the bread laced with arsenic, certainly if I had been there at the time I would have strongly supported an effort to stop these types of abuses and these types of unsanitary practices from taking place.  But there is a fine line here. You come to a point where, if you see that point, you have too much government control. I think that is one of the basic philosophical differences, and it is an honest difference, between Democrats and Republicans. I suggest to you, if you talk to Tim Carter of Skiatook, OK, who was called a couple of days before Christmas a few years ago and put out of business by the EPA, what he had done wrong was he moved his business from one area of Skiatook, OK, a very small city, to another area, and did not inform the EPA of this move.  I said, ``They do not know that you moved?'' He said, ``Well, yes, I informed the district office, but they apparently did not inform the national office.'' For that reason they put him out of business and they took his number away from him.  Then, when I finally got that corrected, he called me again and he said, ``Now I have another problem. I have an inventory of 50,000 bottles.'' He had some kind of operation, horse spray or something, that they manufactured. Apparently there is a market for it. He said, ``The EPA says I cannot use those bottles now, because during that brief time I was out of business they gave my number to somebody else.'' This is the type of thing.  Or Jim Dunn, who owned a third generation family lumber company in Tulsa, OK, who called me up and said, ``The EPA put me out of business.'' This was a couple years ago. I was in the other body at the time. I said, ``What did you do wrong?'' He said he did not do anything wrong. He said, ``I have been selling used crankcase oil to the same contractor for a couple years and they traced some of that to the Double Eagle Superfund Site and they say I am in violation. They are going to impose $25,000 a day fines on me.'' This is a company that had its net increase the year before of something like $50,000. He was out of business. The heavy hand of overregulation.  We corrected that situation. But if he had not called me, he probably would be out of business today. That contractor he sold his oil to 10 years ago was licensed by the Federal Government, by the State of Oklahoma, by Tulsa County. He did nothing illegal. Yet Government was regulating him out of business. This is what I am talking about. Have we gone beyond that point, to where we are the most overregulated society or country, to the point where we are not globally competitive? I say, yes, we are overregulated.                          ____________________
