President, if the Senator would yield further, let me just make a comment. I perhaps have had maybe even a conflict of interest in this case. But that conflict has made me very sensitive to the plight they have in sub-Saharan Africa. As the Senator from Florida knows, I have been there many times. I am very familiar with that whole region. But in the case of Ethiopia, which seems to be one of the first areas the Senator is addressing, a drought is taking place there right now. In fact, I have and I will hold up a picture of a little girl we found during that drought. She was abandoned. She was 3 days old. We were able to get her back into good health. I am very proud to say that this little girl--Zegita Marie Rapert--happens to be my granddaughter. She is now officially adopted.  By the way, in case you are wondering why she is wearing a crown, that was her first birthday. She has three older brothers ages 4, 5, and 6. It is a pretty typical family. Anyone from Ethiopia is considered royalty: Queen of Sheba--anyone from Ethiopia is royalty. So they gave her this crown for her first birthday.  I would suggest that there is no area that is having a more difficult time right now. I know there is a lot of competition for funds. But I think the way the junior Senator from Florida has structured this amendment, that would allow the administration to make some of these determinations and some of these priorities.  I strongly support the idea of giving some aid to that area because of the drought that has been unprecedented for about 12 years. Hopefully, this will happen, and it will become a reality for these people.  We do a lot of talking around here about poverty; we do a lot of talking about problems; but until you see some of the poverty and some of the effects of the drought that has taken place right now in the sub-Saharan, Africa, it is really one that we don't understand.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
