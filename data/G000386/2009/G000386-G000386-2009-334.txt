 I said that about President Bush. I have to say it about President Obama. They were elected. They have a certain respect of the people, and that respect should not be questioned by the Senate except under extraordinary circumstances. I think these are extraordinary circumstances, and I am bringing it up.  Mr. Lynn has informed me that he would be divesting his financial stakes in Raytheon in the next 90 days. He also said he would not engage in any Raytheon-related decisions for 1 year at DOD unless he receives a special waiver.  Regrettably, for Mr. Lynn and for American taxpayers, getting rid of conflicts of interest is not as easy as it might sound. The Raytheon Corporation has hundreds of potential contracts and programs with the Department of Defense. As such, the Office of Government Ethics will have to set up a full-time department just to handle Mr. Lynn's conflict-of-interest Raytheon waivers.  On the one hand, I believe the best leaders lead by example. So mean what you say. For that reason, I challenge Mr. Lynn to take control of this ethical debate and demonstrate true leadership on this issue by sticking to the principles set forth by President Obama's Executive order on ethics commitments by executive branch personnel. Special waivers and exemptions undermine the basic principle of good government.  Changing the rules as you go along tends to foster a basic sense of distrust of the Government of all Americans. We all know that is a problem. We have to be cautious to make sure we don't make the situation worse. Why make rules if you know you are going to break them? How can gutting the ethical heart of the new ethics rule be inthe public interest when those very same rules were created in the first place in the public interest?  Even the best qualified nominees with the highest recommendation should recognize when serving in his or her post would not be in the public interest. I believe the American people expect nominees to be true and honest. Given his chosen career path, Mr. Lynn should know he does not comply with the spirit or intent of the Executive order on ethics.  If he is seriously devoted to serving his country and this President, Mr. Lynn should consider withdrawing his nomination and ask to be reconsidered when he is within the ethics ``revolving door'' principles laid down by my President, Mr. Obama. Then he would come back in 2 years to seek such appointment. This country will always need good leaders who lead by example. By doing this, he would set the standard of excellence for all other nominees to follow. It would restore integrity and credibility to President Obama's new ethics rules. As it stands now, unfortunately, the Lynn nomination is rolling down a very low road at high speed. By setting the new rules aside for the first top-level appointee to come down the pike, President Obama and his administration appear to embrace the very same culture President Obama promised to change.  None of us knows for sure whether Mr. Lynn's nomination is truly in the public interest. We can only hope it is. In time, we will find out.  What is going to take me longest to explain is documentation of some activity of Mr. Lynn when he was Chief Financial Officer and how that fits into some questions I have about the position to which he was nominated.  My second area of concern pertains to Mr. Lynn's financial management record at the Pentagon. Mr. Lynn served as Chief Financial Officer at the Department of Defense from November 1997 through 2000. I first came to know Mr. Lynn in 1998, after he was appointed to the position. Between June 1997 and July 1998--1 month, approximately--I conducted an in-depth investigation of internal financial controls at the Department of Defense. I was testing basically internal controls within the Department. I reviewed about 200 financial transactions from Pentagon offices where the fraud had occurred. We examined purchase orders, contracts, invoices, delivery verifications or receipts, and, finally, we examined final payments. We even checked to see if remit addresses were correct. In short, we looked at the whole ball of wax.  The results of this investigation were presented in a report in September 1998. This is a report my staff and other people put together. The report concluded, in September 1998, involving the Chief Financial Officer and/or things under his command or jurisdiction:       Internal controls at the Department of Defense were weak or      nonexistent.  The Government Accountability Office, then called the General Accounting Office, concurred with my assessment.  Our investigations found that not one of the accounts payable files examined was 100 percent up to snuff. I was alarmed to find they all had either minor or major accounting deficiencies. If the Department of Defense had followed standard accounting practices, none of the bills should have been paid. Unfortunately, all went out the payment door.  The most glaring and persistent shortcoming observed was the near total absence of valid receiving reports in the accounts examined at the Defense Finance and Accounting Service Center in Denver, CO. A receiving report is one of the most important internal control devices. They provide written verification that the goods and services billed on an invoice were received and matched with what was ordered. In all the files examined, we found only 6 out of 200 genuine receiving reports, or what they call DD-250 forms. The rest of the files contained none. Of the six receiving reports found, all were either invalid or incorrect.  We also noticed gaping holes in another key control mechanism, remit addresses. A remit address is important because it is at the end of the money trail, where the money goes. The review found zero control over remit addresses. A total of 286 technicians in the Dallas center had authority to alter remit addresses. This was a violation of another basic internal control principle--separation of duties. A person responsible for paying bills should never be allowed to change a remit address.  On September 23, 1998, I met with Mr. Lynn to discuss the findings of my investigation. I provided him with a draft of the report. I asked him to review it and provide comment. In his response, dated 5 days later, September 28, 1998, Mr. Lynn did not challenge the findings in this report. So we have this report I have been referring to, and I asked Mr. Lynn for comment on that report. I have his letter here not challenging the findings.  I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                   Under Secretary of Defense,                               Washington, DC, September 28, 1998.     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Grassley: At our meeting of September 23,      1998, you requested that I review and comment on the ``Joint      Review of Internal Controls at Department of Defense'' draft      report dated September 21, 1998.       I am very troubled by the problems cited in this report, as      well as the related General Accounting Office (GAO) report.      Effective internal controls are essential to the detection      and prevention of fraudulent activity in our vendor payment      operations. Without question, the Krenick and Miller fraud      cases, which are at the core of both reports, indicate that      there are unacceptable weaknesses in our internal control      programs. Although both individuals were caught and      convicted, and funds were recovered, we must ensure that the      appropriate actions are taken to prevent further abuses. Let      me briefly describe for you the measures that the Defense      Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) is taking to improve      internal management controls.       First, we are taking steps to ensure that the vendor pay      process establishes positive control over payment-related      information. An important step in this regard is to tighten      controls over remittance addresses through use of a Central      Contractor Registration database maintained by the      acquisition community. Eliminating the ability of personnel      in the paying offices to change the addresses to which      payments are sent will correct a critical weakness that was      exploited in the fraud cases cited.       Second, to reinforce the principle that there must be a      strong separation of responsibilities for providing and      verifying payment information, we are strengthening the      processes that preclude a single individual from controlling      multiple critical portions of the payment process. In      particular, pursuant to a GAO recommendation, DFAS is      reducing by at least half the number of employees who have      the highest level of access to the Integrated Accounts      Payment System.       Third, a critical internal control is the positive check of      payment information with accounting data prior to      disbursement. To ensure the effectiveness of this control, we      will make systems changes to eliminate the ability of a      single individual to have concurrent access to both the      vendor payment system and the accounting system.       No internal control system will work if it is not      rigorously adhered to throughout the organization. During      August of this year, a top to bottom review of the various      vendor pay operations was accomplished at each DFAS center      and operating location. This review concentrated on      identifying weaknesses in the application of these controls      and business practices. At the same time, DFAS has conducted      a stand down of all vendor pay operations to provide formal      training in internal controls and fraud awareness. Finally,      earlier this month, I met personally with all of the      directors of the DFAS centers and operating locations to      stress the need to strengthen our management controls.       To ensure a more permanent senior level oversight of      internal controls, DFAS has established a separate      organization which reports directly to the Director's office.      The mission of this organization will be internal review,      fraud prevention, fraud detection, and audit follow-up. One      of the primary functions of this office is to track and      ensure that accepted recommendations from existing fraud      oases, GAO audits, along with other internal and external      reviews and reports are implemented. This unit will be      operational within the next 30 days.       In closing, Senator, I want you to know that I place the      highest priority on ensuring that we have the best possible      protections against fraud and wrongful payments. We have more      to do, but I believe that we have made a strong start in      responding to the lessons of the Miller and Krenick cases. I      have conveyed these thoughts to Senator Durbin as well.           Sincerely,                                                  William J. Lynn.
