President, today the Senate will be in a period of morning business throughout most of the day. The Senate may also resume debate on the motion to proceed to the H-1B visa bill. As a reminder, the first vote of next week is scheduled to occur at 4:50 p.m. on Monday, September 25. The vote is on final passage of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000. Also next week, the Senate will continue consideration of the H-1B visa bill.  I thank my colleagues for their attention.                          ____________________
