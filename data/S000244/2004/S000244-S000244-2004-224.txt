Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I think the choice in this bill is either pass the bill and allow for the donation of the equipment, or do not pass the bill and no equipment is going to be donated at all because the donor does not want to be on the hook for a civil liability lawsuit merely as a result of the donation.  This bill does not immunize the manufacturer of the equipment so if the equipment was defectively manufactured, a lawsuit would still lie againstthat manufacturer for either product liability or negligence.  The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott) also says, well, the way to deal with this is to defeat the bill and have every volunteer fire company sign a waiver when they receive donated equipment. Well, that means that there is going to have to be a lawyer sitting in the firehouse drafting these waiver documents. Most of the volunteer fire companies that I am familiar with in my State, and I do not think they are any different from volunteer fire companies in other States, are staffed entirely by volunteers. These are people who donate their time to deal with emergency situations. Many of the volunteer fire companies in Wisconsin also run the first responder and emergency medical technician teams, and they ought to be spending their time and efforts doing training and raising money to purchase equipment that could not be donated, rather than paying for lawyers' fees to draft up waiver of liability agreements.  I think this is a very sound bill. It is a commonsense bill. It should be passed.  Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Delaware (Mr. Castle).
