 President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Without objection, it is so ordered.                           Amendment No. 2724  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we have now cleared the Cohen amendment on both sides. I am not aware of any need for further debate.
