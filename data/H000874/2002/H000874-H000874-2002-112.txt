Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, I also want to continue to lend my support to the gentlemen from Florida (Mr. Shaw) and (Mr. Wexler) and the others that have been mentioned. I, like the chairman, will continue to work with the gentleman on this issue so that we can find a timely and meaningful solution that satisfies the concerns of the gentleman and the concerns of the local officials in Boca Raton.  I do believe this is a public health problem. I do believe the Federal Government has a responsibility, and I want to see us help solve this problem this year.
