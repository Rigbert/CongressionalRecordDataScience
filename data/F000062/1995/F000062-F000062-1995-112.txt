 President, this amendment makes a technical correction to the bill's current language appropriating funds for the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program, known in short as SCAAP.  I was very pleased last year to be part of a bipartisan group of Senators who introduced legislation to establish SCAAP, which was ultimately made part of the crime bill. SCAAP was established in recognition of the burden placed on State and local governments by the Federal Government's failure to control illegal immigration, when State and local governments then find themselves faced with the high cost of incarcerating persons who enter this country illegally and are later convicted of felonies.  Unfortunately, a glitch in the appropriations language prevented SCAAP from completely fulfilling its purpose--contrary to SCAAP, local governments were excluded from reimbursement. Even more unfortunately, this mistake has been replicated in the appropriations bill which we now have before us.  Specifically, this appropriations bill, like last year's appropriations bill, provides that the funds appropriated for SCAAP shall be available as authorized by section 501 of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 [IRCA], rather than as authorized by SCAAP itself, which was enacted as section 242(j) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as part of the 1994 Crime Act.  Section 501 of IRCA only provides for reimbursement to States, not to localities. The reference to IRCA, in effect, means that only States and not localities would be reimbursed for their costs from not only the $130 million in fiscal year 1995 SCAAP funds, but also the $300 million in fiscal year 1996 funds that would be appropriated under this bill.  It is important to note that not only is the reference to IRCA inconsistent with SCAAP itself, it is also inconsistent with the committee's own report, which references the Crime Bill, not IRCA.  My amendment would correct this apparent error and eliminate this inconsistency.  It also would ensure that all States and localities would be equitably reimbursed for their combined fiscal years 1995 and 1996 costs at the same percentage rate.  Therefore, it corrects for any inequities in the allocation of fiscal year 1995 SCAAP funds to States as well as to localities. It is noteworthy that, because fiscal year 1995 was the first year of the SCAAP program, there necessarily would be start-up delays in setting up procedures to identify criminal alien inmates whose costs are reimbursable. My amendment would ensure that States which could not identify all, or most, of their allowable costs before fiscal year 1995 allotments were made, would not be penalized.  It is also important to note, Mr. President, that this amendment neither increases nor reduces the amount of money appropriated for SCAAP, but only affects who can access that money.  In expanding access to that money to local governments, we are: First, furthering the goal of Senators who wish to send authority away from the Federal Government, by allowing for direct grants to the level of government closest to the people, local government: and second, removing a level of bureaucracy by not making localities go through State governments.  This amendment has important, real-world consequences. Many localities, especially in California, have been hurt more by illegal immigration than have many States.  In Los Angeles County, for example, based on the preliminary results of a joint County-INS effort to identify deportable criminal aliens in the county's jail system, the percentage of all county jail inmates who are deportable criminal aliens has increased to 17 percent from 11 percent in May 1990.  The growing impact of criminal aliens on the county's criminal justice system not only imposes a major financial burden on the county, which must finance the costs, but also endangers the public's safety.  Because of the county's major budget problems, which have been worsened by the impact of criminal aliens, the county had to close three of its jail facilities earlier this year. As a result, many criminals, who, otherwise, would be incarcerated, now are on the streets of Los Angeles.  I am pleased to report that this amendment is supported by the National Association of Counties, the National League of Cities, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, cities throughout the country, including New York City and Chicago, and by local governments throughout the State of California.  I therefore urge my fellow Senators to support their cities, counties, and towns, and vote in favor of this amendment.  I yield the floor.                           amendment no. 2860       On page 85, line 14 add the following new section:       Sec. 207. None of the funds appropriated under this Act or      any other law shall be used to implement subsections (a),      (b), (c), (e), (g), or (i) of section 4 of the Endangered      Species Act of 1973, (16 U.S.C. 1533) until such time as      legislation reauthorizing the Act is enacted or until the end      of fiscal year 1996, whichever is earlier, except that monies      appropriated under this Act may be used to delist or      reclassify species pursuant to subsections 4(a)(2)(B),      4(c)(2)(B)(i), and 4(c)(2)(B)(ii) of the Act.
