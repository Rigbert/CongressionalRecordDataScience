Speaker, on Thursday, June 4, 1998, during the consideration of House Joint Resolution 78, I apparently voted contrary to my intent on one part of the amendment offered by the gentleman from Georgia.  I correctly voted ``no'' on the second part of the amendment, but thinking and intending to vote ``no'' on the first part, I apparently made a mistake and pushed the wrong button, and inadvertently voted ``yes'' on rollcall 198. I was shocked and disbelieving, Mr. Speaker, to discover my unintended vote of ``aye'' on the first part of the amendment, which would have stricken the reference to, and I quote, ``acknowledge God in our Constitution'' and replaced it with ``freedom of religion.'' I did not and do not support that proposal.  As I said in my statement, Mr. Speaker, on House Joint Resolution 78, ``. . . we do need to stress that faith in God and raising our voices in prayer continues to be one of the most important things that Americans can do.'' Mr. Speaker, the right to acknowledgeone's God was fundamental to the founding of this great country. Indeed, the Founding Fathers acknowledged God as the source of our unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.                          ____________________
