Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds.  Mr. Chairman, I would say to my friend from Arizona, that may sound good, but it is not accurate, and I would be glad to discuss it with the gentleman. The fact of the matter is this is a Bush administration-Reagan administration initiative. So we understand one another, this is a previous Republican administration initiative. The fact of the matter is, this figure has gone up and down under both administrations.
