 But it would strike me that under these circumstances, once the Chair has put the unanimous-consent request and there has been objection, that at the very minimum there should be a motion made by a Member of the floor. It does not appear to me to be the Chair's right or prerogative to try to reinstitute the rights of the individual Member to proceed and to speak, once his words have been stricken and objection has been voted.  I also find it unfortunate, I have to say, for both sides of the aisle. I will conclude, I find it unfortunate on both sides of the aisle that these motions which really go to the decorum of the House have been partisan motions, and I understand that in the past our side has been guilty as your side has. But if we are to maintain decorum in this body I hope we can take a second look at this type of question.
