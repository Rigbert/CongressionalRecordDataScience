 President, today, along with Senators Roth, Dole, and Pryor, I am introducing a bill to restore and increase the health care deduction for the self-employed.  Most of the major health care bills introduced in the last Congress called for an increased extension of the 25-percent health insurance deduction for the self-employed. There's a broad consensus that an increased health insurance deduction would contribute to tax fairness and would also lead to a significant reduction in the number of uninsured Americans.  Unfortunately, as we all know, the self-employed health insurance deduction expired on December 31, 1993, with the understanding that an extension, and possible expansion, would be part of health care reform in 1994. However, we all know what happened to President Clinton's disastrous health care reform effort. And, unfortunately, the self-employed deduction went down with it.  Mr. President, if the 25-percent deduction is not retroactively reinstated, the self-employed will be hit with a sizeable tax increase. Moreover, it would be a tax increase on predominantly middle-income persons, since about 73 percent of those persons who pay self-employment tax earn under $50,000 in adjusted gross income.  Mr. President, our bill will reinstate the 25-percent deduction for the 1994 tax year, and then increase the deduction to 50 percent this year, 75 percent next year, and 100 percent the year after.  Organizations as diverse as the Farm Bureau, the National Federation of [[Page S1443]] Independent Businesses, the Association for the Self-Employed, and the National Restaurant Association support this legislation.  I understand the House Ways and Means Committee will be holding a hearing this Friday on restoring this deduction, at least for 1994. I look forward to the Congress dealing with this problem in the near future for 1994, and then expanding the deduction up to 100 percent for future years.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 262       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
