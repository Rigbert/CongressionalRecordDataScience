 Why, everybody who stood up--the distinguished Senator from Utah, the manager of the bill is here. His Governor, a really solid guy, a guy who is a fiscal conservative I assume, a guy who is straight as an arrow, and I asked him, ``Do you balance your budget?''  He said, ``No, we have a capital budget.''  I said, ``Should we have one federally?''  He said, ``Well, it is something you should look it. It seems like a pretty good idea to me.''  Did anybody go out there and survey the Governors, whom we all think somehow God invested them with some new knowledge now? Governors are in. That is great. Ask them do any of them object to us having a capital budget? This is silly, refusing to do this.  I see my friend from New Jersey is on the floor. Would he like some time yielded?
