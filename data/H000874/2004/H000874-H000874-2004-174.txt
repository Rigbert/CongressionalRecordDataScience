 Now, on the PAYGO bill, or the budget enforcement legislation, we marked up a bill some time ago, the budget itself. On this enforcement act, will Democrats, Mr. Leader, be allowed to substitute on this very important legislation?  I yield to my friend.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding, and as the gentleman can see, the chairman of the Committee on Rules is standing here. I do not want to spoil the surprise of the chairman, his announcement, but I believe that they do plan to solicit all types of amendments and substitutes. I do not want to prejudge their actions, but I do expect them to make in order a number of amendments.
