 Speaker, Some may think the discussion of campaign finance reform is esoteric--not related to the real day to day problems and concerns of ordinary people. Wrong. If we are concerned to know why this country has the most unfair distribution of wealth in the industrialized world, and why the richest person in this country owns more wealth than the bottom 40 percent of our population-then you are talking about campaign finance reform, and the role that big money plays in the political process.  If you want to know why last year Congress gave huge tax breaks for the rich and large Corporations, and then proceeded to cut Medicare by 115 billion dollars--then you are talking about campaign reform, and the role that big money plays in the political process.  If you want to know why this country spends more money per capita on health care than any other industrialized country, and why 40 million Americans have no health insurance at the same time as insurance companies and pharmaceutical companies make huge profits--then you are talking about campaign finance reform and the role that big money plays in the political process.  And on and on it goes. The rich get richer, the middle class shrinks and we have the highest rate of childhood poverty in the industrialized world-and big money plays a major role in determining the agenda of both political parties.  Mr. Speaker, the current campaign finance system is obscene and the situation is becoming worse and worse everyday.  Our republican friends have recently made allegations against President Clinton regarding the influence that campaign contributions might have had on the Presidents policy towards China and Chinese missiles. This is a very serious allegation that should be fully and fairly investigated, but so should the role that campaign contributions play in our tobacco policy, in our health care policy, in our banking policy, in our environmental policy, and in many other areas.  Since 1991 the pharmaceutical industry has given more that 18 million dollars in political contributions and today we have the highest cost of prescription drugs in the world. The oil gas and chemical industries have provided over 24 million dollars in campaign contributions, and they get away with murder in terms of environmental destruction.  Some in this body say that the problem is with labor unions and the big money that labor spends. In the 1995-1996 election cycle corporations and groups and individuals representing business interests out spent labor 12 to 1. In fact, the wealthiest one quarter of one percent provides 80 percent of the campaign contributions and it is incomprehensible that some want to relax restrictions and enable the rich to contribute even more.  Mr. Speaker, this congress must end the obscenity of the current system which allows big money to buy and sell politicians like we were just another commodity.  This congress can learn a lot from my own state of Vermont which has passes serious campaign finance reform which severely limits the power of big money over the political process. Ultimately, what this congress must do is eliminate soft money completely; limit the total amount of money that can be spent in a campaign by a candidate, and move us in the direction of matching public funding with small individual contributions.  The day must come when once more in this country democracy means one person one vote, and not the current obscenity in which multinational corporations and individuals control the process.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Chairman, a diverse coalition of citizens groups ranging from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) to the National Right to Life (NRLC) have demonstrated that the Shays/Meehan and the Hutchinson campaign reform bills are nothing short of attacks on freedom of speech.  I hope my colleagues will take some time to read the following analysis distributed by National Right to Life Committee. The NRLC correctly points out that these two bills contain patently unconstitutional government regulations that should not be supported by the House of Representatives.  The Shays-Meehan Bill's Year-Round Restrictions on First Amendment                                  Rights       The most recent version of the Shays-Meehan bill (H.R.      3526) is taken from the September 29, 1997 version of the      Senate McCain-Feingold bill. This bill contains multiple      provisions that blatantly violate the Supreme Court's long-     established First Amendment rulings. In Buckley v. Valeo      (1976) and later cases, the Court has emphatically held that      the government may not regulate commentary on politicians      except for ``express advocacy,'' a term that the Court has      said must be confined to communications that use explicit      words to expressly urge a vote for or against an identified      candidate.       As the Court stated in Buckley, ``So long as persons and      groups eschew expenditures that in express terms advocate the      election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate [i.e.,      ``express advocacy''], they are free to spend as much as they      want to promote the candidate and his views.'' Such      constitutionally protected commentary on politicians'      positions is referred to by the legal term of art issue      advocacy. This memo summarizes multiple provisions of the      Shays-Meehan bill that infringe on such constitutionally      protected speech.\1\---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \1\ For a fuller analysis of this bill, see NRLC's memo, ``An      Analysis of the Speech-Restriction Provisions of the Shays-     Meehan Bill (H.R. 3526).'' For an examination of statements      by advocates of the bill, and their implications, see ``Do      American Voters Need Speech Nannies?'' by NRLC Legislative      Director Douglas Johnson (Sept. 30, 1997), available at      www.nrlc.org/dimwit.html.---------------------------------------------------------------------------      year-round restrictions on constitutionally protected speech       1. The bill would redefine illegal corporate campaign      activity so broadly that, at any time of any year, a non-PAC      incorporated organization would risk being the target of a      complaint to the Federal Election Commission (FEC), alleging      illegal corporate campaign expenditures, and subsequent      costly investigation and litigation, any time it issues a      print, broadcast, or other type of communication to the      public that mentions the name of a Member of Congress (or      other candidate) with any sort of explicit or implicit      viewpoint regarding the rightness or wrongness of that      politician's position. This is because any such commentary      could be viewed by some politician or regulator as      constituting ``unmistakable and unambiguous support for or      opposition to'' a candidate, which the bill would redefine      as ``express advocacy.'' (Section 201) For example, if      NRLC distributed a brochure that contained a description      of partial-birth abortion, followed by the simple      statement, ``On May 20, 1997, Senator Russ Feingold voted      against banning the brutal partial-birth abortion      procedure,'' NRLC would risk being subjected to      investigation and prosecution for engaging in speech that      expressed ``unmistakable . . . opposition'' to Senator      Feingold.       2. Moreover, if a non-PAC organization is deemed to have      established ``coordination'' with a lawmaker or other      ``candidate'' (even by sharing a vendor--see #4 below), it      would be banned (at any time of any year) from issuing any      communication to the public that names that ``candidate'' and      ``is for the purpose of influencing a Federal election.''      This is an extremely vague and sweeping restriction that      applies, as the bill says, ``regardless of whether the      communication is express advocacy.'' (See Section 201,      definition of ``expenditure.'')       3. In addition, under Section 205, at any time of any year,      a non-PAC incorporated citizen group, if it has established      ``coordination'' (see #4 below), is prohibited from issuing      any communication to the public that is ``of value'' to a      candidate, ``regardless of whether the value being provided      is a communication that is express advocacy.'' Such a      communication is prohibited, as an illegal campaign      ``contribution,'' even if the communication contains the name      of no candidate. This could apply, for example, to an ad in a      newspaper that mentions the name of no politician, but that      calls for a ban on partial-birth abortions, if a politician      complains that the ad was ``of value'' to a political      opponent who opposes partial-birth abortion.definition of ``coordination'' places unconstitutional restrictions on                  lobbying activities and issue advocacy       4. The restrictions described in items #2 and #3 above      apply to any group that is deemed to have established      ``coordination'' with a candidate. The bill (Section 205)      vastly expands the current definition of ``coordination,'' in      10 separate clauses, so that an organization that      communicates with members of Congress regarding public policy      matters would be at constant risk of falling over these      ``coordination'' tripwires. For example:       Many public policy organizations gather information on the      positions of members of Congress on certain issues through      use of a written questionnaire, and then disseminate that      information in communications to the pubic. But the      submission and return of such a questionnaire, with intent to      publicize the information obtained, would fall under one of      Section 205's multiple definitions of ``coordination''--that      is, a communication based on a ``general or particular      understanding with a candidate''--and therefore would be an      illegal corporate campaign expenditure.       Another provision, declaring that an organization is      ``coordinated'' if it has engaged in ``policymaking      discussions'' with a ``candidate's campaign,'' could apply to      routine attempts by public policy groups to persuade      lawmakers of the merits of the organization's positions      (i.e., lobbying).       Another provision would define ``coordination'' as the mere      sharing of a single professional vendor (a printer, artist,      or pollster, for example), during a two-year period, with a      congressional candidate.the first amendment does not allow lawmakers to prohibit non-PAC groups                       from mentioning their names       5. In addition to the restrictions described above, within      60 days of a congressional primary election (which occur as      early as March 1) or a general election, Section 201 places      an absolute ban on any non-PAC group broadcasting a      communication that even mentions the name of a ``candidate,''      which includes all incumbent members of Congress. This      provision does not only require ``disclosure'' of funding      sources for such communications. Rather, it bans the naming      of politicians in broadcast communications to the public,      unless they are conducted under the entire panoply of      restrictions that apply to PACs--in other words, only federal      PACs are permitted to sponsor such ``politician-mentioning''      communications. This ban would apply even to ads alerting      citizens to upcoming votes in Congress. [For further      discussion of the implications of allowing only PACs to      sponsor politician-mentioning communications, see the NRLC      memorandum, ``An Analysis of the Speech-Restrictive      Provisions of the Shays-Meehan Bill (HR 3526).'']   the first amendment does not permit lawmakers to dictate ``speech         specifications'' for discussion of their voting records       6. Sponsors of the bill make much of a so-called      ``exception'' (in Section 201) for printed material about      voting records and positions. But legal analysis of the      so-called ``exception'' reveals that it actually      underscores the sweeping restrictions implicit in the      underlying definitions. The ``exception'' would not allow,      but rather effectively defines as illegal corporate      campaign expenditures and thereby bans (to non-PACs), at      any time of any year, any printed materials (such as      typical ``scorecards'' and voter guides) that fail to      conform to a series of ``speech specifications.''       For example, to qualify for the ``exception'' a publication      must be confined ``solely'' to information regarding votes or      positions, and must be presented ``in an educational      manner''--in other words, interpretation or commentary would      be verboten. Even if these requirements are met, the      ``exception'' explicitly excludes publications that discuss      the position on only one ``candidate''--for example, a      newspaper ad that urges letters and calls to a single local      congressman about an upcoming vote in Congress. But under the      First Amendment, Congress has no authority whatever to impose      such restrictions on the right of citizen groups to      disseminate and comment on lawmakers' voting records or      upcoming votes.``soft money'' ban unconstitutionally nullifies the right of political              parties to engage in unrationed issue advocacy       7. The bill (Section 101) completely prohibits organs of      the national political parties from receiving so-called      ``soft money''--a term that really refers to all funds that      are not rationed and controlled by the Federal Election      Campaign Act (FECA). This is unconstitutional. Under rulings      of the U.S. Supreme Court, the First Amendment protects the      right of political parties to sponsor communications that      discuss issues, or the positions of officeholders or      officeseekers on those issues (``issue advocacy''), without      being subjected to the rationing laws that the FECA applies      to communications that contain explicit endorsements of      candidates (``express advocacy''). The bill would effectively      nullify political parties' First Amendment right to engage in      issue advocacy, by requiring that all party ads be conducted      under the restrictions that currently apply only to express      advocacy communications (since the parties would be      prohibited from raising any money that did not conform to      those restrictions). If ``reform'' advocates successfully      obliterate the distinction between issue advocacy and express      advocacy with respect to political parties, they will then      redouble their attacks on issue advocacy by citizen groups      such as NRLC. Those who support free speech about political      figures should oppose all restrictions on issue advocacy,      whether engaged in by political parties, citizen groups, or      others.                                  ____The Hutchinson ``Freshman'' Bill (HR 2183) Violates the First Amendment   Rights of Citizen Groups, Political Parties, and Members of Congress       When the House of Representatives soon revisits the issue      of ``campaign finance reform,'' the ``base bill'' will be HR      2183, sponsored by Rep. Asa Hutchinson (R-Ark.), sometimes      referred to as the ``freshman'' bill. NRLC strongly opposes      the Hutchinson bill. This memo summarizes the most      objectionable elements of the bill. unconstitutional regulation of citizen groups' communications to the                                  public       HR 2183 attempts to assert congressional authority to      monitor and regulate citizen groups' broadcast communications      to the public, in any month of any year, merely on grounds      that a communication mentions a member of Congress or other      federal politician. The bill would require that sponsoring      organizations report such communications to Congress. This      proposed requirement violates both the general constitutional      immunity of issue advocacy from governmental regulation,      enforced in numerous court decisions, and the specific      holdings of the Supreme Court in the 1995 case of McIntyre v.      Ohio Elections Commission, a 7-2 affirmation of the First      Amendment right to engage in anonymous issue advocacy.       The Hutchinson requirement would apply whenever a group      spends in a year (1) $25,000 on communications ``relating      to'' (mentioning) a single politician, or (2) $100,000 on all      ``politician-mentioning'' communications nationally. Once a      group has spent an aggregate total of $100,000 on broadcast      communications that name politicians--even if they pertain      solely to upcoming votes on legislation--then EVERY such      expenditure must be reported to Congress, even a $100 radio      ad.                 unconstitutional ban on ``soft money''       The bill completely prohibits organs of the national      political parties from receiving so-called ``soft money''--a      term that really refers to all funds that are not rationed      and controlled by the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA).      This is unconstitutional. Under rulings of the U.S. Supreme      Court, the First Amendment protects the right of political      parties to sponsor communications that discuss issues, or the      positions of officeholders or officeseekers on those issues      (called ``issue advocacy''), without being subjected to      the rationing laws that FECA applies to communications      that contain explicit endorsements of candidates (called      ``express advocacy''). The bill would effectively nullify      political parties' First Amendment right to engage in      issue advocacy, by requiring that all party ads be      conducted under the restrictions that currently apply to      express advocacy communications (since the parties would      be prohibited from raising any money that did not conform      to those restrictions).       If ``reform'' advocates successfully obliterate the      distinction between issue advocacy and express advocacy with      respect to political parties, they will then redouble their      attacks on issue advocacy by citizen groups such as NRLC.      Those who support free speech about political figures should      oppose all restrictions on issue advocacy, whether engaged in      by political parties, citizen groups, or others.      Unconstitutional Ban on Endorsements by Members of Congress       The bill would make it unlawful for any Member of Congress      to endorse the fundraising or membership-recruitment efforts      of a citizen group, such as NRLC, which at any time of any      year engages in ``any communication which refers to a clearly      identified candidate for election for Federal office,'' which      includes all incumbents except those who have announced their      retirement.       In other words, an organization becomes ``tainted'' if it      issues any communication, at any time of the year, that so      much as mentions the name of a member of Congress. For      example, if an organization sponsors a single newspaper ad or      sends out a single newsletter saying that a lawmaker will be      voting or has already voted on a certain bill, this      restriction would be triggered. Such a mettlesome      organization would no longer be eligible to receive the      endorsement of any member of Congress. Communications that      mention the names of lawmakers are a pervasive ingredient in      NRLC's overall pro-life advocacy, throughout the year, so the      bill effectively prohibits lawmakers from endorsing NRLC's      fundraising efforts, as Congressman Henry Hyde and others      have done in the past.       The concept underlying this provision--that there is      something ``corrupting'' about Members of Congress endorsing      the work of issue-oriented organizations with which they      agree--is very offensive. This provision in effect applies an      unconstitutional penalty to NRLC for exercising its First      Amendment right to engage in commentary on a federal      politician, and also violates NRLC's constitutional right of      association. Moreover, this proposed endorsement ban is an      unconstitutional infringement on the rights of association      and freedom of speech of each and every Member of Congress.
