On Sunday, September 5, 2010, Derrill passed away at the age of 83. He will be deeply missed.  Derrill was born on April 2, 1927, in Lincoln, Nebraska. He attended La Sierra Academy and served as a surgeon's assistant in the Army Medical Corps in World War II. He went on to receive a business degree from La Sierra College and became the founding manager of the Alumni Association of the Loma Linda University School of Medicine. Derrill eventually resigned from the Alumni Association to pursue a law degree, and while attending law school at night at the University of Southern California, Derrill worked as an investigator for the Office of the Los Angeles City Attorney. Upon graduation, he joined the Corona firm established by Walter Clayson in 1910, where he practiced business and real estate law for 45 years. He became a principal shareholder with the firm which is now known as Clayson, Mann, Yaeger and Hansen.  Known for being in his office by 4:00 a.m. many mornings, Derrill built a legacy of well-planned residential and commercial development in Corona, Riverside and Beaumont, and became a leading expert in real estate law and development. His clientele ranged from La Sierra and Loma Linda Universities, to 3M Corporation and the Bren Company. He even served as personal attorney to musician and television star Desi Arnaz for many years.  Through one of his projects, Derrill worked to lift a moratorium on major land development in Corona and worked with the city to create a thriving community south of Ontario Avenue. He also helped Loma Linda University market 300 acres of sheep pasture for development that included homes and a medical plaza, and also provided support for the University's endowment.  Outside of his law career, Derrill remained very active in his community. He was a member of the Loma Linda University Board for 16 years, served on the Board of Directors and as legal counsel to Corona Community Hospital and the Versacare Corporation and later the Versacare Foundation. He also served as the President of the La Sierra University Alumni Association where he was awarded alumnus of the year. La Sierra University even renamed its new entrance road ``Yaeger Way'' in Derrill's honor. He was also a member of the Corona Lion's Club for many years. In May 2000, Derrill was given the ``Humanitarian of the Year'' award at Loma Linda University in recognition of his generous donations and tireless efforts on behalf of the University.  As a longtime member of the Victoria Club in Riverside, Derrill served as Club President from 1994-1995. A decade later, Derrill had the proud honor of witnessing his son, Kurt Yaeger, serve as president from 2005-2006, which was a rare honor.  Though his professional accomplishments were many, Derrill will be remembered for his kindness, integrity, and generosity, which was felt by those around him. Undoubtedly a busy man, Derrill tried to balance his professional life with his personal life, and often acknowledged that spending time with his family was what gave him the most joy. His children fondly remember the cherished time they spent as a family over the dinner table on Sunday nights, a tradition kept through the years.  Derrill is survived by his wife of 59 years, Frances; daughter, Nedra Yaeger; daughter-in-law, Andrea; and grandchildren Jacqueline, Elizabeth, Emily and Adam. Sadly, Derrill's son Kurt recently preceded him in death.  On behalf of all those who knew him, it is my honor to offer these remarks as a tribute to the life and legacy of my friend Derrill Yaeger. His life and presence will be sorely missed and I extend my condolences to his dear family and friends.                          ____________________
