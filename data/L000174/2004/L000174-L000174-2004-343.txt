President, I proudly note passage of S. Res. 310, a resolution to designate May 15, 2004, as National Peace Officers Memorial Day. I again cosponsored this resolution with Senator Campbell, as we do every year. We are right to remember and commemorate the sacrifice and commitment of our law enforcement officers serving our communities, States and country. We annually honor the officers and their families who made the ultimate sacrifice for public safety.  I commend Senator Campbell for his leadership in this issue. This marks the 8th year running that he and I have teamed up to submit the resolution to commemorate National Peace Officers Memorial Day. As a former deputy sheriff, Senator Campbell has experienced first-hand the risks faced by law enforcement officers every day while they protect our communities.  I also want to thank each of our Nation's brave law enforcement officers for their unwavering commitment to the safety and protection of their fellow citizens. They are real-life heroes.  Currently, more than 850,000 men and women who guard our communities do so at great risk. Each year, 1 in 15 offices is assaulted, 1 in 46 officers is injured, and 1 in 5,255 officers is killed in the line of duty in the United States every other day. After the hijacked planes hit the World Trade Center in New York City on September 11, 2001, 72 peace officers died while trying to ensure that their fellow citizens in those buildings got to safety. That act of terrorism resulted in the highest number of peace officers ever killed in a single incident in the history of this country.  In 2003, 146 law enforcement officers died while serving in the line of duty, well below the decade-long average of 165 deaths annually, and a major drop from 2001 when a total of 237 officers were killed. A number of factors contributed to this reduction including better equipment and the increased use of bullet-resistant vests, improved training, and advanced emergency medical care. And, in total, more than 17,100 men and women have made the ultimate sacrifice--of that number 43 are police officers who have already been killed in 2004 while serving in the line of duty.  During the 108th Congress, we have improved the Justice Department's Public Safety Officers Benefits program by making law the Hometown Heroes Survivors Benefits Act (Public Law 108-182), which allows survivors of public safety officers who suffer fatal heart attacks or strokes while participating in non-routine stressful or strenuous physical activities to qualify for federal survivor benefits.  The Senate also passed the Campbell-Leahy Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act, S. 764, which will extend through FY 2007 the authorization of appropriations for the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program that helps State, tribal and local jurisdictions purchase armor vests for use by law enforcement officers. The House has yet to act on this important measure. We want to be sure that every police officer who needs a bulletproof vest gets one.  Last month, the Senate added to the gun liability bill by a vote of 91-8 the Campbell-Leahy Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act, S. 253. This measure would establish national measures of uniformity and consistency to permit trained and certified on-duty, off-duty or retired law enforcement officers to carry concealed firearms in most situations so that they may respond immediately to crimes across State and other jurisdictional lines, as well as to protect themselves and their families from vindictive criminals.  This National Peace Officers Memorial Day, Vermonters will remember our brave State Police Trooper, Sergeant Michael Johnson, who was killed last Father's Day while trying to stop a suspect leading two other State troopers on a high-speed chase. Sergeant Johnson was not even on duty, but he went to help his fellow troopers that Sunday afternoon after hearing their trouble on his radio. He had just deployed a set of tire spikes across the interstate when the suspect swerved to avoid the spikes and struck him. Sergeant Johnson left behind his wife and three children. Words are insufficient for the brave sacrifice of the man who was so admired by his family, community and the Vermont State Police force. In memory of this bravery and service to his family, community, State and country, Sergeant Johnson will be one of the names added this year to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial.  National Peace Officers Memorial Day will provide the people of the United States with the opportunity to honor the extraordinary service and sacrifice given year after year by our police forces. More than 15,000 peace offices are expected to gather in Washington to join with the families of their fallen comrades. I thank the Senate for acting on this important resolution.                          ____________________
