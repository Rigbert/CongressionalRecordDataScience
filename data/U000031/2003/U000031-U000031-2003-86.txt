Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Kalamazoo County Sheriff, Tom Edmonds, who is closing a chapter in a long and distinguished career of public service. A dedicated and selfless individual, Tom has served five terms as Sheriff after being appointed to the Office in 1984. Over his tenure as Sheriff, Tom served the citizens of Kalamazoo in a number of capacities, all with great distinction.  Since 1975, Sheriff Edmonds' contributions to our community have been tremendous. From post to post, he consistently received accolades and recognition. In addition to his remarkable service as Sheriff, highlights of his storied career include being Adjunct Professor of criminal law and procedure at Western Michigan University, Chair of the Michigan Commission on Law Enforcement Standards, Brigadier General for the Michigan Air National Guard, and recipient of Citation and Medal for Professional Service from the Michigan's Sheriffs' Association.  Many words come to mind as one reflects upon Tom's public service to our community. He is selfless, brave, generous, giving, caring, humble . . . the list goes on. Tom is widely known for his extensive charity and dedication to local individuals, businesses, universities, and the community as a whole. He spent a career devoted to the protection and safety of the citizens of Kalamazoo, and for this the county is forever in his debt. There is no question that Tom's dedication and contributions to the county will be missed.  Our community is in debt to Sheriff Edmonds for his continued public service since 1975. I wish him and his family all the best in retirement. Tom's contributions to our community have been many, and we are all better off from his service. He will be truly missed by the folks in southwest Michigan. I'm certainly glad he's remaining in our corner of Michigan.                          ____________________
