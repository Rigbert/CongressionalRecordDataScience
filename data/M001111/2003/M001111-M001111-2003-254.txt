 President, I rise today to share a story with my colleagues. It's a true story about a family who happened to live in a neighborhood in Spokane, WA. They could have easily been in Memphis or Minneapolis or Midland as well. But they lived in my State, in Spokane, a typical American city in Eastern Washington.  Mr. President, as part of realizing their American dream, Ralph Busch and his wife Donna bought a house. They were newlyweds, and this was the home they bought after getting married. They soon discovered that it needed roof repairs, and so Ralph spent quite a bit of time in the attic, working on his roof.  The following year they found they had to renovate an addition that was put on the house in the 1950s.  They both had full-time jobs, so they spent many nights and weekends working on their home. They knocked down walls and tore through the old insulation, drywall and wood. They sanded and hammered and spent two entire years fixing up the place.  One morning, Ralph was reading the newspaper. Just by chance, he came across a story about a company that manufactured a household insulation called Zonolite. This insulation, he read, was tainted with deadly asbestos.  Ralph suddenly realized that Zonolite was in his home.  Ralph Busch was stunned as it dawned on him. He had just spent two years in his own home handling Zonolite insulation and he and his wife may have unknowingly been exposed to deadly asbestos.  What would happen from his and his wife's exposure?  How come no one had told him he had asbestos in his attic?  The Zonolite insulation was a product from the little town of Libby, MT. It was produced by the W.R. Grace Company.  W.R. Grace mined vermiculite from the hillside near Libby. The company turned the ore into insulation known as Zonolite by heating vermiculite to expand it into light granules.  The process was similar to popping popcorn. After sorting the popped vermiculite, W.R. Grace poured it into bags and sold it to use as insulation.  The company marketed Zonolite as ``perfectly safe''.  .  .  But laced throughout the vermiculite in the ground near Libby, another mineral was present: asbestos. W.R. Grace's process to make Zonolite and other products could not, and did not, remove all the asbestos from the end product. Zonolite insulation contains between .5 percent and 8 percent asbestos.  The community of Libby has suffered immensely from decades of mining the deadly vermiculite ore used to make Zonolite insulation and other consumer products.  At least 200 men and women from Libby have died from diseases caused by exposure to asbestos-tainted vermiculite, and hundreds more people from the town are sick.  When inhaled, asbestos can cause deadly diseases, from asbestosis to mesothelioma, a deadly cancer of the lining of the lung that is almost always fatal. In fact, mesothelioma kills at least 2,000 people each year and is caused only by asbestos.  The diseases induced by exposure to asbestos result in horrible deaths and they are nearly always fatal. Treatment is harsh and debilitating.  These diseases can take years to strike. The late Congressman Bruce Vento and the father of the modern Navy, Admiral Elmo Zumwalt both died from asbestos they had been exposed to years earlier.  The asbestos-tainted insulation manufactured by the W.R. Grace Company was used in homes throughout the country for decades.  Vermiculite from Libby first started being sold commercially in 1921, and W.R. Grace bought the mine in 1963. Reviews of invoices indicate that more than 6 million tons of Libby ore was shipped to hundreds of sites nationwide for processing over the decades.  This chart behind me shows more than 300 sites across the Nation, where ore was processed, in many cases to make Zonolite insulation.  In internal memos and e-mails, the Environmental Protection Agency has estimated that as many as 35 million homes, schools and businesses may still contain this insulation. Moreover, W.R. Grace knew the Libby mine contained asbestos when the company purchased it in 1963. But Grace made millions of tons of Zonolite anyway and unabashedly marketed it as ``safe.''  If the manufacturer of this insulation knew it was contaminated with asbestos, why didn't it or the Federal Government make sure that Ralph Busch and millions of others across the country knew to leave it alone?  The answer to the first question is that W.R. Grace still claims its product isn't harmful. The answer to the second question is more complicated.  According to published reports and internal EPA documents, the EPA was preparing to tell the American people about the dangers of Zonolite insulation. But it didn't happen.  An investigation by Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter Andrew Schneider found that last spring while it was addressing the public health crisis in Libby, MT, the EPA was preparing to tell the American people about the dangers of Zonolite insulation in millions of homes across this country. But first, EPA had to deal with Libby. EPA decided it needed to minimize the exposure of Libby residents to asbestos-contaminated vermiculite, and the agency drafted a press release announcing its decision.  This document said that EPA:       . . . will spend $34 million to remove dangerous asbestos-     contaminated vermiculite insulation from 70 percent of      residential and commercial buildings in Libby.  I am glad that EPA has taken aggressive steps to protect people in that small Montana town.  Senator Baucus deserves tremendous credit for the work he has done to bring Federal resources to Montana to help people in Libby.  And EPA deserves credit for doing the right thing, and going in to remove the insulation from Libby.  But what about the rest of the country? What about the millions of other homes with Zonolite insulation?  Since EPA decided to help Libby, the agency anticipated the logical follow-up question of what about the millions of homes nationwide that contain the same Zonolite insulation as homes in Libby.  According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, the EPA had drafted news releases, and drawn up lists of public officials to notify. The agency was preparing to embark on an outreach and education campaign to let people know about this hazard in their homes.  But what stopped EPA from following through with its warning?  It may have been the same person or people who blocked another government health agency from warning workers about asbestos exposure.  Last April, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health--NIOSH--was preparing to release new guidance for workers who come into contact with insulation in the course of their daily work.  NIOSH was preparing to alert workers, such as electricians, plumbers and maintenance workers, about how they can better protect themselves from exposure to asbestos in Zonolite insulation.  These materials were prepared last April, but they still have not been released.  Let me read from a ``Pre-Decisional Draft'' of a NIOSH Fact Sheet dated April 11, 2002.  I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record in its entirety.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:    NIOSH Recommendations for Reducing Risk of Worker Exposures to            Vermiculite That May Be Contaminated With Asbestos       A vermiculite deposit formerly mined in Libby, Montana was      contaminated with asbestos, raising concerns about      occupational and public health risks to former miners,      residents of Libby, and to workers and consumers who come in      contact with vermiculite end-products, such as insulation and      potting soil. This fact sheet summarizes existing      recommendations by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control's      (CDC) National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health      (NIOSH) for reducing risk of worker exposures to asbestos or      to materials that may be contaminated with asbestos. These      recommendations serve as interim guidance from NIOSH for      employers and workers involved at sites where vermiculite      used as attic insulation or for other purposes may be      contaminated with asbestos. NIOSH is conducting further      research on vermiculite to provide more information on      exposures that may pose the highest risks to workers.       How can a worker or an employer know if vermiculite they      have is contaminated with asbestos?       The only way to determine conclusively whether vermiculite      is contaminated is to have it analyzed by a trained      microscopist. (Any suggestions by NIOSH beyond OSHA 1910      regarding methods for bulk analysis would be extremely      helpful and reduce much of the confusion we are seeing as      polarized light microscopy (PLM) has not been useful in      evaluating and predicting airborne levels generated from      VAI).       As a rule, we believe that any vermiculite that originated      in Libby, Montana, before 1990 should be regarded as      potentially contaminated. It is known that vermiculite from      Libby was sold as attic insulation under the product name      Zonolite Attic Insulation, and that this product is still in      homes throughout the United States.       (Comment: WR Grace estimates several million homes contain      VAI, which is most likely very conservative. If we don't wish      to provide any indication of the magnitude of the potential      VAI exposure in number of homes, we should be clear about the      potential situation to provide a more accurate picture and      warning. Also, it is uncertain whether other vermiculite      products not originating in Libby contain potentially      hazardous concentrations of asbestos, until we have      definitive information to the contrary these materials should      also be treated with caution)       How can workers be protected from asbestos-contaminated      vermiculite?       They should isolate the work area from other areas in order      to avoid spreading fibers, use local exhaust ventilation to      reduce dust exposures, and use appropriate respiratory      protection. If the employer or worker is concerned about      potential exposure, and if at all possible, the vermiculite      should not be disturbed.       Which respirators are appropriate to protect workers from      asbestos exposure?       If asbestos cannot be contained to below 0.1 fibers per      cubic centimeter of air (fiber/cm \3\) by engineering      controls and good work practices, or when engineering      controls are being installed or maintained, appropriate      respirators should be provided to workers. When respirators      are worn, it is advisable to wear a fit-tested, tight fitting      half-mask air-purifying particulate respirator (not a      disposable dust mask) equipped with an N-100 filter or      better, because of the potential for episodic exposure to 1      fiber/cm \3\. A tight-fitting powered air-purifying      respirator should be provided instead of a negative-pressure      respirator whenever an employee chooses to use this type of      respirator. Tight fitting respirators should be used in      conjunction with a comprehensive respiratory protection      program under the direction of a health and safety      professional. Further information concerning respirator      selection can be found on the NIOSH web site at: http://www.cdc.gov/niosh; or the OSHA web site at: http://www.osha.gov.       What can workers do to protect themselves from exposure to      asbestos-contaminated vermiculite?       If at all possible, avoid handling or disturbing loose      vermiculite that is not contained in a manner that will      prevent the release of airborne dust.       Workers should guard against bringing dust home to the      family on clothes by using disposable protective clothing or      clothing that is left in the workplace. Do not launder work      clothing with family clothing.       Some measures can be used to avoid spreading potentially      contaminated dusts:       Use vacuum cleaners equipped with High-Efficiency      Particulate Air (HEPA) filters to collect asbestos-containing      debris and dust;       Employ wet methods or wetting agents, unless wetting is not      feasible or creates a greater hazard (wetting absorbent      vermiculite materials in an attic may not be feasible or      advisable);       Use negative pressure air units, which are large mobile      units that combine a fan and a HEPA filter critical for      preventing other exposures to non-workers, to keep      airborne asbestos levels to a minimum. Combined with      temporary barriers or enclosures, they can be set up to      make sure fibers do not contaminate other areas.       Dispose of wastes and debris contaminated with asbestos in      leak-tight containers;       Never use compressed air to remove asbestos-containing      materials;       Avoid dry sweeping, shoveling, or other dry clean-up      methods for dust and debris containing vermiculite that is      potentially contaminated with asbestos without environmental      controls to avoid spreading contamination;       Use proper respiratory protection.       Are there regulations that pertain to asbestos-contaminated      vermiculite?       Yes, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration      (OSHA) asbestos regulations (29 CFR 1910.1001 and 1926.1101)      for general industry and construction should be consulted to      determine if there are specific requirements that need to be      followed when handling asbestos-contaminated materials or      potential asbestos-containing materials. Relevant information      is posted on the OSHA Internet page at: http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/asbestos/index.html.       What should you do if you believe you have been exposed to      asbestos-containing vermiculite?       Workers who believe they have had significant past exposure      to asbestos-containing vermiculite, should consider getting      an appropriate medical check up. The appendices to the OSHA      asbestos standard describe the types of tests a physician      will need to provide.       What did NIOSH find from past studies at Libby, Montana?       NIOSH has responded to past and current concerns about      worker health by conducting needed research and disseminating      its findings. In the 1980s, NIOSH conducted research and      communicated findings about job-related exposures and health      effects among workers employed in mining and milling      vermiculite in Libby, Montana.       Our past studies identified asbestos contamination in the      vermiculite mined and milled in Libby.       We determined, from examination of x-rays of Libby miners,      that the miners showed evidence of adverse health effects      associated with asbestos exposure.       In a review of death certificates of former Libby      vermiculite miners, we identified an excess of deaths from      lung cancer, and other lung diseases that are known to be      related to asbestos exposure.       We made our findings available in 1985 through meetings in      Libby with workers and their representatives, employer      representatives, and members of the community. We also      published the results in peer-reviewed scientific journals.       Is NIOSH planning further occupational health research on      vermiculite?       NIOSH is currently conducting research to help determine      whether the processing of vermiculite produced by mines other      than the Libby mine results in workplace exposure to      asbestos. Vermiculite is used in a variety of occupational      settings including construction, agriculture, horticulture,      and for miscellaneous industrial applications. Through      carefully designed sampling, NIOSH will be better able to      define the extent to which workers may be occupationally      exposed to vermiculite that may be contaminated with      asbestos. Current plans are to: (1) conclude field exposure      sampling, (2) send company-specific reports to each of the      surveyed sites, and (3) prepare a summary of the overall      result of exposure assessments.       (Question will NIOSH be performing any field investigations      to evaluate the occupational exposures to airborne asbestos      associated with Vermiculite Attic Insulation among commonly      exposed workers (i.e. home reconstruction workers,      electricians, cable TV workers) ?)       Has NIOSH been involved in the public health response for      Libby community?       NIOSH has been providing technical assistance to the U.S.      Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Agency for      Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) which are the      lead agencies for the Federal government in assessing current      concerns about potential community health risks from asbestos      exposures in Libby.
