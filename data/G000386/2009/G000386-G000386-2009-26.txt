 President, we have all been waiting for many weeks while the Democratic leadership worked behind closed doors, out of public view, to write this new health care reform bill, and this process, of course, is very much contrary to what the President promised during the campaign--that negotiations on the health care reform bill would even be on C-SPAN so everybody in the country could see it. So now a very secretly put together bill is out for our consideration with just a few days to consider it.  Last week, they were considering expanding Medicare to people between 55 and 64 years of age--also, increasing Medicare to cover people up to 150 percent of poverty--and thirdly, having a government-run plan run by the Office of Personnel Management.  Now we have something entirely different. We have the Reid amendment, and it is chock full of special deals. It does nothing to fix the fatal flaws in the 2,074-page bill we started with, and now we have a bill that is probably 400 pages longer than 2,074 pages.  What kind of changes does this new amendment make to the original Reid amendment? Well, one tax disappears--it was a tax on cosmetic surgery--and in its place we have a new tax, a tax on tanning bed services. The dial on the Medicare payroll tax is turned up. So the first-time marriage penalty in a Medicare tax--one that hits about half the two-earner couples--is enhanced. Well over 1 million couples get to look forward to that tax hit--can you believe it?--just for being married. So the old marriage penalty is back. The dial on the insurance fee is also turned up in the back end of the bill.  But with respect to a few favored insurance companies, the fee is turned off. The very limited small business tax credit is expanded--over $\1/2\ trillion in new taxes, according to the official congressional scorekeepers. What kind of tax changes stay the same? Basically, the managers' amendment in the underlying Reid amendment still imposes new taxes--new taxes on everything from tanning beds to insurance companies to wages to heart valves to drugs and even more.  Contrary to what has been said on the Senate floor this very day, the tax burden still rests on many middle-class folks. As has been said, there is a sizable subsidy that 12 million tax-filing families and individuals receive. We do not dispute that. But what the other side does not want to acknowledge is this: There are 42 million tax-filing, middle-class families and individuals who will pay higher taxes under this 2,000-plus page bill. For every middle-class, tax-filing family who receives an insurance subsidy, three middle-class families will pay higher taxes.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of a corrected version of an article from Congressional Daily, dated December 18, of this year.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 [From CongressDaily AM, Dec. 18, 2009]         Labor Cites JCT Analysis To Argue Against Cadillac Tax                            (By Peter Cohn)       Labor officials Thursday unveiled new ammunition in their      fight against a proposal to tax high-cost health insurance      plans in the Senate health bill, citing a congressional      analysis that found more than 22 million households earning      less than $200,000 would see a tax increase by 2019.       That figure could rise a bit as the Joint Committee on      Taxation did not distribute information on tax returns for      married couples earning up to $250,000, which is the      threshold set by President Obama when he pledged not to tax      the middle class. The tax issue could be the most intractable      difference between Senate and House-passed legislation--which      instead relies on a millionaires' surtax--as Democratic      leaders struggle to cobble together a bill that can pass in      both chambers next year. Communications Workers of America      President Larry Cohen, whose group released the JCT figures,      said they demonstrate ``irrefutably that the excise tax--     which will result in reduced coverage and increased costs for      our middle class families--is the opposite of reform.''       Most House Democrats and union officials are adamant that      the final version does not break Obama's pledge and tax those      households earning less than $250,000. Obama at one point      appeared to endorse the House bill's surtax, which is the      single-biggest revenue source in either bill at $460.5      billion. There are major problems with that tax in the      Senate, however, not least because it is not indexed for      inflation. It also could affect about one-third of all income      earned by small business owners that file individual tax      returns, according to JCT.       ``This is going to be a major problem, no question about      it,'' said a senior Democratic aide. ``The White House is      going to have to weigh in and provide some direction.''       There have been some mixed signals. The president in a July      press conference said the House surtax ``meets my principle''      of not burdening ``families who are already having a tough      time.'' In a speech to Congress after Labor Day, however,      Obama endorsed the Senate excise tax as a ``modest change      that could help hold down the cost of health care for all of      us in the long run.''       The 40 percent excise tax in the Senate bill would affect      employer-sponsored coverage worth more than $8,500 for single      workers and $23,000 for family plans beginning in 2013. Those      figures would rise with inflation, plus 1 percent each year,      with higher beginning thresholds for older workers and those      in high-risk professions. Certain high-cost states would be      granted additional room before the tax kicks in.       In a White House blog post Wednesday, National Economic      Council Deputy Director Jason Furman said the Senate bill      would not hike taxes on the middle class and actually would      provide a net tax cut.       He noted JCT estimates that only 3 percent of health      premiums would be affected in 2013, a figure that rises to 8      percent by 2019, as well as the higher wages that would      accompany a decrease in costly health benefits.       One school of thought holds that whatever bill is able to      muster 60 Senate votes will form the basis for the final      legislation, and House Speaker Pelosi will have to deliver      the votes in her chamber. Another says 188 House Democrats      that oppose the Senate tax--a broad cross-section led by      second-term Rep. Joe Courtney of Connecticut, who requested      the new JCT data, and Rep. Sander Levin of Michigan--won't      allow the House to be steamrolled.       ``How did they get into this mess?'' one labor official      asked. ``They've set this thing up terribly, and they have a      huge problem in their Caucus.''       The senior Democratic aide said another Senate provision,      an increase in the Medicare payroll tax for those earning      above the $200,000 and $250,000 thresholds, could meet the      House test. Another idea, promoted by Sen. Debbie Stabenow,      D-Mich., would apply the Medicare tax to unearned income such      as capital gains and dividends and also has some cache in the      House.       But those proposals also have the disadvantage of being      prime revenue sources to     help shore up Medicare's finances over the long haul, which      could be negated if used up to help expand healthcare      benefits to younger workers.       House moderates at one point considered a plan authored by      the centrist Democratic think tank Third Way to tax ``excess      medical inflation,'' or healthcare premiums that are rising      much faster than overall economic growth. Sen. Thomas Carper,      D-Del., an honorary Third Way co-chairman, has pitched the      idea in his chamber as well. He continues to argue it could      be a fallback position; other sources on and off Capitol Hill      suggested the train has already left the station and it was      too late to inject a new and untested idea into the mix.       What is striking is the amount of agreement between unions      and Republicans on the Senate's excise tax, however.      Republicans, including Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., have long      held that taxing employer-provided health coverage is the      best way to keep costs down and raise revenues. But in      opposing the overall health bill, they have latched on to the      fact that the excise tax and other taxes in the bill would      hit those middle-class workers Obama wants to protect.       According to JCT data analyzed by Senate Finance Committee      Republicans, the number of households earning less than      $200,000 that would be hit with a tax increase number closer      to 42 million in 2019, or about 25 percent of all tax filers      under that threshold.       They looked not only at the excise tax but also a scaled-     back itemized deduction for medical expenses for those with      costs not covered by insurance, and those affected by the      Medicare tax that have losses bringing their income under the      thresholds.       The numbers factor in those who receive premium tax credits      and subsidies to offset the cost of buying health coverage in      the bill. Most of those hit with net tax increases earn      between $50,000 and $200,000 annually. Of those households      earning under $75,000, roughly 12 million would come out      ahead, JCT found, including many who earn too little to pay      taxes.
