Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the Skaggs amendment and in support of the legislation that I am offering to his amendment. The amendment of the gentleman from Colorado [Mr. Skaggs] is aimed at the heart of what is sometimes called surrogate broadcasting. An even better term, Mr. Chairman, is freedom broadcasting sending the message of freedom to people who live in countries where this message is not permitted to be carried on domestic radio and television stations.  The amendment of the gentleman from Colorado, [Mr. Skaggs], would eliminate TV Marti, would deprive millions of Cubans of not only vital information around the world and about the world, but also the hope that comes with knowing that the free world cares. My substitute perfecting amendment guarantees fiscal responsibility without compromising our commitment to freedom.  Mr. Chairman, eliminating or crippling freedom broadcasting into Cuba, as the Skaggs amendment would do, would send exactly the wrong message at exactly the wrong time.
