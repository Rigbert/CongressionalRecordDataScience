Chairman, the gentleman from Georgia talked to me about this amendment just a little while ago, I do not know exactly how long ago it was; and very frankly, I have not had the opportunity to review it, I have not really discussed it with the chairman, and am not going to ask for a vote on this.  But it is my understanding, I want to tell the gentleman from Georgia, first of all, there is a question about whether or not this money can be obligated this year. I do not know the answer to that question, but I will tell the gentleman I want to find that out from the National Archives, whether or not it is able to be obligated this year.  If it is not able to be obligated this year, obviously it will push out an expenditure that could be obligated this year. There is a tremendous backlog, as the gentleman knows, for capital improvements in every area of this country.  Secondly, we have not considered this in the subcommittee or full committee, so I do not know the full merits of this project. The gentleman tells me, and I understand what he is saying, first of all, it is not going to be in his district, so this is not a district concern.                              {time}  1445  I am a big supporter of the National Archives and its work, and they need facilities that are adequate and protective of the materials that they store. But I am in the unfortunate position of not knowing enough about the amendment, frankly, to support it.  I would tell the gentleman I will not oppose it at this point in time because the chairman wants to accept it, but I will be looking at this and I will discuss it with the gentleman and the conference committee to determine what we are going to do.
