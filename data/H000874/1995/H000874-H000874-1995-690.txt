Speaker, today I am introducing a resolution which authorizes the use of Constitution Avenue, NE., between Delaware and Third, for the Greater Washington Soap Box Derby. The resolution also authorizes the Architect of the Capitol and the Sergeant at Arms, to negotiate the necessary arrangements for carrying out this event in complete compliance with rules and regulations governing the use of Capitol Grounds. The Soap Box Derby has run on the Capitol Grounds for the last 4 years.  This year marks the 54th running of the Greater Washington Area Soap Box Derby, and the race is slated for July 15, 1995. Participants ranging from ages 9 to 16 are expected to compete in the early summer race. They hail from Washington, DC and the surrounding communities of northern Virginia and Maryland. The winners of this local event will represent the Washington, DC area in the national race which will be held in Arkon, OH later this year.  The Soap Box Derby provides our young people with an opportunity to gain valuable skills such as engineering and aerodynamics. Furthermore, the derby promotes team work, a strong sense of accomplishment, sportsmanship, leadership, and responsibility. As we all know, these are all positive attributes which these young people can carry into adulthood.  Again, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this resolution.                            ____________________
