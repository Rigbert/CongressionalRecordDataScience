Mr. Speaker, I first want to congratulate the chairman, Mr. Oberstar, and the Minnesota delegation in expediting this processwith the leadership of Mr. Mica and the leadership of both sides.  I don't do this often when I say I told you so. As chairman, with Mr. Oberstar, we tried to put the money in to identify the weaknesses of the bridges and to repair them, and we were unsuccessful. We ended up with a $286 billion bill instead of a $375 billion bill.  Mr. and Mrs. America, I believe it is time for us to wake up. We have to repair our outdated infrastructure, especially our bridges. You have heard statistics, 11,000 and on and on, how many are deficient. But there are about 500 in the same shape as the bridge in Minnesota right now that are a potential death trap to constituencies.  We have to, as a Congress, grasp this problem and, yes, lo and behold, I would even suggest fund this problem with a tax. May the sky not fall on me, but with a tax. Make it a 3-year tax. Make it a 5-cent tax, and they will say we can't do that. But I would suggest respectfully that the American people will understand the importance if we fund it and if we address the issue of the bridges. We should do this.  And maybe this is a wake-up call, and I hope The Post is wrong, that we all don't go back to sleep and watch football this fall and forget this tragic accident, because if we do so, then we are not fulfilling our obligation and our duty.  So I stand here before you today saying I told you so. But I am also saying let's act as we should to protect our people in every one of our States.
