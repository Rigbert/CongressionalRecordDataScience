Mr. Chairman, I will not take a great deal of time. This is a very simple amendment.  What my amendment does, very frankly, is to strike the funding for 59 new vehicles for the United States Fish and Wildlife Service for police activities and two airplanes for the Fish and Wildlife Service. It is my strong feeling that these are not needed at this time, and, in fact, these monies should be transferred, and that is what my amendment does, to the BIA.
