 President, today I am submitting, along with my colleague Senator Wyden, a Senate resolution to amend the Senate rules to eliminate secret holds.  I know Senators are familiar with the practice of placing holds on matters to come before the Senate.  Holds derive from the rules and traditions of the Senate.  In order for the Senate to run smoothly, objections to unanimous consent agreements must be avoided.  Essentially, a hold is a notice by a Senator to his or her party leader of an intention to object to bringing a bill or nomination to the floor for consideration.  This effectively prevents the Senate leadership from attempting to bring the matter before the Senate.  A Senator might place a hold on a piece of legislation or a nomination because of legitimate concerns about that legislation or nomination.  However, there is no legitimate reason why a Senator placing a hold on a matter should remain anonymous.  I believe in the principle of open government.  Lack of transparency in the public policy process leads to cynicism and distrust of public officials.  I would maintain that the use of secret holds damages public confidence in the institution of the Senate.  It has been my policy, and the policy of Senator Wyden as well, to disclose in the Congressional Record any hold that I place on any matter in the Senate along with my reasons for doing so.  As a practical matter, other Members of the Senate need to be made aware of an individual Senator's concerns.  How else can those concerns be addressed?  As a matter of principle, the American people need to be made aware of any action that prevents a matter from being considered by their elected Senators.  Senator Wyden and I have worked twice to get a similar ban on secret holds included in legislation passed by the Senate.  But, both times it was removed in conference.  Then, at the beginning of the 106th Congress, Senate Leaders Lott and Daschle circulated a letter informing Senators of a new policy regarding the use of holds.  The Lott/Daschle letter stated,       . . . all members wishing to place a hold on any      legislation or executive calendar business shall notify the      sponsor of the legislation and the committee of jurisdiction      of their concerns.  This agreement was billed as marking the end of secret holds in the Senate and I took the agreement at face value.  Unfortunately, this policy has not been followed consistently.  Secret holds have continued to appear in the Senate.  For example, last November, it became apparent that an anonymous hold had been placed on a bill, S. 739, sponsored by Senator Wellstone.  This bill had been reported by the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.  However, neither Senator Wellstone nor Senator Rockefeller, as chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, were ever informed as to which Senator or Senators had placed the hold.  The time has come to end this distasteful practice for good.  This resolution that Senator Wyden and I are submitting would do just that.  It would add a section to the Senate rules requiring that Senators make public any hold placed on a matter within two session days of notifying his or her party leadership.  This change will lead to more open dialogue and more constructive debate in the Senate.  Ending secret holds will make the workings of the Senate more transparent.  It will reduce secrecy and public cynicism along with it.  This reform will improve the institutional reputation of the Senate and I would urge my colleagues to support the Grassley-Wyden resolution.                          ____________________
