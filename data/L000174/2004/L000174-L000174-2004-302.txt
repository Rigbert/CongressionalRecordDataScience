President, we have come to the close of several days of tribute to our late President, Ronald Reagan. So much has been said about President Reagan's buoyant spirit and about the contributions he made to our Nation, and these tributes have helped millions of Americans with the healing process that comes with the death of so popular and beloved a leader.  Though much has already been said about President Reagan, I do want to pay special tribute today to our former First Lady, Nancy Reagan.  For me--and, I suspect, for millions of other Americans--some of the most stirring images of this memorable week have been of Nancy Reagan and her family. We saw again, and so clearly, her strength, her compassion and her deep love for her husband.  Ever since President Reagan's deeply moving announcement to his fellow citizens and to the world that he was suffering from Alzheimer's disease, I have watched Mrs. Reagan conduct herself with compassion, loyalty, competence and caring that have been an inspiration to the thousands of family members who every day struggle to cope with loved ones suffering from this disease or from any of the long variety of other disorders that can come upon us in our older ages--and sometimes far earlier than that.  The Alzheimer's Association estimates that 4.5 million Americans today suffer from this debilitating disease. Often, family members and especially, spouses--end up as primary caregivers to their partners or other family members. Along with the emotional pain and heartbreak of watching the mind of a loved one slowly fade away, many caregivers are ill-equipped to handle the many facets of the illness that present themselves over the duration of this mental and physical struggle. Their own physical health suffers. Managing a job or any other activity outside the home becomes almost impossible.  I believe Nancy Reagan is an inspiration to so many Americans. The love that she and her husband so clearly showed to each other comforted and sustained their marriage in sickness, as it did in health.  Marcelle and I extend our best wishes to Mrs. Reagan and to the entire Reagan family.                          ____________________
