President, I am joining forces with my good friend Senator Hatch on a Judiciary Committee bill that would prohibit improper tampering with product identification codes.  Manufacturers code their products in order to protect their consumers and to assist law enforcement in investigating consumer complaints, as well as in conducting recalls of tampered products. These codes assist the manufacturer and law enforcement in tracing goods back to a particular lot, batch or date of production. They include batch codes, expiration dates, lot numbers, and other information that one can typically see imprinted on the bottom or side of most products.  This product identification codes are extremely important in terms of product recall. There were over 250 product recalls last year--including two recent product recalls, one of ready-to-eat diet shakes and the other regarding the recall of 7,000 cases of infant formula. Also, product codes were of great help regarding the Tylenol poisonings of 1982 and the contaminated strawberry incident in Michigan in which school children became ill.  Forensic experts have used product identification codes in investigating numerous crimes including the bombing of the World Trade Center in New York City. Sometimes product codes are used to exonerate the innocent. For example, the product codes in the batteries involved in the Olympic Park, Atlanta, bombing helped exonerate the security guard, Richard Jewell, under suspicion in that case.  Product codes have been fraudulently altered regarding medicines, fertility drugs, and even bulk frozen shrimp. This makes it very difficult to trade back these products and to determine their safety. This bill addresses those concerns.  This bill contains significant improvements over a version introduced in the other body some time ago. Wholesalers were worried that they could not repackage goods--together into ``sale baskets''--to be sold at discount prices. This bill permits the resale of products at discounted prices. Each individual item would have to keep the original code but the prices could be changed depending on competitive market forces.  It is important that manufacturers not be able to control prices by operation of this bill. Consumers interested in bargains need to be able to get the best bargain they can get. This bill does not prevent the reselling of overstocked, or other, goods to discount retailers.  The bill also makes clear that any innocent alterations of product identification codes are not subject to the criminal provisions.  The bill contains a provision unrelated to product identification codes which I want to discuss for a moment. The bill prohibits at flea markets the sale of baby food, infant formula, or similar products made for consumption of children under three years of age. It also prohibits the sale of drugs, medical foods, cosmetics, and medical devices as defined in the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act at flea markets unless the seller keeps for public inspection written documentation identifying the seller person as an authorized representative of the manufacturer or distributor of the food, drug, device, or cosmetic.  This appears to be a reasonable policy but I am very interested in the views of my colleagues on this matter as there may be other ways to achieve the goals of these flea market provisions. I intend to work closely with the Committee Chairman, Senator Hatch, and my other colleagues regarding this bill.                          ____________________
