 President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record my correspondence with American University, AU. AU is a federally chartered nonprofit, tax-exempt educational organization.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                      U.S. Senate,                                         Committee on Finance,                                      Washington, DC, May 17,2006.     Gary M. Abramson,     Chair of the Board, American University.     Thomas Gottschalk,     Vice Chair of the Board, American University,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Abramson and Mr. Gottschalk: I am writing to you      regarding the Finance Committee's review of governance issues      at American University (``AU''). AU is a federally chartered      non-profit, tax-exempt educational organization. Congress      enacted the law in 1893 that first incorporated AU, appointed      its initial individual corporate members, and specified the      size and composition of its board of trustees. Act of Feb.      24, 1893, ch. 160. In 1953, Congress enacted legislation,      altering, among other things, the process by which the AU      board of trustees is elected. Act of Aug. 1, 1953, Pub. L.      No. 183, ch. 309. The Finance Committee's review is      predicated on this unique history of the legislative      relationship between the federal government and AU as a      congressionally chartered institution, as well as on the      Committee's general legislative and oversight jurisdiction      over tax-exempt charitable organizations.       In conducting its governance review, the Finance Committee      has reviewed the numerous documents provided by AU and      material provided by other sources, as well as discussions      with current and former board members, faculty, students and      AU employees. In addition, I have heard concerns raised by AU      students from Iowa and their parents. To allow students,      faculty and staff, and the public to have a better      understanding of the governance issues still facing AU, I am      today releasing relevant material provided to the Finance      Committee. It says volumes about problems of AU governance      that students, faculty, and supporters often have to learn      about the work of the AU board from the U.S. Senate Finance      Committee rather than from the board itself. I understand      that governance changes are to be proposed that proponents      claim will ensure that there will be greater openness and      transparency at AU. I look forward to meaningful reform in      this area and expect to be informed of the details of those      proposals.       While I am releasing quite a bit of information today, I am      frustrated that there is certain key material that I cannot      release today. When the Committee began this investigation on      October 27, 2005, I received assurances of cooperation. The      Washington Post stated on October 28, 2005, ``Gottschalk said      yesterday that the board would do everything it could to      cooperate.'' Unfortunately, those words have not always been      met by deeds. While AU has over time provided material      requested, AU continues to redact material provided and most      frustratingly labels key documents' `confidential' and not to      be released to the public. This is not what I would expect      from a university that benefits from tax-exempt status and      was chartered by act of Congress. I call on you to hold to      your public commitments of full cooperation and allow for      public release of all documents without redaction that have      been requested. AU students, faculty and supporters have a      right to a full understanding of the board's actions.       One of my principal governance concerns relates to the      legal structure and composition of the AU board. The Finance      Committee, during its roundtable discussion on charitable      governance, heard from AU student leaders, faculty, and      former board members, a number of whom called for the removal      of certain AU board members--particularly focusing on members      serving on the ad hoc committee that took actions regarding      former AU president Dr. Ladner without the knowledge of key      board members.       In reviewing the material, I understand the views of those      who believe the members of the ad hoc committee should be      removed. In the course of our review, I have also focused on      several key votes by some AU board members. In particular,      given all related information reviewed by the Finance      Committee, I am seriously troubled by votes cast in October      2005: 1) to amend the audit committee's recommendation and      secondly to reject the audit committee's recommendations on a      vote for reconsideration; 2) to reject three identical      recommendations from counsel, including Manatt Phelps as well      as Arnold & Porter, that had concluded that Dr. Ladner's 1997      employment agreement was invalid; 3) not to terminate Dr.      Ladner for cause; and 4) to increase cash severance to Dr.      Ladner by an additional $800,000 over eight years--after the      board had already voted to increase Dr. Ladner's cash      severance by $950,000.       It is important to bear in mind that these votes were made      after the findings from protiviti independent risk consulting      reports, which I am releasing today; were known to the board      and that provided in detail the expenses of Dr. Ladner and      his wife that he charged to AU. The report shows expenses      that would make for a good episode of `Lifestyles of the Rich      and Famous'--a lifestyle paid for by AU students and their      parents. In addition, as noted above, the board members were      aware of the findings of two respected law firms that found      that Dr. Ladner's 1997 employment agreement was invalid.       While I fully understand that as Chairman of the Senate      Finance Committee, I'm not here to direct the management of      the affairs of AU or its board, I do want you to know that I      am considering proposing federal legislation that would      require changes in the structure, composition, and governance      of the AU board, as Congress has done previously. In      particular, in discussions with Finance staff, AU board      members have noted that they do not view that under current      federal law the AU board has the authority to compel a board      member to resign. Please confirm if that is accurate, and      please also provide your views about the wisdom of      Congress amending the law to provide the AU board such      authority and, if so, suggested changes to the law.       In addition, I want to draw your specific attention to a      board meeting that discussed Mr. Ladner's compensation      package. In general, under federal tax laws, outside review      and justification for the salary of a highly compensated      individual at a public charity provides a safe harbor from      penalties under Section 4958 of the Internal Revenue Code. My      review of tax-exempt organizations and corporations has found      that in the overwhelming number of cases outside consultants      provide a justification for the salary request that is being      considered. In fact, the AU situation is the only example      Finance Committee staff have seen of an outside consultant      stating that a salary of an individual at a public charity is      too high.       However, in calling for a salary for Dr. Ladner higher than      that recommended by outside consultants, some AU board      members appear to have rejected concerns about complying with      the laws passed by Congress and instead described financial      penalties for violating federal law as `de minimis.' Comments      that suggest that federal laws should be disregarded because      penalties are `de minimis' are stunning when I hear them from      members of for-profit corporate boards; they are shocking      when they come from board members of a tax-exempt university.      Do you believe this is the appropriate message AU should send      to students--it is all right to violate the law if the      penalty is de minimis? Please provide a complete explanation      of these events and your views of them, as well as all      related material.       The issue of whistleblower protection at non-profit      institutions has also been of great concern to me in the      course of the Committee's work. Whistleblowers in certain      situations are protected from retaliation under state and      federal law. A series of aggressive emails to other AU board      members by one AU board member appear to attack      whistleblowers trying to do the right thing regarding the      situation at AU. They include the following language: ``You      are right in citing a Nixon era example. People do not      tolerate leaks any more. No one is so naive anymore to think      that unidentified `whistleblowers' are public servants. You      are right in saying there always must be a process for people      to report wrongdoing but this is not the way.''       As a champion of whistleblowers in Congress for years, I      can state categorically that not only are whistleblowers      public servants, they are often heroes--saving lives and      taxpayers billions. I commend you, Mr. Gottschalk, and former      board chair Ms. Bains, for taking a strong line against any      effort to bring the Salem witchcraft trials to northwest DC.      But again, that a board member might propose retribution      against whistleblowers, as appears from some of these      emails.is inexcusable. I would appreciate your general views      on the benefit of whistleblower protection at tax-exempt      organizations, as well as your specific views on the series      of emails appearing to support aggressive efforts to search,      find, and punish those who try to speak out against what is      wrong. In particular, do you believe such efforts send the      appropriate message to AU students--especially given that a      large number of AU graduates will be employed in public      service?       Finally, let me return to the overall issue of governance.      In meetings with my staff, AU representatives have given      assurances that AU will have in place governance reforms that      will provide students and faculty a meaningful and      substantive voice at AU. I view this as a vital part of AU      governance reforms coupled with greater sunshine and      transparency that I mentioned at the beginning of my letter.      Please inform me in detail what the governance reforms are as      to students and faculty.       Given that Congress is currently considering reforms to      provisions of the tax code affecting charities as part of the      conference on the pension bill, I ask that you provide      answers to this letter within 10 working days. Thank you for      your time and courtesy.           Cordially yours,                                              Charles E. Grassley,     Chairman.                          ____________________[Pages S4690-S4691]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                          AMERICAN UNIVERSITY
