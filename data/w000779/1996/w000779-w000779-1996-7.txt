President, there has been considerable discussion in this Congress about assaults on our environment. But up until now, a serious, stealth assault that threatens our environment, our citizens' health, and quality of life has been essentially ignored.  The threat I am referring to arises not from action that this Congress has taken. Rather, it comes from decades of Federal inaction in the face of haphazard development activities that are slowly degrading the landscape of our states and our communities.  Mr. President, what I am referring to is the wholesale strip malling of America.  If this trend continues unchecked, it will imperil our Nation's productive lands and natural resources, while turning the landscape into an unbroken expanse of suburban sprawl.  This pattern of sprawling, uncontrolled development is in many instances promoted by the Federal Government. Despite the major impacts many Federal programs have on growth and land use, the Federal Government has largely turned a blind eye to the visual blight these programs spawn, let alone the environmental, health and economic impacts of unmanaged growth and development.  Besides turning our landscapes into eyesores, unmanaged growth contributes to traffic congestion that snarls our highways, creating both additional stresses for commuters and additional exhaust emissions that degrade the quality of our air.  Uncontrolled development not only hurts our citizens where they live and breathe, it also hits them in their wallets. Several studies have come out that show the costs of sprawling growth are significantly higher thanmore compact, managed growth patterns. These studies show that taxpayers can save billions of dollars in public facility capital construction and operation and maintenance costs by opting for growth management.  Time and time again, I'm asked at town meetings what I can do at the Federal level to help manage growth in my home State of Oregon, so our State doesn't get overrun by suburban sprawl.  The answer, Mr. President, is not to create a new Federal program that will embroil the Federal Government in land use decisions that have historically been State and local issues. Rather, what we should do is create incentives to encourage and build on the State and local growth management efforts already underway.  For example, Oregon's pioneering Land Use Act builds environmental and resource protections into the State's growth management and development strategies. But our State gets no credit for this innovative program from the Federal Government.  As a result, Federal development projects in Oregon have to undergo Federal reviews that in many cases duplicate the process under State law. That's bureaucratic overkill.  Oregon and other States that have similar programs should be recognized by the Federal Government both when new Federal development projects are undertaken in these States and when new Federal requirements are imposed.  Today, I am introducing the Local Growth Management Incentives Act. This legislation will give Oregon and other States and localities with good growth management programs the credit they deserve.  Under this legislation, States that have good growth management programs will get several incentives.  First, the legislation directs Federal agencies to take steps to eliminate duplication of studies, environmental assessments, planning and other activities to the extent these actions have already been undertaken under a State or local growth management plan.  Because the State of Oregon and many cities in our State have environmentally protective growth management programs, development projects in our State frequently have to go through layers of duplicative environmental reviews--first at the local level, and then at the State level, and then again at the Federal level. In some cases, virtually identical environmental analyses are required by the different levels of government, each according to different sets of regulations.  Let me cite several examples affecting the Port of Portland in Portland, OR:  The Port of Portland's proposed development of additional marine terminals at Hayden Island in the Columbia River has already undergone extensive reviews and analysis by the city of Portland and by our State agencies. But in order for this project to proceed to the actual development stage, it still must undergo still another round of reviews by two Federal agencies--the Army Corps of Engineers and the National Marine Fisheries Service. The port estimates that if it could just eliminate the duplicative requirements, two or more years of unnecessary delay could be avoided for this project .  The port's efforts to identify better ways of handling materials dredged from around its docks and piers and from the Willamette River navigation channel is subject to two virtually identical, essentially independent environmental analyses, one by the State of Oregon and another by the Corps of Engineers. Avoiding duplication by allowing the Corps of Engineers to rely upon the State analysis could save considerable money for both the port and the Corps and expedite this project.  The port is currently planning further development and expansion at the Portland International Airport, the port's marine terminals, and several port-owned general aviation airports, all of which contain wetland areas. These activities could be facilitated, without diminishing environmental protections, if the State of Oregon's extensive process for addressing the environmental impacts associated with wetlands could be relied upon by the appropriate Federal agencies.  Under my legislation, Federal agencies would have to incorporate, as part of the reviews they require, any relevant reviews and analyses already conducted under State and local programs. This would save the project sponsors considerable time and expense compared to starting the Federal reviews essentially from scratch.  The net effect of this provision is that Federal development projects reviewed and approved under good State and local programs can avoid redundant Federal reviews that increase costs and cause delays with no environmental benefits. If environmental safeguards are already in place under State law, these protections should be recognized when it comes time to develop federally supported projects in the State.  Second, States and localities with good growth management programs will be eligible for extensions of up to 1 year to comply with new Federal requirements, when this additional time is needed to integrate a new Federal requirement with the State or local growth management program. However, additional time would not be provided if an extension of time would adversely affect public health or the environment.  This incentive recognizes that good growth management programs offer a more comprehensive and more long-term approach to protecting our environment than many of the specific requirements imposed by Federal environmental programs. At the same time, coordinating Federal requirements with State and local programs is hard work, as two leading growth management experts point out in their recent book ``Land Use in America.'' For this reason, we should give those States and localities that are undertaking this difficult, but ultimately rewarding effort the extra time they need to do it right.  The same amount of additional time granted to the State or locality would also be provided to any private party in that jurisdiction who is subject to a compliance deadline under the new Federal requirement, unless this would adversely affect public health or the environment. While States and localities are working to meld their programs with Federal requirements, private parties should not be subject to double jeopardy by having to comply first with a Federal requirement and then subsequently with a different requirement after the State or locality modifies its program to meet the new Federal mandate.  Third, Federal agencies conducting development projects and other activities affecting growth must ensure that their activities are consistent with States' and localities' growth management programs. This provision, which is modeled on a similar consistency requirement in the Coastal Zone Management Act, empowers States and localities by giving them the ability to affect Federal activities that could undermine State and local efforts to manage growth locally.  Fourth, my legislation amends the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act [ISTEA] to give priority for discretionary spending under ISTEA to any State or locality that has a growth management program that meets the eligibility criteria set out in the bill. Giving States and localities with good growth management programs priority for ISTEA funding will not only provide a financial incentive to establish these programs, it will also help reduce Federal, State, and local transportation costs and even help reduce air pollution from motor vehicles.  The legislation I am introducing is the beginning and not the end of a process. It is my hope that the Local Growth Management Incentives Act will begin a discussion on what the Federal Government should be doing to address the impacts Federal actions have on growth and land use. In the next Congress, I will be looking for additional incentives to offer States and localities so they will develop their own programs to manage growth.  In summary, I think there is an appropriate role for the Federal Government to help States and localities to manage growth so we have smart growth, instead of either uncontrolled sprawl or NIMBY [Not In My Back Yard] efforts to block any kind of growth. I am introducing my legislation today in an effort to jumpstart a dialog on how the Federal Government can promote well-managed, sustainable growth that will best serve our environment, our citizens' health and, ourNation's economic well-being in the 21st century.                                 ______                                       By
