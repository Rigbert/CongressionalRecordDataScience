 Let me remind my colleagues that I am planning to make a unanimous consent request on several amendments. I have asked Senator Ayotte from New Hampshire to come forward with amendments to be included on this list, and I am hoping she will do that momentarily. After Senator Paul of Kentucky, who is seeking recognition, concludes his statement, I would like to make this unanimous consent request.  May I ask the Senator from Kentucky if he would be kind enough to tell me how long he will be speaking on the floor.
