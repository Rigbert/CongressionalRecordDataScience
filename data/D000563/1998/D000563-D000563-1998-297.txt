In a courtroom--I will when I finish; I will be happy to yield when I finish. In a courtroom, it is one attorney against another. It is a jury of peers, 12 Americans sitting in judgment, and that is when the tobacco companies are being brought to their knees. They could not buy it through lobbyists. They could not buy it through political contributions. They had to walk into a courtroom. And when it happened in 42 different States, they said, ``It is time to settle. The game is over.'' So naturally they are angry with these attorneys, these trial lawyers who have brought them to their knees.  And think about the limitation of $250 an hour. Not a word about limiting the amount of money paid to the tobacco company attorneys, and certainly not one word about limiting the money paid to the tobacco company executives. Four years ago, do you remember that shameful scene when seven tobacco company executives, under oath, in the House of Representatives swore to God on a stack of Bibles that tobacco was not addictive? Tobacco is not addictive. Imagine they would say that. And these men, who were being paid millions of dollars a year by exploiting our children and selling their products, are not even mentioned in this amendment.  Now, if we are going to work out some moral outrage about how much money we are going to pay people, then let us include not just trial lawyers. Let's include the attorneys for the tobacco companies. Let's include the tobacco company executives. Or let's call this amendment for what it is. This is an effort to get rid of the element that has brought the tobacco companies finally to this Senate floor and brought us finally to comprehensive legislation.  I yield to the Senator from North Carolina.
