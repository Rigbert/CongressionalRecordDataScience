President, I would like to bring to the Budget Committee's attention a great program that saves the Federal Government both money and energy--it is called Energy Savings Performance Contracting or ESPC. Under this public-private initiative, the private sector upgrades our aging federal facilities and military bases with new energy efficient equipment, at no upfront cost to the government. The private sector is then paid back over time with the savings from the government's utility bills. The beauty of this program is that under the law, the energy savings must cover the project costs and also guarantee that there will be additional savings to the government, as codified per the Energy Policy Act of 1992:                                H.R. 776       Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Enrolled as Agreed to or Passed      by Both House and Senate)     SEC. 155. ENERGY SAVINGS PERFORMANCE CONTRACTS.       (a) In General.--Section 801 of the National Energy      Conservation Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 8287) is amended--       (1) by striking ``The head'' and inserting the following:       ``(a) In General.--(1) The head''; and       (2) by inserting at the end the following:       ``(2)(A) Contracts under this title shall be energy savings      performance contracts and shall require an annual energy      audit and specify the terms and conditions of any Government      payments and performance guarantees. Any such performance      guarantee shall provide that the contractor is responsible      for maintenance and repair services for any energy related      equipment, including computer software systems.       ``(B) Aggregate annual payments by an agency to both      utilities and energy savings performance contractors, under      an energy savings performance contract, may not exceed the      amount that the agency would have paid for utilities without      an energy savings performance contract (as estimated through      the procedures developed pursuant to this section) during      contract years. The contract shall provide for a guarantee of      savings to the agency, and shall establish payment schedules      reflecting such guarantee, taking into account any capital      costs under the contract.       ``(C) Federal agencies may incur obligations pursuant to      such contracts in finance energy conservation measures      provided guaranteed savings exceed the debt service      requirements.''  It's a win-win program for the government and taxpayers.  The problem is that under the current CBO budget scoring methodology, the entire contract cost is scored up front and there is no accounting for the guaranteed savings which are required by law. Since these guaranteed savings are not recognized, this program is scored as costing the government money when in reality this is not the case. The Office of Management and Budget views the program as budget neutral, and the program has strong support from the Administration.  This current scoring dilemma for the ESPC program has been problematic in the reauthorization of this valuable program. I respectfully ask that the Budget Committee work with the Congressional Budget Office to resolve this scoring problem for the ESPC program.
