Sure, there is what amounts to negligible growth, but this slows the growth of our economy after 2025. That is not what we were promised.  In fact, let me just recap a little bit the Republican promise. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said this bill would generate so much growth that it would take care of the $1.5 trillion and generate $1 trillion on top of it.  What a difference between Steve Mnuchin's projection of $2.5 trillion and the number that I have on this sheet from the Joint Committee on Taxation--$407 billion worth of revenue.  I appreciate my colleague asking that. It helps us to clear up a little bit more of what is at issue.  I appreciate Senator Thune being so gracious and giving me the extra time.  Mr. President, I have a UC request, if I could.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Franken, myself, and Senator Nelson be added as cosponsors to amendment No. 1720.
