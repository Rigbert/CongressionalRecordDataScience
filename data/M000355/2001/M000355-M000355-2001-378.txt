 LOTT. I yield to the Senator.  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to the distinguished majority leader, it shouldn't be a problem coming up with a list of amendments by sometime Monday.  I think it was George Orwell in the novel ``Animal Farm,'' who said all pigs were equal but some pigs were more equal than others. All amendments are equal, but I think we have a sense of the really important amendments and those will be dealt with in the early part of the week. I think we will have a clearer sense of where we are.  I also want to agree with Senator McCain. This has been a superb debate, enlightening for all the Members. A lot of Members, and hopefully members of the press, have learned a little bit more about a very complex issue which we have had out here in a freewheeling fashion for the last week. We understand the need to get to a conclusion and will work toward that on Monday.
