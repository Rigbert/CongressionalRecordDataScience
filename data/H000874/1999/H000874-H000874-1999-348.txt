Speaker, today I have introduced a bill designed to ensure the continued ability of the Library of Congress to provide quality child care services to those who so ably serve that fine institution and other elements of the Legislative Branch, as well as to other federal government employees and private sector employees when space is available.  Similar to the general law applying to other federal child care facilities, this legislation would amend the Library of Congress Child Care Center's authorizing language to specify that the Center must have at least 50 percent of its enrollees from families of federal employees. The legislation also establishes priorities for enrollment in the Center: first priority would go to children (and grandchildren and dependents) of Library employees; second priority would go to children of other employees of the Legislative Branch; and third priority would go to children of employees of other federal agencies. Children of non-federal employees would then be admitted as space allows, subject to the 50 percent limit.  The 1991 law creating the Library's Child Care Center is ambiguous on the point of permitting the Center to admit children whose parents are employed outside of the Legislative Branch. The Library's General Counsel and the independent Library of Congress Child Care Association Board believe the clear authority provided in the bill I introduce today is needed to continue the ability of the Library to provide affordable child care to Capitol Hill staff.  The proportion of Library and other Legislative Branch children enrolled in the Library's Child Care Center has steadily increased since the Center opened its doors in 1993. With nearly 50 percent of the Library's workforce becoming eligible for retirement by the year 2003, Library employees will have an even greater need for quality, convenient child care. Meanwhile, in order to remain self-sustaining, the Library's Center needs the same flexibility provided to other federal centers to admit a small proportion of children from families not employed by the federal government.                          ____________________
