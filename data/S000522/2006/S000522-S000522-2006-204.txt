Mr. Speaker, today I am pleased to pay tribute to Orest Deychakiwsky for his 25 years of faithful service to the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Helsinki Commission. Orest began his work as a member of the professional staff on November 15, 1981, just six years after the signing of the Helsinki Final Act, a period marked by ruthless Soviet repression and widespread violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms.  Driven by a deep commitment to aid the victims of Communist oppression, Orest devoted himself to documenting the human rights cases, particularly those involving divided families, an especially poignant task given his own family's history under Soviet domination and repression. He was responsible for compiling and maintaining the lengthy lists of individuals seeking to emigrate from the Soviet Union and Romania. Each spring would bring an opportunity to secure the exit of some of the thousands effectively held hostage in Romania by the Ceausescu regime. Orest was faithful in making representations to the Romanian Embassy on behalf of all those seeking to exercise their right to leave their country. When Moscow began to accept emigration lists from the Commission in the mid-80s, Orest's diligent efforts on behalf of refuseniks began to pay off for families, including some with American spouses, who were finally allowed to leave the Soviet Union after a decade or more of waiting.  With a passion for Ukraine, his familial homeland, Orest helped document modern Soviet repression in that country including imprisonment of human rights activists, suppression of Ukrainian culture and language as well as harsh actions against the Ukrainian Catholic Church. He was at the forefront of efforts in support of the restoration of Ukrainian independence and the consolidation of democracy in that country following the demise of the Soviet empire. Despite setbacks, Orest was optimistic that the people of Ukraine would insist on a democratic future for their country. On a cold November night in 2004, he witnessed firsthand their determination as he stood in Kiev's Independence Square where tens of thousands of Ukrainians gathered to protest fraudulent elections.  Fifteen years earlier he had stood in the main square in Sofia, Bulgaria as peaceful demonstrators stood up to tyranny, ushering in the demise of Eastern Europe's longest standing dictatorship. In recent years, he has been active in confronting the repressive regime of Aleksandr Lukashenka in Belarus, Europe's last dictatorship.  Mr. Speaker, in this year when we observe the thirtieth anniversary of the Helsinki Commission, as a long serving Commissioner and Co-Chairman, I am pleased to recognize and commend Orest Deychakiwsky for his faithful service and tireless defense of human rights and dignity.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Page E2041]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]RECOGNIZING OREST DEYCHAKIWSKY'S 25 YEARS OF SERVICE ON THE COMMISSION                  ON SECURITY AND COOPERATION IN EUROPE                                 ______                                                        HON.
