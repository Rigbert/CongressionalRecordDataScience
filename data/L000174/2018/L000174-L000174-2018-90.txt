President, I appreciate the comments of the Senator preceding me, and I thank him very much. He has worked very hard in the Appropriations Committee.  Senator Shelby and I have worked very hard to get a bipartisan bill. I would hope that we could have a consent agreement very soon to bring the current bills to a conclusion.  I would note that both Mr. Shelby and I have done our best to work with Members of both parties. Many people on the Appropriations Committee have concerns, some of which are by nature parochial, many national. I think we have tried to accommodate as many people as possible, and I hope that Senators can reach an agreement soon so we can know exactly what we will be voting on if not tonight, tomorrow morning.  I thank the Senator for his comment.  I see my friend is about to speak, so I will yield the floor.
