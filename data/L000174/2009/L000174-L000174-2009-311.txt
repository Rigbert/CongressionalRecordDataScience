President, as the administration considers ways to reform our foreign aid programs, I want to call attention to a recent Op Ed piece by a Vermont friend who has over 30 years of experience dealing with these issues.  Dr. George Burrill founded Associates in Rural Development--ARD--in Burlington in 1977 and since then he has brought Vermont common sense and values to international aid and development work. Since its founding, it has implemented some 600 projects around the world including extensive work with the U.S. Agency for International Development. Today ARD, a for-profit international development firm, has $100 million in annual revenue operating out of 43 field offices around the world.  Throughout his career, Dr. Burrill has thought long and hard about ways to make foreign aid more effective. In his recent piece in the Burlington Free Press, a copy of which I will ask to be printed in the Record, Dr. Burrill calls for a ``modernization'' of our thinking about foreign aid; the creation of a global development strategy to give U.S. foreign aid agencies a way to effectively evaluate past actions and determine what reform is needed; and tools for evaluating progress. Beyond that, he proposes developing a ``coherent strategy that will foster economic opportunity'' in the developing world, enacting legislation that ``elevates development as a foreign policy pillar equal with diplomacy and military defense,'' and creating an independent executive agency bringing together the relevant Federal agencies and departments into a single group ``giving the executive branch the authority it needs to develop solutions to 21st century problems while providing accountability to Congress.''  Foreign aid reform means many things to different people, but there is one thing we all agree on--it is overdue. Dr. Burrill's voice is one that should be listened to, and I commend him for speaking out.  I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:            [From the Burlington Free Press, Apr. 30, 2009]      My Turn: Investing in Smart Power Is Foreign Aid Well Spent                          (By George Burrill)       During his campaign, Barack Obama called for salvaging      America's international reputation. Rebuilding international      respect and trust, he correctly maintained, is vital to our      future security and economic well-being. The president's new      budget proposal indicates that he intends to follow through      with this promise. Americans should be encouraged and      relieved that the budget supports an increased emphasis on      nonmilitary responses to our security and foreign policy      interests.       A major component of nonmilitary response is our foreign      assistance and development programs. They are critical in the      struggle against global poverty, open markets for our      products, spread our basic values, and help address global      environmental and economic problems. In the 21st century,      America needs smart power, as robust a diplomatic and      international development capability as it has military      strength. Now is the time to modernize our thinking about how      to relate to the developing world.       There are several steps the Obama administration must take      in order to achieve the promise of a bold makeover. These      steps are consistent with the effort to make government more      efficient and to ensure that the American public is getting      more services and impact for the dollar. And they won't cost      anything.       First, along with the redesign of our national security and      foreign policy, which the president has already vigorously      embarked upon, government needs to simultaneously create a      global development strategy. We need a coherent strategy that      will foster increases in economic opportunity for the bottom      billion of Earth's residents and help eliminate the      conditions that foster conflict in the developing world. When      the United States leads on international development and      relief issues, it enhances our international standing and      strengthens our relationships with allies. It creates      improved possibilities for America's global agenda.       Second, the White House needs to work with Congress and      representatives of the broader development community in      crafting new legislation that elevates development as a      foreign policy pillar, equal with diplomacy and military      defense. We currently have an outdated, inadequate set of      legislation; international foreign assistance efforts that      are spread across at least 20 different agencies (which has      created competing fiefdoms and inefficiency). No single      person or authority is clearly in charge that the president      and Congress can hold accountable. New legislation would      provide the congressional mandate for streamlined      organizational structures and coherent policies, and give the      executive branch the clear authority it needs to develop      solutions to 21st-century challenges while providing      accountability to Congress.       Third, a modernized set of foreign assistance policies and      operations must be placed in a single, streamlined,      consolidated and empowered U.S. development agency. The ideal      option for streamlining and eliminating the current,      inefficient, multi-agency situation would be to create a new      Cabinet-level department for global development, as is the      case in England. Or the White House could work with the      Congress and create a new subcabinet, independent executive      agency. Either option should merge all international      development and humanitarian programs into a single entity.      Agencies such as the U.S. Agency for International      Development, the Millennium Challenge Corp., the President's      Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief and all the international      development programs of various agencies including those in      the Department of Defense should be merged.       As a candidate, Obama indicated his support for these      actions, but there have been no recent public comments by the      administration about any planned reorganization. Efficiency      calls for it.       America cannot afford an uncoordinated, confused or second-     best approach to our relations with the developing world. Our      foreign assistance programs have immense importance in      addressing global poverty, eliminating the environments that      help create terrorists and fostering the advancement of a      sound global economy. The Obama administration and Congress      must not miss this opportunity to modernize our foreign      assistance infrastructure. Getting the most out of the new      budget demands it.                          ____________________
