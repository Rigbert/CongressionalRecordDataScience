President, I rise today to acknowledge Mrs. Pearl Salotto of Warwick, Rhode Island for her dedicated work in establishing the ``Respect for Living Things Day'' in the state of Rhode Island. Mrs. Salotto has established a number of programs in Rhode Island including the D.J. Pet Assisted Therapy University Certificate Program, the D.J. Pet Assisted Therapy High School Program, and the D.J. Respect for Living Things Elementary School Program. Mr. President, I ask that Mrs. Salotto's op-ed on July 21st, 1999 in the Providence Journal be printed in the Record.  The article follows:                        [The Providence Journal]                The Best Way To Remember DJ, Therapy Dog                           (By Pearl Salotto)       DJ, dog of joy, recently passed away peacefully within the      loving arms of her family. The smiling face of this big white      dog had become synonymous with professional Pet Assisted      Therapy (PAT), locally and nationally, because of her      enthusiasm for life and her unconditional love, because of      the countless people of all ages whose lives she touched,      because of the many programs as well as social-reform      initiatives that she inspired, because of the many dreams      that she helped turn into reality.       Anyone who recognizes that pets and people are good for      each other can turn this moment of sadness into a celebration      of DJ's life and commit to carrying on her legacy,      recognizing that she did more than her part in bringing about      a healthier, friendlier, and more peaceful world simply by      being herself.       DJ showed me, at a New York nursing home in 1998, how      residents could find a renewed joy of life through her loving      touch and thus inspired not only my university program but      also my vision that all universities should have PAT degree      programs so that ultimately all facilities could have      professional PAT as part of their treatment team.       DJ showed me, in my granddaughter's first-grade classroom      in New York in 1991, how a dog's strolling up and down aisles      and interacting with children could open up their hearts and      minds to their responsibilities to pets, people and      themselves.       DJ showed all of us the profound and life-changing impact      that her freely given love could have on Feinstein High      School students, giving them the ``heart-opening''      opportunity to learn of the positive impact that animals can      have in all of our lives through their one-of-a-kind PAT      curriculum and the subsequent follow-up opportunity to share      their love with others through PAT Service Learning.       DJ showed me from the first day of our experiences together      that the bond between the therapy pet and the professional is      the ethical foundation of this profession, protecting the pet      in the field and providing the example from which all else      flows.       DJ and DJ-inspired programs have led to schoolchildren      writing and singing songs about respecting animals, other      people and themselves, Rhode Island Health Department      guidelines for pet therapy, an official state commission,      annual DJ Respect for Living Things Days on her birthday, May      8, several Rhode Island agencies having professional PAT      programs, the integration of PAT with Service Learning and      Windwalker Humane Coalition for Professional Pet Assisted      Therapy, among other programs.       Won't you join my children and grandchildren, friends and      colleagues, elementary school students of Central Falls,      Woonsocket, Providence and Feinstein High School students,      and students of all ages who knew and loved DJ, in doing all      in our power through all our words and deeds to help this      magical profession earn its rightful place in health care,      education, social services, and society as a whole,      spearheaded over the past 13 years by the smiling face and      extended paw of a big white dog named DJ?                          ____________________
