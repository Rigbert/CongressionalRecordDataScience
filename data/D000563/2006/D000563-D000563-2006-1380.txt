President, my colleague from Iowa has come to the floor and wants 15 minutes to speak. I ask unanimous consent for 5 minutes and my colleague from Iowa 15 minutes and that morning business be extended the necessary time for that to occur, and an equal amount offered to the other side, if they care to use it.
