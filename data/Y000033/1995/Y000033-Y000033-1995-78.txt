Mr. Chairman, I would like to address some of the things that have been said on this floor in the recent moments of this debate.  First, I want to stress one thing, in the reconciliation package that came out of our committee, the Committee on Resources, we addressed the grazing provisions that were mentioned by the gentleman from California. We in fact raised the fees for grazing. I do not see that in their substitute.  The second thing, with what we call the hard rock mining provisions, for the first time we created a royalty provision for the taking of minerals from the so-called public lands. So we have addressed that. We just do not speak out in anger or frustration. We have really tried to do what we think is correct to help balance the budget. We are not giving anything away in this provision which came out of our bill that came to the Reconciliation Act.  I would also like to suggest that there has been more misinformation, more flat out dishonesty, about the Alaskan Oil Reserve in the past, I would say, 6 to 8 months than I have ever experienced in my 22 years here.  We have to keep a little bit of history in mind. In 1980 we set aside 147 million acres of land for single use purpose in the State of Alaska. But the Congress at that time said that we ought to look at the coastal plain, where the oil possibly could be, and then there would be a recommendation by the President whether we should drill. That recommendation came down after a period of time, a period of time, that said yes, the Congress should have leasing for oil on the oil reserve, the so-called ANWR area. There has been 40 days of hearings held since 1978 after the recommendation came down. It is estimated that there is between 3 billion and 30 billion barrels of oil 74 miles away from the existing pipeline.                              {time}  1845  This area is strongly supported to be leased by the native people of Alaska. Many Members might have had a chance to visit with them. These are people that had little or nothing before the development of oil and now have what they think is their right due off of their land. They have water and sewage and schools and health, which they did not have before.  But more than that, Mr. Chairman, we are now importing $1 billion a week of foreign oils--$1 billion per week. It is important that the truth of this matter comes forth. Do not look at the ads and the misinformation that has been conveyed to this body and to the general public. Let us look at this Reconciliation Act as a responsible resource development and protection of the environment.
