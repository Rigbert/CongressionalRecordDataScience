 President, today I rise to pay tribute to SFC Scott E. Nisely, who made the ultimate sacrifice while serving his country. Sergeant Nisely, of Marshalltown, IA, was assigned to C Company, 1st Battalion, 133rd Infantry Regiment, 34th Infantry Division, Army National Guard, based out of Iowa Falls, IA. He was mobilized for Operation Iraqi Freedom with the unit in September 2005 and arrived in Iraq in early May 2006. He died at the age of 48, on September 30, 2006, in Al Asad, Iraq, when his military vehicle encountered small arms fire.  Staff Sergeant Nisely will be posthumously awarded the Bronze Star for the second time, the Purple Heart, the Iraq Campaign Medal, the Army Good Conduct Medal, the Armed Forces Reserve Medal with Mobilization device for the second time, and the Combat Infantryman Badge.  My thoughts and prayers have been with Scott's wife Geri and his children, Justin and Sarah, as well as all those other family and friends who are grieving his loss. Scott's family said, ``Scott was a dedicated and loving husband and father. He was actively involved in his children's lives. He was a loyal, compassionate, and caring friend that everyone liked. He loved and was committed to God, and was very involved with his church and community.''  Learning about the sacrifice of Scott Nisely, I am reminded of the words ofJohn 15:13: ``Greater love has no man than this, that he lay down his life for his friends.''  His family also said of Scott that he ``loved his country and was a volunteer career service-member that was proud and honored to serve his country.'' Our Nation will be forever grateful for Scott Nisely's loyal service and sacrifice. His loss is tragic, but he will be remembered as an American hero.
