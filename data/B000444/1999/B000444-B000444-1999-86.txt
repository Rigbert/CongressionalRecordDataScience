 I appreciate the respect he has shown for the efforts I have been making, notwithstanding we disagree on this considerably.  I want to make this closing point at this moment, and that is, it has been said by the Republican leader, Senator Lott, that 45 Senators demanded a vote on this treaty now. But 45 Senators signed a letter, including me. It was a Biden resolution--one that was about to be voted on when we were on another piece of legislation--that we have extensive hearings this year and that final action not occur until the end of March of next year, so everybody could have a chance to go through all of these hearings, so everybody could have a chance to debate what we are talking about at much greater length than today.  There has not been the bipartisan negotiation on conditions to this Resolution of Ratification that usually occurs during consideration of treaties.  Mr. President, I see my friend from North Carolina is seeking recognition. I will be delighted to yield the floor to him.
