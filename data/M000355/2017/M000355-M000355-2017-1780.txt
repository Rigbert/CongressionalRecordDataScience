 President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Young). Without objection, it is so ordered.                   Recognition of the Majority Leader  The majority leader is recognized.                 Welcoming the Prime Minister of Canada  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, later today we will welcome Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to the Capitol. Canada is more than just our neighbor. Canada is our ally. I am looking forward to a productive discussion with him.                          Cabinet Nominations  Mr. President, after much unnecessary delay from Senate Democrats, we will finally confirm two more key Cabinet nominees this evening--Steve Mnuchin as Treasury Secretary and David Shulkin as Veterans Affairs Secretary. The President has selected two well qualified candidates to lead the charge on strengthening our economy and providing veterans with more of the care they deserve. I will have more to say on Mr. Mnuchin and Dr. Shulkin tomorrow, but for now I look forward to their confirmation this evening.  After we work with these nominees, we will continue to put the rest of President Trump's Cabinet in place.  It has been really disappointing to see the historic level of obstruction by Senate Democrats. I would like to remind our colleagues across the aisle of the very real consequences their actions have on our country and on the men and women forced to work grueling hours to keep the Senate running overnight last week.  There are so many who worked around the clock to keep the Senate operating and I would like to offer some words of thanks now.  First, I would like to start with our floor staff led by Laura Dove on the Republican side and Gary Myrick on the Democratic side. They, along with the cloakroom staff and floor teams, worked nonstop to allow us to keep the floor running smoothly. So I want to thank them for their hard work and dedication.  I would also like to recognize the Senate pages, who didn't miss a beat just 2 weeks into their new job. They are Hailey Maggelet, Cameron Mabry, Shelby Hogan, Elizabeth Flachbart, Chris An, Sammy Potter, Sydney Jones, Cynthia Yue, Avery Beard, Wade Quigley, Eddie Owens, Hannah Seawell, Chloe Smith, Bryant Reynolds, Taylor Ball, Mitchell Heiman, Drew Beussink, Harrison Bushnell, Lauren Cavignano, Mitchell Durbin, Allie Glassman, Pablo Gomez Garcia, Julia Graham, Savannah Hampton, Argenis Herrera, Riley Johnson, Holly Newman, Colin Solomon, Katrina Turner, and Kayla Zhu. I know we are all impressed by these young men and women, and we all appreciate the role they play in our Nation's government.  There are so many others, like Sergeant at Arms Frank Larkin and his Deputy, Jim Morhard, who work tirelessly behind the scenes to keep the Capitol running smoothly. I would like to thank their team: the doorkeepers, the Senate recording and television studio, the Press Galleries, the IT and technical support, and the help desk, the security and operations teams, the executive office, and the Capitol exchange operators, who oversee the many calls that come into Senate offices. Many of these teams provided support literally around the clock, and we are thankful.  Of course, none of this would have been possible without the Capitol Police, headed by Chief of Police Matthew Verderosa. These men and women worked overtime to ensure the safety of the Senate Chamber and the entire Capitol as Members and their staffs worked through the night. We thank them for their service and for keeping us safe every day.  I would also like to thank the Secretary of the Senate, Julie Adams, Assistant Secretary Mary Suit Jones, and their entire team.  Specifically, I would like to thank the following offices and staffers, many of whom who worked for more than 50 straight hours: the Official Reporters of Debates, which include Patrick Renzi, Susie Nguyen, Julia Jones, Mary Carpenter, Patrice Boyd, Octavio Colominas, Alice Haddow, Andrea Huston, Carol Darche, Desirae Jura, Megan McKenzie, Wendy Caswell, Diane Dorhamer, Mark Stuart, and Julie Bryan; the Captioning Services team, which includes Sandra Schumm, Brenda Jamerson, Doreen Chendorain, Jennifer Smolka, and Laurie Harris.  In addition to the offices I just named, I would also like to recognize the following legislative offices: The Bill Clerk, the Enrolling Clerk, the Executive Clerk, the Journal Clerk, the Legislative Clerk, the Daily Digest, and, of course, the Parliamentarians.  Lastly, I would like to thank our subway drivers and the Government Publishing Office, which worked tirelessly to get the Record printed.  We are also grateful for the long hours and sacrifice that each of these offices and staffers made last week. Of course, it was completely unnecessary but, nevertheless, they were here through the night.                       Nomination of Neil Gorsuch  Mr. President, now, one final matter. When President Clinton took office in 1993, he named his first nominee to the Supreme Court, Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Ginsburg's nomination was not without controversy. She had argued for positions that are still quite controversial today. For example, she had questioned the constitutionality of laws against bigamy because they implicated private relationships. For the same reason, she had opined that there might be a constitutional right to prostitution. She always advocated for coeducational prisons and juvenile facilities. She even proposed abolishing Mother's Day.  So you can understand why Senators wanted to get her views on issues that might come before her as a Justice, but when pressed at her confirmation hearing, here is what she had to say:       You are well aware that I came to this proceeding to be      judged as a judge, not as an advocate. Because I am and hope      to continue to be a judge, it would be wrong for me to say or      preview in this legislative chamber how I would cast my vote      on questions the Supreme Court may be called upon to decide.      Were I to rehearse here what I would say and how I would      reason on such questions, I would act injudiciously. Judges      in our system are bound to decide concrete cases, not      abstract issues.  She went on:       A judge sworn to decide impartially can offer no forecasts,      no hints, for that would show not only disregard for the      specifics of a particular case, it would display disdain for      the entire judicial process.  So summing it up, she said: No hints, no forecasts, no previews, and that is what has become known as the Ginsburg standard. Supreme Court nominees of Presidents of both parties have adhered to it.  For example, President Clinton's second nominee, Stephen Breyer, noted that ``there is nothing more important to a judge than to have an open mind and to listen carefully to arguments,'' and so he told the Judiciary Committee he did ``not want to predict or commit myself on an open issue that I feel is going to come up in the Court.'' That meant, he said, not discussing ``how'' a ``right applies, where it applies, under what circumstances'' it applies.  When his nomination to be Chief Justice was pending, John Roberts said that adhering to the principle embodied in the Ginsburg standard is ``of great importance not only to potential Justices but to judges, which most nominees to the Supreme Court already are.''  ``We're sensitive,'' he said, ``to the need to maintain the independence and integrity of the Court.''  Let me repeat that. The Chief Justice said this principle was necessary ``to maintain the independence and integrity of the Court.''  He then explained how the Ginsburg standard helps maintain that independence. Nominees, he said, ``go on the Court not as a delegate from [the Judiciary] Committee with certain commitments laid out and how they're going to approach cases.''  Rather, ``[T]hey go on the Court as Justices who will approach cases with an open mind and decide those cases in light of the arguments presented, the record presented, and the rule of law.And the litigants before them,'' he concluded, ``have a right to expect that and to have the appearance of that as well. That has been the approach that all of the Justices have taken.''  At the time, my colleague from New York and other Senate Democrats were upset that the Chief Justice followed Justice Ginsburg's approach--even though many of them didn't complain when she refused to preview or prejudge legal issues during her confirmation hearing.  But guess who came to the Chief Justice's defense. Justice Ginsburg. She felt compelled to depart from protocol and weigh in on the matter. She said: ``Judge Roberts was unquestionably right'' in refusing to preview or prejudge legal issues at his confirmation hearing.  Both of President Obama's nominees adhered to the Ginsburg standard as well. His first nominee, Sonia Sotomayor, explained that what her ``experience on the trial court and the appellate court have reinforced for me is that the process of judging is a process of keeping an open mind. It's the process,'' she continued, ``of not coming to a decision with a prejudgment ever of an outcome. . . . `' That process, she said, applied not only to the cases that would come before her on the Supreme Court if she were confirmed but that could come before her in her then-current capacity as a circuit court judge.  Most Senators of both parties have respected the Ginsburg standard.  For example, during her hearing, Senator Leahy told Justice Ginsburg that he ``certainly'' didn't want her ``to have to lay out a test here in the abstract which might determine what [her] vote or [her] test would be in a case [she had] yet to see that may well come before the Supreme Court.'' Even my friend from New York has recognized the Ginsburg Standard is a ``grand tradition.''  The far left has been pushing my counterpart and other Senate Democrats to oppose anyone--anyone--whom the President nominates to the Supreme Court. So the Ginsburg standard is given way to the double standard.  My friend from New York now says this Supreme Court nominee has to pass some ``special test''--some ``special test''--to show his judicial independence. He says Judge Gorsuch, a highly respected, experienced jurist, must preview his approach or even prejudge legal issues that could come before him, like whether the President's Executive order on refugee vetting is ``constitutional.'' This is clearly an effort to get Judge Gorsuch to prejudge not a matter that could be in the Federal courts but to prejudge on a matter that is in the Federal courts right now.  Senator Schumer is not alone in wanting to replace the Ginsburg standard with a new double standard. His colleague who serves on the Judiciary Committee, the senior Senator from Connecticut, also says that Judge Gorsuch, for the first time with Supreme Court nominees, has some ``special obligation''--some ``special obligation''--to give his views on ``specific issues,'' without the benefit of the judicial process that Justice Sotomayor noted was so important.  Under our colleagues' approach, there is no need to review the record in the case, no need to do any legal research, no need to hear the best arguments from each side, no need to deliberate with your colleagues on the bench to arrive at a correct result. Nope. Just give a driveby legal conclusion on a complicated and consequential matter of constitutional law.  Let's be clear about what is going on here. This new ``special test'' and ``special obligation'' aren't about ensuring Judge Gorsuch's judicial independence; they are about compromising it. Our friends on the other side of the aisle want to constrain his ability to rule in a later case according to the facts and the law by holding him to what he said in their meetings or what he said under oath at his hearing.  In the upside down world of my Democratic friends, Judge Gorsuch must lose his judicial independence--both as a sitting circuit court judge and as a future Supreme Court Justice--in order to prove his judicial independence.  As Justice Ginsburg and Justice Breyer and Justice Sotomayor all noted, the process of judging is about having an open mind, seeing what the facts are in a particular case, hearing the arguments on both sides, and making what the judge believes is the correct ruling according to the law. It is not about a judge hemming himself in before a legislative body by previewing how he would view a legal issue, or, as Senator Leahy noted, announcing the legal test he might apply in a particular case, and it is definitely not about that judge saying whether something in the abstract is constitutional.  So under this double standard, Senators must respect the need for judicial independence of the Supreme Court nominees of Democratic Presidents, even when those nominees espouse views that are far, far outside the mainstream, like suggesting there is a constitutional right to prostitution or urging the abolition of Mother's Day.  Under this double standard, Senators can compromise the judicial independence of clearly mainstream Supreme Court nominees of Republican Presidents, even when those nominees are, like Judge Gorsuch, well-known proponents of maintaining judicial independence, who have a long record on the issue.  That is not just my view of Judge Gorsuch's commitment to judicial independence, by the way; that is according to prominent Democratic lawyers like President Obama's top litigator in the Supreme Court.  This Democratic double standard, though, is not surprising. Recall that the Democratic leader said he was prepared to keep Justice Scalia's seat open for 4 years--4 years. That was made difficult by the nomination of an outstanding candidate like Judge Gorsuch.  So our colleague came up with a new supermajority standard for his confirmation--a standard that didn't exist for seven of the eight Justices currently on the Court--a fact my friend later had to admit.  The Democratic double standard on requiring nominees to prejudge issues is just the latest attempt to come up with something, with anything--anything--to justify opposing an exceptional nominee like Judge Gorsuch. Judge Gorsuch is one of the most impressive, most highly qualified nominees to ever come before us. He has won kudos from across the political spectrum. Even the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee couldn't help but praise him.  Instead of appreciating that our new President has nominated an accomplished, independent, and thoughtful jurist, Democrats are viewing this outstanding nominee as a political problem. Their base is demanding total resistance to everything, but they can't find a good reason to oppose Judge Gorsuch on the merits. They are in a pickle.  So we have this attempt to replace the bipartisan Ginsburg standard with the double standard. I understand the difficulty of their situation, but the standard we are going to follow with this nominee is the same one--the same one--we followed for Ruth Bader Ginsburg and every other Justice on the Court since then: no hints, no forecasts, no previews, fair consideration, and an up-or-down vote.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
