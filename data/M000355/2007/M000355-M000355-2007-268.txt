 President, 10 years ago a Republican-controlled Congress created and passed the State Children's Health Insurance Program. It targets the health care needs of poor children whose families make too much to be eligible for Medicaid but are still in danger of not being able to afford private health insurance.  In many ways, this program, SCHIP, is a remarkable success. The rate of children in America living without health insurance dropped 25 percent from 1996 to 2005. Last year, 6.6 million children had health care coverage thanks to SCHIP, including more than 50,000 in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Those are some truly astounding numbers.  There is a lot of good in the current SCHIP law that we should reauthorize, but at the same time, we should also modernize and improve it.  Our goal should be to continue to target those low-income children who fall between the cracks and go without health insurance. And we should seek out those children who are eligible for SCHIP, but currently go without, and bring them into the program.  Unfortunately, I have serious concerns with the bill that the Finance Committee sent to the floor. I do appreciate all the hard work of the ranking member, Senator Grassley, as well as Senator Hatch, who is one of the original authors of this program. However, the committee's bill is a dramatic departure from current SCHIP law: It will significantly raise taxes, increase spending, and lead to government-run health insurance.  Funding for this proposed massive increase in spending relies not just on a massive tax increase, but also on a budgeting gimmick. Their plan will increase SCHIP spending every year for the next 5 years, with projected spending of $8.4 billion in 2012.  Then suddenly in 2013, like magic, spending would drop to only $400 million--a decrease of $8 billion in one year. That's not because the funds won't be needed--rather, it is a sleight of hand needed to fit the program within the bill's funding limits.  But does anyone seriously think Congress will decide to cut SCHIP by $8 billion in one year, so that millions who rely on it will lose their health insurance? Of course not. Future Congresses will go back and spend more, and this proposal will end up costing exponentially more than its current price tag.  Under this scenario, the Congressional Budget Office estimates the total cost of this bill over the period from 2008 to 2017 is actually $112 billion--$41 billion more than the advertised price.  And most of this increase will go toward people that SCHIP was never meant to cover.  The expansion proposal we are considering here on the floor will allow SCHIP coverage to extend to families with incomes as high as 400 percent of the Federal poverty level--even though 89 percent of children in families with incomes as high as 300 to 400 percent of the Federal poverty level already have private coverage.  The bill also includes a tax increase, when the American people are already taxed too much. So I hope we will have a free, open debate on this bill, and every Senator will be allowed to offer ideas to improve it.  Senators Lott, Kyl, Gregg, Bunning and I will propose an alternative measure called the Kids First Act. It refocuses SCHIP to help the people it was designed to help: low-income children.  While considerably less expensive to the taxpayers than the Finance Committee's bill, it's worth noting that many States, including Kentucky, would fare better next year under theKids First Act than under the committee bill.  Our plan is fiscally responsible and focuses Government assistance on those who really need it. I urge all of my colleagues to seriously consider it.  Many Senators have also worked exceedingly hard to craft comprehensive measures addressing the uninsured in America. I applaud their efforts, and look forward to having a full and open debate on the Senate floor about their ideas.  I especially want to recognize Senators Burr, Coburn, Corker, DeMint and Martinez for their work in this regard.  As we begin to consider SCHIP legislation, this Senate should focus on reauthorizing a program that works, instead of transforming it into a license for higher taxes, higher spending, and another giant leap toward government-run health care.  Legislation like that will not receive a Presidential signature. But this Senate can craft something that will. Let's work toward that and produce a bill that focuses on the true goals of SCHIP--providing a safety net for kids in low-income families.  I also have here an editorial from today's Wall Street Journal that describes many of the problems with the committee's bill I just detailed. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Wall Street Journal, July 30, 2007]                         The Newest Entitlement       The State Children's Health Insurance Program sounds like      the epitome of good government: Who could be against health      care for children? The answer is anyone who worries about one      more middle-class taxpayer entitlement and a further slide to      a government takeover of health care. Yet Schip is sailing      toward a major expansion with almost no media scrutiny, and      with Republicans in Congress running for cover.       Schip was enacted in 1997 to help insure children from      working-poor families who make too much to qualify for      Medicaid. In the intervening years, the program reduced the      rate of uninsured kids by about 25 percent but has also grown      to cover the middle class and even many adults--and it gets      bigger every year. Schip expires in September without      reauthorization, and Congressional Democrats want to enlarge      its $35 billion budget by at least $60 billion over five      years.       State Governors from both parties are also leading the      charge--and for their own self-interested reasons. Schip      money is delivered as a block grant, which the states match      while designing their own insurance programs. All cost      overruns, however, are billed to the federal government,      which is on the hook for about 70 percent of Schip's      ``matching rate.'' This offers incentives for state      politicians to make generous promises and shift the costs to      the feds, or to toy around with costly universal health-care      experiments. And since the states only get 57 cents on the      dollar for Medicaid, they are working hard to transfer those      recipients to Schip.       This self-interest explains a recent letter from the      National Governors Association demanding ``urgent action'' on      Schip, which got lots of favorable play in the press. Yet      these are the same Governors who have been moaning for years      about rising entitlement burdens, which is what Schip will be      soon enough. Particularly egregious was the signature on the      letter of Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty, a Republican who      regards himself a conservative health-care maven and should      know better.       This ``bipartisan'' cover is serving Democrats in Congress,      who want to liberalize Schip eligibility as part of their      march to national health care. The Senate Finance Committee      has voted 17-4 to increase Schip spending to at least $112      billion over 10 years. Not only does it use a budget trick to      hide a payment hole of at least $30 billion, it proposes to      offset the increase by bumping up the cigarette tax by 61      cents to $1 a pack.       House Democrats are putting the finishing touches on their      own plan, making the cigarette tax somewhat lower to win over      tobacco-state Members. Instead, the House is proposing to      steal nearly $50 billion from Medicare Advantage, the      innovative attempt to bring private competition to senior      health care.       Michigan's John Dingell explains that ``these are not      cuts'' but ``reductions in completely unjustified      overpayments''--which will come as news to insurers that      offered coverage plans based on certain funding expectations.      The ``overpayments'' he's referring to were passed expressly      as an incentive for companies to offer Medicare Advantage in      rural areas with traditionally fewer insurance options--and      are intended to be phased out over time. Democrats apparently      want to starve any private option for Medicare.       In any case, the actual costs of Schip will overwhelm these      financing gimmicks. Like all government insurance, Schip is      ``covering'' more children by displacing private insurance.      According to the Congressional Budget Office, for every 100      children who are enrolled in the proposed Schip expansion,      there will be a corresponding reduction in private insurance      for between 25 and 50 children. Although there is a net      increase in coverage, it comes by eroding the private system.       This crowd-out effect is magnified moving up the income      scale. In 2005, 77 percent of children between 200 percent      and 300 percent of the poverty level already had private      insurance, which is where the Senate compromise wants to move      Schip participation. New York State is moving to 400 percent      of poverty, or some $82,000 in annual income. All of this      betrays the fact that the real political objective of Schip      is more government control--HillaryCare on the installment      plan.       We'd have thought Capitol Hill Republicans would understand      all this, especially with the White House vowing to veto any      big Schip expansion. But we hear the GOP lacks the Senate      votes for a filibuster and perhaps even to sustain a veto.      GOP Senators Mitch McConnell and Jon Kyl are backing an      alternative to account for population growth and reach the      remaining 689,000 uninsured children that Schip was intended      to help. Republicans would be wise to support this version,      or they'll take one more step to returning to their historic      minority party status as tax collectors for the welfare      state.
