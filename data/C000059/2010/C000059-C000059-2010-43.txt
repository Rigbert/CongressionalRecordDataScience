On Thursday, April 1, 2010, John passed away. He will be deeply missed.  Born in Yuba City on June 30, 1940, John grew up in San Francisco and attended city schools and community colleges before enlisting in the U.S. Marine Corps in the early 1960s. After serving in the U.S. Marine Corps, he worked with the California State Department of Transportation, Division of Highways. He received his bachelor's degree in business management from the University of San Francisco. John passed his civil engineering licensing exam on the first try and became a registered Civil Engineer in California and Nevada.  In 1968, John accepted an engineering position with J.F. Davidson in Riverside. He worked his way to the top, becoming a partner with Davidson, and ultimately opening his own company in 1997, Canty Engineering Group. John eventually sold this company after years of success in order to travel with his wife, Jan.  Though he was known for having a sharp mind and many professional talents, John will be remembered most for his generosity and integrity. He was an active member of the Calvary Presbyterian Church and the Kiwanis Club of Uptown Riverside, which awarded him the Legion of Honor plaque in 2008 to recognize his more than 40 years of service.  On behalf of all those who knew him, it is my honor to offer these remarks as a tribute to the life and legacy of my friend John Canty. His life and presence will be sorely missed and I extend my condolences to his dear family and friends.                          ____________________
