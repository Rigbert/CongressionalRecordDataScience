So I now do refer to the fact that the Senator from Utah said people should not be demonized as being against people of faith if they oppose somebody.  I appreciate it. It is the first time I have heard that said on his side of the aisle. Unfortunately, many others have been saying just the opposite. That is why I wish the majority leader would not act in support of such a campaign this weekend.
