Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time, and I thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. Gilman) for bringing this resolution, along with the minority, to the floor.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1064 and urge my colleagues to support it. I am an original cosponsor of this bill, offered by my friend, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), the chairman of the Helsinki Commission. As he has noted, whatever our views on the American involvement in the Balkans, we all have a common interest in bringing democratic change to Serbia, which will enhance long-term stability in the region, allow our troops in Kosovo and Bosnia to return home sooner, with their mission accomplished, and preclude the need for further intervention to thwart Slobodan Milosevic's aggression.  Clearly, democratic change in Serbia is the single most critically needed development in southeast Europe today. First and foremost, the people of Serbia deserve the same ability to exercise their human rights and fundamental freedoms that so many other Europeans enjoy. Secondly, it, more than anything else, would contribute to security in the region. Indeed, it would increase tremendously the chances for resolving conflicts and encouraging social reconciliation.  The gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith) and I have served together on the Helsinki Commission for a long time, over a decade and a half, and we have worked together to promote human rights in Europe and in other parts of the world, I might add.                              {time}  1745  Our efforts have been especially relevant in the Balkans, where Milosevicand his regime have instigated conflict and orchestrated genocide to perpetuate their rule and enhance their power and privilege. The international community, Mr. Speaker, has been slow to respond and sometimes ineffective in the face of this threat to European stability. Only with the intervention of the United States has action been taken.  Since Kosovo, however, there is a more united view than ever between the United States, Europe and the international community as a whole that democratic change must come to Serbia. There is also a greater realization that the threat Serbia poses comes not from the Serb people. Let me repeat that. The threat comes not from the Serb people but from Milosevic and his henchmen. Indeed, the people of Serbia, and the people of Montenegro, who are in a Yugoslav federation with Serbia, have suffered far too long under Milosevic's repression. They, the Serbians, the Montenegrans, deserve to take their rightful place in the democratic community of Europe.  Mr. Speaker, national elections were held in Yugoslavia yesterday, as many have said. We do not yet know the final results and there are, as predicted, widespread allegations of fraud. Early reports indicate that the opposition is claiming first round victory with more than 50 percent of the vote. That in my opinion would be an extraordinarily happy circumstance. The Milosevic camp, not committed to democracy, committed to authoritarian rule, committed to attaining their ends by whatever means are necessary, are claiming that they are ahead 44 percent to 41 percent, indicating a need for a second round runoff. Nobody in the international community believes that representation.  It is widely believed that Milosevic simply will not concede. He has hinted that, as he has said, his term does not formally end until next year, giving him another 9 months or so entrenched in power and in perversion. Alternatively, he may simply turn up the level of fraud to ensure a second-round victory and crack down on whatever opposition might exist.  At this point, Mr. Speaker, we do not know what Serbia will be like, even in the near future, other than the fact that it will not be the same. It might change, we pray, drastically for the better or tragically for the worse. Either way, this bill sends the message that we are there for the people of Serbia. The alternative, to send no message at all, Mr. Speaker, is the message that Milosevic wants to hear.  I urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 1064.
