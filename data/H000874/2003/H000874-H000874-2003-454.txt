 The smallpox vaccination compensation bill, I know there are ongoing discussions. It is my understanding, from what I have heard the gentleman say, that the expectation is that is not going to be on the calendar next week.  Mr. DeLAY. If the gentleman will yield, Mr. Speaker, he may remember that last week during our discussion I mentioned that we are trying to move forward on a product under a very tight time frame that all Members could support. We really would like to see this bill come to the floor in a bipartisan way.  I understand the gentleman from Louisiana (Chairman Tauzin) and the ranking member, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Dingell), have had daily, if not hourly, discussions on this legislation and at times have become very close to a compromise that all Members could likely support. The bill was pulled from consideration this week primarily because the interested parties believe that the differences on the issues are minimal now and that more time could in fact yield a reasonable compromise.  I would just note for the gentleman that this is a relatively small authorization for a fund that would serve a very targeted community, and usually the House considers legislation of this nature under suspensions of the rules. I would hope that we could bring this bill under suspension as soon as possible.
