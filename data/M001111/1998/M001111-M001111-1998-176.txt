 President, soon after the upcoming recess, I will join my colleague, Senator Slade Gorton, to introduce the Dungeness Crab Conservation and Management Act. The ocean Dungeness crab fishery in WA, OR, and CA has been successfully managed by the three states for many years. The states cooperate on season openings, male-only harvest requirements, and minimum sizes; and all three states have enacted limited entry programs. Although the resource demonstrates natural cycles in abundance, over time the fishery has been sustained at a profitable level for fishermen and harvesters with no biological problems.  The fishery is conducted both within state waters and in the federal exclusive economic zone (EEZ). Although state landing laws restrict fishermen to delivering crab only to those states in which they are licensed, the actual harvest takes place along most of the West Coast, roughly from San Francisco to the Canadian border. Thus, it is not unusual for an Oregon-licensed fisherman from Newport to fish in the EEZ northwest of Westport, WA, and deliver his catch to a processor in Astoria, OR.  In recent years, federal court decisions under the umbrella of U.S. versus Washington have held that Northwest Indian tribes have treaty rights to harvest a share of the crab resource off Washington. To accommodate these rights, the State of Washington, has restricted fishing by Washington-licensed fishermen. This led Washington fishermen to request an extension of state fisheries jurisdiction into the EEZ. The Congress partially granted this request during the last Congress by giving the West Coast states interim authority over Dungeness crab, which expires in 1999 (16 U.S.C. 1856 note). The Congress also expressed its interest in seeing a fishery management plan established for Dungeness crab and asked the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) to report to Congress on this issue by December, 1997.  The PFMC established an industry committee to examine the issues, which developed several options. At its June meeting, the PFMC selected two options for further development and referred them for analysis to the Tri-State Dungeness Crab Committee which operates under the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission. After lengthy debate, the Tri-State Committee recommended to the Council that the Congress be requested to make the interim authority permanent with certain changes, including a clarification of what license is required for the fishery, broader authority for the states to ensure equitable access to the resource, and clarification of tribal rights. The Tri-State Committee agrees that each state's limited entry laws should apply only to vessels registered in that state. I ask unanimous consent to include the report of the Tri-State Dungeness Crab Committee and the membership list of the Committee in the Record following my remarks.  On September 12, 1997, the PFMC unanimously agreed to accept and support the Tri-State Committee recommendation. The Council agreed that the existing management structure effectively conserves the resource, that allocation issues are resolved by the restriction on application of state limited entry laws, that tribal rights are protected, and that the public interest in conservation and fiscal responsibility after better served by the legislative proposal than by developing and implemeting a fishery management plan under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. This legislation will fully implement the Tri-State Committee recommendation and ensure the conservation and sound management of this important West Coast fishery.  I look foward to the Senate's timely consideration of this bill.Report of the Tri-State Dungeness Crab Committee to the Pacific Fishery  Management Council on Options for Dungeness Crab Fishery Management,                              August 7, 1997       The Tri-State Dungeness Crab Committee met on August 6-7,      1997 to review the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC)      Analysis of Options for Dungeness Crab Management. A list of      the attending Committee members, advisors, and observers is      attached. After completing that review, the Committee      discussed the merits of each option and offered the following      comments for PFMC consideration.       There was general agreement within the Committee that      Option 1, No Action, would not satisfy the current needs of      the industry. There was unanimous opposition, however, among      Oregon and California representatives to Option 3,      Development of a Limited Federal Fishery Management Plan      (FMP). Washington representatives were not strongly in favor      of a FMP, but viewed it as the only realistic means to      address their concerns for the fishery. After an extended      discussion, it     was the consensus of the Committee that a modified version of      Option 2, Extension of Interim Authority, was preferred.       There were three common themes that appeared during the      discussion. No Committee members believe that there should be      fishing or processing of Dungeness crab in waters of the EEZ      under PFMC jurisdiction by any vessel not permitted or      licensed in either Washington, Oregon, or California. The      Committee generally accepted that additional tools beyond      area closures and pot limits could be needed to address      tribal allocation issues. Finally, the Committee also agreed      that as a matter of fairness, vessels fishing alongside each      other in an area should be subject to the same regulations.      On that basis, the Tri-State Dungeness Crab Committee      recommends that:       1. The PFMC immediately request that Congress make the      current Interim Authority a permanent part of the Magnuson-     Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, applying      only to Pacific coast Dungeness crab, with the following      adjustments.       (a) delete the limitations listed in the current Section 2      of the Interim Authority so that state regulations will apply      equally to all vessels in the EEZ and adjacent State waters;      and       (b) clarify the language in the current Section 3B of the      Interim Authority to prohibit participation in the fishery by      vessels that are not registered in either Washington, Oregon,      or California.       2. The PFMC defer action on a Dungeness crab FMP until      March 1998 to determine whether Congress will be receptive to      this extension of the Interim Authority.       Proposed draft bill language for an extension of the      Interim Authority is attached.       This recommendation is not made without reservations on      both sides. Washington representatives were reluctant to      totally withdraw consideration of a federal FMP option, in      the event that efforts to extend the Interim Authority fail.      They expressed little confidence that a request for      Congressional action would be successful. Representatives      from Oregon were concerned that discriminatory regulations      could be enacted in the future by other states that could      effectively exclude them from participation on traditional      fishing grounds. They preferred this risk over the      involvement of federal agencies under a federal fishery      management plan.
