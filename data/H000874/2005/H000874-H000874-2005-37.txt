Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.  I understand the gentleman from Hawaii, and I checked to make sure I understood him correctly and the facts correctly, is that the Senate has offered an amendment which is included in the Defense bill which is being conferenced, the very bill to which this motion is being directed, that we take the Senate language that is in the Defense bill. So, obviously, it is absolutely relevant on the bill that is going to conference. In fact, it would not be relevant in any other piece of legislation.  I suggest to my friend that the gentleman is correct, it ought to be offered in a relevant time, and now is the relevant time.  Mr. McHUGH. Mr. Speaker, if I may reclaim my time, I do not disagree with the gentleman that the Senate, as the Senate does, has done something that should not be done. It is something inappropriate and something totally based upon the rule of no rule. I agree with the gentleman.  However, the gentleman from Hawaii's context was to the House bill, which has no application, no provision, to this. That was the relevancy in my comments. That is all I was questioning was his comment relevant to the House bill. There is no provision, as there should have not have been, because this is not relevant to the House bill.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
