President, I understand the concerns raised by my colleagues about this rule. The point has been made that the EPA should not create a major disincentive for switching to energy efficient lamps by requiring burdensome treatment of the lamps. On the other hand, 42 States have consumption warnings for eating the fish from the streams and lakes in our towns. Mercury containing lamps are the largest single contributor of mercury to the municipal waste stream, and our policies should take that fact into consideration. Our country has a mercury pollution problem that warrants our attention, and I share the chairman's concern about addressing the problem in a way that makes sense in cost-benefit analysis context.  I also understand the Chairman's concern about expediting the final rule. However, I want to point out that we are considering this bill only 3 days from the end of the fiscal year. Final passage of the conference report may not occur until late next month. The deadline included in the report language may allow for only a month for EPA to decide, with holidays. I just want to emphasize that this is a very tight timeline, and it does not provide the recycling industry enough time to adjust if necessary. I would like to work with other Senators to ensure that there is an adequate adjustment period.
