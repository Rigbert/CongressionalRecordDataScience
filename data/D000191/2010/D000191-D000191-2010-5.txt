  Mr. DeFAZIO. Madam Speaker, today, the Senate with one vote willincrease this fiscal year's deficit by $430 billion under the pretense that it will get our economy back on track and create millions of jobs--and yes, there is a Santa Claus. Thank you very much.  Over 2 years, $858 billion in total has been financed with money borrowed, in good part, from China to pay for an extension of the stimulus tax cuts with a new twist--the money will be stolen from the Social Security Trust Fund and a large dose of Bush era trickle-down tax cuts, with new breaks for States over $10 million.  Last week, the Democratic Caucus spoke almost unanimously against this--and this week, under pressure from the White House and the Republican leader of the Senate, it appears our leadership is attempting to avoid our wishes and bring this bill forward without major changes. It will be a disaster for the American people. It is a bad deal for taxpayers, people who are unemployed and our kids and grandkids.                          ____________________
