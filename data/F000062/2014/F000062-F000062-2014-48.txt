 President, I rise to reintroduce the Veteran Voting Support Act, which is cosponsored by Senators Leahy, Durbin, and Reid.  Almost 7 years ago, during the previous administration, I learned that a Department of Veterans Affairs facility in California had barred voter registration groups from accessing veterans in the facility. Similar reports emerged in other parts of the country.  This was unacceptable. Therefore, then-Senator Kerry and I worked with the VA to establish a fair, nonpartisan policy to facilitate voter registration and voting for veterans who receive services at VA facilities.  We held a hearing in the Rules Committee on a previous version of this bill on September 15, 2008, when I was Chairman of that committee.  One week before that hearing, the VA issued a directive that created a new and substantially improved policy to permit state and local election officials, as well as nonpartisan groups, to access VA facilities.  Yet many expressed concerns that it did not go far enough. For example, the Brennan Center for Justice, American Association for People with Disabilities, Common Cause, Demos, and the League of Women Voters sent me a letter stating that the directive was ``an important step in the right direction'' but stressed ``that the VA's recent directive will not be sufficient to protect the voting rights of the men and women served by the VA.''  Paul Sullivan, then Executive Director of Veterans for Common Sense, said: ``There is a veteran voting rights crisis. As many as 100,000 of our veterans living in VA facilities may not be able to vote in our November 4 election.''  Mr. Sullivan also explained a key problem facing veterans who live at a VA facility: ``When a veteran moves into a VA facility, the veteran's old registration becomes invalid. The veteran must re-register before he or she can vote again.''  In short, while many believed the VA's directive was not perfect, they also acknowledged it was an improvement.  I am sad to report that the 2008 voting assistance directive expired at the end of September 2013. That means no voting assistance directive is in place at the VA, with the mid-term elections only a few months away.  This is unacceptable. There is no justification for it. Veterans' voting rights, like the voting rights of others, do not have an expiration date.  There is no question about the continuing need for VA action in this area.  While the VA's directive was in place, from 2008 to 2012, veteran voter registration ticked up only slightly, from 77 to 78 percent, according to the Census Bureau's Current Population Survey.  But during the same period, actual voting by veterans dropped as a percentage of the veteran population--from 70.9 percent to 70.3 percent.  In raw numbers, there remain over 4.6 million veterans who either are unregistered or for whom the Census Bureau's data reports no response.  In the 2012 election, there were over 6.2 million veterans who either did not vote or for whom the Census data reports no response.  Thus, there is much more to do to help our veterans register and cast their ballots.  The VA is the agency best suited to do the job because it comes into contact with several million veterans each year.  In fact, in 2013, according to the VA's latest statistics, there were over 6.41 million unique patients in the VA health care system, up from 5.65 million in 2008, a 15 percent increase.  Today, I am reintroducing the Veteran Voting Support Act, which, unlike a VA directive, cannot be rescinded by the VA and would not expire.  This bill would take important steps to improve veterans' ability to register and vote.  First, the bill would require the VA to provide a veteran seeking to enroll in the VA health care system with a mail-in voter registration form. Such a form would also have to be provided to currently enrolled veterans upon a change of address or enrollment status.  The VA would be required to send such forms to the appropriate state election official within 10 days, or within five days if the form is received within five days before a registration deadline.  Second, the VA would be required to provide assistance to veterans seeking to register to vote using the mail-in form. Such assistance would be non-partisan.  Third, the bill would require the director of a VA community living center, domiciliary, or medical center to provide assistance to veterans with respect to voting by absentee ballot, consistent with state and local laws. This section is limited to residents of a community living center or domiciliary and inpatients of a medical center.  Fourth, the bill would ensure that the VA provides access for nonpartisan organizations to provide voter registration and assistance at VA facilities.  This is subject to reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions, including limiting activities to regular business hours and requiring advance notice to the facility.  Fifth, the bill would prevent the VA from prohibiting access to VA facilities by election administration officials at the state and local levels, as long as the officials provide only nonpartisan information about voting, such as voter registration, voting systems, absentee balloting, and polling locations. This is also subject to reasonable, time, place, and manner restrictions.  Finally, the bill would require the VA to report annually on the number of veterans helped by this bill.  We owe our veterans a great debt. That debt includes a promise we will not deny them the right to vote and will commit to involving them in the process of choosing leaders who may send Americans into harm's way. This bill would help veterans register to vote, and it would help veterans living in VA facilities cast their ballots.  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Veteran Voting Support Act.                                 ______                                       By
