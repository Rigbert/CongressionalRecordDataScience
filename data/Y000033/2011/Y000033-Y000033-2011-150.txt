The second one, the newest one to come out is a regulation by EPA under the oil spill liability clause where the EPA is proposing a regulation to apply to dairies because milk has fat in it. They want to apply the oil spill liability regulation to a dairy. That means each cow costs $600 per life of the cow because they want to clean up milk. The saying ``don't cry over spilt milk'' is now going to cost you money, a regulation by an agency that makes no sense at all.  Wake up, Mr. and Mrs. America. Let's eliminate these regulations that prohibit job creation in this country. That is what we ought to be talking about.
