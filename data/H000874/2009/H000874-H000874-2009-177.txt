 There has been unprecedented, I reiterate, I don't think you can remember, and I have been here 29 years and I can't remember a bill that has been more widely vetted than this bill in terms of the American public. Maybe the Social Security proposal the President some years ago had, that was pretty widely vetted, but I don't think as widely vetted as this proposal.  So I say to the gentleman, you go and you vet the bill, you discuss alternatives, you then come back after having listened to those alternatives and fashion a bill. You don't have new committee hearings, whether it is a health care bill or any other bill. You amend it and you perfect it pursuant to hearings, and then you bring it to the floor. I don't expect we will treat this bill any differently.  Mr. McCARTHY of California. I thank the gentleman.  The only thing I would ask, knowing that the American public did have this bill vetted but the majority of the American public disagreed with this bill, disagreed with the public option, and having the transparency here that the American public is asking, having the American public so engaged and educated on health care and it being such an issue, I always thought it would be helpful not only to this body but to the American public itself, before we go and vote again, whatever comes before that bill to come to the House, that you allow the opportunity for Members to go home and have a townhall and explain what is in the final version of the bill before that vote takes place. I think the American public would appreciate it, and it would be a great opportunity for both sides.
