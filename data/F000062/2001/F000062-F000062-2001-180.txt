 President, I rise today to oppose the nomination of John R. Bolton as Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security. In many ways, Mr. Bolton's record, writing, and views lead me to believe that he is the wrong man at the wrong time for this position.  In considering this nomination I am most troubled by the fact that Mr.Bolton's views appear to be antithetical to both arms control and international law.  Although he has supported some security treaties, on the whole he has been highly critical of most of the treaties that comprise the foundations for nuclear arms control and nonproliferation.  When the Senate voted down the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, CTBT, for example, it is my understanding that Mr. Bolton applauded the defeat of ``the illusionary protection of unenforceable treaties''.  Arms control treaties and international efforts to control the spread of weapons of mass destruction are not the only way to address these threats, the United States must have other means and capabilities as well, but they have a place in U.S. foreign policy, and can play a useful role in safeguarding American interests.
