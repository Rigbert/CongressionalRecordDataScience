I ask my friends, the senior Senators from Michigan, Nevada, Rhode Island, and Idaho, if perhaps the senior Senator from Vermont could proceed for about 10 minutes on the subject of land mines without the Senator from Michigan losing his right to reclaim the floor. In the meantime, maybe through the work that is always done with such finesse by the senior Senator from Nevada, something can be worked out.
