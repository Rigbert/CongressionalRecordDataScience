Speaker, I rise today to remember those who lost their lives and those who are suffering the aftereffects of the world's worst nuclear accident--Chernobyl, April 26, 1986.  The suffering extends outside Ukraine's borders to Russia, Belarus and beyond. I ask my colleagues to take a moment to honor those innocent lives that will be forever changed by such a horrific event.  I applaud the efforts of the United States Department of Energy, the International Atomic Energy Association, and other donor nations in remediation and containment efforts in Ukraine. Estimates indicate that these projects may last at least 100 years. Our commitment must remain firm.  I am including for the Record an article highlighting some of the challenges ahead and devastation many have already faced.                     [From CBS News, Apr. 26, 2004]                         Remembering Chernobyl       Across the former Soviet Union, people lit candles, laid      flowers and held demonstrations Monday to mark the 18th      anniversary     of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, which spread radiation      over much of northern Europe.       In all, 7 million people in the former Soviet republics of      Belarus, Russia and Ukraine are estimated to suffer physical      or psychological effects of radiation related to the April      26, 1986, catastrophe, when reactor No. 4 exploded and caught      fire.       An area half the size of Italy was contaminated, forcing      hundreds of thousands of people to be resettled and ruining      some of Europe's most fertile agricultural land, the United      Nations said.       Hundreds of Ukrainians filled the small Chernobyl victims'      chapel in the Ukrainian capital, Kiev, at 1:23 a.m. Monday      (6:23 p.m. Sunday ET), the exact time of the explosion.      Later, they laid flowers and lit candles at a small hill      where marble plates are inscribed with the names of hundreds      of victims.       Nearly 1,000 mourners gathered Monday afternoon at Kiev's      memorial to Chernobyl victims, a soaring statue of five      falling metallic swans. Some placed flowers and photos of      deceased relatives at its base.       ``Nothing can be compared with a mother's sorrow,'' said      Praskoviya Nezhyvova, an elderly retiree clutching a black-     framed photograph of her son, Viktor. She said he died of      Chernobyl-related stomach cancer in 1990 at age 44.       Volodymyr Diunych, a driver who took members of the hastily      recruited and inadequately equipped cleanup crews to the      site, recalled watching as residents were evacuated ``in an      awful rush'' days after the disaster. Meanwhile, the Soviet      Union's traditional May Day celebrations went ahead in Kiev,      80 miles south of Chernobyl, only five days after the      accident.       Soviet authorities had withheld much information on the      world's worst nuclear accident, both from its own people and      from the rest of the world. Only last year, Ukraine's      security service declassified secret files documenting      malfunctions and safety violations at the plant that caused      the release of small doses of radiation from time to time      long before the explosion.       Ukraine shuttered Chernobyl's last working reactor in      December 2000, but many problems remain.       Ukrainian experts say that the concrete-and-steel shelter      that was hastily constructed over the damaged reactor needs      urgent repairs, but authorities claim that there are no      serious safety threats. Meanwhile, many people injured or      displaced because of the explosion complain about inadequate      government support.       Sergei Shchvetsov, the head of Russia's Chernobyl Union,      said that 40,000 people disabled in operations to clean up      the blast live in Russia and the ``volume of benefits to      which (they) are eligible is narrowing every year,'' the      ITAR-Tass news agency reported.       Greenpeace activists held a small protest outside Russia's      Department for the Inspection of Radiation Security, carrying      signs that read ``No more Chernobyls.''       Meanwhile, in the Ukrainian town of Slavutych--built to      house Chernobyl workers displaced by the accident--people      held a solemn memorial meeting early Monday to honor the      memory of their relatives, friends and colleagues.       The accident occurred after officials put the reactor      through a test in which power was reduced and some safety      devices were disabled.       More than 2.32 million people have been hospitalized in      Ukraine as of early 2004 with illnesses blamed on the      disaster, including 452,000 children, according to Ukraine's      Health Ministry. Ukraine has registered some 4,400 deaths.       The most frequently noted Chernobyl-related diseases      include thyroid and blood cancer, mental disorders and      cancerous growths. The United Nations said in a statement      that in some areas of Belarus, thyroid cancer among children      has increased more than 100-fold when compared with the      period before the accident.       Two years ago, the U.N. reported that 200,000 people still      live in highly contaminated areas and 4.5 million residents      in three countries are receiving financial help--draining      national budgets.       The explosion and fire at Chernobyl's No. 4 reactor      contaminated 23 percent of Belarus, 5 percent of Ukraine and      1.5 percent of Russia, according to the report. It also      spewed a radioactive cloud across Europe.                          ____________________
