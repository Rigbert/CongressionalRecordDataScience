  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). Without objection, it is so ordered.                     Tribute to Senator Jim Bunning  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I rise to pay tribute to a great friend of mine and a friend of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, former Senator Jim Bunning. Jim has been an inspiration to Kentuckians for decades in many different roles--as a public servant, a man of integrity, a devoted father of 9 children, grandfather of 35, and a great-grandfather of 12, with 1 more on the way. But few public servants or family men can also claim to be in the Baseball Hall of Fame. Jim Bunning can, for his extraordinary Major League pitching career with the Detroit Tigers and with the Philadelphia Phillies.  With Father's Day approaching this weekend, I thought it appropriate to remember what Jim Bunning accomplished on Father's Day 1964. The date was June 21, and in front of his wife Mary, his eldest daughter Barbara, and more than 32,000 cheering fans, Jim Bunning delivered the perfect Father's Day gift by pitching a perfect game.  Let me take a moment to explain, for those who do not spend their youth playing baseball and collecting baseball cards as some of us did, what pitching a perfect game means and why it is such a legendary feat. To pitch a perfect game, a pitcher must pitch a full nine innings without allowing a batter to get on base for any reason--no hits, no walks, no hits by a pitch, and no errors. Twenty-seven batters must step to the plate and all 27 must sit down. It is an achievement that has been accomplished only 23 times in more than 135 years of Major League Baseball history--23 times in the history of Major League Baseball.  At the time Jimmy's pitching perfection was only the seventh perfect game in Major League Baseball history. It was the first perfect game in regular season play in more than 42 years and the first in the National League since 1880. As the Philadelphia Phillies were the visitors against the New York Mets, it was also the first-ever perfect game pitched in Shea Stadium.  Jimmy's day started as did any other Sunday. He went to 9 a.m. Mass andhad a breakfast of eggs and sausage. He was worried about getting tickets for his wife and daughter to attend the game. He showed up at Shea Stadium to warm up for the first game of a doubleheader. ``I felt good and loose,'' Jim recalls. ``I realized right away that I had exceptional stuff.''  With a combination of fastballs, curveballs, and sliders, Jim began to make short work of the Mets' batting order. By the sixth inning, he began to consider that he was on the cusp of history.  ``Everyone is supposed to do perfect work, but perfection in the game of baseball is a rarity I never expected to accomplish.'' That is what the big right-hander had to say about that.  The final Met at bat was John Stephenson, a lefty. Here is how the Philadelphia Inquirer described the game's dramatic conclusion:       The rookie swung at a low-breaking ball and missed, took a      pitch for a second strike, then took two balls, one low      outside and the other high and away. Bunning came back with a      curve at the knees on the outside part of the plate.      Stephenson swung and missed and the Phillies made a bee-line      for the mound. They came running from their positions and      streamed out of the dugout to pound the former American      Leaguer on the back and escort him to the dugout.  The story continues:       A few minutes later, [Bunning] went on television for an      interview during which his wife and daughter rushed up to      kiss him. It was the thrill of a lifetime for the pitcher,      who richly deserved it.  That he did.  For baseball fans, the statistics on Jim's perfect game are truly numbers to behold. He threw only 90 pitches in the Phillies' 6-to-0 victory--an average of only 10 per inning. He struck out 10. He did not miss the strike zone more than four times in any inning. And he went to a three-ball count on only two batters. Statistically, it may be the most perfect of perfect games ever pitched.  Acclaim was instant. Jim appeared on ``The Ed Sullivan Show'' that night. This man, who was always a fierce competitor both on the pitching mound and in the Halls of Congress, had reached the pinnacle of his profession. But it won't surprise any of my colleagues who know and worked with Jim that he did not let this sudden rush of fame go to his head. ``Fame is fleeting as far as the next hitter at the plate is concerned,'' says Jim. I admire my friend and former colleague's ability to keep such a momentous event in perspective.  It is fitting that his perfect game occurred on Father's Day because family is really what Jim Bunning is all about. The Bunning family celebrated their dad's perfect game not at a fancy Manhattan restaurant but at the Howard Johnson's on the New Jersey Turnpike. And I know his lovely wife Mary has been his rock and his foundation for his entire career in both baseball and politics.  Jim Bunning was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1996. But for any baseball fan, including this Senator, the thrill of Jimmy's perfect game is as fresh as if it happened yesterday, not 50 years ago.  Jim Bunning always stood tall, firm, and unafraid, whether in sports, politics, or life. That is how he became one of Kentucky's favorite sons. That is how he became an inspiration to his family and his friends and his colleagues. And that is how he threw that perfect game on Father's Day 1964. It is his strength of spirit that has enabled Jim to succeed. Kentucky is honored to have had Jim Bunning pitching for our home team for so many years.  I am sure that every Father's Day brings back special memories for the Bunning family. I am proud to wish my friend and former colleague well on the eve of this Father's Day and to extend my best wishes to him and to his family.  Thank you, Jim. Thank you for the example you have set for how to compete, how to win, and how to live a good and full life.  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
