 President, yesterday, I came to the floor to speak about the Green New Deal. I compared it to the New Deal of the 1930s.  I mentioned before that the New Deal of the 1930s is not something that we ought to be emulating.  The National Recovery Administration of the 1930s was a key feature of that New Deal. It was designed to eliminate competition, with industry, government, and labor all working together.  The National Recovery Administration turned out hundreds of codes, regulating every aspect of business. Small businesses struggled to comply, job creation stalled, and prices stayed high.  When big business and big government get together to write regulations, hard-working Americans suffer. You don't create jobs.  So I hope you will take a look at how complicated the Green New Deal is, besides costing $93 trillion in the future.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
