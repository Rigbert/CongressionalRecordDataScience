  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, later today, the House will vote to restore funding to the Nation's air traffic control system to better protect the traveling public and to restore order to a vital sector of our economy by shifting unused funds.  Two lessons are hopefully now learned:  Across-the-board budget cuts are abysmally stupid. Cut a program that's vital to the health, safety and the economy, and what about this unused money over here? Oh, we can't move that, so we took care of that.  Second, there are some here who believe the Federal Government doesn't need to and should not invest in facilitating the movement of goods and freight and people in this country. It should devolve to the States.  Well, this is an object lesson in how vital these Federal programs are to the Nation's airspace. And next year, when the Highway Trust Fund goes below zero and we cut spending by $50 billion on highways and transit, we will have another crisis. Let's hope we don't have to see a million layoffs and total disruption across the country before we fix that one. Fix that one before it happens.                          ____________________
