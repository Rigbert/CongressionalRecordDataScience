I think it is appropriate for him to open the debate. Now I am told that my time is running because he is not here. I have no option or alternative but to speak to the amendment.  I cannot believe this amendment is being offered to this bill. This is a bill on homeland security. This amendment relates to a declaration of a disaster, a disaster like Hurricane Katrina. Do you know what happens in times of disaster? You have probably seen it. Basic law enforcement breaks down.
