Speaker, as I have said since the law was passed, parts of the Affordable Care Act need to be improved or fixed. The employer mandate is no exception. For example employers in many sectors, from farmers to municipalities, face unacceptable uncertainty surrounding the definition of seasonal and part time workers. The federal government needs to provide clear guidance to these employers. As some Senators have proposed, I also support giving businesses with between 50 and 100 full time employees the option to either provide employer sponsored insurance or have their employees buy plans on the individual exchange. Instead of focusing on reasonable reforms like these, Republican House leadership today brought up H.R. 2575, a bill that the President has already promised to veto.  H.R. 2575 would not provide any more certainty to employers with seasonal workers. It would not give businesses with between 50 and 100 full time employees any more flexibility with regard to how their employees get insurance. What it would do, according to the Congressional Budget Office, is increase the deficit by $73 billion. It would also increase the number of uninsured Americans. For these reasons, I voted against the bill. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pass real fixes to the ACA that will make the law work better for consumers and employers alike.                          ____________________
