Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, small and medium-sized manufacturers contribute greatly to our Nation's economic growth, creating thousands of new jobs each year and providing all Americans with quality manufactured goods.  The emergence of electronic commerce has the potential to assist small and medium-sized manufacturers develop new products and markets, interact more quickly and efficiently with suppliers and customers and improve productivity by increasing efficiency and reducing transaction costs and paperwork.  Despite the benefits electronic commerce has to offer, small and medium-sized manufacturers face significant challenges in integrating electronic commerce into their operation because of the complexity of multiple technologies, expensive deployment costs and the lack of interoperability standards.  H.R. 4429, the Electronic Commerce Enhancement Act of 2000, helps to assist small and medium-sized businesses to successfully integrate and utilize electronic commerce technologies and business practices. Specifically, the bill requires the National Institute of Standards and Technology of the Department of Commerce to assist small and medium-sized manufacturers by assessing critical enterprise integration standards in implementation activities for major manufacturing industries and to develop a plan for enterprise integration for each major manufacturing industry.  This bill was unanimously approved by the Committee on Science on July 26 of this year. I wish to commend the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Technology, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Barcia), and the chairwoman of the subcommittee, the gentlewoman from Maryland (Mrs. Morella), for their efforts, and urge my colleagues to support its passage today.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
