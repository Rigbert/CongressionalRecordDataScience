President, on July 1, 1999, just before last week's recess, the Senate passed four bills which Senator Hatch and I had joined in introducing and which the Judiciary Committee had unanimously reported on the same day as Senate passage. These four bills would reauthorize the Patent and Trademark Office, update the statutory damages available under the Copyright Act, make technical corrections to two new copyright laws enacted last year, and prevent trademark dilution. Each of these bills makes important improvements to our intellectual property laws, and I congratulate Senator Hatch for his leadership in moving these bills promptly through the Committee and the Senate.  Passage of these four bills is a good start, but we must not lose sight of the other copyright and patent issues requiring our attention before the end of this Congress. The Senate Judiciary Committee has a full slate of intellectual property matters to consider and I am pleased to work on a bipartisan basis with the chairman on an agenda to provide the creators and inventors of copyrighted and patented works with the protection they may need in our global economy, while at the same time providing libraries, educational institutions and other users with the clarity they need as to what constitutes a fair use of such works.  Among the other important intellectual property matters for us to consider are the following:  Distance education. The Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing in May on the Copyright Office's thorough and balanced report on copyright and digital distance education. We need to address the legislative recommendations outlined in that report to ensure that our laws permit the appropriate use of copyrighted works in valid distance learning activities.  Patent reform. A critical matter on the intellectual property agenda, important to the nation's economic future, is reform of our patent laws. I worked on a bipartisan basis in the last Congress to get the Omnibus Patent Act, S. 507, reported by the Judiciary Committee to the Senate by a vote of 17 to one, and then tried to have this bill considered and passed by the Senate. Unfortunately, the bill became stalled due to resistance by some in the majority. We should consider and pass this important legislation.  Madrid Protocol Implementation Act. I introduced this legislation, S. 671, to help American businesses, and especially small and medium-sized companies, protect their trademarks as they expand into international markets by conforming American trademark application procedures to the terms of the Protocol in anticipation of the U.S.'s eventual ratification of the treaty. Ratification by the United States of this treaty would help create a ``one stop'' international trademark registration process, which would be an enormous benefit for American businesses.  Database protection. I noted upon passage of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act last year that there was not enough time before the end of that Congress to give due consideration to the issue of database protection, and that I hoped the Senate Judiciary Committee would hold hearings and consider database protection legislation in this Congress, with a commitment to make more progress. I support legal protection against commercial misappropriation of collections of information, but am sensitive to the concerns raised by the Administration, the libraries, certain educational institutions, and the scientific community. This is a complex and important matter that I look forward to considering in this Congress.  Tampering with product identification codes. Product identification codes provide a means for manufacturers to track their goods, which can be important to protect consumers in cases of defective, tainted or harmful products and to implement product recalls. Defacing, removing or tampering with product identification codes can thwart these tracking efforts, with potential safety consequences for American consumers. We should examine the scope of, and legislative solutions to remedy, this problem.  Online trademark protection or ``cybersquatting.'' I have long been concerned with protection online of registered trademarks. Indeed, when the Congress passed the Federal Trademark Dilution Act of 1995, I noted that:       [A]lthough no one else has yet considered this application,      it is my hope that this     antidilution statute can help stem the use of deceptive      Internet addresses taken by those who are choosing marks that      are associated with the products and reputations of others.      (Congressional Record, December 29, 1995, page S19312).  Last year, my amendment authorizing a study by the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences of the effects on trademark holders of adding new top-level domain names and requesting recommendations on related dispute resolution procedures, was enacted as part of the Next Generation Internet Research Act. We have not yet seen the results of that study, and I understand that the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (I-CANN) and World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) are considering mechanisms for resolving trademark and other disputes over assignments of domain names in an expeditious and inexpensive manner.  This is an important issue both for trademark holders and for the future of the global Internet. While I share the concerns of trademark holders over what WIPO has characterized as ``predatory and parasitical practices by a minority of domain registrants acting in bad faith'' to register famous or well-known marks of others--which can lead to consumer confusion or downright fraud--the Congress should tread carefully to ensure that any remedies do not impede or stifle the free flow of information on the Internet. I know that the Chairman shares my concerns and that working together we can find legislative solutions which make sense.  As detailed below, the four intellectual property bills by the Senate will help foster the growth of America's creative industries.s. 1257, the digital theft deterrence and copyright damages improvement                               act of 1999  I have long been concerned about reducing the levels of software piracy in this country and around the world. The theft of digital copyrighted works and, in particular, of software results in lost jobs to American workers, lost taxes to Federal and State governments, and lost revenue to American companies. A recent report released by the Business Software Alliance estimates that worldwide theft of copyrighted software in 1998 amounted to nearly $11 billion. According to the report, if this ``pirated software had instead been legally purchased, the industry would have been able to employ 32,700 more people. In 2008, if software piracy remains at its current rate, 52,700 jobs will be lost in the core software industry.'' This theft also reflects losses of $991 million in tax revenue in the United States.  These statistics about the harm done to our economy by theft of copyrighted software alone, prompted me to introduce the ``Criminal Copyright Improvement Act'' in both the 104th and 105th Congresses, and work over those two Congresses for passage of this legislation, which was finally enacted as the ``No Electronic Theft Act.'' The current rates of software piracy show that we need to do better to combat this theft, both with enforcement of our current copyright laws and with strengthened copyright laws to deter potential infringes.  The Hatch-Leahy-Schumer ``Digital Theft Deterrence and Copyright Damages Improvement Act'' would help provide additional deterrence by amending the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. Sec. 504(c), to increase the amounts of statutory damages recoverable for copyright infringements. These amounts were last increased in 1988 when the United States acceded to the Berne Convention. Specifically, the bill would increase the cap on statutory damages by 50 percent, raising the minimum from $500 to $750 and raising the maximum from $20,000 to $30,000. In addition, the bill would raise from $100,000 to $150,000 the amount of statutory damages for willful infringements.  Courts determining the amount of statutory damages in any given case would have discretion to impose damages within these statutory ranges at just and appropriate levels, depending on the harm caused, ill-gotten profits obtained and the gravity of the offense. The bill preserves provisions of the current law allowing the court to reduce the award of statutory damages to as little as $200 in cases of innocent infringement and requiring the court to remit damages in certain cases involving nonprofit educational institutions, libraries, archives, or public broadcasting entities.  In addition, the bill would create a new tier of statutory damages allowing a court to award damages in the amount of $250,000 per infringed work where the infringement is part of a willful and repeated pattern or practice of infringement. I note that the House version of this legislation, H.R. 1761, omits any scienter requirement for the new proposed enhanced penalty for infringers who engage in a repeated pattern of infringement. I share the concerns raised by the Copyright Office that this provision, absent a willfulness scienter requirement, would permit imposition of the enhanced penalty even against a person who negligently, albeit repeatedly, engaged in acts of infringement. The Hatch-Leahy-Schumer bill avoids casting such a wide net, which could chill legitimate fair uses of copyrighted works.s. 1258, the patent fee integrity and innovation protection act of 1999  The Patent Fee Integrity and Innovation Protection Act would reauthorize the Patent and Trademark Office for fiscal year 2000, on terms that ensure the fees collected from users will be used to operate the Patent and Trademark Office and not diverted to other uses.  The PTO is fully funded and operated through the payment of application and user fees. Indeed, taxpayer support for the operations of the PTO was eliminated in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, which imposed a large fee increase (referred to as a ``surcharge'') on those who use the PTO, namely businesses and inventors applying for or seeking to protect patents on trademarks.  The fees accumulated from the surcharge were held in a surcharge account, for use by the PTO to support the patent and trademark systems. Unfortunately, however, the funds in the surcharge account were also diverted to fund other, unrelated government programs. By fiscal year 1997, almost $54 million from the surcharge account was diverted from PTO operations.  Last year, Congress responded to this diversion of PTO fees by enacting H.R. 3723/S. 507, which the chairman and I had introduced on March 20, 1997. That legislation authorized a schedule of fees to fund the PTO, but no other government program, and resulted in the first decrease in patent application fees in at least 50 years.  This PTO reauthorization bill would make $116,000,000 available to the Patent and Trademark Office, a self-sustaining agency, to pay for salaries and necessary expenses in FY 2000. This money reflects the amount in carryover funds from FY99 that PTO expects to receive from fees collected, pursuant to the Patent Act and the Trademark Act. By authorizing the money to go to PTO, the bill would avoid diversion of these fees to other government agencies and programs. Inventors and the business community who rely on the patent and trademark systems do not want the fees they pay to be diverted but would rather see this money spent on PTO upgraded equipment, additional examiners and expert personnel or other items to make the systems more efficient. This bill would ensure those fees are not diverted from important PTO operations.            s. 1260, copyright act technical corrections act  In the last Congress, Senator Hatch and I worked together for passage of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act. This significant legislation is intended to encourage copyright owners to make their works available online by updating the copyright laws with additional protections for digital works, and conforming copyright terms available to American authors to those available overseas. The Hatch-Leahy substitute amendment to this bill adopted by the Judiciary Committee and passed by the Senate, makes only technical and conforming changes to those new laws and the Copyright Act.               S. 1259, The Trade Amendments Act of 1999  The Hatch-Leahy Trademark Amendments Act is significant legislation to enhance protection for trademark owners and consumers by making it possible to prevent trademark dilution before it occurs, by clarifying the remedies available under the Federal trademark dilution statute when it does occur, by providing recourseagainst the Federal Government for its infringement of others' trademarks, and by creating greater certainty and uniformity in the area of trade dress protection.  Current law provides for injunctive relief after an identical or similar mark has been in use and has caused actual dilution of a famous mark, but provides no means to oppose an application for a mark or to cancel a registered mark that will result in dilution of the holder's famous mark. In Babson Bros. Co. v. Surge Power Corp., 39 USPQ 2d. 1953 (TTAB 1996), the Trademark Trial and Appeals Board (TTAB) held that it was not authorized by the ``Federal Trademark Dilution Act'' to consider dilution as grounds for opposition or cancellation of a registration. The bill remedies this situation by authorizing the TTAB to consider dilution as grounds for refusal to register a mark or for cancellation of a registered mark. This would permit the trademark owner to oppose registration or to petition for cancellation of a diluting mark, and thereby prevent needless harm to the good will and distinctiveness of many trademarks and make enforcing the Federal dilution statute less costly and time consuming for all involved.  Second, the bill clarifies the trademark remedies available in dilution cases, including injunctive relief, defendant's profits, damages, costs, and, in exceptional cases, reasonably attorney fees, and the destruction of articles containing the diluting mark.  Third, the bill amends the Lanham Act to allow for private citizens and corporate entities to sue the Federal Government for trademark infringement and dilution. Currently, the Federal Government may not be sued for trademark infringement, even though the Federal Government competes in some areas with private business and may sue others for infringement. This bill would level the playing field, and make the Federal Government subject to suit for trademark infringement and dilution. I note that the Lanham Act also subjects the States to suit, but that provision has now been held unconstitutional. Last week, the Supreme Court held in College Savings Bank versus Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Education Expense Board that federal courts were without authority to entertain these suits for false and misleading advertising, absent the State's waiver of sovereign immunity. This case (as well as the other two Supreme Court cases decided the same day), raise a number of important copyright, federalism and other issues, but do not effect the provision in the bill that waives Federal government immunity from suit.  Fouirth, the bill provides a limited amendment to the Lanham Act to provide that in an action for trade dress infringement, where the matter sought to be protected is not registered with the PTO, the plaintiff has the burden of proving that the trade dress is not functional. This will help promote fair competition and provide an incentive for registration.  Finally, this bill makes a number of technical ``clean-up'' amendments relating to the ``Trademark Law Treaty Implementation Act,'' which was enacted at the end of the last Congress.  These bills represent a good start on the work before the Senate Judiciary Committee to update American intellectual property law to ensure that it serves to advance and protect American interests both here and abroad. I began, however, with the list of copyright, patent and trademark issues that we should also address. We have a lot more work to do.                          ____________________
