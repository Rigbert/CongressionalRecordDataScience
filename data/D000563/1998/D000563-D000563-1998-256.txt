President. I rise today to offer an amendment that seeks to address some of the inadequacies in the current Armed Services' health care system. I know many of my colleagues will be aware of these inadequacies from their constituents complaints about this system which, at times seems more like a cost cutting operation than the health care system for those brave enough to put their lives on the line for their country.  The inadequacies addressed by my amendment were brought to my attention recently through the tragic case of Stephanie Davito, the 14 year old daughter of a nuclear submarine commander who currently lies in a coma at Sentara General Hospital in Norfolk, Virginia. This little girl's family has been fighting to get her the care that she needs through the TRICARE PRIME health care system and they have met time and time again with a wall of bureaucracy. At this time of extreme stress and anguish, Commander Davito and his wife Kristine have been forced to literally plead for adequate health care for their daughter. No-one should be forced to plead for covered benefits, least of all our Armed Services personnel and their families.  Commander Davito, who is a United States Naval Officer from Spring Valley in Illinois, had been the Executive Officer on board the nuclear powered attack submarine U.S.S. Hyman G. Rickover stationed in Norfolk, Virginia. In March, he was transferred to STRATCOM in Nebraska. His family remained in Norfolk to finish out the school year. On May 15th, tragedy struck as Commander and Mrs. Davito's young daughter was hit by a car on her way home from school. She has been in a coma ever since. STRATCOM, as Commander Davito explained in his recent letter to me, was wonderful and transferred him temporarily to Commander Submarine Force Atlantic in Norfolk, so that he could be with his daughter.  However, Commander Davito's experience with TRICARE has been a nightmare. Even though Stephanie's neurologist, Dr. Robert Rashti, believes that Stephanie has a very good chance for recovery, a TRICARE bureaucrat tried to argue that because Stephanie was not ``an active participant'' in her rehabilitation, they would not have to cover her treatment. This is an absolutely outrageous claim. Such a view obviously affects anyone covered by TRICARE that is unfortunate enough to suffer a coma. To suggest that comatose patients do not deserve treatment is, to me a completely abhorrent suggestion.  The TRICARE policy manual does in fact stipulate that Rehabilitation is a covered service, though must of the manual reads like alphabet soup with respect to clarity. Clearly, the manual needs to be made more explicit, as my amendment suggests, so that no utilization clerk within the TRICARE system will ever again be confused.  TRICARE has on numerous occasions tried to encourage the Davitos to put Stephanie in custodial care which, by the way, they do not cover. There, she would not get the Rehabilitation that she needs.  The Davitos contacted Senator Warner, Illinois State Representative Frank Mautino, and my office to see if we could help them. I want to take this opportunity to thank Senator Warner on their behalf for all his staffs' hard work on this issue. In particular, I believe that Mr. Sanford in his district office has been extremely helpful to the Davitos. In spite of all our offices' repeated intervention on behalf of the Davitos, Stephanie's care is still not resolved and we are still being met with a wall a bureaucracy from the TRICARE system. Secretary Dalton has personally intervened and I want to sincerely thank him for that. The Navy has been deeply involved in trying to resolve this but they too have met with incredible resistance from TRICARE West with respect to TRICARE committing to treating Stephanie adequately. These are not the wars that the Armed Services should have to fight.  Stephanie's doctor believes that she has a good chance for recovery, if TRICARE would only provide her with the Rehabilitation that she needs. Dr. Rashti wrote on June 15th, and I am quoting from his letter to Senator Warner, ``at the time of Stephanie's admission, she was in critical condition due to severe brain swelling from contusions and a small hematoma in the right frontal region of the head. After a stormy course lasting two weeks, her brain swelling began to resolve and Stephanie began to show signs of improvement. . . . Prognostically, her diagnostic studies in conjunction with her evolving clinical course, suggests that this young lady has significant potential for functional recovery. While there is no guarantee, this medical impression is based on over 26 years of neurosurgical experience, including experience at the Shock Trauma Unit in Maryland and the Multiple Trauma Unit for twenty years here in Norfolk.'' Later in this letter, Dr. Rashti stated very clearly ``From a medical standpoint, it is not felt appropriate that she go to a custodial care facility.'' Another doctor, Dr. Kip Burkman was in full agreement with Dr. Rashti's recommendation. Neither medical opinions seemed to sway the administrators of the TRICARE West program who refused to allow for Stephanie's transfer to the Immanuel Medical Center in Omaha, Nebraska which is near her family's home and which can provide Rehabilitation services that she needs.  Can any of us imagine how we would feel if one of our children lay as Stephanie does in a coma, where the doctors said she would get better if only she has access to care, but the cost cutting plan administrators tried to use every ambiguity in the policy manual to deny care? The pain and suffering that Stephanie's parents must be going through must be incredible. Is this how we treat the families of a person like Commander Davito who has served his country for 16 years and who has time and time again put his life at risk for the good of his country? Is this the kind of health care system that we reward our Armed Services with?  Further confounding this problem is the issue of whether the network of providers in some regions of the country are adequate. Part of the problem that the Davito's are experiencing is due to the absence of a Rehabilitation facility near the STRATCOM base that is affiliated with the TRICARE West network. The Immanuel Medical Center in Omaha which is close to the STRATCOM base, after TRICARE initially suggested that Stephanie could be transferred there, was found not to be within the TRICARE West network which was probably part of the reason that TRICARE West suddenly became reluctant to allow her to be transferred there. However, TRICARE West does not have any facilities within their network near the base that are capable of providing Stephanie with the Rehabilitation recommended by her doctors. TRICARE suggested again that she be placed in a nursing home in Omaha or a nursing home in Lincoln Nebraska which is over 80 miles from the base, or finally they offered a place in a hospital in Lincoln, again over 80 miles from Stephanie's parents.  What would it mean if TRICARE was successful in denying Stephanie access to the care that she needed? Well, it would likely mean that when she recovers from her coma, she will not be able to walk because she will have been denied the physical therapy necessary to prevent muscle atrophy. A wide variety of other completely avoidable complications might also result from the denial of rehabilitation.  This little girl deserves a chance to get better. After much prodding, TRICARE is now saying that maybe she could have one month of Rehabilitation care at the Immanuel Hospital near the STRATCOM base. However, the time-frame for recovery from these injuries is 4-6 months at a minimum. Stephanie's doctors are suggesting that she may need between 6 and 12 months of care. As Dr. Rashti pointed out in his most recent letter, ``Progress in any rehabilitation program is usually not as rapid as family or insurance companies would like but that is the nature of recovering brain injury patients. Their course is frequently characterized by rapid spurts of improvement interspersed with plateau periods lasting weeks before the next level of improvement begin.'' Dr. Rashti suggested that Stephanie would likely need 4 to 6 months of aggressive rehabilitation, with a maximum rehab benefit of about a year. I completely agree with Dr. Rashti when he says ``This child is 14 years old and deserves every chance to reach her maximum potential''.  My staff has contacted NIH to inquire of their staff at the National Institute of Neurological Disease, as to their opinion for the normal time-frame for recovery from such injuries. They have also indicated that 6 months to 1 year seems appropriate.  Everyone except the insurance company seems to be in agreement as to the care that Stephanie needs. I hope that we can make some progress during consideration of the Department of Defense's Reauthorization bill to see that this issue gets resolved not only for Stephanie but also for all the other Americans covered by the TRICARE system.  My amendment is very simple. It has two parts. The first part directs the Secretary of Defense to revise the TRICARE policy manual to make it perfectly clear that Rehabilitative services are available to a patient suffering from a head injury when the treating physician certifies that such services would be beneficial for that patient and there is potential for recovery. This would move medical decisions concerning treatment back where they belong into the hands of physicians and out of the hands of HMO bureaucrats that may be more concerned with cost cutting than care giving.  The second part of my amendment would direct the Secretary of Defense to evaluate the adequacy of each TRICARE region's network of providers. Each region should have sufficient number, distribution and variety of qualified health care providers and facilities to provide all the covered services. If a region is found to have an inadequate network of providers for some covered services, then the Secretary would be requested to take remedial action to improve the adequacy of the networks. This part of my amendment is very important to those in the military who are frequently transferred from station to station. In some areas, where managed care has been around for a long time, the networks may be good and patients may access all the care that they need and are entitled to. However, in some parts of the country, the networks are not sufficient and someone that enrolled in TRICARE PRIME while in California or Oregon suddenly finds that their new network is completely inadequate. Should our Armed Services personnel be force to swap between TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Standard depending on where they are currently stationed? Will they only find out when they can't get the care that they need that their region has an inadequate network of providers? Surely, we can provide a getter standard of care to the men and women and their families who patriotically serve our country.  After 4 years in operation, I believe it is time to evaluate the TRICARE system and to see if there are regional gaps in service. Obviously, if it turns out that some regions do not provide adequately for our military's the health care needs, then this should be remedied. However, if we don't ask for this evaluation, it may take much longer to correct problems that may exist.  There are those that might argue that providing adequate health care coverage will cost us more. Actually, having inadequate networks may also be extremely costly because when a person is denied care, it may take many navy personnel working in the appeals process to secure them the necessary health care. It may also mean that the Plan has to contract temporarily with an out of network provider. This is not a very efficient way of doing business. As the saving goes, ``You should fix the roof while the sun is shining'', we should not leave it to tragedies like Stephanies to point out to us when our health care system for the Armed Services is deficient.  I believe that this amendment will take a small step forward to making sure that the Armed Services have access to a decent health care system and I hope that my colleagues will support my amendment.                     amendment no. 2976 as modified                 (Purpose: Relating to Radio Free Asia)       Add at the end the following new title:                      TITLE ____--RADIO FREE ASIA     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Radio Free Asia Act of      1998''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       The Congress makes the following findings:       (1) The Government of the People's Republic of China      systematically controls the flow of information to the      Chinese people.       (2) The Government of the People's Republic of China      demonstrated that maintaining its monopoly on political power      is a higher priority than economic development by announcing      in January 1996 that its official news agency Xinhua, will      supervise wire services selling economic information,      including Dow Jones-Telerate, Bloomberg, and Reuters      Business, and in announcing in February 1996 the ``Interim      Internet Management Rules'', which have the effect of      censoring computer networks.       (3) Under the May 30, 1997, order of Premier Li Peng, all      organizations that engage in business activities related to      international computer networking must now apply for a      license, increasing still further government control over      access to the Internet.       (4) Both Radio Free Asia and the Voice of America, as a      surrogate for a free press in the People's Republic of China,      provide an invaluable source of uncensored information to the      Chinese people, including objective and authoritative news of      in-country and regional events, as well as accurate news      about the United States and its policies.       Enhanced broadcasting service to China and Tibet can      efficiently be established through a combination of Radio      Free Asia and Voice of America programming.       (6) Radio Free Asia and Voice of America, in working toward      continuously broadcasting to the People's Republic of China      in multiple languages, have the capability to establish 24-     hour-a-day Mandarin broadcasting to that nation by staggering      the hours of Radio Free Asia an Voice of America.       (7) Simultaneous broadcastings on Voice of America radio      and Worldnet television 7 days a week in Mandarin are also      important and needed capabilities.     SEC. 3.
