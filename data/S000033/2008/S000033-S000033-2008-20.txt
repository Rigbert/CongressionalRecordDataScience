 President, as we observe Constitution Day today, we do not have to look very far to be reminded why it is important for us to reflect on the 221st birthday of the Constitution, which was signed by the Framers in Philadelphia on this date in 1787. I think the reason why it is so important to take a hard look at the Constitution today is because of what has happened over the last 8 years, because in many respects we have had a President who did not do as Senator Byrd urged us to do: Study the Constitution.  We all know that international terrorism is a very serious issue. We take it terribly seriously, and all of us are pledged to do everything we can to protect the American people from international terrorism. However, many of us believe we can do it within the context of the United States Constitution and the separation of powers----
