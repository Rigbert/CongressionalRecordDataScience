Speaker, this week, the world laid to rest in the Egyptian desert a holy and wise spiritual giant, Pope Shenouda III, the117th Pope of Alexandria and the patriarch of all Africa of the Coptic Orthodox Church. He passed on March 17.  His Holiness Pope Shenouda III presided more than 40 years over a worldwide expansion of the Coptic Orthodox Church. During his papacy, he appointed the first-ever bishops to preside over North American dioceses. When His Holiness became Pope in 1971, there were only four churches in North America. Today, there are over 100.  He championed a deep commitment to ecumenism interfaith dialogue, not just with Catholic groups--meeting the Roman Catholic Pope of Rome for the first time in over 1,500 years in the year of 1973--but he joined with Protestant churches as well as Islamic leaders and Muslim clerics. He was a man for the world.  I had the honor of meeting the Pope at our local Coptic Christian church when it was being constructed. He was a man of immense faith, unforgettable. I never will forget his steady, strong, peaceful countenance when I asked him what it would take to achieve unity among the faith confessions, and he said: It would take love.  His contributions to world understanding and bridging horizons yet unmet will flower in decades ahead and progress will move forward in his memory.                [From the New York Times, Mar. 17, 2012]           Coptic Pope Dies in Egypt Amid Church's Struggles                           (By Kareem Fahim)       Cairo.--Pope Shenouda III, who led the Coptic Orthodox      Church in Egypt for four decades, expanding the church's      presence around the world as he struggled, often      unsuccessfully, to protect his Christian minority at home,      died on Saturday after a long illness, state media reported.       Pope Shenouda, who was 88, had suffered from cancer and      kidney problems for years.       His death comes at a time of rising fears for Egypt's to      million Coptic Christians, who have felt increasingly      vulnerable since the fall of President Hosni Mubarak and amid      attacks on churches by hard-line Islamists and repression by      Egypt's security forces.       The rise to power of conservative Islamist parties has also      raised concerns that Egyptian national identity is becoming      more closely bound to Islam.       ``It's an injection of uncertainty for Copts at a time of      transition in the country,'' said Michael Wahid Hanna, a      fellow at the Century Foundation. ``Whether people were fond      of him or not, this will cause anxiety.''       On Saturday night, hundreds of Coptic Christians gathered      at Cairo's main cathedral to grieve.       Samir Youssef, a physician, called the pope ``an      intellectual, a poet--strong, charismatic.''       ``On a personal level, I'm worried about the future. I      think there will be a conflict, the same chaos that followed      the 25th of January,'' he added, referring to the start of      the uprising last year.       In a statement, President Obama praised Pope Shenouda as a      beloved ``advocate for tolerance and religious dialogue.''      Egypt's interim rulers, the Supreme Council of the Armed      Forces, called on Egyptians to ``come together in solidarity      and be tolerant, to take Egypt toward security and      stability.''       Pope Shenouda, who became patriarch in 1971, was known as a      charismatic, conservative leader for Egypt's Copts, who make      up about 10 percent of the population in the majority Sunni      nation.       He filled a leadership vacuum as Copts--along with most      Egyptians--retreated from public life under authoritarian      rule, and he expanded the church's reach, especially in North      America. At the same time, he was criticized for what were      seen as his autocratic tendencies, which stifled internal      church changes, and his support for Mr. Mubarak's government,      given in return for a measure of protection that Copts      increasingly felt was insignificant.       The failure to distance the church from Mr. Mubarak led to      greater disillusionment with the pope after the revolution,      especially among younger and more secular Copts.       Pope Shenouda was born on Aug. 3, 1923, as Nazeer Gayed in      the city of Asyut, Egypt, according to a biography of the      patriarch posted on the church's Web site. He attended Cairo      University and became a monk in 1954.       In 1981, Pope Shenouda was sent into internal exile by      President Anwar Sadat, with whom he clashed after complaining      about discrimination against the Copts. Mr. Mubarak ended      that exile in 1985, with an informal understanding that Pope      Shenouda would be less vocal in pointing out discrimination,      according to Mariz Tadros, a researcher at the University of      Sussex and the author of a forthcoming book on the Copts.       That understanding was severely strained in the past decade      after a series of deadly clashes between Copts and Muslims,      and charges that the state, and especially its security      services, stoked the sectarian divide. After 21 people were      killed in a church bombing last year, some Copts criticized      the pope for not confronting the government.       The Coptic Church's own policies, including its almost      total ban on divorce, have also increased tensions. Some have      left the church specifically to divorce, either choosing      another denomination or officially converting to Islam, then      sometimes converting back after the split.       The conversions have incited rumors that have led to      episodes of Muslim-Christian violence.       The next pope will face a growing desire among many Copts      to expand the community's leadership, analysts said. Under      Pope Shenouda, ``the church became the de facto political      representative of the Copts,'' Mr. Hanna said. ``That became      increasingly problematic.''                          ____________________
