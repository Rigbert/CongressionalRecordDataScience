  The day the legislation passed on December 11, 2000, Senator Boxer stated on the Senate Floor that dropping the gaming restriction was necessary because of opposition to the no-gaming clause by the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs and the Clinton Administration and because, according to Senator Boxer, ``Senator Inouye asserts that the no-gaming clause is unnecessary because the Graton Rancheria have no intention of conducting gaming.''  So what has changed one might ask?  Well, even though the Gratons voluntarily and repeatedly took a no-gaming pledge while their restoration bill was under consideration by Congress, on April 23, 2003, the Tribe and its partner, Stations Casinos of Las Vegas, announced plans to purchase approximately 2,000 acres of land in Southern Sonoma County near Sears Point for the development of a casino.  This site is located on environmentally sensative open space and San Francisco--North Bay tidelands which have been the subject of a decades-long conservation effort by environmentalists and local residents.  This site is roughly 30 miles from San Francisco--along the gateway to Sonoma that leads thousands of travelers into the beautiful wine country each day.  The Tribe's casino proposal has outraged local elected officials and residents who had sympathized with the Tribe's plight and supported their restoration on the condition that they not seek to develop a casino. The Sonoma and Marin County Boards of Supervisors have each passed unanimous resolutions objecting to the Graton casino proposal. In fact, even the Board of Supervisors of neighboring Napa has also passed a resolution against the casino proposal. I ask unanimous consent to print these resolutions and letters from the counties in the Record.  There being no objection, the materials were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         Marin County, San Rafael, CA and Sonoma County, Santa            Rose, CA,                                                     May 29, 2003.     Senator Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate,     San Francisco, CA.       Dear Senator Feinstein: We write this joint letter to      request your assistance with an urgent matter facing Marin      and Sonoma counties. As you are aware, the Graton Rancheria      Tribe has announced plans to acquire lands adjacent to the      San Pablo Bay National Wildlife Refuge and to construct a      major casino in partnership with Stations Casinos of Las      Vegas. The proposal came as a shock to us since, at the time      it sought restoration in 2000, the Graton tribe represented      to Congress that it would not engage in gaming. It now      appears that the Secretary of the Interior believes she must      take into trust any land within our counties acquired by the      tribe, and that gaming will be permitted on these lands      without consultation with local governments or discretionary      review by the Secretary.       We ask that you sponsor legislation to require that tribal      trust land acquisitions be subject to consultation with local      governments and an appropriate administrative review. We ask      that restored tribal land acquired for gaming be subject to      the two part test that it is not detrimental to the community      and is supported by the Governor. Finally, we ask that the      Secretary be given discretion with respect to accepting land      into trust for the benefit of the Graton tribe. County      Counsel from our two counties have prepared a letter to you      providing background and supporting details regarding our      proposals.       We know that you share our concern about the proliferation      of casinos in California, especially those which are close to      metropolitan areas or have impacts on sensitive lands.       We look forward to working with you to bring about changes      in the law which can advance the economic interests of tribes      without harm to the local community.           Very truly yours,     Annette Rose,       President, Marin County Board of Supervisors.     Paul Kelley,       Chairman, Sonoma County Board of Supervisors.                                  ____                         Resolution No. 03-0512       Whereas, the agricultural lands and wetlands fronting the      San Francisco Bay along Highway 37 constitute one of the most      environmentally sensitive regions in the entire Bay Area in      light of their proximity to and drainage directly into the      Bay;       Whereas, the agricultural lands along Lakeville Highway      afford an invaluable agricultural and scenic resource, not      only to the people of Sonoma County but to the populace of      the entire Bay Area;       Whereas, such lands provide one of the Bay Area's most      cherished community separators, and represent an important      scenic gateway to Sonoma County;       Whereas, these bay, agriculture and wet lands have been the      focus of preservation and conservation efforts by      environmentalists and local communities for many years;       Whereas, based upon press reports, approximately 2,000      acres of such lands are presently in imminent danger of being      withdrawn from County land use control and placed into trust      for the purposes of casino development--including the      potential of an extensive gaming complex, including a hotel,      parking and other support services as well as possible      residential development, by Station Casinos, a Las Vegas-     based developer and the Federated Indians of the Graton      Rancheria (``Tribe'');       Whereas, the Tribe was restored in 2000 based, in part, on      its promise not to engage in Indian casino gaming;       Whereas, the federal legislation restoring the Tribe      contains language that could be used to circumvent the      normally required environmental review and administrative      regulatory process for taking land into trust by the United      States government on behalf of the Tribe;       Whereas, the Tribe's gaming plans were announced in the      media without any government to government consultation with      affected local communities;       Whereas, the Board and Tribe have initiated communication      regarding the proposed casino but details regarding the      project and siting have not yet been made available;       Whereas, the proposed project could overwhelm the local      infrastructure in the area in which the casino project is      proposed;       Whereas, the environmental impacts of the prosed project      have the potential of being are reaching and of such a      magnitude that they would negatively affect a significant      portion of the North Bay, including grossly aggravating      existing traffic problems along State Highways 37 and 101 (as      well as County roads in the project vicinity), pose severe      water quality risks, and have profound negative visual      impacts in the scenic area;       Whereas, when California voters approved Proposition 1A      (Indian Gaming) in March of 2000 as a means of supporting the      laudable goal of Indian economic development and self-     sufficiency, they were not aware that such approval would      allow Nevada developers to seize prized off-reservation      environmental resources of intense development without      regarding to locally approved general plans or any meaningful      environmental review or protection;       Whereas, under the provisions of Proposition 1A and the      Tribal-State Compact, local communities have been granted no      effective input into the development of proposed tribal      casinos that threaten their rights and the State appears to      have no effective redress for significant environmental      impacts these gambling casinos impose on local communities:      Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That the Sonoma County Board of supervisors,      based on the information currently available, strongly      opposes the creation of a gambling casino on the site      proposed by the Tribe; and be it further       Resolved, That County staff is directed to enter into good      faith discussions with tribal representatives for the      purposes of facilitating government to government      communications, exploring casino development and reviewing      alternative sites, as well as minimizing and mitigating      environmental impacts of any casino project; be it further       Resolved, That County staff is authorized to take all      reasonably required action, including submitting comments to      agencies involved in considering the trust application and      casino proposal, requesting assistance from State and Federal      elected representative, proposing legislation, participating      in administrative proceedings, and initiating litigation to      insure that any proposed gaming project in Sonoma County      complies with the county General Plan and meets all federal      and state environmental, public health, and public safety      requirements that otherwise would apply to a non-Indian      development project, and to require that any land proposed to      be taken into trust goes through a thorough regulatory and      environmental review process.                                  ____                         Resolution No. 2003-70       Whereas, the agricultural lands and wetlands fronting the      San Francisco Bay along Highway 37 constitute one of the most      environmentally sensitive regions in the entire Bay Area in      light of their proximity to and drainage directly in to the      Bay; and       Whereas, the Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria have      announced their intention to acquire 2000 acres of land along      Highway 37 and develop a casino, hotel, housing and related      development on this precious natural resource; and       Whereas, the impact on traffic of a development of this      magnitude will be felt throughout the North Bay, with this      single development jeopardizing all traffic capacity with      local jurisdictions have husbanded for purposes consistent      with their respective General Plans; and       Whereas, when Congress passed the Graton Rancheria      Restoration Act, the Federated Indians of Graton had pledged      not to engage in gaming on any lands placed in trust by the      federal government; and       Whereas, the Federated Indians of the Graton Rancheria take      the position that under the provisions of the Graton      Rancheria Restoration Act, and the tribal state compact,      local residents have no effective input into the development      of the proposed tribal casino, yet these residents      nevertheless bear the resultant environmental, societal,      traffic, infrastructure, public safety, and other burdens      which these gambling casinos impose on their communities:      Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, that the Board of Supervisors of the County of      Marin calls on its elected members of the United States      Senate, Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, and its elected      member of the House of Representative, Lynn Woolsey, to      assist the residents of Marin and the entire North Bay to      preserve their environment by introducing legislation that      would amend the Graton Rancheria Restoration Act and/or the      Indian Gaming Regulatory Act to stop the unregulated creation      of tribal lands and to subject any development of tribal      lands in the newly acquired tribal lands by the Indian Gaming      Regulatory Act.                                  ____                          Resolution No. 03-94       Whereas, the agricultural lands and wetlands fronting the      San Francisco Bay along Highway 37 constitute one of the most      environmentally sensitive regions in the entire Bay Area in      light of their proximity to and drainage directly into the      Bay; and       Whereas, the agricultural lands along Lakeville Highway      afford an invaluable agricultural and scenic resource, not      only to the people of Sonoma County but also to the populace      of the entire Bay Area; and       Whereas, such lands provide one of the Bay Area's most      cherished community separators, enjoyed and remembered by all      who traverse Highway 37; and       Whereas, these agricultural lands, bay and wetlands have      been the focus of preservation and conservation efforts by      environmentalists and local communities for many years; and       Whereas, such land are presently in imminent danger of      intense development--including an enormous casino, a high-     rise hotel, an amphitheater, a residential development, and      acres of parking--by Station Casinos, a Las Vegas-based      developer, and       Whereas, the impact on traffic of a development of this      magnitude will be felt throughout the North Bay, with this      single development jeopardizing all traffic capacity, which      local jurisdictions have husbanded for purposes consistent      with their respective General Plans; and       Whereas, when California voters approved Proposition 1A      (Indian Gaming) in March 2000 as a means of supporting the      laudable goal of Indian economic development and self-     sufficiency, they had no way of knowing that such approval      would allow Nevada developers to seize our most prized      environmental resources for intense development in violation      of all local zoning controls and health and safety      ordinances; and       Whereas, under the provisions of Proposition 1A and the      tribal state compact, local residents have been granted no      effective input into the development of proposed tribal      casinos that threaten their civil and property rights, yet      these residents must nevertheless bear the resultant      environmental, societal, traffic, infrastructure, public      safety, and other burdens that these gambling casinos impose      on their communities: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That the Board of Supervisors of the County of      Napa strongly oppose the creation of a gambling casino along      highway 37 or Lakeville Highway; and be it further       Resolved, That the Board of Supervisors of the County of      Napa calls on Governor Davis, the California State      Legislature, the U.S. Congress, and the U.S. Department of      the Interior to take any and all steps within their powers      and prerogatives to block the creation of new tribal land      bases that are intended for gambling casinos and other      development inconsistent with local zoning and controls and      to require that all commercial development on new and      existing tribal lands comply with federal, state, and local      laws and regulations intended to safeguard the environment      and to protect public health and safety.
