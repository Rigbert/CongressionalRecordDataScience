  Mr. DeFAZIO. Today, the House will finally turn from naming sports teams' accomplishments to the Pentagon budget, a budget that's top heavy with more generals and admirals than we had at the height of World War II, a broken procurement system that's gold-plating dysfunctional weapon systems while our troops lack basics.  But, today, Congress will finally answer a question that is a puzzle perhaps only inside the Washington, DC beltway: How many engines does a single-engine jet fighter need? Now, where I come from it's pretty simple, the answer is one; but you've got to tune in later today to find out the judgment of Congress because some think you need two engines for a single-engine jet fighter. Hey, it will only cost another $15 billion or $20 billion.                          ____________________
