We're now near 320 million people. By 2050, we will have 500 million people in this country. We cannot continue to live like it's 1950. We have to sort of catch up, which is where these public investments come in. They create jobs. They create real wealth that you can't take away or outsource. It belongs to the American people. It belongs here.  I wanted to say a word about Ohio. We're facing this vote on Issue 2 in Ohio, which is an effort, as Congressman Ryan says, to dismantle what's left of the middle class in our State: our teachers, our firefighters, our police. We have a Governor who called an Ohio highway patrolman an ``idiot,'' which I consider a complete degradation of the Office of Governor and an insult to those who put their lives on the line for us every day.  We stand against Issue 2. We're going to defeat Issue 2 in Ohio because we believe in building the middle class; and we are proud of our police, of our highway patrolmen, of our firefighters, of our teachers. They hold us together as a community, and it is our job to push investment into airports, highways, high-speed rail, trains, transit, ports, water and sewer--all of the pieces of ``community'' that hold us together and make our economies hum. Either you're looking through the rearview mirror or the windshield going forward. This is an ``I can'' Nation. The last four words of ``American'' are ``I can,'' and we are an ``I can'' country.
