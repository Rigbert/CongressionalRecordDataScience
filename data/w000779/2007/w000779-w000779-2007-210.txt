I am very honored to represent Oregon in the Senate. I have been able to get into a host of issues that I think are important, particularly as a member of the Finance Committee, to fix health care and fix the out-of-whack American tax system. I serve on the Intelligence Committee. But Senator Smith and I have said this is our most important issue for our State for this session because, without this funding, there is a real question about whether these local communities can hang on. They simply have no other options. You are not going to be able to go to a small resource-dependent community in eastern Oregon and set up a biotechnology company in the next few weeks. It is not going to happen. I support those kinds of industries and economic development, as does my colleague. It has been a big part of our bipartisan agenda. But we are talking about survival for these rural communities. This will be our top priority for this session.  This has also made a great contribution in terms of bringing together people of differing views on natural resources. As part of the legislation that I authored with Senator Craig a number of years ago--as Senator Smith has noted--we set up resource advisory committees so that you now have folks in the timber industry talking to environmentalists who in the past were, for the most part, spending their days in the courthouses suing each other. Now they are working together to cooperate through the legislation that we have put in place. This has been recognized as a wildly successful natural resources law, bringing about cooperation that, prior to this law going into effect, was seen virtually nowhere.  It is a stable, consistent source of funding for communities that have nowhere else to turn, affecting communities in 39 States, but it is also a program that has brought together a unique kind of cooperation between people in the natural resources area who in the past would spend an awful lot of time running what I call a lawyers full employment program, essentially suing each other in the Federal courthouse.  We are going to be back on the floor for whatever number of times it takes to get this program reauthorized and take these rural communities off this roller coaster. They ought to be able to know that they can survive, and they can survive as they have over many years through a program that was tied to the unique consideration that the Federal Government owns most of our land. That is what this is all about. This is different than how people may pay for schools and roads and essential services in parts of the eastern United States where there is little Federal ownership.  We ask that the Senate not ignore the plight of rural America, particularly the rural West, as we continue forward with the legislative calendar.                      Amendment No. 104 Withdrawn  I ask unanimous consent that this bipartisan amendment be withdrawn. We will be back another day. But I ask unanimous consent that the amendment I have offered be withdrawn.
