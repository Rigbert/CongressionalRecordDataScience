Speaker, reclaiming my time, I thank the minority leader, and I am very pleased myself to have the honor of welcoming the gentleman from Oregon, Earl Blumenauer, as the newest Member of the U.S. House of Representatives and the Oregon delegation.  I have to say, in all honesty, I cannot think of a more highly qualified person to represent Oregon as a new Member in this body. He has a lengthy history of public service: He served in the Oregon Legislature, the Oregon Community College Board; he was a Multnomah County Commissioner at the same time I was a Lane County Commissioner, a tremendous experience and training to become a Member of Congress, to bring that local orientation with him; and he was on the Portland City Council.  Throughout his 24 years of elected office, perhaps the thing he is best known for is he is a worker, a hard worker. In each position that he has held of public trust he has not only done the job that has been asked of him, he as taken on a leadership role, rolled up his sleeves and helped develop creative and workable solutions to problems at every level of government. He has not risen through the ranks of government by resting on his laurels on his past record; he is constantly working, learning, serving, and doing better.  I know he will continue that commitment here in Congress, and I look forward to having his skill, knowledge, and energy to call upon and utilize as we work to do the people's business for the citizens of Oregon and our Nation.
