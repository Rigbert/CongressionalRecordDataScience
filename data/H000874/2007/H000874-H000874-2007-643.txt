 I said similar remarks, as the gentleman may know, last week. But I certainly want Karen to know, I want everybody in this House to know, that the opinions just expressed by Mr. LaHood reflect, I think, Karen, the opinions of everybody on this floor. You have done a wonderful job for the House of Representatives as an institution, a great job for your country, and we know you will be a great success in the future. And all of us stand ready to tell anybody who wants to know what an asset you have been to the House of Representatives.  I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. LaHOOD. I thank the majority leader.  Good luck, Karen. Thank you for doing a great job.                          ____________________
