Speaker, it is with great pleasure and sincere respect that I congratulate Mrs. Mary Edith Brown Coleman as she is recognized by First Church of God in Gary, Indiana, for 73 years of continuous service to the church. Edith will be recognized for her lifetime of dedicated service on September 22, 2013 at First Church of God.   Edith Brown was born on February 13, 1917 in Muskogee, Oklahoma. She was one of four children born to Luther Albert Brown and Dora Rozolia Draper Brown. Having gone on to live in Kansas City, Kansas, and Chicago, Illinois, Edith finally relocated to Gary, Indiana, in 1940. Quite the accomplished student, Edith completed her Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees in education at Indiana University in Bloomington. From there, she decided to go into the teaching profession. As a teacher at Frederick Douglass Elementary School in Gary for over 27 years, Edith was able to enrich the lives of so many young people in the Gary community. For her commitment to the youth of Northwest Indiana, she is worthy of the highest praise.   Equally impressive, Edith has always been seen as the foundation of her family. She and her husband, the late William Henry Coleman, were blessed with the births of two wonderful children: Norma Louise Coleman and the late Merle Jean Coleman. Edith's family, as well as the many people whose lives she has touched, admire her for devoting unselfish love, time, dedication, guidance, and spirit to her family, her students, her church, and her community.   As well as being dearly loved and respected by her family, her students, and her community, Edith is also well known for her involvement with her church, First Church of God. Over the course of seventy-three years, Edith has taught Sunday School, been the director of the Daily Vacation Bible School, held memberships in the local and national Missionary Societies, sung in the church choir, created beautiful and meaningful bulletin board displays, served as a deaconess, and taught a manners class for young children.   For years, Edith has also been a distinguished member of the American Association of University Women, the Women's Association of the Northwest Indiana Symphony Society, the Red Hat Society, and the Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority. Since her arrival in Northwest Indiana, Edith has been known as a good-hearted woman who is always willing to help the people of her church and her community. For her selflessness, she is to be commended and admired.   Mr. Speaker, Mary Edith Brown Coleman has given her time and efforts selflessly to her church and the community in Northwest Indiana throughout her illustrious life. She has taught every member of her family and extended family the true meaning of service to others. I respectfully ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in commending Edith for her lifetime of service.                          ____________________
