President, Vermont benefits both by the people who were born there and those who come to Vermont and make us even better.  One of those people who has chosen Vermont is Barrie Dunsmore, who before his change in careers had been one of the foremost reporters and commentators on the national news scene. When he and his wife, Whitney Taylor, and his daughter, Campbell, came to Vermont, we Vermonters have benefitted by his columns in The Rutland Herald and his commentary on Vermont Public Radio. Recently Barrie took a number of his columns and collected them in a book, ``There and Back.'' I could not begin to do his writings justice, but my wife Marcelleand I were privileged to be at a reception for Barrie and Whitney in Burlington and we heard him speak. I asked him if I could have a copy of his notes from that evening, and he shared them with me. The notes offer only a hint of what awaits in the book, which I read with pleasure at our home in Vermont.  I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Barrie Dunsmore's remarks be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                             There and Back                          (By Barrie Dunsmore)       Thank you Senator Leahy for being here tonight with your      wife Marcelle, and for your kind words. I also thank you for      your constant support for my columns and comments over many      years. Having you in my camp has been an inspiration.       Thank you to Holly Johnson, the proprietor of Wind Ridge      Publishing. If you had not had faith that my writing deserved      a wider audience outside Vermont, there would be no book and      we would not be here this evening.       Last, but certainly not least, I wish to thank my wife,      Whitney Taylor. She is tireless in encouraging me and      steadfast in supporting me. She is an excellent editor and my      most important audience. She always reads my material before      I send it out. And if she doesn't get something I know nobody      will--so I make changes accordingly.       There are others who are deserving of my thanks but I      promise I won't bore you kind folks who probably aren't      interested in my high school Latin teacher who made me such a      great writer.       Seriously I make no such claim, but I am a writer. In fact      over the last decade--including my columns, radio and      television commentaries, book reviews and speeches--I have      written about a half a million words. To put that into      perspective, Tolstoy's War and Peace in Russian runs 460,000      words.       I'm not talking about quality here, but in quantity, my      body of work is greater than War and Peace. But you'll be      happy to know the book contains only a fraction of that.       Let me explain the title of the book, ``There and Back.''       The first section, called THERE, contains columns and      commentaries that deal largely with events taking place in      foreign lands over THERE in this century--but seen through      the prism of events I covered in the last century. For      example, I wrote about the Arab Spring in Egypt last      February, in the context of my long experience in Egypt and      particularly my contacts with the late president Anwar Sadat.       The section called BACK contains articles addressing the      politics, culture and media of America--since I've been in      retirement, BACK here in the United States.       The items in this section reflect a somewhat detached view      of America as a former foreign and diplomatic correspondent      might see it. The title of the book, and the concept, were      suggested by my principal editor Emily Copeland to whom I am      most grateful.       I promise you, this is not going to be a long speech, but      I've been asked to reflect a bit on my impressions of how the      mainstream media have fared since I retired in the mid-1990s.       When I took early retirement, I vowed I would not fall      victim to the affliction that hits many old men and induces      them to claim that everything that has happened in their      field since they retired is a disaster. I confess in recent      years being true to that vow has been a real challenge.      Actually, when I did a series of lectures to the journalism      classes at Vermont's Saint Michael's College last year, I      suggested the students look at me as an archeologist might      view a relic from the past that is more or less intact, and      might provide some useful information.       During my four decades as an active reporter, there were      major technological changes in network television news--going      from black and white film to color; shifting from film to      videotape; the advent of high-quality hand held cameras. And,      finally of course, the coming of the communications      satellite. That significantly changed everything. It meant      there would be no more waiting for three days for the film      from Vietnam or the Middle East to arrive in New York. But      much more important, it became possible to have live coverage      of news events virtually anywhere in the world.       Yet as great as those changes were, they pale in comparison      to how the new information technologies have totally      revolutionized the media. The Internet and the almost      universal use of the personal computer and the cell phone      have had an extraordinarily profound impact on the reporting      of news, not to mention redefining what constitutes news--and      who or what is a reporter. Many consider this a good thing--a      notion I do not entirely share.       I will say this about the new technologies--they are not      inherently good or bad. Like all of their revolutionary      predecessors, such as the telegraph or moveable type, they      are neutral instruments. Whether they serve society--or      subvert it--depends on how these new tools are being used, by      whom and to what ends.       For me, one of the more troubling consequences of this      latest revolution is that by siphoning off huge portions of      ad revenues, the Internet and its social networks have      threatened the financial viability of the mainstream media--     and as a consequence, have undermined the credibility of the      news media as one of the key institutions that make democracy      work.       Thomas Jefferson repeatedly said it. And the philosophers      of ancient Greece apparently believed it: In order to      survive, democracy needs to have a relatively well-informed      electorate. The people cannot wisely choose their leaders if      they don't have at least a basic understanding of the issues      and of the consequences of the choices they are making.       What worries me most about the declining role of the      mainstream media in today's world, is that in spite of all      the various new platforms to provide and dispense      information--ironically, maybe because of all these choices--     there is evidence that the electorate is less well informed      than it was in other times in history. As I see it, these      days more people than ever hold passionate, partisan      opinions--that are largely free of facts. At another time,      those necessary facts would have been available in the major      news media, and most people would have accepted them as such.      Sad to say, that is something which large and growing numbers      of people no longer do.                          ____________________
