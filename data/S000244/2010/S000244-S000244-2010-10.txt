Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 140th anniversary of the Department of Justice. The Judiciary Act of 1789, which was passed by the First Congress and signed into law by President George Washington, created the office of Attorney General, which eventually became the chief law enforcement officer of the Federal Government.  The Department of Justice began its work on July 1, 1870, through an act of Congress, with the Attorney General at its head. Since then, the Department has evolved into the world's largest law office and the central agency for the enforcement of Federal law.  Today, the Department strives to meet four goals in its pursuit of justice: First, protecting the public against foreign and domestic threats; second, ensuring the fair administration of justice in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution; third, assisting both State and local law enforcement agencies; and, fourth, defending the United States and its foreign interests.  Over the past decade, the Department has made significant efforts to protect the children of America. In 2006, through the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act, the Department of Justice created a national sex offender registry to better protect children by organizing sex offenders into three tiers. The act also created a nationwide DNA database and allows law enforcement to monitor dangerous sex offenders through the use of GPS technology.  Recognizing the dangers of technology-assisted exploitation crimes against children, the Department of Justice launched Project Safe Childhood, an effort that resulted in record numbers of arrests and prosecutions of individuals seeking to commit sexual crimes against children.  The AMBER Alert system, a Department of Justice directive, works to protect and save the lives of abducted children. Since the expansion of the system in 2003, more than 500 missing or exploited children have been safely recovered. Alerts are broadcast over the Internet, television and radio programming, electronic highway signs, lottery tickets, and text messaging.  Shortly after the September 11 attack, I introduced the USA PATRIOT Act, which afforded the Department of Justice new tools to detect and prevent terrorism, organized crime, and drug trafficking. The provisions of the act updated laws to reflect new threats and new technologies, facilitate better cooperation amongst government agencies, and updated and increased penalties for convicted terrorists. Since the act's passage in October 2001, the numbers of terrorist convictions and prosecutions by U.S. attorneys have soared. Make no mistake, the USA PATRIOT Act has contributed to the prevention of another large-scale terrorist attack on American soil.  The Justice Department has also made a commitment to protect Americans residing in areas riddled with gun and gang violence. It responded to the significant increase in the number of firearms-related crimes in small geographic areas by creating the Violent Crime Impact Team initiative.                              {time}  1345  Since 2004, it has arrested more than 14,000 gang members, drug dealers, felons in possession of firearms, and other violent criminals, including more than 2,800 who have been identified as the ``worst of the worst'' criminals.  I applaud the work of the Department of Justice in its efforts to defend the American people and to administer justice while respecting and ensuring the rights and dignity entitled to all.  I encourage my colleagues to support House Resolution 1422.
