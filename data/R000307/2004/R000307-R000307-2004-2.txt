President, I rise today to offer my support for the President's nomination of Dr. Fran Harvey to the post of Secretary of the Army.  Our forces are deployed around the world as they have never been before. They are fighting hard and they are fighting well to defend Americans in the war on terror, and the Army is at the front line of that fight.  Gone are the days when massive and overwhelming force was all this country needed to ensure victory. The threats we face and the stresses they cause on our force require visionary solutions. Fran Harvey is the visionary we need at the head of our largest force.  Fran Harvey knows how to look at a large organization where the bureaucracy is an overwhelming force in its own right, and mold it to meet future threats. Dr. Harvey is a successful executive who has extensive experience in leading and managing large organizations, particularly program based organizations involved in the development and deployment of technology and systems.  He will bring a results oriented management approach to an organization where results matter more than anywhere else. As part of this approach, Dr. Harvey places major emphasis on business transformation through process improvement in combination with the application of information technology.  Fran Harvey's broad base of experience has been multi-dimensional interms of industries, functions, and markets. His industrial experience is very diverse and includes aerospace and defense, environmental and infrastructure, energy, government facilities management, communications and information systems and electronics.  Fran Harvey has the requisite experience to be Secretary of the Army, but what is more important, he is a visionary where long-term vision is badly needed. It is my great pleasure to support what I am sure will be a successful tenure leading our Army.
