I think it is certainly time to review this statute. It is obviously time to get some clarification from the administration on exactly what authority they believe they do have. Are there no limits? We are now pledging $20 billion to Mexico. Is there no limit? What if the $20 billion is not enough? Credible analysts came before our hearing, unlike the playacting hearing put on by the Committee on Banking and Financial Services, but a hearing where we invited people who had differing views from the administration and the bailout artists, and said ``No. $40 billion will not be enough. Mexico is such a basket case, if you are going to tie the U.S. dollar to the Mexican peso, you better be prepared to defend the U.S. dollar against a run by the Japanese and the Germans and others, because they do not think this is a very smart thing to do.'' They said, ``You can expect to be talking about $150 billion, not $40 billion dollars.''  So this stabilization fund, will the President next week announce that well, the $20 billion was not enough, and now we are going to go for another $50 billion or $100 billion?                              {time}  2120  Where does this money come from? As you said, we have a $200 billion deficit, where does this money come from?
