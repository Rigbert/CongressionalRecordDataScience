m. with the time allocated as follows: 30 minutes under the control of Senator Gorton, 40 minutes under the control of Senator Abraham, and 10 minutes under the control of Senator Levin. I further ask that no other amendments be in order prior to the 6:40 vote. I also ask that immediately following that vote, a vote occur on amendment No. 1658, with 2 minutes for explanation prior to the vote. I understand this request has been cleared.
