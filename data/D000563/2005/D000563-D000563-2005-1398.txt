They are expanding at the expense of many other countries, including the United States.  We have lost hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs over the last 4 years to China as their economy is exploding in size. Many of the companies in China that are growing are American companies. The fact is, China is expanding its economy dramatically. It is no longer a backward Communist nation. It is a full-fledged world competitor, and many believe that China and India will be our competitors in the next 50 years for jobs and economic growth.  Is it not also true that China has one problem it has to face, and that is the fact that within the borders, as huge as China is, they don't have a lot of energy resources. So to keep this economy moving forward, they need to import energy into China, which means in the years to come, we will see more and more competition for foreign oil, not just the United States versus the rest of the world, but the United States versus China and the rest of the world, which means oil for $50 per barrel, which has now raised our price at the pump, may go to $100 per barrel.  I ask the Senator from Washington, setting this goal of reducing our dependence on foreign oil through conservation techniques, through alternative fuels, through finding environmentally sensitive resources that we can use, is that not looking forward to the kind of global competition we are going to face and accepting the reality that if we don't do this as a nation, we will find ourselves losing out from a security viewpoint as well as global competition with nations such as China?
