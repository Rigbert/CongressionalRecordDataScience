 President, I just want to add my congratulations to Timfor his tremendous work here. I have been here for 24 years, and every year I have been here, he has been a critical part of the work we do. Thank you, Tim, for the numerous issues you have helped us work our way through.  For me, when I was chairing the Budget Committee, which we all know is a very chaotic, long, and tedious process, Tim was there to make sure we did it right, that we were in order, and that things moved smoothly.  Tim, we could not have done it without you. Thank you for your 25 years of service and thank you to your family for allowing you to be here with us for 25 years of service, and I thank you for all you will continue to do in the future.  Thank you.
