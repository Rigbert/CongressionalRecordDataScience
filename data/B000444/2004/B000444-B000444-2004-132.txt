 President, as was announced yesterday, I was not able to be here for the vote on the amendment offered by Senator Hutchison, No. 3152, which includes service academy cadets and midshipmen in the military's disability discharge and retirement system and allows ROTC cadets to use TRICARE supplemental health care programs when they are injured during training. This amendment makes an important improvement to the health care of our future military leaders, and I would like the record to reflect that, had I been here, I would have voted for that amendment which passed unanimously.                          ____________________
