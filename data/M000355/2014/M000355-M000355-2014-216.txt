 President, here on the Senate floor we often speak about numbers of great magnitude. Whether we are speaking of the national debt, jobs, or tax dollars, the numbers can be in the thousands, millions, or even billions. Sometimes these numbers are enough to numb even the most policy minded to the sheer volume and amount of people and resources that go into running the Nation's Capital City.  Today, as I bid farewell to Rochelle Eubanks, a diligent, beloved, and loyal staffer for 25 years, there is one number in particular I want to bring to my colleagues' attention. That number is 1,807,181.  For a quarter of a century, Rochelle has been the backbone of my office, in charge of the one critical task that all of us honored enough to be elected to Congress are charged with: to listen, to respond to, and to act on behalf of our constituents.  First as my correspondence mail system, or CMS, operator; and since 1994, as my CMS production manager, Rochelle has been at the front lines of communicating with Kentuckians. CMS is the computerized system Senate offices use to keep track of their letters to constituents. And that number--1,807,181--is the number of letters to the Bluegrass State Rochelle has sent out in her 25 years of service.  It is truly remarkable. If every letter were to go to a different person, then Rochelle has mailed a letter to nearly half the State. No one else on my staff has had more contact with the voters back home than she has. After her retirement on April 4, she will be very much missed by myself and by all of her colleagues in my office.  Rochelle started back in March of 1989. But her Senate service extends back to April of 1982, when she began work as a mail manager for the Republican Conference. She also worked with Senators John East and Jim Broyhill, both of North Carolina, before moving to the House side in 1987. I am very glad we were able to lure her back over to the Senate side to work in my office beginning in 1989.  Most staff offices have two or three staffers working on CMS. But for the majority of her tenure with my office, Rochelle has handled CMS duties on her own. How in the world does she do it? Well, ``I just do what I do,'' Rochelle says, in her usual modest fashion. Perhaps the key to how she does itis that Rochelle is always the first to arrive in the office, often by 5:30 in the morning. I know for a fact Rochelle can be counted on as the first to arrive at work, because I can recall a time or two when she had to let me in my own office.  I knew I could always count on, as I have called her, the early bird. In fact, that is how I introduced Rochelle to my wife Elaine: This is my early bird. Rochelle could always be counted on to be there.  Because of her long tenure, Rochelle has become almost a den mother of sorts to many of the younger staff members and interns in my office. Rochelle has been with us in three different office locations, all in the Russell Building, and every time her desk has been located near the mailroom and the office interns.  When new interns or mailroom staffers start their first day, they already know who is looking out for them. ``You must be Rochelle,'' many have been heard to say. ``I've heard so much about you.''  One of my longtime staffers who worked with Rochelle for nearly 20 years remembers her fondly.       She interacted with me the same day I came as a staff      assistant, to the day I left as chief of staff. It was the      same way she treated everybody. It didn't matter if you were      a senator or an intern. She was always sweet and pleasant and      positive.  Another longtime staffer recalls:       Rochelle has long been the master of mass mail. Regardless      of how many bins I brought her, she always had a bright      smile, a kind word, a listening ear, and a delightful laugh.      All the things that make a colleague a dear friend--that's      what Rochelle is truly the master of.  Yet another former longtime time staffer says in tribute to her:       Rochelle . . . you were always the sounding board, the      moral compass and the reality check for the people you worked      with, some of whom you may have forgotten, but who will      always count you as a friend. And while your work over the      years was excellent, please know that those you have worked      with will remember you for much more.  The fidelity and loyalty Rochelle has shown to my office is exceeded only by her fidelity and loyalty to her family. Rochelle has two daughters: Rochelle and Endyia, and six granddaughters: Nyla, Jermany, Albany, Liberti, Milini, and little Marlei, who was born just this March 9.  Everyone in the office knows how cute Rochelle's granddaughters are because she proudly displays several pictures of them at her desk. Some former staffers recall years ago when Rochelle would occasionally bring her then-school-aged daughters into the office and they would show off their cartwheels. The tradition continues today with Rochelle's granddaughters. ``Granny, can we come work with you?'' they ask.  Family is also the reason that after 25 years, Rochelle is taking her well-earned retirement and moving into the next phase of her life. I was thrilled to learn Rochelle will be marrying her fiance Kevin Perry. They will soon be moving to New York. Of course, she will be missed by her family here in the District as well as by everyone in the McConnell office, but our loss is Mr. Perry's gain, and I wish the two of them great happiness in their marriage.  Kevin is a professional musician who plays the guitar, and his genre of choice is R&B and funk music. He and Rochelle have known each other since high school and after 30 years recently reconnected. Now they are back in each other's lives and looking forward to starting a new life in Queens--``not Manhattan,'' as Rochelle is quick to point out.  Rochelle is a native Washingtonian, and of course Rochelle's daughters, granddaughters, and other family here will miss her terribly, but Rochelle is reassuring. ``I'm only 4 hours away. And we'll do a lot of Skype,'' she says. ``They don't want me to stop [working] and they don't want me to leave DC. But I'm ready for a change.''  Quite a change it will be. It is hard to imagine the McConnell office without Rochelle. She is the fourth longest serving staffer in the history of my office. When she retires next Friday, she will have 9,140 days of continuous service. In fact, the three longest serving staffers still in my office are all women who have more than 25 years of service each; field assistant Sue Tharp, archivist Nan Mosher, and Rochelle.  For Rochelle it all comes down to family--her own family and the McConnell family which she has formed and grown close to in her time with us. So it is fitting that she is retiring to start a new chapter with her family.  ``It's a very close-knit office,'' Rochelle says of her tenure. ``Everybody cares. Everybody helps each other out.'' I am glad Rochelle feels that way, and I couldn't agree more.  Another longtime staffer and longtime friend of Rochelle's sums up the special place she holds in our hearts this way:       For Rochelle, it comes down to family. To her, that's the      unifier. My nephew is 20 years old; she still asks what he's      up to. She's that way with everybody. She's the glue.  Now the McConnell office is going to have to soldier on without the vital glue Rochelle Eubanks has provided for 25 years. It is a great loss not only for us but for the people of Kentucky--for all of my constituents she reached out to, for the recipients of 1,807,181 letters, each letter representing a vital link between them and their elected representative.  So farewell, Rochelle, my friend, and thank you ever so much for two and one-half decades of tireless service. It is going to be a very different office without your welcoming smile and easy laugh.  Congratulations and best wishes on your marriage and the wonderful new life you will begin with your husband. You certainly deserve every happiness.  It would be such a remarkable turn of events and a genuine pleasure to receive a letter from you for a change. I would even settle for a postcard. I hope you will send us one from New York.                                Ukraine  Mr. President, I wish to start by acknowledging the majority leader's decision to remove extraneous IMF provisions from the Ukraine bill. As I noted yesterday, no legislation could have passed with those provisions included. So I think it is a positive step forward. We are glad he took our advice, and now Congress will be able to pass an effective bill on Ukraine very soon.                              The Economy  Mr. President, President Obama and his Washington Democratic allies are well into their sixth year of presiding over our economy. Yet the jobs recovery they keep promising us just never seems to materialize.  We have to give Washington Democrats at least some credit though. They have tried regulating, taxing, spending, stimulating, just about everything their ideology will allow. The problem is their ideology just simply doesn't work. Many of their policies just end up making things worse. Of course, the best example is ObamaCare.  They promised the Sun and the Moon to sell this thing. They said it would create jobs. They also said it would improve the economy, lower premiums, insure the uninsured, without causing Americans to lose their insurance, their doctors or their hospitals--the kind of claims which would have made Billy Mays blush.  But now Americans know better. Evidence shows that not only will ObamaCare encourage less job creation, but it is also making the economy worse, that it is driving premiums higher, and it will not come anywhere near insuring all the uninsured, while causing millions of Americans to lose the insurance and the doctors they were promised they could keep.  It is also a law which is unraveling before our very eyes. As we read this week, the administration has now handed out so many waivers, special favors, and exemptions to help out Democrats politically that the heart of the law--the individual mandate--may actually no longer even be viable. It has basically become the legal equivalent of Swiss cheese.  There is a broader point. If Washington Democrats think ObamaCare is so bad they need to exempt that many people from its mandates, then why shouldn't we remove the hardship for everyone? Doesn't the middle class deserve a break too?  Why shouldn't we repeal the 30-hour workweek created by ObamaCare, the provision which reduces take-home pay for the middle class.  Why shouldn't we do away with ObamaCare's job-killing medical device tax, something even many Democrats would vote to abolish if the majority leader would allow the vote.  What I am saying is if Washington Democrats are actually serious aboutjob creation, then it is time to actually show it. Work with us to eliminate the things that hurt jobs, that hold Americans back from a real recovery--such as these job-killing ObamaCare mandates--and work with us to enact things which can actually create jobs.  Approving the Keystone Pipeline would create thousands of jobs right away. Passing trade legislation--legislation President Obama has already endorsed--would help create even more, but Washington Democrats need to work collaboratively with us to make those things happen. Yet this morning's New York Times highlights their strategy for the rest of the year. Here it is summed up in three words, ``political show votes.''  Get this. Their plan is not to pass legislation but to time show votes to ``coincide with campaign-style trips by President Obama.'' Rather than take up House-passed jobs bills which would actually help middle-class Americans, they plan for yet another year of turning the Senate floor into a campaign studio.  I am asking Washington Democrats to put the ideology and political show votes aside for once and finally join us, join us to give the American people what they have been asking for all along--more jobs, more opportunity, and an economy which works for the middle class once again.  I yield the floor.                       Reservation of Leader Time  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). Under the previous order, the leadership time is reserved.                          ____________________
