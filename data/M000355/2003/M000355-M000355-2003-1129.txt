m., with the time equally divided in the usual form. At 10:30, the Senate will then resume consideration of H.J. Res. 2, the appropriations bill. I understand there are several Members on the other side of the aisle who intend to offer their amendments to the appropriations measure during Tuesday's session.  In addition to considering further amendments to the appropriations measure, it is the majority leader's hope that on Tuesday the Senate will consider the nomination of Tom Ridge to be Secretary of Homeland Security. I believe some Members have indicated their desire to speak in regard to that nomination. A rollcall vote is anticipated.  At the hour of 5:15, the Senate will vote on S. 121, the AMBER Alert bill. This will be the first vote of today's session. Additional votes are expected during today.  As a reminder, Senators have until 6 p.m. today to file their first-degree amendments to the appropriations bill.  Finally, I announce to Members that they should expect busy sessions each day this week in the hopes of completing action on the appropriations bill.
