Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I would like to remind people we did pass this bill with 269, I believe, votes in the House and that is an overwhelming majority. I am very proud of that; and again, I will say and repeat it again and again: just to do something to have a charade conveyed upon the people I will not be part of, just to say we passed something and say it does something when it does not do it. I am not going to rehash what happened last week in the sense that the other body's bill does not do it, and we do a disservice when we sell something to the public that is not really factually doing what we say it does.  Let us go to conference and see if we can solve this problem; but I also urge my colleagues to talk to the other body and suggest that since they have their feet dug in concrete, it is going to be a little difficult. But what we did last week was the right thing to do, was the right thing for the public, and it will be the right thing for the public in the future, not only today but in the future.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mica).
