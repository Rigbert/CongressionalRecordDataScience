Mr. Speaker, today is a day of several anniversaries. As Americans we cannot forget that 54 year ago today our nation was invaded and attacked and lives were lost at Pearl Harbor. Today we remember those who lost their lives and honor those who bravely served in our Armed Forces and defended our borders.  Today is also the anniversary of another invasion. Twenty years ago today the nation of Indonesia invaded the territory of East Timor and 1 year later forcibly annexed it. Within a matter of hours and days after the invasion entire families were wiped out. And since December 7, 1975, over 200,000 Timorese have been killed--one-third of the entire population.  What has happened in East Timor over the last 20 years has been sarcastically called by John Pilger, an Australian journalist, ``one of the world's great secrets.'' Indonesia severely restricts access to East Timor, making it difficult to monitor abuses, while human rights organizations and activists are subject to harassment and threats from the government. Still, well-respected organizations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch/Asia have been able to report on the continuing human rights problems in East Timor.  In addition to the thousands killed over the last 20 years, the Indonesian Government has unleashed a reign of terror over the East Timorese which includes detaining political prisons, torture and rape, and disappearances. According to Roman Catholic Bishop Ximenes Belo, an outspoken defender of human rights in East Timor and a Nobel Peace Prize nominee, ``There is always fear. We lack freedom to speak, to walk where we want, to have different opinions. If people talk, they know they will be interrogated. They will be tortured.''  Because of Bishop Belo's strong defense of human rights, the Jakarta Government is actively seeking his replacement as leader of East Timor's Roman Catholic Church. The government's attempt to control the church is an attempt to control even the spiritual life of the East Timorese people. In addition to the campaign against Bishop Belo, Amnesty International reports that church officials are subject to surveillance, including the tapping of phones and interception of letters. Members of the clergy also face harassment and intimidation by security forces and Indonesian troops.  In October of this year young people, unable to tolerate the suppression any longer, protested against the Indonesian Government. The response of the military was swift and violent. Over 200 people were injured by gunfire, while 150 others who were attending a meeting at a convent were arrested and detained. Many of those who were detained were reported to have been tortured with electric prods or beaten while in custody.  Mr. Speaker, the territory of East Timor has been held in captivity for 20 years by the Indonesian Government and there are few indications that the reign of terror will soon end. On this day, when we remember that our own nation was once invaded by another nation, we must not forget the people of East Timor who have not known freedom and peace since the Indonesian invasion on December 7, 1975. And unlike the attack on Pearl Harbor where we were able to overcome the invaders, the invaders of East Timor have yet to be defeated. We can only imagine what life must be like, denied the right of self-determination and other basic human rights. But the words of one man who has spent the last 20 years of his life under the Indonesian dictatorship might help us understand: ``We the people in East Timor call it the biggest prison island in the world. You must understand that. For us who live here it's hell.''                          ____________________
