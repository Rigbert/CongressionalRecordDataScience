Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague and friend for yielding.  The right to vote and to have every vote counted is precious and sacred. It is the heart and soul of our democratic process. We cannot be true to ourselves as a democratic society unless we get it right.  I think, Mr. Speaker, it is fitting and appropriate that we pause, that we have this discussion, that we have this debate, and that Congress hold further hearings on questions about the Presidential election in Ohio and elsewhere.  Our electoral system is broken, and it must be fixed once and for all. What happened in Florida in 2000 and in Ohio in 2004 tends to dramatize the fact that there is something wrong with our democracy. More and more of our citizens have grown uneasy.  I hear people on the other side saying we should forget it, we should get over it. How can we get over it when people died for the right to vote, where people suffered for the right to vote? The right of every vote to be counted must be upheld by this body.
