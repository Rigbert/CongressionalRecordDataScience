President, today I introduce the Health Care Consumer Assistance Act. This legislation creates a consumer assistance program that is key to patient protections in the health insurance market.  President Clinton's Health Quality Commission stated in its recently released Bill of Rights that consumers have the right to receive accurate, easily understood information and get assistance in making informed decisions about health plans and providers. Today, only a loose patchwork of consumer assistance services exists. And, while a number of sources provide assistance, most programs are limited. Many consumer groups have advocated for the establishment of consumer assistance programs to support consumers' growing need of information.  The legislation I am introducing today gives states grants to establish nonprofit, private consumer assistance program designed to help consumers understand and act on their health care choices, rights and responsibilities. Under my bill, the Secretary of Health and Human Services will make available funds for states to select an independent, nonprofit agency to provide the following services to consumers: provide information to consumers relating to their choices, rights and responsibilities within the plans they select; operate 1-800 telephone hotlines to respond to consumer information, advice and assistance requests; produce and disseminate educational materials about patients' rights; provide assistance and representation to people who wish to appeal the denial, termination, or reduction of health care services, or a refusal to pay for health services; and collect and disseminate data about inquiries, problems and grievances handled by the consumer assistance program.  This program has been championed by Ron Pollack of Families USA, a member of the President's Commission on Quality, as well as numerous other consumer advocates.  Mr. President, I have joined with many of my Democratic colleagues in sponsoring S.1890, the Patients' Bill of Rights Act of 1998. I am pleased that S.1890 would establish a consumer assistance program, similar to that established by my legislation. My purpose today is to emphasize the importance of such a consumer protection program. This legislation is not without controversy, but I believe that American consumers deserve protection and assistance as they attempt to navigate the often confusing and complex world of health insurance.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the bill printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2254       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
