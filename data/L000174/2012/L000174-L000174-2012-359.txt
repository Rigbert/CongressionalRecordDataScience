Du's nomination. In his recommendation letter, he wrote that when Ms. Du appeared before him when he was a judge, she ``was always well prepared and represented her clients with integrity and distinction.'' He further stated that she had his ``full support'' for confirmation as a Federal district judge. Ironically, he was the judge in the one case on which Republicans rely to criticize the nominee. As the judge, he had overlooked the jurisdictional argument when initially deciding against dismissing the case. The Magistrate Judge on the case issued sanctions, but Governor Sandoval ultimately struck the motion for sanctions as moot when Ms. Du and her legal team resolved the dispute with the third-party. In addition, Ms. Du testified candidly about the incident during her Committee hearing and in her response to the Questions for the Record, acknowledged that she had ``learned a great deal from this experience.'' Incidents like this have never held up a nomination before in the past, and it should certainly not hold up Ms. Du's nomination. President Obama's nominees should not be held to a different or new standard.  She has spent her 17-year legal career in private practice as a partner at a law firm in Reno, Nevada. She currently serves as chair of the firm's Employment & Labor Law Group. Ms. Du's story is compelling. She was selected by Super Lawyers as a 2009 ``Mountain States Rising Star'' and was named as one of the ``Top 20 Under 40'' Young Professionals in the Reno-Tahoe Area in 2008. That she is being opposed because she and her legal team filed a third-party complaint on behalf of a client in one case is to hold her to a new standard than Senate Republicans have utilized with other nominees and other Presidents in the past.  The other nominee we consider today is Susie Morgan. She has worked in private practice for 30 years. Her nomination has the bipartisan support of Louisiana's Senators, Democratic Senator Mary Landrieu and Republican Senator David Vitter. Following her law school graduation, Ms. Morgan clerked for Chief Judge Henry A. Politz of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. She was unanimously rated as qualified by the American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary to serve as a Federal judge in the Eastern District of Louisiana. Her nomination was approved unanimously by the Judiciary Committee last November.  The Senate needs to make real progress, which means going beyond the nominations included in the agreement between Senate leaders to include the 17 judicial nominations currently before the Senate for a final vote and the eight judicial nominees who have had hearings and are working their way through the Committee process. There are another 11 nominations on which the Committee should be holding additional hearings during the next several weeks.                               Exhibit 1                [From Tuscaloosanews.com, Mar. 22, 2012]       Editorial: Congress Needs To Stop Judicial Partisan Games       Delays in the confirmation of federal judges aren't      uppermost in Americans' minds when they complain about      partisan dysfunction in Congress. But the determination of      Senate Republicans to delay President Barack Obama's judicial      nominees--even those who have won bipartisan support from the      Judiciary Committee--is emblematic of the polarization that      also has sabotaged efforts of the two parties to work      together on numerous other fronts. And the delays are      objectionable in themselves: They deprive the courts of      needed personnel, slow the administration of justice and      deter well-qualified candidates from agreeing to be      considered for the bench.       So it's a hopeful sign that Republicans have agreed to vote      on 14 judicial nominations by May 7. It would be heartening      to report that the Republicans agreed to the votes because      they repented of the obstructionism of some of their members,      but in fact their agreement followed a power play by Senate      Majority Leader Harry Reid, D Nev., who filed cloture motions      to try to force votes on 17 nominations.       Rather irrelevantly, Republicans had complained that Reid      hadn't made judicial confirmations a priority. Now he has.      Republicans also have faulted the Obama administration for      being slow to fill vacancies on district and appeals courts.      That is a fair criticism. There are 81 vacancies but only 39      pending nominees (including two for future vacancies). But it      is Republicans who have withheld the unanimous consent      necessary for nominations already approved by the Judiciary      Committee to move forward expeditiously and without prolonged      debate. The latest pretext for delay was the desire to      protest Obama's recess appointments to federal agencies, but      Republicans have been reluctant to allow Democrats to score a      political point by promptly confirming Obama's judicial      nominees.       When Reid first proposed swift action on the nominations,      Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R Ky., complained:      ``This is just a very transparent attempt to try to slam dunk      the minority and make them look like they are obstructing      things they aren't obstructing.'' But then McConnell added      that ``this is going to, of course, be greeted with      resistance.'' In other words, if you accuse us of being      obstructionist, we'll make you pay by being obstructionist.      This is partisanship at its pettiest.       The White House complains that the Senate has taken four to      five times as long to confirm Obama's nominees as it did to      approve George W. Bush's. Nevertheless, several of Bush's      nominations were delayed or derailed by Senate Democrats,      including eminently qualified appeals court nominees whom      they feared might be potential Republican appointees to the      Supreme Court.       Controversial or not, every judicial nominee deserves      serious consideration by the Senate and an expeditious up-or-     down vote--and no more partisan games.                                  ____                               Exhibit 2                                       Office of the Governor,                                   Las Vegas, NV, August 22, 2011.     Re Recommendation of Miranda Du     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Dirksen          Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: It is with great pleasure that I      recommend Miranda Du for the United States District Court      Judge, District of Nevada.       As long as I have known Miranda, she has exhibited great      character and is well respected in the legal community.      During my tenure as a U.S. District Judge, each time Miranda      appeared before me, she was always well prepared and      represented her clients with integrity and distinction.       Miranda Du will make a fine U.S. District Judge and      therefore has my full support. Please feel free to contact me      if you have any questions. Thank you for your consideration.           Sincere regards,                                                   Brian Sandoval,     Governor.                                  ____                            Office of the Lieutenant Governor,                                 Carson City, NV, August 23, 2011.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Dirksen          Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: I am writing in enthusiastic support of      Miranda Du's nomination to the United States District Court      for the District of Nevada.       As Nevada's Lieutenant Governor, I have the privilege of      serving as Chairman of the Nevada Commission on Economic      Development (NCED), whose mission is to promote a robust      diversified and prosperous economy for Nevada. In this      capacity, I have served with Ms. Du since she was appointed      to the Commission in July 2008.       As a NCED commissioner, Ms. Du has demonstrated many      qualities that will make her an ideal Federal District Court      Judge. She is intelligent, inquisitive, reliable and      dedicated. She is an active and involved commission, always      prepared and informed, and she is not afraid to ask tough      questions. She conducts herself in a professional and      dignified manner. I think that both Nevada and the United      States will benefit from Ms. Du's appointment to the Federal      Bench and I strongly encourage the Senate to confirm Ms. Du.           Best regards,                                                Brian K. Krolicki,     Nevada Lieutenant Governor.                                  ____                                                 City of Reno,                                        Reno, NV, August 12, 2011.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Dirksen          Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.     Hon. Chuck Grassley,     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate,          Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Leahy and Grassley: I am writing in support      of the nomination of Nevada Attorney Miranda Du to the United      States District Court for the District of Nevada.       I have known Ms. Du for quite some time. For the last eight      years, I have had the opportunity to observe her legal skills      and temperament primarily in my role as a member of the Board      of Directors of the Truckee Meadows Water Authority      (``TMWA''), which is partly owned by the City of Reno. Ms. Du      has represented TMWA on several matters, and she has been      both effective and professional in that representation. Ms.      Du is intelligent, articulate and even-tempered. She is      direct and always seems prepared in responding to questions      from the TMWA Board. I believe she will be a great addition      to our federal bench. I strongly recommend her for      confirmation.           Sincerely,                                           Robert A. Cashell, Sr.,                                                            Mayor.
