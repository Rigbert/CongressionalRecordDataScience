 President, let me begin my remarks on North Korea and Egypt with an expression of sympathy and solidarity with the people of Israel following the weekend's brutal violence that killed and injured scores of innocent civilians. My thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families.  The fanatical suicide bombings by Palestinian extremists must end today. PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat must immediately and unequivocally prove that he embraces peace with Israel, and he can do this by taking concrete action against those responsible for organizing and committing these heinous attacks. Israel has already appropriately responded to the Palestinian terrorism, and I do not doubt that further retaliation is possible.  North Korea today is a failed state. Its centrally planned economy is in shambles, and the people of North Korea are, at best, oppressed and, at worst, starving and dying. Borrowing a page from Mao Zedong and Pol Pot, North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il recently launched a new revolutionary movement to build ``a people's paradise on this land at an early date.'' I would remind my colleagues that in the jargon of dictators, ``paradise'' is synonymous with ``purgatory.''  While the North Korean leadership poses a clear and present danger to the welfare of its own people, state sponsorship of international terrorism and news reports of North Korean missile sales to Egypt present wider challenges to democracies around the world, from Japan to Israel.  I have stood on the Senate floor several times this year to express my concern with reports of Egyptian insistence on buying North Korean missiles and weapons technology. Last week, this issue surfaced once again at the State Department's daily press briefing. When asked whether the Department has concluded that a missile deal between Pyongyang and Cairo has not occurred, Spokesman Richard Boucher stated ``No, I wouldn't go that far.''  This should give pause to all of us who follow events in the Middle East closely. According to a November 16 article in the Washington Post, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak publicly warned of an arms race between Israel and its Arab neighbors. The danger posed by North Korean weapons sales to the region is double-edged: hostile arsenals are bolstered while Pyongyang receives much-needed infusions of cash. Deny both, and stability is strengthened in Asia and the Middle East.  Egypt must immediately and honestly answer whether the purchase of Nodong missiles, that have a range of 1,000 kilometers, is the beginning of that arms race. If this is the case, America has no choice but to review new foreign military sales to Egypt. I know some of my colleagues will disagree with me on this issue, but, to paraphrase that old car repair commercial, we can pay for our inaction now, or we can really pay for it later.                          ____________________
