Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I find this incredible. I offer an amendment which prohibits the possession of illegal firearms, illegal firearms, in public housing, and it is being resisted by the Republican majority. Illegal firearms.  Do we want to end crime in this country with sensible gun regulation?  Every time we raise the issue of firearms on this floor, will we have people go into a panic?  We are talking about illegal firearms. We are talking about the discharge of firearms in public housing, terrorizing families and their children. We are talking about drug gangs.  Mr. Chairman, the resistance to this amendment tells me that many of the people who are opposing it have not even been to these public housing projects and spoken to the families.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy].
