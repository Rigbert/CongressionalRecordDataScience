Cannon) very much for his leadership in assembling this tribute this evening on behalf of our beloved colleague Wayne Owens who passed, as others have said, in Tel Aviv, as a witness for peace, and I would like to encourage my friend, the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Cannon), to consider perhaps in Congressman Owens' memory that we, on a bipartisan basis, might create, as the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Capps) has very wisely suggested, a Middle Eastern study group oriented toward peace in that region and to do so on a bipartisan basis, naming it after Congressman Owens who showed us the way in that troubled and war-torn region of the world.  He was walking the path to peace and peace requires heroes and it requires heroics; and Wayne Owens, for our Nation, is such a hero. My heart goes out to his wife, Marlene, his five children, two sisters, a brother, 14 grandchildren who truly have a hero to admire.  At age 65 he did not have to go on that painstaking journey, 7 days of intensive work, trying to find those keyholes to peace, and yet he did that. He could have been living a comfortable life in some condo on some ski slope enjoying himself, but his whole life showed that Wayne Owens was not afraid of hard work.  In 1989, he cofounded the Center for Middle East Peace and Economic Cooperation here in our Nation's capital and established working relationships with leaders from Jordan, Egypt, Israel, Palestine, Saudi Arabia and was making a difference for all of us as the world and our own country is perched on the verge of war in that region. He was trying to show us a different path.  He was not afraid of hard work in his own life. I mean, from the time he washed dishes to work his way through school, to walking across his own State in the entire second congressional district and winning election here, this was a man who endured and who rose above common effort to heroic level to try to help the world, to remove from the television every evening those terrible images of death in the Middle East that infect every child in every nation on Earth, certainly our own.  To his family, may I please extend the deepest sympathy of the people of our community. I had the great honor of being able to work with Wayne in our efforts here to find a peaceful road in the Middle East. I am forever indebted to him, to the organization that he founded and to the friendships that he made on both sides of the aisle that helped us find a better way forward.  As mission president for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in Montreal, Canada, for 3 years, Wayne Owens took his own peace quest to a much higher level and took it to ground zero in the battle for peace in the Middle East.                              {time}  1730  Madam Speaker, I will place in the Record an article that was in Roll Call this week in his honor and also thank the gentleman from Utah very much for yielding to me this evening.                    Former Representative Owens Dies                           (By Bree Hocking)       Wayne Owens, a relentless advocate for Arab-Israeli peace      and former Democratic Representative from Utah, died Dec. 18      while walking on a beach in Tel Aviv.       Owens, who was 65, succumbed to a massive heart attack      while traveling with a Congressional delegation to the      region.       The four-term Congressman served in the House from 1973 to      1975 and from 1987 to 1993, representing the Salt Lake city      area.       During his Congressional career, he made two unsuccessful      bids for the Senate. In 1974, he lost to Republican Jake Garn      and in 1992 he was defeated by Sen. Bob Bennett (R-Utah). He      also ran unsuccessfully for governor of the Beehive State in      1984.       A devout Mormon, Owens served as president of the Montreal      mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints      in the mid- to late 1970s.       Despite his liberal credentials--he was the Western states      coordinator for the presidential bids of both Robert Kennedy      and now-Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.), and also was a staffer      to the later Kennedy--Owens was admired by Members from both      sides of the aisle for his tireless work for peace in the      Middle East. In 1989, he co-founded the Center for Middle      East Peace and Economic cooperation and served as its      president.       Owens attended the University of Utah, latter earning a law      degree from that institution.       He is survived by his wife, Marlene, five children, two      sisters, a brother and 14 grandchildren.
