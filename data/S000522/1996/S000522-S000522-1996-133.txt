Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman for offering this amendment.  The amendment will provide for a 6-month extension of H-1A nonimmigrant program for nurses as originally enacted by the Immigration Nursing Relief Act of 1989. I support this extension of the H-1A program which originally was effective for just 5 years. This will permit the Subcommittee on Immigration and Claims to conduct hearings and otherwise investigate the competing interests relevant to this program.  Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from North Carolina [Mr. Burr] for taking the lead on this issue. I urge my colleagues to support this extension of the nurses program.
