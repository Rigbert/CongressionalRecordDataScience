Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this legislation. I want to thank my good friend, the chairman, Mr. McDermott, for his hard work in bringing this bill to the floor.  Under this bill, a Georgian would receive an additional 20 weeks of unemployment benefits. Many have been waiting, worrying, and juggling bills for months. People from all over the State of Georgia call my offices every day asking what is taking Congress so long to act. Let me be clear, these are not people who want a handout. These are people who want to work. Many are older workers with all levels of education who have worked in the same jobs for years, and now their jobs are gone, just gone.  We can act today, and we must act. Now is the time to act to pass this legislation, send it to the President, and let him sign it into law so our citizens will receive the necessary benefits.
