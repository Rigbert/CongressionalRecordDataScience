Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I have to tell my colleagues how much I appreciate the gentleman from Illinois' generous comments, and I certainly understand what he was saying, and, as he just suggested, the intent here was never to end legal immigration. It was just to force Congress to do its job and regularly review our immigration numbers. And I do appreciate the gentleman from Illinois making his statement clear and appreciate his being so open and honest about the whole subject.  Mr. Chairman, let me also commend the gentleman for his amendment and for rectifying the situation that none of us anticipated, but at least we are doing the right thing.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
