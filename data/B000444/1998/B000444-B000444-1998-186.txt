 President, today I am introducing the New Medicines to Treat Addiction Act of 1998, legislation that builds upon my efforts in previous Congresses to promote research into and development of new medicines to treat the ravages of hard core drug addiction.  Since the first call to arms against illegal drugs in 1989, we have learned just how insidious hardcore drug addiction is, even as the ravages of substance abuse--on both the addict and his victims--have become ever more apparent. The frustration in dealing with a seemingly intractable national problem is palpable, most noticeably in the heated rhetoric as politicians blame each other for the failure to find a cure. What gets lost underneath the noise is the recognition that we have not done everything we can to fight this problem and that, like all serious ills, we must take incremental steps one at a time, and refuse to be overwhelmed by the big picture.  Throughout my tenure as Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I called for a multifaceted strategy to combat drug abuse. One of the specific steps I advocated was the creation of incentives to encourage the private sector to develop medicines that treat addiction, an area where promising research has not led--as one would normally expect--to production of medicines. The bill I am introducing today, the New Medicines To Treat Addiction Act of 1998, will hopefully change that. It takes focused aim at one segment of the drug-abusing population--hardcore addicts, namely users of cocaine and heroin--in part because these addicts are so difficult to treat with traditional methods, and in part because this population commits such a large percentage of drug-related crime.  In December, 1989, I commissioned a Judiciary Committee report, ``Pharmacotherapy: A Strategy for the 1990's.'' In that report, I posed the question, ``If drug use is an epidemic, are we doing enough to find a medical `cure' for this disease?'' The report gave the answer ``No.'' Unfortunately, almost a decade later, the answer remains the same. Developing new medicines for the treatment of addiction should be among our highest medical research priorities as a nation. Until we take this modest step, we cannot claim to have done everything reasonable to address the problem, and we should not become so frustrated that we effectively throw up our hands and do nothing.  Recent medical advances have increased the possibility of developing medications to treat drug addiction. These advances include a heightened understanding of the physiological and psychological characteristics of drug addition and a greater base of neuroscientific research.  One example of this promising research is the recent development of a compound that has been proven to immunize laboratory animals against the effects of cocaine. The compound works like a vaccine by stimulating the immune system to develop an antibody that blocks cocaine from entering the brain. Researchers funded through the National Institute of Drug Abuse believe that this advance may open a whole new avenue for combating addiction.  Despite this progress, we still do not have a medication to treat cocaine addiction or drugs to treat many other forms of substance abuse, because the private sector is unsure of the wisdom of making the necessary investment in the production and marketing of such medicines.  Private industry has not aggressively developed pharmacotherapies for a variety of reasons, including a small customer base, difficulties distributing medication to the target population, and fear of being associated with substance abusers. We need to create financial incentives to encourage pharmaceutical companies to develop and market these treatments. And we need to develop a new partnership between private industry and the public sector in order to encourage the active marketing and distribution of new medicines so they are accessible to all addicts in need of treatment.  While pharmacotherapies alone are not a ``magic bullet'' that will solve our national substance abuse problem, they have the potential to fill a gap incurrent treatment regimens. The disease of addiction occurs for many reasons, including a variety of personal problems which pharmacotherapy cannot address. Still, by providing a treatment regimen for drug abusers who are not helped by traditional methods, pharmacotherapy holds substantial promise for reducing the crime and health crisis that drug abuse is causing in the United States.  The New Medicines to Treat Addiction Act would encourage and support the development of medicines to treat drug addiction in three ways.  It reauthorizes and increases funding for the Medications Development Program at the National Institute of Health, which for years has been at the forefront of research into drug addiction.  The bill also creates two new incentives for private sector companies to undertake the difficult but important task of developing medicines to treat addiction.  First, the bill would provide additional patent protections for companies that develop drugs to treat substance abuse. Under the bill, pharmacotherapies could be designated ``orphan drugs'' and qualify for an exclusive seven-year patent to treat a specific addiction. These extraordinary patent rights would greatly enhance the market value of pharmacotherapies and provide a financial reward for companies that invest in the search to cure drug addiction. This provision was contained in a bill introduced by Senator Kennedy and me in 1990, but was never acted on by Congress.  Second, the bill would establish a substantial monetary reward for companies that develop drugs to treat cocaine and heroin addiction but shift the responsibility for marketing and distributing such drugs to the government. This approach would create a financial incentive for drug companies to invest in research and development but enable them to avoid any stigma associated with distributing medicine to substance abusers.  The bill would require the National Academy of Sciences to develop strict guidelines for evaluating whether a drug effectively treats cocaine or heroin addiction. If a drug meets these guidelines and is approved by the Food and Drug Administration, then the government must purchase the patent rights for the drug from the company that developed it. The purchase price for the patent rights is established by law: $100 million for a drug to treat cocaine addiction and $50 million for a drug to treat heroin addiction. Once the government has purchased the patent rights, then it is responsible for producing the drug and distributing it to clinics, hospitals, state and local governments, and any other entities qualified to operate drug treatment programs.  This joint public/private endeavor will correct the market inefficiencies that have thus far prevented the development of drugs to treat addiction and require the government to take on the responsibilities that industry is unwilling or unable to perform.  America's drug problem is reduced each and every time a drug abuser quits his or her habit. Fewer drug addicts mean fewer crimes, fewer hospital admissions, fewer drug-addicted babies and fewer neglected children. The benefits to our country of developing new treatment options such as pharmacotherapies are manifold. Each dollar we spend on advancing options in this area can save us ten or twenty times as much in years to come. The question isn't ``Can we afford to pursue a pharmacotherapy strategy?'' but rather, ``Can we afford not to?''  Congress has long neglected to adopt measures I have proposed to speed the approval of and encourage greater private sector interest in pharmacotherapy. We cannot let another Congress conclude without rectifying our past negligence on this issue. I urge my colleagues to join me in promoting an important, and potentially ground breaking, approach to addressing one of our nation's most serious domestic challenges.                                 ______                                       By Mr. D'AMATO (for himself, Ms. Mikulski, Ms. Snowe, Mr.         Moynihan, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Bingaman,         Mr. Johnson, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Kennedy, Ms. Moseley-Braun, Mrs.         Feinstein, and Mrs. Boxer):  S. 2017. A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to provide medical assistance for breast and cervical cancer-related treatment services to certain women screened and found to have breast or cervical cancer under a Federally funded screening program; to the Committee on Finance.          The Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act of 1998  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce bi-partisan legislation which will allow states the option of providing Medicaid coverage to women who have been diagnosed with breast and cervical cancer through the federal government's breast and cervical cancer early detection program.  Currently, the CDC breast and cervical cancer program provides low-income, uninsured women with coverage for cancer screening, covering mammographies and pap smears. While this program begins to fill a crucial need, this legislation allows Congress to make this program even better. The result has often been that uninsured women are diagnosed with cancer and then left to scramble to find treatment.  In 1990 Congress passed a bill that was a breakthrough for the early detection of breast and cervical cancer in women. The Breast and Cervical Cancer Mortality Prevention Act of 1990 authorized the Center for Disease control to increase screening services for women who are low-income. From July of 1991 to March of 1997, CDC's program provide mammography screening to over 500,000 women and diagnosed nearly 3,500 cases of breast cancer. During this same period, the program provided over 700,000 Pap tests and found more than 300 cases of invasive cervical cancer. This is good news for the early detection of cancers in women.  But the bad news is that all women are not getting treated for cancer. Screening does not prevent cancer deaths; it must be coupled with treatment. Congress tried to ensure that women would get treatment, by requiring that state programs seek out services for the women they screen. But wherever I've traveled in New York, I've been hearing reports that programs are over burdened. Volunteers are working over time. Program administrators are having to rely on public hospitals and charity care. Women are having to hold bake sales to get treatment. This is wrong. It's not what Congress intended when it passed the Cancer Prevention Act in 1990.  Now, a newly published study of the program documents that approaches for delivering treatment services are fragmented, and in danger of breaking down. I am very concerned, Mr. President, that the program is over burdened and needs help. The women of America need this program. Early detection saves lives. However, Mr. President, if we are unable to treat the women who are diagnosed with breast cancer, we have failed them.  I commend the local programs that are working hard to line up treatment services for women. These programs are doing whatever they can to see that women with cancer get care. But the fact is that these solutions are labor-intensive and have long-range consequences of the program itself. The CDC study shows that programs are having a hard time recruiting new providers and must limit the number of women screened. Today the program serves only 12 to 15% of all women who are eligible nationally. And this percentage is likely to decrease. The study also shows that fewer physicians will be able to offer free or reduced-fee services in the future, because of changes in the health-care system. My point is, and the study shows, that whatever fragile delivery systems for treatment are in place now are in jeopardy and overburdened. Women are not getting the treatment they need.  In June 1997, Senator Moynihan and I were successful in including an amendment in the Budget Resolution that addressed this and would have solved this problem. Unfortunately, that amendment was passed by the Senate but later died in conference. Mr. President, we must not let these women fall through the cracks any longer. This legislation provides a mechanism to fix the problem that these under served women face.  Mr. President, I began the fight in 1992 for more research funding for breast cancer. With the help of the National Breast Cancer Coalition and thewomen of New York--women like Barbara Balaban, Geri Barish, and Doctor Susan Love, Senator Harkin and I started a research program in the Army that has grown to over $750 million and continues to provide research dollars for the latest, cutting edge technologies and research.  We must not abandon the women of America who are diagnosed with breast and cervical cancer, only to find that there is no way to pay for their treatment. Congress has responded to the call for more research money for breast cancer, we must now continue that fight to provide increased treatment for every woman diagnosed with breast and cervical cancer.  The National Breast Cancer Coalition has made me very aware of the problems that women are facing regarding treatment after diagnosis under the CDC program. And I am concerned that the problem is getting worse.  We make speeches and wear pink ribbons to show our commitment to fight breast cancer--but now is the time to act to support a simple amendment that will make real contribution to the fight against breast cancer. It will save lives and ensure that women, when diagnosed through the federal program, will not have to hold bake sales to get treatment.  I join my colleagues, Senator Moynihan, Senator Snowe, and Senator Mikulski, in sponsoring legislation that will establish a mechanism for women's treatment. This is a targeted measure that will allow states the option of providing Medicaid to women who have participated in the CDC program and have been diagnosed with breast and cervical cancer. I am determined to solve this problem before Congress is adjourned this year. It is irresponsible of the federal government to do otherwise.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2017       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
