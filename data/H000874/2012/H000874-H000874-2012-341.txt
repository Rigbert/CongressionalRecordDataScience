Speaker, I rise today to commend ORBIS International, an organization that has been an outstanding member of the global community for 30 years. I am proud to recognize its invaluable service and contributions to some of the most vulnerable populations in the world.  ORBIS International is a U.S.-based global health organization dedicated to saving sight and eliminating avoidable blindness in developing countries. Created in 1982, ORBIS has conducted over 1,000 programs in 88 countries, trained over 288,000 healthcare professionals and touched the lives of 18 million children and adults. Today, we celebrate ORBIS International's 30 years of commitment to preserving and restoring sight by strengthening the capacity of local institutions in developing nations in their efforts to prevent and treat blindness.  The story of ORBIS International is a remarkable one. A grant from USAID and funds from private donors enabled ORBIS to begin its mission by successfully converting a plane into a fully functional teaching eye hospital, and in 1982 it flew to Panama on its first training mission. Today, the world's only Flying Eye Hospital visits 6-8 nations each year conducting programs, training medical personnel, and providing eye care services.  ORBIS is more than a Flying Eye Hospital with permanent programs and regional offices in the countries that have the highest prevalence of avoidable blindness. ORBIS has conducted more than 900 capacity building programs in its 30-year history. These capacity building programs were conducted through its six country and regional-based offices, the Flying Eye Hospital, and ORBIS' in-country, hospital-based training sessions.  In addition to treating a number of diseases of the eye that can cause blindness, ORBIS is also working in Africa to eliminate trachoma, one of the seven Neglected Tropical Diseases. Trachoma, an infectious disease found predominantly in developing countries, starts as an infection and progresses to corneal scarring. ORBIS International teaches surgical techniques and treatment for trachoma in Ethiopia and other developing countries.  Blindness has profound human and socioeconomic consequences. The costs of lost productivity and of rehabilitation and education of the blind constitute a significant economic burden for the individual, the family and society. Investments in avoidable blindness and visual impairment offer not only economic and social returns in global health, but they dramatically improve the quality of life of individuals and families. ORBIS International is a trusted partner in the global coalition of organizations fighting preventable blindness.  ORBIS programs and partnerships provide the skills, infrastructure and on-going support to build the capacity and skills necessary to sustain care at a local level. As a founding member of Vision 2020: The Right to Sight, a campaign led by the World Health Organization and other leading blindness prevention organizations to eliminate avoidable blindness by the year 2020, ORBIS is dedicated to working in partnership to create a world free of needless blindness.  I am honored to join ORBIS International in celebrating its 30 year commitment toward achieving its goal of a world in which no one is needlessly blind, and where quality eye care is available to everyone. I want to thank ORBIS International for the lives it has touched and its leadership in providing valuable health and training services across the globe.                          ____________________
