President, I ask to engage in a colloquy with Senator Harkin.  I thank the Senator from Iowa for his hard work as chairman of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions and, in particular, on the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act that the Senate is now considering. I appreciate Senator Harkin reaching out to me about those amendments to his bill that fall within the jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee. One of those amendments concerns the issue of synthetic drugs--a major problem that the committee has been addressing.
