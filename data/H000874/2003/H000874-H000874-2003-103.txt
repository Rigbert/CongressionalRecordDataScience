The Majority leader mentioned several conference reports that would come up next week or may come up next week. I would note that neither the Medicare prescription drug legislation nor the child tax credit legislation is on that list, but could Members be told which of those that were listed are most likely to come to the floor? I know we have had them on the list a number of times. Does the gentleman have any greater feel for which bills would be most likely to come to the floor?  I yield to the gentleman.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, of those that I listed, the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act has already been filed, so we know that we will be voting on those. And we have every reason to expect that we have a good possibility of having the military construction and Department of Interior appropriations bills come to the floor. It may be a little more difficult to get Labor HHS to the floor.  As far as Medicare and its conference, the conferees have had formal meetings, meetings with the President, informal meetings in small groups. The conference chairman, the gentleman from California (Mr. Thomas), is working nonstop to try to reach a final agreement before the end of the first session, which I hope we can conclude by the end of October.  Progress has been made, very good discussions have been held, and the future looks good for actually bringing a conference report on Medicare to the floor.  As far as the child tax credit bill, we are still having problems with the Senate accepting the fact that child tax credits should be a permanent thing and we should not raise taxes on families after a certain period of time. So, until the Senate agrees to that, I think that conference is going to have a very hard time.
