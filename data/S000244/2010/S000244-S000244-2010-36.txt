This bill would cost Wisconsinites and Wisconsin businesses. The legislation essentially puts the government in control of health care)--an industry that comprises nearly one-sixth of our economy. And, as I've repeatedly heard at dozens of my Town Hall Meetings, Wisconsinites overwhelmingly oppose this legislation.  Until the Federal Government can effectively manage Medicare and Medicaid, it shouldn't be creating a new program. Additionally, there are 27,156 seniors in Wisconsin's Fifth Congressional District who use Medicare Advantage and who would likely see reduced benefits.  And in another bad move for my State, the Senate version proposes an additional $2 billion annual tax for each of the next 10 years on medical device manufacturers. This would negatively affect good companies, such as GE Healthcare in Waukesha, Wisconsin, and hundreds of our small business suppliers. In addition to stifling innovation and hindering research and development, the added costs would hurt consumers, as anyone purchasing medical products, such as wheelchairs, or whose care includes the use of equipment, such as an MRI machine, would feel the pinch.  Making backroom deals to pass health care reform is a far cry from the transparency President Barack Obama promised. Every Wisconsinite will be affected by this legislation so they have a right to be in the know and to watch the debate unfold on C-SPAN. It's common sense that the people who elect us be included in the process.  Yes, health care needs to be reformed in our country. However, patching two pieces of horrible legislation together into one awful bill that would cost Wisconsinites more while lessening their care will not receive my support.  The bottom line is that this legislation is bad medicine that would make our health care system sicker.                          ____________________
