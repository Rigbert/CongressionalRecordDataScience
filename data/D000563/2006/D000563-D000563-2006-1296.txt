President, today I introduced this resolution, S. Res. 433, honoring the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals on the 140th Anniversary of their founding.  The dedicated employees and volunteers of the ASPCA have provided shelter, medical care, and placement for abandoned and abused animals for more than a century.  The ASPCA is the oldest animal welfare organization in North America. Henry Bergh began the organization in 1866 as a platform to prevent the cruel beating of carriage horses in New York City. Today, the ASPCA is a national organization that provides services to millions of people and their animals. The success of the organization has made the term ASPCA synonymous with ``animal rescue,'' ``animal shelter,'' ``animal adoptions'' and ``humane education.''  For over 25 years, my home State of Illinois has hosted the ASPCA's Animal Poison Control Center. The Center is staffed 24 hours a day, 365 days a year by numerous veterinarians and toxicologists who provide a unique and valuable service to pet owners and veterinarians. Each year, tens of thousands of animal lovers concerned about the health of their pets contact the Animal Poison Control Center seeking assistance on how to relieve their poisoned animals' pain and suffering. I am proud to have the Animal Poison Control Center located in the State of Illinois.  I ask my colleagues in the Senate to join me in congratulating the staff, directors and volunteers of the ASPCA on a successful 140 years of service.  The resolution (S. Res. 433) was agreed to.  The preamble was agreed to.  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:                              S. Res. 433       Whereas April 10, 2006, marks the 140th anniversary of the      founding of The American Society for the Prevention of      Cruelty to Animals (referred to in this preamble as      ``ASPCA'');       Whereas ASPCA has provided services to millions of citizens      of the United States and their animals since Henry Bergh      established the society in New York City in 1866;       Whereas ASPCA was the first humane society established in      the western hemisphere;       Whereas ASPCA teaches children the character-building      virtues of compassion, kindness, and respect for all of God's      creatures;       Whereas the dedicated directors, staff, and volunteers of      ASPCA have provided shelter, medical care, behavioral      counseling, and placement for abandoned, abused, or homeless      animals in the United States for more than a century; and       Whereas ASPCA, through its observance of April as      ``Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Month'', its Animal Poison      Control Center, and its promotion of humane animal treatment      through programs dedicated to law enforcement, education,      shelter outreach, legislative affairs, counseling, veterinary      services, and behavioral training, has provided invaluable      services to the citizens of the United States and their      animals: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That the Senate--       (1) honors The American Society for the Prevention of      Cruelty to Animals for its 140 years of service to the      citizens of the United States and their animals; and       (2) respectfully requests the Secretary of the Senate to      transmit a copy of this resolution to the president of The      American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.                          ____________________
