President, I respect the Senator who is the chairman of the Finance Committee. It is one of the toughest assignments on Capitol Hill. He has adequately described what I think is the challenge of pension plans--how to make sure companies put the money in they promised, and to keep their promise to their retirees.  What I am saying is, the approach the Senator brings to the floor, in section 808, is opposed by the retirees and workers.
