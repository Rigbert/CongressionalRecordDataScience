President, I commend the Senator from Maryland. Theissue he has spoken of is one we can address in every single State where aging infrastructure is taking its toll in terms of the public services each family and business expects. It is something we can use to our advantage by channeling the resources of this country into building and rebuilding infrastructure and creating much needed jobs.  I thank the Senator from Maryland. I am more than happy to support his efforts.                          ____________________
