S. crude oil futures to avoid U.S. regulations--in other words, go around it. Trades exceeded U.S. speculation limits every single week since 2006.  Last month, CFTC announced that it would limit this offshore market speculation and require recordkeeping and an audit trail for these traders. That is a start. But legislation is still needed to codify the regulation. This legislation will require foreign exchanges with customers in the United States to adopt the same speculation trading limits and reporting requirements that apply to U.S. trades, ending the regulatory race to the bottom. This language is based on legislation that Senator Levin and I introduced previously.  I believe very strongly that we must ensure that American energy commodities are protected from manipulation and excessive speculation, regardless of where the commodities are traded.  Bottom line, this bill brings transparency, it brings accountability, it brings recordkeeping, it brings oversight to the energy markets. It would impose sound, proven economic principles to markets that are currently broken and where speculation has increased so dramatically that it is pushing up the price. It would close regulatory and legislative loopholes that prevent the CFTC from enforcing the Commodity Exchange Act in energy commodity markets.  I hope my colleagues will support the bill. I suspect it may not pass. I hope it does because there is no question in my mind that the 800-pound gorilla in the price of gasoline at the pump is excessive speculation on commodities futures markets dealing with energy.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
