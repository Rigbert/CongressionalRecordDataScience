President, the headlines in the morning paper tell the story: America is facing a national gun crisis. Firearms are easy to come by for 6-year-olds and psychotics.  The violence is not confined to just the main streets. It is in our homes, our fast-food restaurants, and in our schools.  This amendment gives to school districts across America an opportunity to apply for help from the Department of Education for grants so they can educate the children in the school, and their parents, about how dangerous guns can be and how they should be stored safely.  It provides money for public service announcements so we can try to reduce the gun violence we read about, sadly, every single day. We know, as sure as we are here this evening, there will be another story in the newspaper in the not-too-distant future of more gun violence in schools. With the Durbin amendment, we at least start to move forward toward reducing that violence by helping schools.
