 I would like to ask the Senator from New Jersey if he would comment or reflect on the following: There are approximately 20,000 shrimpers, crab and oyster fishermen in Louisiana alone. If the $75 million in damages were dedicated only to those seafood industry workers in that one State, it would equate to roughly $3,500 per person.  I would like to ask the Senator from New Jersey, can there be any justice in that outcome; that BP would be limited in the amount they would pay out, the $75 million, when we look at the fact that there are those in similar professions in Alabama, in Mississippi, in Florida, and other States who are not even included in this calculation, if such a small amount was all that was paid to those who have clearly been directly damaged by this spill?
