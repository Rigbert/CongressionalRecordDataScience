It's not identical. There have been some changes which will be included in a manager's amendment. I will make sure that that manager's amendment is available no later than Monday. Essentially what it does is it ensures that it is consistent with the PAYGO rule that we have here in the House and it does somewhat modify it as to the tax cuts that will be effected, that will mirror the budget that was adopted by this House earlier this year. It also directs that CBO scoring be controlling so that we have a neutral arbiter, not an administration, whether it's a Democratic or Republican arbiter, as to what the costs are. Those are the major changes that I think make it more consistent with what the House's position has been in the past.
