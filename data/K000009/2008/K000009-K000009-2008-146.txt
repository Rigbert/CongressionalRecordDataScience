 of Toledo, Ohio.  It is with the deepest appreciation that I pay tribute to the long life of a good, patient, and kind man, Stanley Ronda, Jr. He lived his years in service to his family, friends, and our Toledo community. Coming from the working class and of Polish-American heritage, he graduated college in architecture in an era when that was a rare achievement for a family of their means. Stan was a path breaker.  He was always generous with his company, his conversation and his artistic creations. He greeted every person with a broad smile and a laugh. He was an engaging conversationalist and a patient teacher, too. He labored to transfer his considerable skills in calligraphy, architectural drafting, and model building to all who expressed an interest.  For decades, he worked for the City of Toledo in the Toledo Lucas County Planning Commissions, from where he retired. I can still see him bent over his light table in the Huron Building preparing the architectural and subdivision drawings for cases pending before the Commission. He reported to work every day, always wearing a white, long-sleeved shirt and held standards of military precision.  Once, when we worked together on a project, we were assigned to field check and map all of Monclova Township, Ohio. That is 16,000 acres. Stan and I worked on that for days. I hold many precious memories of Stan during that laborious effort.  Stan never asked anything for himself. He was always creating lovely-original works for others such as mailings at the holidays or special occasions. Each was carefully drawn and colored with his signature logo was at the lower left corner--a miniature version of him sitting at his drawing table. At Christmas, his logo would wear a tiny Santa hat. On his own initiative, Stan drew many beautiful renderings of landmark structures in Toledo. When I was elected to office, I commissioned Stan to do a rendering of historic churches of Toledo. He gladly accepted and this framed achievement always hangs in our Congressional office.  Though Stan became more fragile with years, he never, ever complained. He always welcomed a visitor with that same open smile. Stan revered the time he witnessed developments of downtown Toledo like the Maumee River Crossing Bridge, the new Ferry Landing, the future Marina District and the Mud Hens. He was overjoyed that day to view his hometown, to which he had dedicated his working years, building forward.  May God welcome Stan home; a good and faithful servant. May He shower him royally with blessings into eternity and bestow upon him a loving peace.                          ____________________
