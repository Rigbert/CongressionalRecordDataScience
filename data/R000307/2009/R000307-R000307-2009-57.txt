President, I rise today to offer legislation with Senator Harkin to fulfill a promise that we made over 30 years ago. We made a commitment to pay 40 percent of the excess cost of educating a special needs child. However, we have not fulfilled that promise.  Our legislation annually increases funding for Part B of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act over a 6-year period. With these increases, we will be able to fully fund Part B in 2015.  I encourage my colleagues to add their support to this needed legislation. If the Federal Government would provide its promised share of special education funding, our schools could then use any state and local funds for other educational needs, such as art and music.                                 ______                                       By
