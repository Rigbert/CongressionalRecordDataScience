President, Congress has just passed a funding measure that will prevent a shutdown at the end of this week. As headlines across the country noted as the debate over this bill played out, it was delayed partly due to partisan attacks against women's health and one provider in particular--Planned Parenthood--that were shoehorned into the debate once again.  Colleagues, this year Planned Parenthood turns 100 years old. You cannot look at the last 100 years and deny that monumental progress has been made with respect to women's health and rights--thanks to strong allies like Planned Parenthood. But that progress is what some members of this body want to roll back.  When the first Planned Parenthood opened in 1916, it was illegal for women to get information about how to prevent a pregnancy. It is not surprising that at the time, one of the leading causes of death for women in the United States was complications from pregnancy and childbirth.  From the get-go, Planned Parenthood said that women in America have a fundamental right to information about their reproductive health and access to care. It was about the right of all women to a healthy life and the pursuit of happiness.  In 1965, Planned Parenthood Connecticut fought and won the Supreme Court decision that made birth control legal for married women.  In 2010, Planned Parenthood was at the front lines of the battle, along with a lot of us here in the Senate, to ensure that birth control would be covered under the Affordable Care Act.  Today, an estimated one in five women in America has been to a Planned Parenthood clinic for care at some point in her life. Eight out of ten Planned Parenthood patients live in or near poverty. As tough as it is for them to make ends meet, Planned Parenthood is a place they can turn to for important medical care from a provider they trust.  Planned Parenthood at 100 years old has racked up some impressive points on the scoreboard. Each year Planned Parenthood provides educational programs to 1.5 million people. Planned Parenthood has doubled the number of health services it provides to men and has led the way in expanding access to health care for LGBT Americans. It has more than 650 health centers across the country and served two and a half million women and men last year.  In my home State of Oregon, more than 70,000 Oregonians are served by 11 Planned Parenthood centers. I know firsthand from visiting with Planned Parenthood officials throughout Oregon in Portland, in Lane County, in central Oregon, how important these centers are to the health care of Oregonians.  Planned Parenthood is at the heart of the revolution in women's health care over the last 100 years. It is the first place millions of American women turn to for health care--women from Portland, OR, to Portland, ME.  Here are some of the services Planned Parenthood provides: birth control and counseling; pregnancy tests; prenatal services; HIV tests; safe, legal abortion services; breast cancer screenings; HPV vaccinations; cervical cancer screenings and prevention; ovarian cancer screenings; PAP tests;exams for sexually transmitted diseases; treatment for urinary tract infections; basic physical exams; adoption referrals; family practice services; and nutrition programs.  Despite all these critical services Planned Parenthood provides, every day, legislators attack Planned Parenthood.  The fact is this crusade against Planned Parenthood is a crusade against the fundamental and constitutionally-protected right of women to make their own decisions about their bodies.  Time and time again on the Senate floor and in debates with the other side, my Democratic colleagues and I have had to beat back the attempts to defund Planned Parenthood.  Here is my bottom line colleagues. This country has made 100 years of progress on women's health, and it's not going to move backward.  I urge my colleagues to honor the commitment to women's health and rights that Planned Parenthood has shown in the last 100 years by working in a bipartisan way to improve access to women's health care, instead of limiting it.  Let us allow more women and men to access the health care they need and deserve, no matter who they are or where they live. Let us work to uphold the fundamental right of all women to make their own reproductive choices and access quality health care. Let us continue funding for Planned Parenthood and end these partisan attacks against this bedrock American health provider.  Today, I am joined by 17 of my colleagues in introducing a resolution to formally recognize Planned Parenthood's immense contributions to progress for women's health and quality of life in America. It is time to end the unfounded attacks against Planned Parenthood and allow it to continue to provide critical health services for the next 100 years.                          ____________________
