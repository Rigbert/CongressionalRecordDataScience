Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, just in reference to what the gentleman said earlier, once, when Barney Frank used to serve here, I was friendly with one of the recording clerks, and she would rate how many words per minute people could talk. Barney was faster than me. Sometimes I would be sitting here and people would say: What did he say? And I said: Oh, I can translate that. So I grew up in that era.  But, returning to this bill, this is important, and this is not the end of our reforms. As the gentleman from Louisiana pointed out, just think of it this way: We had a very rare, bizarre snow event last winter, and I had five trees fall on my house. The insurance adjuster came out and said okay. We agreed on what it would take to fix the house.  Now, imagine if that company had sent five different adjusters on different days and they all came up with different figures. The house was just finished last weekend. It took 9 months, but I would still be waiting, probably, for the repairs to start.  That is what happens to people in some of these disasters. They are still waiting for the approvals they need to go forward and do the repairs, or they got funding from one agency for emergency housing assistance and then they are being told they can't get housing assistance or they can't get their home repaired because they took that money, even though no one told them when they took that money that that was going to disqualify them from some other agency.  It has got to get straightened out. The Federal Government needs to coordinate this response, and this is just, I believe, the beginning of reforming these disaster assistance programs.  And, oh, by the way, the National Flood Insurance Program is broke, and we have got to do something about that, too, including some reforms.  Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I yield back the balance of my time.
