 President, under our order from last night, we will start today's session with a 1-hour period of morning business. At approximately 10:30 this morning, we will return to the Agriculture appropriations bill. We have an agreement in place that first-degree amendments be filed at the desk no later than 4 p.m. today. I hope that there will not be many more amendments filed. We would like to finish this bill this evening, and we will stay in session later into the evening with votes in order to accomplish that, if necessary.  We have several meetings occurring this afternoon, including an all-Senators meeting from 4 to 5 today. Because of these meetings, it is important that we get started early this morning and process as many amendments as possible.
