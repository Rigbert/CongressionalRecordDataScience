President, I want some clarification because I thought I heard the Senator say something. Is the Senator saying that if we offer a separate measure on the floor which reauthorizes the National Flood Insurance Program--and let's add in there, for example, this $8,000 home buyer credit we have talked about for more real estate closings, the extension of the home buyer credit, which was passed on the floor--and unemployment compensation as an emergency expenditure, is the Senator from Louisiana saying he would vote for that package?
