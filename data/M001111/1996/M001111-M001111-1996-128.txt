 President, I rise in strong support of the Women's Health Equity Act. I am proud to join my colleagues, Senators Snowe, Mikulski, Feinstein, and Moseley-Braun, in offering this package of 39 legislative initiatives of critical importance to the health of women and their children. Today we are sending a powerful and united message. We are more committed than ever to keeping the spotlight on the important issues surrounding women's health research, treatment and education.  There are so many worthy pieces to this bill that I won't go into each and every one separately. This bill underscores the lack of attention that has been paid to women's health issues and the many obstacles we face in getting accurate, vital information about our health, the health of our children and the health care system as it effects us.  Women face an array of unique and serious health risks. We must do more to ensure that adequate research and education programs are maintained, supported and enriched. We have much more to learn about diseases like osteoporosis, lupus, and breast cancer that devastate the lives of women across this country. And we need to continue to broaden the scope of current efforts in research into AIDS, cardiovascular disease and alcoholism to better understand how women are impacted. We must enable women to protect themselves and their daughters.  Mr. President, our bill recognizes the need for supporting this kind of research and specifically addresses all of these conditions which jeopardize the health of women. We must encourage a coordinated and committed effort from the top level of our government to make sure that women's health issues receive the attention they deserve. For too long, our concerns were ignored or given second-class status. If we continue to allow this to happen--women will die, our children will get sick, and future generations will be shortchanged of valuable information about ways to prevent health-related tragedies.  And our bill acknowledges another critical health issue which disproportionately affects women--domestic violence. The Women's Health Equity Act includes a number of provisions which seek to protect women who are victims of violence from being discriminated against when seeking health insurance. Family violence is a public health crisis which tears families apart and often prevents women, especially low-income women, from providing their children with a safe, nurturing environment in which to learn and grow.  As you know Mr. President, one of my biggest concerns as a Senator is the well being of our Nation's young people. I am proud that this bill includes provisions which encourage: adolescent health demonstration projects; eating disorders research and education initiatives; fetal alcohol syndrome research and prevention programs; and demonstration projects to prevent smoking in WIC clinics. These efforts are critical and send our young people an important message that we care about them, their health, and their futures.  I am particularly pleased that the Newborns' and Mothers' Health Protection Act was included in this act. By allowing longer hospital stays after child-birth, we will see improved health for both mother and baby. Women will receive essential information about care for their newborn and if there are any health complications, mother and baby will receive the attention they need.  Mr. President, I want to commend Senator Snowe for her leadership in coordinating this effort and for all she has done for women's health and health care. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this bill and I urge all of my colleagues to join and help move these initiatives forward. Together, we can improve the lives and health of women and children in our Nation, continue the important work we have started and celebrate the great strides we have made. I look forward to this challenge.                                 ______      By Mr. D'AMATO (for himself, Mr. Kerry, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Bryan,         Ms. Moseley-Braun, and Mrs. Murray):  S. 1800. A bill to amend the Electronic Fund Transfer Act to limit fees charged by financial institutions for the use of automatic teller machines, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.              the fair atm fees for consumers act of 1996  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Kerry and Murray as my primary cosponsor to introduce legislation to protect consumers from excessive and redundant fees imposed by automated teller machine (ATM) operators. I am also pleased that Senators Boxer, Bryan, and Moseley-Braun have joined in cosponsoring this important initiative.  Traditionally, a bank or financial institution, let's call it Integrity Bank, agrees to provide a consumer with a package of services in exchange for the use of the consumer's money. These services typically include access to an ATM network, such as MOST, CIRRUS, or PLUS, which consists of any Integrity Bank ATM's as well as ATM's operated by other banks or financial institutions. Integrity Bank and the consumer have an agreement about whether Integrity Bank will charge the consumer for using ATM's not owned by Integrity Bank. Integrity Bank, in turn, is responsible for paying the network a fee for transactions completed by its consumers on ATM's not owned by Integrity Bank.  Changes which took effect in April of this year may force the consumer to pay new fees. Until April 1, the major electronic banking networks prohibited the assessment of ATM user fees by the bank which owned the ATM. The networks have revoked this policy, opening the door to a new and outrageous practice beyond the control of Integrity Bank and its customer. Now, despite the fact that Integrity Bank pays fees to the ATM network, ATM owners and operators can now charge non-customers who use their ATM's--a service that consumers thought was included in any charges imposed by Integrity Bank--their bank.  Now many ATM users may be caught in the middle. Their own banks can continue to impose fees while the operators of the ATM's they use are entitled to ransack consumers' accounts. What is next, explicit and redundant fees for deposit envelopes? A nighttime ATM surcharge? I will refrain from offering banks any further suggestions on how to pick the pockets of American consumers.  Mr. President, this double-dipping is unfair and unconscionable. Consumers should not be charged twice for a single ATM transaction and should certainly not be charged a fee which has nothing to do with the relationship between the consumer and his or her financial institution.  Banks and other financial service providers argue that these surcharges are necessary to cover the costs of ATM operation. In-branch ATM's present minimal expense to financial institutions. How can banks argue with straight faces that surcharges are necessary to cover costs of operation?  Mr. President, the rules change which permits this extra fee was enacted only recently. While some banks have already imposed the surcharge, many others are testing the waters before they take advantage of the rule change. Congress should act before this unfair practice spreads like a wildfire.  It is hard to believe that banks are so strapped when industry profits have never been higher. For the fourth straight year in 1995, commercial banks reported record earnings. Last year, commercial banks reported profits of $48.8 billion, exceeding the previous year's record of $44.6 billion by9.4 percent. These skyrocketing earnings are primarily the result of increased interest and fee income. On top of this, commercial banks now pay nearly nothing to receive deposit insurance.  Are banks really losing money on ATM operations or is this new fee just an easy way to gouge the consumer? The U.S. Public Interest Research Group and the Center for the Responsive Law recently reported that ATM's generated $3.1 billion in transaction fees for banks in 1995. Though ATM transactions cost banks $3.2 billion, the report said, profits increased by $2.2 billion as a result of the labor savings. This new ATM surcharge is nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt to artificially inflate profits at the consumer's expense.  Banks have spent the past 20 years enticing consumers to use ATMs to reduce the need for branch offices. Banks have told regulators and the Congress that branch closings save money without decreasing service because ATM's fill the role once served by branch offices. Now it appears providing that service comes only with an added cost to the consumer and more profit for the provider.  Let me just say a few words about the impact of this fee on community banks. These banks have already agreed to pay fees to ATM networks in order to ensure that their customers have access to funds at convenient locations. Now community banks face the threat of losing customers to large banks with large ATM networks. Since community bank customers depend on other institutions' ATM's, large banks can use ATM user fees to steal community bank customers.  This moves comes at a time when some banks are charging their customers a premium for teller service. These banks justify this teller fee with claims that teller service is more expensive to provide than ATM service. Now, some banks are squeezing consumers even harder with new ATM user fees. Consumers are getting nickel-and-dimed to death and it has got to stop.  Mr. President, the bill I introduce today would prohibit user fees imposed by ATM operators. Under this bill, for example, banks would remain free to charge their own customers for using the ATM's of other banks. Other ATM owners and operators, however, would be prohibited from taking a second bite out of the consumer.  There is congressional precedent for this type of legislation. Congress originally passed legislation banning surcharges in the credit card industry in 1976 and renewed the ban twice in 1978 and 1981. In that instance, Congress prohibited retail institutions from charging consumers surcharges on their credit card purchases. To allow additional charges and fees for card use after the consumer had paid for the use of the credit card would have forced customers to pay twice and permitted some unscrupulous merchant to engage in deceptive advertising and other harmful practices. This is analogous to our current ATM situation.  I understand that some businesses that rely on retail sales through credit and ATM cards may be concerned about this bill. They need not worry. The sole purpose of this legislation is to prohibit excessive fees to ATM users. I recognize that there may be some off-site ATM's that are costly to maintain and have historically charged fees. I am willing to consider necessary accommodations to this bill. However, I will draw the line in cases where it is clear the consumer is being fleeced.
