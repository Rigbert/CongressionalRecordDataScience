 President, I want to join the majority leader and associate myself with his remarks regarding the contributions of Hazel Getty to the operation of the U.S. Senate. Hazel has overseen a remarkable advance in the technological capabilities of the Sergeant at Arms' Printing, Graphics and Direct Mail branch. We will all miss Hazel's excellent leadership and gentle nature. We wish her all the best in this next chapter of her life.                          ____________________
