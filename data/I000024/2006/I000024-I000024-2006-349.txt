We could stand up and talk about the flags of the different States. This has nothing to do with that. Yes, I have made probably five speeches on the floor in Spanish. Every time we did, I had to go up and put it down in English for the Record. I don't mind that. This has nothing to do with that. As far as there being nothing in here encouraging people, if you look at section 767, this is encouraging people and helping people to learn the English language, a concept that 90 percent of Hispanics in America want. I just hope that anyone listening realizes that these are excellent arguments, but they have nothing to do with this amendment.  I yield the floor.
