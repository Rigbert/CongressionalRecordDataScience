Speaker, in relation to the rollcall vote no. 309 on the Coast Guard Reauthorization Act, I was in a meeting in the Capitol here where the lights and bells that notify Members of the vote malfunctioned and we were unaware that the vote was taking place. Had I been here, I would have voted in the affirmative on rollcall vote 309.                          ____________________
