 President, I yield myself such time as I might consume.  I rise in support of Tom Dorr, the President's nominee for Under Secretary of Rural Development at USDA.  Tom is a fourth generation ``dirt under the fingernails'' family farmer. He has also been a small businessman and understands the demands and challenges of doing business in rural America.  Tom Dorr is a family man, having been married to Ann for 35 years.
