  We are here because we believe any hope for peace in the Middle East must begin with the complete renunciation of terrorism by the Palestinian Liberation Organization and a strong, unwavering commitment to bring such terrorism to an end.  We also believe that only with the leadership of the United States can there be a peaceful settlement and resolution of issues in the area.  For the past 18 months, as the violence of the second Intifada has increased, the United States has consistently called upon Yasser Arafat to halt the terrorism he pledged to end in the Oslo accords.  Unfortunately, Arafat has incited the violence and helped financially support the terrorists.  We now know that one of Arafat's top advisers is directly involved in financing the illegal weapons purchases and terror activities of the Al Aqsa Brigade.  We now know, according to documents seized by the Israeli Defense Forces, that Arafat was directly involved in efforts to illegally smuggle more than 50 tons of arms into Israel from Iran a few months ago.  We now know that Arafat has failed to confiscate weapons of terrorist suspects.  We know he has failed to arrest and hold suspected terrorists and is harboring suspects in the assassination of an Israeli Cabinet official in his own headquarters in Ramallah.  In fact, much of the terrorism emanates from the heart of the PLO, carried out by the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, composed of members of Arafat's own Fatah faction.  Since the beginning of the year, 209 people have been murdered and more than 1,500 injured in these suicide bombings. These are children, women, men--innocent civilians.  The Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade claimed credit for numerous of these attacks, including on March 31, central Jerusalem, killing 3 people; March 3, killing 10 people in west Jerusalem; and January 31, when the first female bomber killed an elderly Israeli.  A document seized by the Israel Defense Forces in Ramallah, signed by Arafat himself, approves funding for the Al Aqsa Brigades.  On February 3, Arafat wrote a New York Times op-ed opposing violence against Israel. Yet he declared a few days later, in Ramallah, that ``we will make the lives of the infidels Hell'' and led a chant of ``A million martyrs marching to Jerusalem!''  And this past week, while Arafat spoke out against terrorism, his wife, in Paris, said she would be proud if she had a son who became a suicide bomber.  I believe, sincerely, that this is not a leader who wants peace for his people. In fact, I believe the suicide bombings have been precisely calculated to destroy any chance for peace.  If these suicide bombers cannot be stopped, the situation is going to continue to deteriorate, Israel will have to continue to exercise its legitimate right of self-defense, and the result will be full-scale military conflagration.  Israel has done no less--and certainly no more--than what any country would do to defend itself. There has been a lamentable loss of life in the West Bank. And I grieve for it because I believe, very deeply, every life--Israeli or Palestinian--has equal value.  But let us not forget that Israel's military operation has been one based on specific intelligence information, with specific military goals--to act directly against terrorists who before the start of the operation were carrying out daily suicide bombings against Israeli civilians--and carried out with considerable restraint.  Certainly, Israel has not gone beyond what the United States and our allies have been doing in Afghanistan, or the United Kingdom in Northern Ireland, or the bloody French campaign in Algeria--let alone, what Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Iraq, or Iran do on almost a daily basis to quell dissent.  Does anyone doubt that a suicide bombing in Cairo, or Riyadh, or Damascus, or Beirut, or Paris would be met with the strongest of reactions, as was the 9-11 terrorist incident here?  There simply is no excuse for arming a teenage girl with bombs around her waist to blow up women and children. And this kind of terror is happening over and over again.  So the time is now for this Senate to stand up, in a strong, unified voice, to condemn the actions of Chairman Arafat and his PLO and the terrorism that has spawned.  Chairman Arafat has said one thing in English and another in Arabic. Chairman Arafat fans the flames and incites the people.  We offer this bill, after witnessing the failure of efforts by Messrs. Tenet, Mitchell, Zinni, and, at least initially, Secretary Powell to break the deadlock largely because Chairman Arafat has not brought to an end the suicide bombing and other acts of terrorism.  This legislation would require the President to report to Congress every 90 days, detailing the acts of terrorism engaged in by the Palestinian Liberation Organization or any of its constituent elements and, based on that report, to designate the PLO or its constituent elements as terrorist organizations, or explain why not.  The legislation also finds that Chairman Arafat and the PLO have violated his commitment to peace through the recent purchase of 50 tons of offensive weaponry from Iran; that they are responsible for the murder of hundreds of innocent Israelis and the wounding of thousands more since October 2000, and that they have been directly implicated in funding and supporting terrorists who have claimed responsibility for a number of homicide bombings inside Israel.  Because of the failure by the Palestinian Liberation Organization to renounce terrorism, the act would, A, downgrade PLO representation in the United States to before Oslo; B, place travel restrictions on senior PLO representatives at the United Nations; C, confiscate assets of PLO or Palestinian Authority or Chairman Arafat in the United States; D, deny visas to Chairman Arafat or other officials of the PLO or the Palestinian Authority.  It is important to note that the President may, on a case-by-case basis, waive this provision based on national security considerations.  The legislation presents a sense of the Senate outlining the first steps needed to reach peace. First, the United States should urge an immediate and unconditional end to all terrorist activities and commencement of a cease-fire. Two, Arafat and the PLO should turn over to Israel for detention and prosecution those wanted by the Israeli Government for the assassination of Israeli Minister of Tourism, Mr. Zeevi. Third, Arafat and the PLO should take broad and immediate action to condemn all acts of terrorism, including and especially suicide bombing, which has resulted in the murder of over 125 Israeli men, women, and children in the month of March alone and the injury of hundreds more; confiscate and destroy the infrastructure of terrorism, including weapons, bomb factories and materials, as well as end all financial support of terrorist activities; and to take positive steps to urge all Arab nations and individuals to cease funding terrorist operations and the families of terrorists.  Finally, the President of the United States, working with the international community, with Israel and the Arab States, should continue the search for a comprehensive peace in the region.  There is no question that there are serious differences to be reconciled between Israel and the Palestinian people and that only a political settlement can hopefully bring the violence in this region to an end. I believe the 1967 borders, borders which have the imprimatur of the United Nations, hold the key to a settlement. Despite serious differences about the refugee problem, ongoing security, and the status of Jerusalem, I believe peace can beachieved through negotiation and agreement. But I know it cannot be achieved through violence.  The necessary first step is the end of the violence, the terrorism, and the suicide bombing. Once that is done, we are firmly convinced that if leaders on both sides want peace, the rest can all be worked out.                                 ______                                       By
