Frankly, this is the average annual tax cut for millionaires, an annual tax cut of $89,000.  What does the President cut to provide these tax cuts? Money for schools. Under his program, the education legislation, No Child Left Behind, the schools have all the mandates for testing, for evaluation, and for improvement, but the President will not put the money on the table. This is a President who posed for those holy pictures with the leaders in education in Congress, saying he was the education President, and yet when Mitch Daniels and OMB had a chance to write a budget, they did not put the money there. It is an unfunded mandate to the States when the States are desperately in trouble. The President cannot find the money to fund education, to fund his bill, but he can find money for a tax cut for the wealthiest people in America. He has abandoned No Child Left Behind so he can embrace a tax policy of no millionaire left behind, and that to me is unforgivable.  That is the difference in the approach between the two parties, and that is the difference we need to dramatize as we talk about tax policy and spending policy in this Congress.
