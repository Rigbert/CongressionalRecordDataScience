 President, on February 12, we lost the creator of the world's most popular comic strip, Charles Schulz. The ``Peanuts'' comic strip was a daily staple for millions of people--not only in America but around the world.  While Charles Schulz' legions of fans mourn the loss of his creative genius, he was also a man with a wonderful family who cared deeply about him. I want to express my deep sympathy to his wife, Jeanne Schulz, his five children (Monte, Craig, Meredith, Amy, and Jill), his two stepchildren and 18 grandchildren. Our hearts are with you.  For half a century, the ``Peanuts'' comic-strip has been part of the fabricof our national culture. Charles Schulz' illustrations have inspired us with its wry humor and endearing cast of characters. Who has not been touched by the trials and tribulations of Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Linus, Lucy, and the rest of the Peanuts family?  Here is what some of Charles Schulz' peers had to say about his legacy.  Rob Rogers, editorial cartoonist of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, said of Charles Schulz' legacy to his profession:       Schulz revolutionized the comic strip. Not just with his      simply and accessible art style but also his strong character      development. He combined the innocence of childhood with the      cynicism of adulthood to create realistic, idiosyncratic and      empathetic icons.  Cartoonist Mort Walker, the creator of ``Beetle Bailey'' said of Schulz:       What he brought to the strips was a whole new attitude . .      . [He] brought in pathos, failure, rejection, all that stuff,      and somehow made it funny.  As one writer observed, Charlie Brown taught me     it's OK to lose. Losing doesn't mean giving up hope. No mater      how many times he missed the football, lost the big game, or      heard Lucy call him a blockhead, he still believed in      himself. This is the lesson that helped me get through      childhood and now helps me deal with the tangled kite strings      of adulthood.  Charles Schulz was born in Minneapolis, MN on November 26, 1922, and was raised in St. Paul. He acquired an interest in cartooning while a teenager, but was drafted as an army infantryman in World War II before he could fulfill his career ambition.  In 1947, Schulz started a feature in the St. Paul Pioneer Press called ``Li'l Folks.'' It was syndicated as Peanuts, launching an unprecedented 50-year run of over 18,000 comic strip installments.  At its peak, Peanuts appeared in close to 3,000 newspapers in 75 countries and was published in over 20 different languages to more than 355 million daily readers. Charles Schulz' television special, ``A Charlie Brown Christmas,'' has run for 34 consecutive years. In all, more than 60 animated specials have been created based on ``Peanuts'' characters. Four feature films, 1,400 books, and a hit Broadway musical about the ``Peanuts'' characters also have been produced.  Charles Schulz' achievements are all the more remarkable because, throughout his career, he had worked without any artistic assistants, unlike most syndicated cartoonists. Schulz painstakingly drew every line and frame in his comic strip for 50 years, and unparalleled commitment to his art and profession.  In 1994, while speaking before the National Cartoonists Society, Charles Schulz said of his comic strip, ``There's still a market for things that are clean and decent.'' Charles Schulz has given generations of children a cast of colorful characters to grow up with and to teach the small and large lessons of life.  In his farewell strip, Charles Schulz wrote, ``Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Linus, Lucy * * * how can I ever forget them * * *'' These characters will stay with us forever and we will certainly never forget their creator, Charles Schulz.  There is still something we can do for Charles Schulz and his family.  For the past several months, I have worked on legislation to award Charles Schulz the Congressional Gold Medal for his outstanding career and community service.  In fact, on Thursday, February 10, just 2 days before Charles Schulz' passing, I formally introduced the legislation to award him the Gold Medal. While Charles Schulz can no longer personally receive this honor, the posthumous award would be the proper gesture to his wife Jeanne, their children, and to the millions of ``Peanuts'' fans around the world.  As the world's preeminent cartoonist, Charles Schulz is more than qualified to join the 17 other Americans who have received the Congressional Gold Medal for their contribution to the Arts.  I urge my Senate colleagues to join me in posthumously awarding Charles Schulz the Congressional Gold Medal. This would be one small token of our nation's great appreciation of this man who gave us all so much.                          ____________________
