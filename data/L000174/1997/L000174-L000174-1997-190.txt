There has been a violent coup, if the press reports are accurate, and we have no reason to believe they are not. Members of the opposition have been assassinated. Leaders in the opposition have been murdered. This is a violent coup.  The amendment makes clear that assistance for nongovernmental organizations would be allowed to continue.  I want to make sure we don't inadvertently prevent aid from resuming if the democratically elected government is restored. But I have no doubt, in that kind of situation, that the Senator from Kentucky would want to make clear--or, if that occurred, would want to join with some of us to make clear--that such aid would continue. But this has been a very violent coup. Opposition people are being silenced or killed. And I support the intent of the amendment by the Senator from Kentucky.  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my friend from Vermont.  Madam President, if I have any time, I yield it back.
