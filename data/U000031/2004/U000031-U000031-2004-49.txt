Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the National Hunger and Homelessness Awareness Week and to pay tribute to the countless shelters and staffs throughout the country who tirelessly work to address this ever-growing problem.  Throughout our nation help is increasingly needed to create safe places for people to call home. The face of homelessness does not have an age, race, or creed. Over one million of our nation's homeless are children and families comprise of nearly 40 percent of the entire homeless population. There is no question that homelessness is a serious problem, and we must ensure that our shelters are provided with the necessary assistance.  One particular shelter that is truly making a difference is the Emergency Shelter Service Inc., of Benton Harbor, Michigan. The service, care, and opportunity that this shelter provides for the homeless folks of Southwest Michigan is tremendous.  I recently had the chance to visit with the staff and residents of the shelter. It was heartwarming to see firsthand, individuals getting back on their feet, ready to start anew. The shelter provides the helping hand that many folks need.  The nine-bedroom shelter, a 100-year old house along Pipestone Street, currently houses 35 people, many of which are children. Residents stay for a maximum of 30 days, and the shelter staff work with them to find affordable, appropriate housing.  I am pleased to report that the top floor of the house was recently insulated for the winter which will allow a few more people to have shelter during the coldest months of the year. But the unfortunate reality is that more people seek assistance than the shelter can provide for, and folks seeking a warm bed and a roof over their heads must find shelter elsewhere.  On behalf of the Sixth District of Michigan, I pay tribute to the great service of this admirable shelter. I commend the selfless efforts of Alysia Babcock and her staff who dedicate themselves to provide a safe haven for those in need. Southwest Michigan is better off for their efforts.  As we approach the holiday season, it is vitally important that our communities and cities get involved to raise awareness and work to combat the problems of hunger and homelessness. Any contribution to the Benton Harbor shelter will be greatly appreciated, whether it be a blanket, some food or even a couple of dollars. Even the smallest donation makes an impact.                          ____________________
