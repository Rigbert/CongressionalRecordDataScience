President, one of the pending amendments we will consider very shortly is by Senator Inhofe, and this would create an additional mechanism that would interrupt the bill's renewable fuels standard depending on the ratio of stocks of corn to total corn use, known as the stocks-to-use ratio.  Statistics show that stocks-to-use does not correlate to price and supply information. In addition, there is already a waiver provision in the bill that offers protection to consumers if corn prices or availability becomes unsustainable.  According to one economic analysis, the 10-percent stocks-to-use trigger required by this amendment would suppress corn prices to $2.50 to $2.60 a bushel. In the current farm bill, the target price is $2.63. So by artificially suppressing the price of corn from $2.50 to $2.60, the Inhofe amendment would put downward pressure on prices and cause the triggering of loan deficiency payments. As a result, this amendment would cost the Government more in farm payments.  I am going to urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. I understand there is a budget point of order. I have notified Senator Inhofe that I will raise that point of order at the appropriate time.  I reserve the remainder of my time.
