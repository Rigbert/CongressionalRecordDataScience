 I would be happy to talk with the Senator about it. The Senator doesn't need me to ask. You are standing next to a chairman of a powerful committee. I am a mere ranking member of a Foreign Relations Committee. So I am sure if you get him to do it, he may be able to get others to do it. I have learned, even when I was a chairman, there was not much consequence to what I did and how I was viewed. Now, as a ranking member--we all know that ranking members are people who have no power. So I would find a Republican to help you out. You have a very fine one standing next to you.
