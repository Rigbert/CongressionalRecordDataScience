 President, I see my distinguished colleague, Senator Byrd, on the floor. I ask Senator Byrd a question, if he is willing.  Is it his understanding that if we withdraw these forces and war erupts again in Kosovo, the President needs no Congressional authorization and he is preauthorized to use whatever force is necessary to bring peace and stability back to Kosovo? Is that the Senator's understanding?
