Speaker, it is with great pride that I take this opportunity to extend my congratulations to four Americans who went to Athens to compete in the 28th Olympic Games last month, and came back as Olympic medal winners. With ties to Wisconsin's Fifth District, they are: Chris Ahrens (Whitefish Bay), Paul Hamm and Morgan Hamm (Town of Waukesha), and Beezie Madden (Bayside).  Winner of the gold medal in the U.S. Men's Eight (rowing), Chris started rowing by going out with his dad to the Milwaukee Rowing Club at 6 years of age. After finishing fifth in the 2000 Olympics in the Men's Eight, Chris retired and took 3 years off. Fortunately for America, in 2003, he changed his mind and returned to the sport to represent his Nation with success.  In the sport of gymnastics, Wisconsin was represented by Olympic gold and silver medal winner Paul Hamm, and his twin brother, Morgan Hamm, a silver medalist. Growing up on a farm in Waukesha, the Hamm twins practiced on makeshift equipment--a pommel horse constructed out of a maple tree, and the upholstery of a car; rings hung up in the attic; a trampoline set up in the barn, and parallel bars made from a stairway railing. This goes to show that you don't need state of the art equipment to create champions--you need heart.  In Athens, Beezie (Elizabeth) Madden was an integral part of the U.S. equestrian team that took the silver medal in Team Jumping. Nicknamed after her great-grandmother, Beezie took her first riding lesson at the age of 3. She got her first horse as a Christmas present when she was 4, and 2 years later, she competed in her first horse show.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank all four of these athletes for representing our country with such honor, and congratulate them on their success.                          ____________________
