Chairman, as I stated, my amendment is a straightforward cut of 5 percent in Amtrak's administrative funds. I am concerned that, while this bill asks for many sacrifices on the part of blue-collar Amtrak workers, it may not make the same demands on Amtrak management.  With this need for shared sacrifice in mind, I would urge my colleagues to support the cutting of Amtrak's administrative account by a very small 5 percent, which is approximately $9 million in fiscal year 1995.  Mr. Chairman, I believe my amendment is fair. It does not ask Amtrak management to do anything beyond what Amtrak's management has asked of its workers. I urge my colleagues to support it.
