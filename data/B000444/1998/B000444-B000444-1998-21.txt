 President, I rise to take just a minute of the Senate's time to let my colleagues know of an honor that Senator Roth received from the Delaware Chapter of the Multiple Sclerosis Society.  In a gala event last night in Wilmington, Delaware, Senator Roth was honored for his achievements as a legislator and for his outstanding contributions to Delaware and to the nation. This was the Multiple Sclerosis Society's first-ever Dinner of Champions, and it is quite an honor for Senator Roth to be one of the first two individuals recognized by the organization.  The other individual recognized last evening was Richard Christopher, the President of Patterson-Schwartz Real Estate. He and his company have been sponsors of and participants in the Bike-to-the-Bay fundraising event. The DuPont Company also received an award for its decade-long support of the popular Read-a-thon program. Senator Roth was in excellent company last night.  And, fortunately, he was able to be there and accept the award in person. That is, Mr. President, one of the advantages of representing a State that is close to Washington. Senator Roth could both vote here in the Senate and still get back to Wilmington in time to receive the award. I know that was important to him.  I thank my colleagues for allowing me to take this brief time. And, I congratulate Senator Roth on his award.                          ____________________
