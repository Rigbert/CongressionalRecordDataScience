Madam Speaker, today I would like to recognize Patrick Gamble for his service to Alaska and our Nation.  A decorated Vietnam fighter pilot and now retired Four-Star General, Pat served in the United States Air Force for 34 years and distinguished himself as a decisive and capable leader. His military service first brought him to live in Alaska in 1996 as the commander of Alaska's joint military command. Like so many of us who have moved into the State, he was enchanted by the Last Frontier and has remained under its spell.  After retiring from the Air Force, he returned to Alaska as President and CEO of the Alaska Railroad, the Nation's only full service, year round scheduled passenger and freight railroad, and in my opinion, the most scenic railroad in the country. It stands as a pillar in Alaska's economy and will play a key role in the future of our great State. Through Pat's vision, the railroad has grown dramatically and promoted economic development throughout communities along the railbelt.  Pat was recently selected to replace Mark Hamilton as the President of the University of Alaska, the State's 15-campus university system which provides for the educational needs of 32,000 students every year. This new position is a continuation of many years of educational leadership, including having served as the commandant of the U.S. Air Force Academy and on the boards of five schools. In addition to ensuring a quality education, he plans to focus his efforts as university president on gaining more public support for the University of Alaska, continuing the university's strong presence in research important to Alaskans, and engaging the university in broader State economic development opportunities.  General Gamble has earned himself a reputation as a strong leader and a man of outstanding personal character. He is an excellent asset to our State, and I am proud to have this opportunity to commend his continued service to Alaska.                          ____________________
