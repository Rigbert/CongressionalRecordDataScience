 Speaker, I want to take this opportunity to share with you the attached letter, which I recently received from the Vermont Association of Hospitals and Health Systems in support of my and my colleagues' legislative efforts to enable Americans to access prescription drugs from Canada. I would like this letter included in the Congressional Record.                                            Vermont Association of                                 Hospitals and Health Systems,                                Montpelier, VT, September 29, 2003     The Honorable Bernard Sanders,     House of Representatives,     Rayburn Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Congressman Sanders: On behalf of the hospitals in      Vermont, I am writing to extend our support for your efforts      to allow for the re-importation of prescription drugs from      Canada. As you well know, access to safe, affordable      medication is an issue for many Americans. In our rural      state, patients of all ages travel to Canada to purchase FDA-     approved, less expensive medications. That option should be      available to all patients seeking more affordable      prescription drug coverage.       Our hospitals are committed to ensuring that our patients      have access to affordable, quality healthcare. We applaud      your efforts and the efforts of your colleagues on this very      important issue.           Sincerely,     Thomas Huebner,       Board Chair.     M. Betrice Grause,       President & CEO.                                 ____________________
