President, I rise today to propose an amendment to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Reauthorization bill because our nation has experienced an explosion in air travel this past decade. Air transportation is now as much a means of mass transit as automobiles and trains. Indeed, our economic good fortune and increased competition from air carriers has led to a buyer's market for passengers looking for affordable fares to countless destinations. While we are all amazed by the dramatic growth in the airline industry, we must also consider the ramifications that increased flights and aircraft noise have on the communities surrounding airport facilities.  In my home state of Rhode Island, T.F. Green State Airport, our state's only major airport, has experienced tremendous expansion over the past several years. With more than 4 million passengers flying into and out of Rhode Island each year, representing a 100 percent increase over three years ago, the number of take offs and landings has likewise climbed. This has led to intolerable noise pollution for the airport's neighbors. Of course, this problem is not isolated to Rhode Island. In fact, cities and towns across the country are dealing with similar growing pains. While T.F. Green and numerous airport authorities in our nation are taking steps to insulate homes and other structures from the effects of aircraft noise, the problem cannot be eliminated entirely. And, we must not forget that there is only so much we can do on the ground to reduce noise. We must also deal with noise at its point of origin by researching and developing quieter jet engine technology.  On December 31 of this year, the FAA will require that all civil aircraft comply with Stage 3 noise regulations. This requires that jet engines emit less noise through hushkit adaptations on older, noisier engines, or that air carriers invest in new and quieter Stage 3 compliant engines. While this is a big step in the right direction, the deadline for compliance with Stage 3 must not end progress toward quieter jet engines, but mark the beginning of Stage 4 research.  Currently, the FAA is working in cooperation and consultation with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to define Stage 4 noise levels and reach an agreement with ICAO member states on a plan for implementation of Stage 4 regulations. While this research is in its preliminary stages, our nation's aviation infrastructure must be ready to adopt Stage 4 rules to ensure quieter communities in which residents can enjoy their open spaces and where learning at schools is not interrupted every several minutes to defer to the roar of passing planes.  Mr. President, my amendment would direct the Secretary of Transportation to report to Congress no later than December 31, 2002 the findings of a study on aircraft noise problems in the United States, the status of negotiations between the FAA and ICAO on Stage 4 noise levels, and the feasibility of proceeding with development and implementation of a timetable for air carrier compliance with Stage 4 noise requirements.  This amendment will ensure that both airport authorities and air carriers are aware of developments regarding Stage 4 activities, and that we move in an expeditious and deliberate manner to maintain the momentum we have gained toward making quieter both jet engines and the communities over which they fly.                                 ______                                                         VOINOVICH AMENDMENT 1906  Mr. McCAIN (for Mr. Voinovich) proposed an amendment to the bill, S. 82, supra; as follows:       Strike section 437.                                 ______                                                 COLLINS (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 1907
