President, I am pleased today to congratulate Daniel J. Edelman, Inc., as it commemorates its 50th anniversary. Public relations firms look to Edelman as a company to follow, and I commend their work.  Since its founding in Chicago in 1952 by Daniel J. Edelman, the agency that bears his name has consistently been identified for its leadership in public relations. Edelman has received several awards, including the Golden World Award from the International Public Relations Association and the Sword of Excellence Award from the Institute of Public Relations in London.  Mr. Edelman is widely regarded in public relations circles as a leader and innovator in the development of public relations practices, standards and ethics in the United States and internationally. He has generously given his time to the Public Relations Society of America and to students seeking public relations careers. Mr. Edelman believes that public relations should be practiced in a professional manner with commitment to the highest standards. Edelman Public Relations has contributed significant time to local, national and international philanthropic causes and organizations.  I know my fellow Senators will join me in congratulating Edelman on its 50th Anniversary. I applaud this company for its dedication and extend my best wishes for the future.                          ____________________
