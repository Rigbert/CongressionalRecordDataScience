Mr. Speaker, I want to say for those who are out of order, and they are out of order, this has been going on for 3 days. Do not tell me 4 o'clock in the afternoon. The ranking member and I have been working. We have tried to figure it out. We know the danger. We know what is going to happen. So do not anybody stand in the audience and blurt out like somebody at a circus and say in fact it started at 4 o'clock this afternoon.
