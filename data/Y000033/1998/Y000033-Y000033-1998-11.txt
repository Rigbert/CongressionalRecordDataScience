Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the Speaker's table the Senate bill (S. 2129) to eliminate restrictions on the acquisition of certain land contiguous to Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.  The Clerk read the title of the Senate bill.
