President, I rise to discuss the state of home ownership in the U.S., in addition to legislation I am introducing with Senator Schumer  and Senator Edwards to enable more families to achieve the American dream of home ownership.  Today, we have many reasons to celebrate. Indeed, the national home ownership rate has soared to an all-time high of almost 67 percent, which is up from 64 percent in 1993. Of further significance, this increase has, in large measure, been fueled by the growth in home ownership among minority households. In fact, minorities were responsible for 42 percent of the increase in home ownership between 1994 and 1997, although they only account for 17 percent of the home owner population.  Despite these positive developments, a number of distressing trends should give us cause for concern. For example, minority home ownership rates still lag significantly behind those of non-minority households: 45 percent for minorities versus 72 percent for white households. In addition, only 45 percent of low-income households live in owner-occupied homes, as compared to 86 percent of high-income households.  These alarming disparities have broad societal implications because of the tremendous benefits associated with home ownership. Historically, home ownership has been the key to wealth creation in this country, and wealth in the form of home equity has enabled families to start businesses, finance their children's education, and cover unexpected expenses. Consequently, unequal home ownership rates lead to wealth disparities. In fact, the median wealth of non-elderly low income home owners is 12 times greater than the median wealth of non-elderly renters of the same income.  In addition to wealth-building, home ownership has a positive effect on families and on our communities. Indeed, research has found that children of homeowners are less likely to become involved in the justice system, drop out of school, or have children out of wedlock. Moreover, home ownership is correlated with membership in community organizations and voting, as well as participation in neighborhood enhancing activities.  In view of the substantial benefits associated with home ownership, the Federal Government has actively worked to increase the home ownership rate. The primary tools in this effort have been the mortgage interest and the real estate tax deductions. Although these tax deductions have reduced the costs of home ownership for many, they are of little use to low-income households because their itemized tax deductions generally do not exceed the standard deduction. As such, over 90 percent of the total benefits of the mortgage interest deduction accrue to home buyers with incomes greater than $40,000, and because of the progressive nature of federal income tax rates, even if lower-income households do itemize their deductions, they receive a smaller deduction as a percentage of income than more affluent buyers.  To attack the home ownership disparity between low- and upper-income households, the Federal Government has relied on the Mortgage Revenue Bond (MRB) program, the Mortgage Credit Certificate (MCC) program, and, to a limited extent, the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program. Under these programs, the Federal Government subsidizes interest rates to reduce monthly mortgage costs for low-income home owners.  While these programs have been successful, their effects have been limited. Indeed, the size of these programs, as measured by their annual cost--$2.2 billion--pales in comparison to the annual cost of the mortgage and real estate tax deductions--$58 billion.  Also, while attacking the income constraints that prevent many low-income families from being able to afford monthly mortgage costs, these programs do not address wealth constraints such as a lack of savings for a down payment and closing costs, that keep many low-income families from becoming home owners.  During these times of economic prosperity, we have a rare opportunity to close the home ownership gap that exists between low-income and upper-income families. To this end, I am introducing legislation to establish a Home Ownership Tax Credit targeted to low-income families. This legislation, which has been developed in conjunction with Harvard's Joint Center on Housing Studies, the Brookings Institution, and Self-Help Community Development Corporation, would attack the wealth and income constraints that prevent many low-income families from becoming home owners.  Under this legislation, the Federal Government would issue tax credits to participating lenders who would then be obligated to extend either low-interest or zero-interest second mortgages to low-income families. These second mortgages would effectively be used to cover the downpayment and closing costs, although a prospective home buyer would still be required to make a small contribution toward the purchase. Families could defer repayment on the second mortgage for 25 years, at which point a balloon payment would come due, or they could repay the second mortgage over 30-years, concurrent with the repayment of their first mortgage. In either event, the interest rate on the second mortgage would be subsidized, which would lower families' monthly mortgage costs. Also, these second mortgages would eliminate the need for private mortgage insurance, providing additional savings of roughly $60 per month. Under this proposal, families earning as little as $14,500 would, for the first time, have the opportunity of realizing the American dream of home ownership.  Mr. President, I believe this legislation represents a common-sense approach to addressing the home ownership disparity which exists and I would hope my colleagues can be supportive.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1336       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS; PURPOSES.       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Home      Ownership Tax Credit Act of 1999''.       (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:       (1) Home ownership is of primary importance in building      wealth in low-income families.       (2) 67 percent of the wealth that is owned by non-elderly      low-income households consists of the equity in their      residences and the median wealth of such non-elderly low-     income households is 12 times greater than the median wealth      for non-elderly renters with the same level of income.       (3) Only 45 percent of low-income households live in owner-     occupied homes, as compared to 66 percent of all households,      and 86 percent of high-income households.       (4) According to the Bureau of the Census, in 1993, 88      percent of all renters and 93 percent of renters earning less      than $20,000 could not afford a house selling for half of the      regional median house price.       (5) There is a 23 percentage point difference in home      ownership rates between central cities and suburban cities      which is largely the result of the concentration of low-     income households in central cities.       (6) The cost of the largest Federal tax incentives for home      ownership, the mortgage interest deduction and the real      estate tax deduction, is equal to approximately twice the      amount of Federal expenditures for direct Federal housing      assistance which benefits low-income households.       (7) The mortgage interest deduction and the real estate tax      deduction have little value to low-income households because      the itemized tax deductions of low-income households      generally do not exceed the standard deduction.       (8) Over 90 percent of the total benefits of the mortgage      interest deduction accrue to home buyers with incomes greater      than $40,000.       (9) Current provisions in the Federal tax code to promote      home ownership among low-income households, such as the      mortgage revenue bond program, the mortgage credit      certificate program, and the low-income housing credit, fail      to simultaneously attack the twin constraints of lack of      wealth and low income that prevent many low-income households      from becoming homeowners.       (c) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--       (1) to establish a decentralized, market-driven approach to      increasing home ownership among low-income households,       (2) to enable low-income households to overcome the wealth      and income constraints that frequently prevent such      households from becoming homeowners, and       (3) to reduce the disparities in home ownership between      low-income households and higher-income households and      between central cities and suburban cities.

State HFAs would then      auction these credits off to lenders such as banks, thrifts,      community development financial institutions, and community      development corporations. Lenders purchasing the tax credits      would commit to extending either: 1) zero-interest balloon      second mortgages that are due in 25 years or upon the sale of      the home, or 2) very low-interest rate second mortgages that      amortize in 30 years. These second mortgages would reduce the      size of the first mortgage and ultimately reduce monthly      mortgage costs. The aggregate principal amount of second      mortgages made by each lender would be equal to the price the      lender paid for the tax credits. Also, the lender would      commit to making at least 100 home ownership tax credit      loans.       The lender would receive the tax credit annually for 10      years or until the loan was paid off, whichever occurred      earlier. If a home ownership tax credit mortgage was prepaid      during the 10-year tax credit period, the lender would have      priority in the issuance of tax credits in the subsequent      year.       The lender would get its principal back when the second      mortgage amortized, balloon payment came due, or the house      was     sold. Lenders also would be able to sell the tax credit      mortgages on the secondary market with the tax credits being      transferred to secondary market investors.       Only borrowers earning up to 80 percent of the area median      income would qualify to take advantage of the home ownership      tax credit program. These second mortgages could be between      18 and 22 percent of the purchase price of the home, up to      $25,000. The second mortgage could be up to $40,000 if used      in areas formally targeted for neighborhood revitalization.       Under this proposal, families earning at little at $14,500      would be able to become home owners.       Example: The following example indicates how this proposal      would work:       A low-income family identifies a $100,000 home that it      wants to purchase. The potential home buyers would visit a      lender participating in the tax credit program. Let's assume      that the lender would agree to extend a $81,000 first      mortgage to the home buyer. Under the tax credit program, the      home buyer would only be required to make a $1,000 down      payment. Assuming that the home buyer met the eligibility      requirements of the home ownership tax credit program, the      lender would also agree to extend an $18,000 second mortgage      (In the alternative, the home buyer could get the first and      second mortgages from different lenders). Closing costs of up      to $4,000 could be financed into the second mortgage,      increasing the second mortgage amount to $22,000.       If the second mortgage was a zero-interest 25-year balloon,      the home buyer would only pay principal, interest, taxes, and      insurance on the $81,000 first mortgage for 25 years, or      until sale of the home (approximately $540/month at 7 percent      interest, plus taxes and insurance). Assuming that the home      buyer stayed in the home, at the end of 25 years, he/she      could refinance using his/her accumulated equity to repay      most or all of the $22,000 they owed on the balloon mortgage.       In sum, this proposal will allow a low-income family to      purchase a $100,000 home with a $1000 down payment and a      monthly mortgage payment of $540 (plus taxes and insurance)      throughout most of the life of the first mortgage.                                 ______                                       By
