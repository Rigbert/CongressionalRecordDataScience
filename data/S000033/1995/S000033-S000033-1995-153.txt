 Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me.  Mr. Speaker, the rule that we have before us could very well begin the process of ending the funding for the National Endowment for the Arts. I stand in complete opposition to the rule and to the bill.  Mr. Speaker, let us get our priorities straight and let us try to understand what this country is supposed to stand for. Art and culture are a vital part of human existence. The opportunity to enjoy the arts, to enjoy culture, must be open to all of our people, and not just those who can afford $100 for a concert ticket.  Mr. Speaker, the United States spends only 64 cents per person to support the arts endowment, 64 cents, 50 times less than our major allies. In contrast, we spend over $1,000 per person on the military, far more than our allies. Why is it that this Congress can lower taxes on the wealthiest people in America, do away with taxes for the largest corporations in America, but eliminate programs which bring art and culture into classrooms in the State of Vermont and all over this country? Why is it that this Congress can pour billions of dollars more into B-2 bombers that the Pentagon tells us that do not need, but we cut back on funding for symphony orchestras and threater groups all over America?  Mr. Speaker, I would remind our colleagues that one B-2 bomber costs $1.5 billion, 10 times the entire allocation for the National Endowment for the Arts. The entire endowment is 10 percent of one B-2 bomber, a B-2 bomber that the Pentagon tells us they do not need.  Mr. Speaker, where are our priorities? Let us speak up for the kids in this country. Let us speak up for all of the people who appreciate the arts, who appreciate culture. Let us defeat this rule.
