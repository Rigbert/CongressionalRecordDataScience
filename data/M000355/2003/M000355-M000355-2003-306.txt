 President, I certainly concur with my friend from Vermont. We hope to finish this bill today. We believe we can. There are not a large number of amendments on each side.  With regard to Senator Feinstein's amendment, we are taking a look at that now and hope to be able to react soon about moving that one forward as well. If everyone would share our view that it might be desirable to finish this bill today, the way to get that done is to talk to Senator Leahy and myself about amendments. We are open for business and would love to sit down with Members and talk about their amendments.
