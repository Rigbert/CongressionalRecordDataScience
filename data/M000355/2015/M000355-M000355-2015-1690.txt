 President, the Senate is waiting for House action onthe DHS funding issue, and while that is occurring, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate stand in recess subject to the call of the Chair.  There being no objection, the Senate, at 2:10 p.m., recessed subject to the call of the Chair and reassembled at 8:19 p.m. when called to order by the Presiding Officer (Mrs. Capito).                          ____________________
