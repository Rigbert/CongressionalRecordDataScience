Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to our country, state and community are exceptional. We have been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent to make their communities, and country, a better place to live and work. Jack Wyatt is one of these individuals. Jack's many accomplishments are wide ranging, as he has made his mark as a successful businessman, a decorated member of the military and an active supporter of the community. On February 4, 2014, Jack will be honored by the Riverside County Board of Supervisors for all he has done.  Jack is the true definition of an American patriot and hero. A 35 year veteran, Jack represented his country proudly, serving in four theaters of war during his long career. He has truly seen it all, being shot down, and eventually rescued, while in Vietnam. It is no surprise that he holds commendations from five former United State's Presidents. Jack has since retired as a Captain in the Navy Reserve, though his advice and expertise remain highly sought after. In the early 1990's Jack turned down an Admiralship in Washington D.C., as it meant that he would have to move from his beloved city of Corona, California, out east to the Pentagon.  From 2000 to 2001, Jack was assigned to lead a special project by the Navy's Chief of Information, Thomas Jurkowski, in conjunction with his tasking by the Secretary of the Navy, Richard Danzig, and Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld. The project, ``Vision 21,'' was created to develop a ``lessons learned'' program following Operation Desert Storm and Operation Allied Force. Due to the success of the program, Jack and many members of his team were awarded the Meritorious Service Medal. More recently, Jack became an advisor to the United States Secretary of the Navy on strategy planning, international affairs, and policy, and also served as Public Affairs Advisor to the Commander of the Naval Reserve Force of Western Region, San Diego.  Not only has Jack served his country proudly, he has also contributed to his community's economic and developmental growth. After retiring from active duty, Jack began a long career, spanning 28 years, with Southern California Edison. His focus in management and public policy development garnered the company increased success. Jack went on to become Regional Director for the Inland Empire from 1985 to 1999, and his responsibility covered three counties and 56 cities, with an annual revenue base of $3.5 billion dollars.  With his influence and knowledge of the industry, Jack took a leap of faith and started his own company, Strategic Connections, Inc. (SCI) in 1999. This organization of professionals and specialists advises executives and public officials on a wide array of utility issues including service, leadership and strategy. With Jack's guidance, the company has grown to be a leader in the industry within Southern California.  I have come to know Jack well through many years working together on a variety of projects in California. I can personally attest to his incredible work-ethic, professionalism, and positive attitude. In light of all Jack has done for Southern California and our country, it is only fitting that he be honored by the Board of Supervisors for his more than 30 years of dedicated commitment to our community. Jack's honorable service and tireless passion for public service has contributed immensely to the betterment of our country, state and community. I am proud to call him a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many individuals are grateful for his service and salute him on this great milestone.                          ____________________
