Speaker, as we celebrate the birth of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and reflect on his life and work, we are reminded of the challenges that democracy poses to us and the delicate nature of liberty. Dr. King's life and, unfortunately, his untimely death remind us that we must continually fight to secure and protect our freedoms. Dr. King, in his courage to act, his willingness to meet challenges, and his ability to achieve, embodied all that is good and true in the battle for liberty.  The spirit of Dr. King lives on in the citizens of communities throughout our Nation. It lives on in the people whose actions reflect the spirit of resolve and achievement that will help move our country into the future. In particular, several distinguished individuals from Indiana's First Congressional District will be recognized during the 27th Annual Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Breakfast on Monday, January 16, 2006, at the Genesis Center in Gary, Indiana. The Gary Frontiers Service Club, founded in 1952, sponsors this annual memorial breakfast.  This year the Gary Frontiers Club will pay tribute to five local individuals who, for decades, have unselfishly contributed to improving the human condition of others in the City of Gary. Those individuals who will be recognized as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Marchers at this year's breakfast include: Reverend Norman L. Hariston Sr., who is retired and a member of St. John Baptist Church; Dr. Alfonso D. Holliday II, a semi-retired physician who served Gary residents and is now a consultant; Roosevelt Haywood Jr., activist and former Gary City Councilman; Willie Kuykendall, a 1960's voting activist; and Cherrie B. White, a retired activist, will receive the 2006 Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drum Major Award.  The late Mrs. Rosa Louise Parks will become the only person to receive a Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Honorary Drum Major Award for her single courageous act of dignified defiance on December 1, 1955, which set in motion the Modern Civil Rights Movement.  Though very different in nature, the achievement of all these individuals reflect many of the same attributes that Dr. King possessed as well as the values he advocated. Like Dr. King, these individuals saw challenges and rose to the occasion. Each one of the honored guests' greatness has been found in their willingness to serve with ``a heart full of grace and a soul generated by love.'' They set laudable goals, and they worked hard to achieve them.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in commending the Gary Frontiers Service Club:President Floyd Donaldson, Breakfast Chairman Oliver Gilliam, Breakfast Co-Chairman Clorius L. Lay, Master of Ceremonies Alfred Hammond, Melvin Ward, and all other members of the service club for their initiative, determination, and dedication to making Northwest Indiana a better place for all who live and work there.                          ____________________
