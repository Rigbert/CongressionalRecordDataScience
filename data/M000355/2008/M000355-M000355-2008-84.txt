 President, we talked about this a couple of times before the August break. I know he is concerned because this bill has frequently been targeted for nongermane amendments. I can recall that, as recently as last year, a nongermane amendment was offered by a member of the majority and actually adopted and became a complication in trying to complete the legislation.  I say to the Senator from Virginia, I don't know what is possible. I just got in from the airport. I will meet with the Republican leadership later this afternoon to discuss with our colleagues what we might be able to achieve. I am certainly open to trying to move the measure along. I will consult with everybody on our side to see whether that is possible.
