Speaker, those who are watching might be puzzled, because it does not seem there are too many Members on the floor of the House, and that is because the House has completed its work day. It is about 3 o'clock. Now, why is the House out of session at 3 o'clock when it has yet to do a single appropriations bill, when many other important measures and needs of the American people have yet to be met?  Well, it could be because tonight is the biggest fundraising gala, perhaps the largest single fundraising event in the history of the United States. Downtown, the Republican Party is holding a special fundraising event, and the chair, the fundraising chair of that event is a guy named Robert Ingram.  Why is that relevant? Well, he happens to be the chief operating officer of GlaxoSmithKline, which happens to be the largest drug manufacturing pharmaceutical firm in the world.  Now, why would he give $250,000 and agree to raise millions of other dollars from other pharmaceutical companies who are also contributing: Pfizer, Eli Lilly, Bayer AG, Merck & Company, they are cheapskates, they are only ponying up 50,000 bucks each for a table, but then PhRMA, their organization, is ponying up $250,000.  Now, you have to give it to the Republicans. I mean they, the Republican leadership, either has the most incredible sense of irony and humor, or no shame. Here we are at a time when we are supposedly about to consider legislation to provide or not provide a meaningful prescription drug benefit to seniors in the United States of America, 54 percent of whom pay more than $1,000 a year out of pocket for their drugs; who are charged the highest prices of any customers of the pharmaceutical companies; the uninsured seniors are charged the highest price, prices that exceed those of Canada by 100 percent and other developed nations. Of course, many of those drugs were manufactured in the United States by these very same firms who are throwing this big gala tonight and contributing millions to the Republican Party.  So we have to wonder if there is any connection between the draft of the Republican proposal and the timing of it, because they are considering it right now, and tonight's event.  The Republican proposal is a free market approach. Of course, we have had the free market; it has not been serving our seniors very well, and prescription drug costs have been going up at 2\1/2\ times the rate of inflation. Many seniors have to make critical decisions about getting their prescriptions filled. I have actually met seniors, couples who had to decide who was going to get their prescription one month and who was not, even though they are all necessary and prescribed. These are real problems.  The Republicans have decided they cannot ignore this issue anymore, sothey have gone to their sponsors, the pharmaceutical companies, the insurance companies, who say, look, how about we phony up a bill that continues the status quo and we pretend it is a new benefit for seniors, and the pharmaceutical companies love it. That is why they are giving a quarter of a million bucks from this one company and millions in addition to that at tonight's gala.  There is no guaranteed benefit under the Republican plan. Mr. Speaker, $20 billion over 10 years would go to the pharmaceutical companies as an inducement for them to offer free market, private policies. God forbid we should extend Medicare. They do not want to do that. No, they are very worried about that, because they know if we extend a Medicare benefit to the seniors, then we might begin to question the absolutely obscene prices they are charging for some of their drugs and we might even take steps to rein in those costs like Canada, Great Britain, France, Italy, Spain, Mexico. In fact, every other industrialized country on Earth has taken steps to rein in their obscene pharmaceutical charges. No, but not the United States. We are going to take a free market approach. First give them the $20 billion as an incentive to maybe offer a program and under this ``maybe'' program, this is what the Republicans estimate they would provide, a benefit that would total, of the first $1,000 of drug expenses, which is half the seniors in America spend $1,000, they would get a $182 benefit after their premium, their deductibles, and their out-of-pocket costs.  Wow. Wow, $182. Now, that is really going to help out the seniors who are having trouble today meeting these costs. Of course, remember, this is only recommended. It is not required. God forbid we should put a mandate on the insurance companies. No, no, no, no, no requirement. This is just a suggestion, a suggestion, as opposed to a real Medicare benefit that the Democrats are providing as an alternative. The emperor has no clothes here. Have a good fundraising dinner tonight, guys, but I think in the end the champagne you are toasting tonight might taste like vinegar.                          ____________________
