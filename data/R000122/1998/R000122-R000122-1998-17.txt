 I applaud all the consumer protections that the Senator from Utah has listed, but I would like to add one more. I would like to add, along with the Consumers Union and the Consumer Federation of America, the protection of looking at the good-faith operation of a creditor who is demanding that a debtor be placed from chapter 7 into chapter 13.  With respect to the standard, my standard is as equally well defined as the bad-faith standard that exists today within the legislation, because good faith and bad faith are something that the banking judge should be able to determine, and it does not require an elaborate searching through of underwriting policies and looking through documentation and going around the country.  What it does require is that that trier of fact, that bankruptcy judge, determine whether or not the creditor has abused the relationship, either by intimidation or deceit. All these things would rise to the level of a lack of good faith. I suggest very strongly the bankruptcy judge can do that, and should do that in this context.  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Illinois.
