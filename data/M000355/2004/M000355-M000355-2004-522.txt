 BOND. I am happy to yield to the assistant leader.  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Missouri, it is not actually the first time this has happened. It has become, actually, repetitious. They prevented us from going to conference on the CARE Act, the Bankruptcy Act, the Workforce Investment Act, the Patients Safety Act, not to mention the Transportation bill. So there is a pattern, I would say to my friend from Missouri, which is that the minority is saying to the majority of the Senate and to the majority in the House: You make the bill exactly the way we want it or we won't let the legislative process go forward. Complete stalemate.
