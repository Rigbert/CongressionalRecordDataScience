Chairman, I claim time in opposition, although I am not opposed to the amendment.  The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 minutes.  There was no objection.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  In the base bill, we have included measures to encourage States to build smart or right-size projects for practical design, and this amendment complements those efforts.  Specifically, it mentions the use of geosynthetic materials, which the Federal Highway Administration has been promoting to speed up and reduce the cost of bridge construction as part of its Every Day Counts initiative.  Use of geosynthetic fabrics to reinforce soil can reduce erosion at the point where bridge and road meet, which reduces maintenance costs and provides environmental benefits.  All of these approaches help ensure that we are able to stretch the limited dollars we have to make meaningful improvements to our roads and bridges. It is a meritorious amendment by the gentleman. I urge my colleagues to support it.  I yield back the balance of my time.
