Does the leader believe that the budget conference report is a necessary piece of legislation for us to pass before we leave? I know you mentioned that you might want to try to do that, but does your side believe that is necessary before we leave next week?  Mr. DeLAY. If the gentleman would yield, I have not personally consulted with the Speaker or the rest of the leadership, but it is my own understanding that the conference report on the budget is as important as doing the supplemental. But the word that I have is things are progressing with that conference report. There are very few issues to resolve, and we have the greatest expectation that that conference report will be on the floor sometime next week and will not slow down our ability to go into the Easter break.
