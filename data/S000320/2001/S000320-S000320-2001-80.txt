 President, I rise today to introduce legislation that would reduce the capital gains tax for properties held for more than five or ten years. Such legislation is needed to help increase investment and to decrease inefficient economic behavior.  Under current law, people holding capital property are often discouraged from selling their property because of the large anticipated tax liability. Such a ``lock-in'' of assets is economically undesirable. Economists have estimated that perhaps as much as 7.5 trillion dollars are ``locked-in'' the portfolios of American taxpayers. By reducing the tax on certain long term capital gains, we would decrease the ``lock-in'' effect and allow investors to liquidate or hold capital assets based on market factors rather than the tax code.  Opponents to lower taxation of capital gains argue that reducing capital gains tax rates would result in a revenue shortfall. Such an argument fails to recognize the effect that reduced taxes will have on investment behavior. By lowering taxes on capital gains, we will encourage, rather than discourage, capital investment. I believe the resulting situation would be a rise in the number of investment transactions and in the amount of gain realized in each taxable year which will in turn lead to an increase in tax revenue. This trend has been well-documented as evidenced by the fact that every capital gains tax reduction in the last forty years has resulted in increased federal revenue. In addition to increasing federal revenue, a cut in the capital gain tax rates would benefit individual states, as a vast majority of them also tax capital gains.  The current capital gains tax dissuades investment and economic growth. By lowering the capital gains tax rates, my bill would help lower the cost of capital and spur economic growth. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of the bill. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 302       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. REDUCTION IN MAXIMUM CAPITAL GAIN RATES FOR 5-YEAR                    AND 10-YEAR GAINS.       (a) In General.--Paragraph (2) of section 1(h) of the      Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to maximum capital      gains rate) is amended to read as follows:       ``(2) Reduced capital gain rates for qualified 5-year and      10-year gain.--       ``(A) Reduction in 10-percent rate.--In the case of any      taxable year beginning after December 31, 2001, the rate      under paragraph (1)(B) shall be--       ``(i) 8 percent with respect to so much of the amount to      which the 10-percent rate would otherwise apply as does not      exceed qualified 5-year gain,       ``(ii) 5 percent with respect to so much of the amount to      which the 10-percent rate would otherwise apply as does not      exceed qualified 10-year gain, and       ``(iii) 10 percent with respect to the remainder of such      amount.       ``(B) Reduction in 20-percent rate.--The rate under      paragraph (1)(C) shall be--       ``(i) 10 percent with respect to so much of the amount to      which the 20-percent rate would otherwise apply as does not      exceed the lesser of--       ``(I) the excess of qualified 5-year gain over the amount      of such gain taken into account under subparagraph (A) of      this paragraph, or       ``(II) the amount of qualified 5-year gain (determined by      taking into account only property the holding period for      which begins after December 31, 2001),       ``(ii) 5 percent with respect to so much of the amount to      which the 20-percent rate would otherwise apply as does not      exceed the lesser of--       ``(I) the excess of qualified 10-year gain over the amount      of such gain taken into account under subparagraph (A) of      this paragraph, or       ``(II) the amount of qualified 10-year gain (determined by      taking into account only property the holding period for      which begins after December 31, 2001), and       ``(iii) 20 percent with respect to the remainder of such      amount.

(b) Qualified 5-year and 10-year Gain.--Paragraph (9) of      section 1(h) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended      to read as follows:       ``(9) Qualified 5-year and 10-year gain.--For purposes of      this subsection--       ``(A) Qualified 5-year gain.--The term `qualified 5-year      gain' means the aggregate long-term capital gain from      property held for more than 5 years but not more than 10      years.       ``(B) Qualified 10-year gain.--The term `qualified 10-year      gain' means the aggregate long-term capital gain from      property held for more than 10 years.       ``(C) Determination of gain.--The determination under      subparagraph (A) or (B) shall be made without regard to      collectibles gain, gain described in paragraph (7)(A)(i), and      section 1202 gain.''.
