Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mikel Ryan for his contribution to the national defense and economic health of the United States. Mr. Ryan has displayed outstanding leadership in a wide ranging civil service career that culminated as Chairman of the Department of Defense Range Commander's Council Frequency Management Group.  Mr. Ryan received a B.A. in telecommunications from the University of Northern Colorado in 1981, and has done graduate work in telecommunications at Colorado State University.  On August 26, 1997, Mr. Mikel Ryan completed his 2-year tenure as Chairman of the Department of the Defense Range Commander's Council Frequency Management Group [FMG]. Under Mr. Ryan's leadership, the FMG greatly enhanced its role assisting the development of national spectrum policy that affects the test range spectrum requirements and issues to senior level DOD personnel. In addition, he enhanced the links between the DOD and the civil aerospace industry, a key component of the national economy. Mr. Ryan's leadership of the FMG minimized negative effects of recent losses of Federal spectrum access on the entire DOD test range structure.  Currently, Mr. Ryan heads the Mid-Atlantic Area Frequency Coordination Office at the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division at Patuxent River, MD. He is responsible for frequency management for the entire division. Mr. Ryan is also the executive coordinator for the automated spectrum planning, engineering, coordination, and tracking system. This system is the frequency management software with over 2,300 users worldwide.  Mr. Ryan has over 23 years of experience in the U.S. Government in communications. He joined the U.S. Army in October 1973, and served as a paratrooper/radioman in the 82d Airborne Division for 3 years. After earning his special forces qualification in September 1977, Mr. Ryan served as a senior communications sergeant on an operational detachment in the 19th Special Forces Group Airborne, Aurora CO. In August 1982, Mr. Ryan joined the 11th Special Forces Group Airborne.  Mr. Ryan's greatest contribution has been his exceptional leadership and support to the entire spectrum of the Nation's wide variety of policies, including support for the test and operation of highly complex National defense systems, and the civil aerospace industry. He has played a key role in assuring that there is spectrum available to support the test and operation of highly complex National defense systems, and the economic health of the United States. Thanks in large part to Mr. Ryan's diligence and committed hours of persistent and effective coordination, the National Test Range spectrum requirements has become an integral part of the daily defense operations. His support for defense and economic health will have a long lasting impact. Mr. Ryan's development of new range policies and increased cooperation is the cornerstone of a growing 21st century.  The United States is indeed indebted to Mr. Mikel Ryan for his selfless and distinguished service. Mr. Ryan, your outstanding leadership and ceaseless efforts have laid a solid foundation for the development of range policies. We offer our thanks and appreciation for a job well done and wish you continued success in the future.                          ____________________
