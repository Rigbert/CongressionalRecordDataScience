 My colleague and I, Senator Collins from Maine, will be here all day working our way through any amendments that our Members have to offer. We encourage Members to come to the floor and let us know what those are so we can get this done in a timely fashion.  Madam President, I believe, under the previous order, Senator Portman is here to offer his amendment, and I yield to him at this time.
