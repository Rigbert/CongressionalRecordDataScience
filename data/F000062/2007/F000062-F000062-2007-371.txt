 President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Texas for her support on this. I think we are both alike in that we say wherever there is threat and risk and vulnerability, that is where the money should go. If it is the State of Texas, that is fine with me. If it is the State of California, that is fine. If it is New York, Florida, Connecticut or Maine--wherever the threat and risk is--that is where the money should go. It is clear to me that the big States have felt very aggrieved. Big States with big landmarks, big ports, big oil and petroleum reserves and that kind of thing, feel definitely that they don't get the money they need to provide the protection they need. To that end, on March 5, I received and Senator Cornyn received a letter signed by Governor Schwarzenegger of California, Governor Spitzer of New York, Governor Crist of Florida, and Governor Perry of Texas.  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                    March 5, 2007.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     Hon. John Cornyn,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein and Senator Cornyn: We are writing      to thank you for your leadership in working to assure that      Department of Homeland Security (DHS) counterterrorism grant      programs recognize the homeland security needs of the United      States. Any effective strategy to secure our nation must      apply risk-based analyses to manage the threat from      terrorism. We believe that the Homeland Security FORWARD      Funding Act of 2007 will provide much needed changes to these      programs by better recognizing the risks and vulnerabilities      faced by larger states such as California, New York, Florida,      and Texas.       We support the efforts of your bill to build a coordinated      and comprehensive system to maximize the use of federal      resources and to provide clear lines of authority and      communication. Your bill will further the efforts of DHS,      cities, counties and state agencies as they continue to work      together to detect, deter and respond to terrorism.      Specifically, we appreciate the following provisions of the      bill:       Follows the 9/11 Commission Report recommendation to better      allocate federal resources based on vulnerabilities;       Analyzes risks, threats, vulnerability, and consequences      related to potential terrorist attacks; current programs do      not give full consideration to our states' urban population      centers, numerous critical infrastructure assets, hundreds of      miles ofcoastland, maritime ports, and large international      borders;       Reduces the ``small state'' minimum from 0.75% to 0.25%,      providing each state a baseline award while allocating an      increased level of funds based on risk; the current base +      per capita method allocates a disproportionate share of funds      to states with small populations;       Continues the Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Program      and exempts the program from the base percentage, allocating      all funds based on risk;       Maintains the Emergency Management Performance Grant      program as a separate program focused on capacity building      for all-hazards preparedness, response, recovery and      mitigation;       Continues the central role of states, building on existing      systems that effectively coordinate planning efforts and      ensure accountability;       Allows for limited regional applications from previously-     designated UASI cities or other urban areas with at least a      population of at least 500,000;       Retains the central role of states as the administrative      agent for the grants to ensure regional applications are      consistent with statewide plans; and       Recognizes the importance of national standards for      evaluating the ``essential capabilities'' needed by state and      local governments to respond to threats.       Your continued support for improving the nation's ability      to detect and deter and coordinate responses to terrorist      events is appreciated.           Sincerely,     Arnold Schwarzenegger.     Charlie Crist.     Eliot Spitzer.     Rick Perry.
