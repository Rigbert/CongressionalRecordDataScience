Located in Aroostook County, our State's northernmost region, Madawaska is in the heart of the St. John River Valley, the center of our rich Acadian culture. I am honored to celebrate the generations of industrious and caring people who have made Madawaska such a wonderful place to live, work, and raise families.  Madawaska has a fascinating history. For thousands of years, the St. John River Valley has been the home of the Maliseet Tribe. French explorers, led by Samuel de Champlain, first visited the area in 1604 and established friendly relationships with the Native Americans.  In 1785, French-speaking Canadians fleeing persecution in British Canada journeyed up the St. John River in search of liberty. They marked the spot of their landing with a large wooden cross in gratitude for the safe haven they had found. Today, the rebuilt Acadian Cross is an enduring reminder of the determination and courage of those first settlers. The Tante Blanche Museum honors the heroism and compassion of Marguerite Blanche Thibodeau Cyr, who fed the hungry and cared for the sick during a famine in 1797.  The Maliseets often provided vital assistance during the first difficult years. From fertile soil, vast forests, and their own hard work, the settlers created a prosperous community that laid the foundation for the vibrant Acadian culture that is so important in Maine, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and as far away as Louisiana.  Following the American Revolution, the region was the scene of a decades-long border dispute between our new Nation and British Canada. Although the bloodless Aroostook War did not result in armed conflict, it was a period of great tension and uncertainty, with both sides seeking control of the increasingly valuable timberlands. As the national governments of Great Britain and the United States negotiated a peaceful resolution, the province of New Brunswick laid claim to the disputed area. On July 4, 1827, a band of pro-American settlers declared the independence of the Republic of Madawaska with its own flag and the intention of joining the United States.  In response, the Maine Legislature established the Territory of Madawaska in 1831, creating what was called the world's biggest town, with an area of more than 4,000 square miles. The border dispute was settled by treaty in 1842. Peace was maintained between the United States and Canada. Settlement to the region increase greatly, and in 1869, the town of Madawaska was incorporate.  Today, more than 80 percent of the town's residents speak French, and they continue to uphold the Acadian traditions of great food, music, and dance, and of close-knit families and lasting friendships. The annual Acadian Festival in August is a highlight of the year and a funfilled celebration of this great heritage.  To my Franco-American friends, it is a pleasure to congratulate you on this landmark anniversary. Across the generations, you have worked hard and worked together to create a community that combines your rich heritage with the values that define our State and our Nation.  Mr. President, the celebration of Madawaska's 150th anniversary is not merely about the passing of time, it is about human accomplishment. We celebrate the people who pulled together, cared for one another, and built a great community. =========================== NOTE ===========================     On page S5192, July 30, 2019, first column, the following appears: Mr. President, the celebration of Madawaska's 15th anniversary is not merely about the passing of time, it is about human accomplishment.
