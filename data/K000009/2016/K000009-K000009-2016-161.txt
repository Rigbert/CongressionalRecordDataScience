Speaker, I rise today to proudly submit the Urban Agriculture Production Act of 2016.  Across America, too many urban neighborhoods are absent stores where community members can purchase fresh, healthy foods. More than 23 million individuals reside in these so called ``food desert'' neighborhoods, where no stores are located within one mile in which they can buy healthy food.  Without accessible healthy options, all that is available and affordable is unhealthy, processed, junk-food. The Urban Agriculture Production Act is a step to correct this unacceptable trend.  I am pleased to recognize and support the growing resurgence of locally grown and produced product happening across our great country. I see it in my own community at the Sustainable Local Foods and the Toledo Grows Community Garden.  Individuals, non-profits, and co-ops have stepped up to take action to address the challenge of access to healthy food, and developed local food sources and community gardens to provide fresh, affordable produce throughout underserved communities. Not only are they growing product to provide to communities, they are also engaging and encouraging community participation throughout the stages of growth and production.  They are reconnecting community members to Mother Earth and how to farm in the process.  As the ancient proverb says, ``give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.'' And so goes my bill, the Urban Agriculture Production Act.  The measure will encourage economic development in underserved communities by furthering the mission of local farming. It provides programmatic funds to educate people on health and wellness, supports marketing and development networks, and will inspire communities to create self sufficient food production systems to stimulate community development and healthy eating options.  Throughout our urban and suburban communities there is an abundance of unused land and space conveniently located to neighborhoods that is ripe for agriculture development. We must support and encourage the means to development these plots so they become local sources of wholesome food options.  My bill will spur the development and expansion of community agriculture in nontraditional agricultural production areas across this great nation.  Mr. Speaker, urban and suburban farming and food production is a viable solution to support healthier dietary options and improve overall health of communities. The Urban Agriculture Production Act is the appropriate means to further develop alternative, more urban agricultural production and to help meet all communities' food production needs of the future.                          ____________________
