Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Military Construction Appropriations Act of Fiscal Year 1999 (H.R. 4059).  I am particularly pleased the House and Senate authorizing and appropriating committees have listened closely to the case I have been making for many years on behalf of funding the P-208 Lakehurst Aircraft Platform Interface (API) laboratory, and they are now responding.  I also want to extend my thanks to the support extended to the API lab by the Chairman of the Military Appropriations Subcommittee, Ron Packard, and on the Senate side, by my New Jersey colleague, Senator Frank Lautenberg. It is very encouraging to see that the report language contained in the House and Senate versions of H.R. 4059 have survived and are included in the final product tonight. As a result, H.R. 4059 includes directive report language that earmarks $1.65 million in planning and design funds to be used to begin designing the P-208 Lakehurst API lab project.  At my urging, the House reaffirmed its support for the P-208 project in the report accompanying H.R. 3616, the Fiscal Year 1999 Defense Authorization Act, and now Congress is specifically appropriating the funds to adequately finance the planning and design of the P-208 API lab.  I also want to commend the Navy for moving forward with this vital project in an expeditious manner. The Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC), in response to one of my inquiries, has informed me that on May 22, 1998, the Navy issued the necessary authorization to begin the planning and design of those military construction projects listed for fiscal year 2000, which includes the Lakehurst API lab. The only questions remaining now are how many square feet the facility will have and what it will look like.  Mr. Speaker, today is a very good day for America, for naval aviation, and for the people of the 4th Congressional District. It has been a long, grueling fight to successfully get the Lakehurst API consolidation project to this point, and the battle is by no means over. However, in the end, our Navy pilots and carrier crew will be able to operate more safely, more efficiently, and more effectively because of the improvements that will be brought about by the P-208 API lab project.                          ____________________
