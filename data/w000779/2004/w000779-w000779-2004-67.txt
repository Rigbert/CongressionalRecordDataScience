President, to respond very briefly, we pay for it as essentially outlined in the President's budget. According to OMB and the Treasury Department, we would close the loophole that would save taxpayers approximately $5.7 trillion over 10 years. That is the way we pay for the program. The people who are going to be eligible for the program are going to get the same opportunities as those in the manufacturing sector, the same number of weeks.  The Senator from Oklahoma has talked about unemployment compensation. This is about retraining people. This is about health care benefits.  If you think we are doing enough today when 5 percent of the people get access to the health care program, then I guess that is a rationale for voting against this amendment. I would hope the bipartisan work that has been done on this legislation by myself, Senator Coleman, Senator Brownback, Senator Snowe, and Senator Baucus would warrant the support of our colleagues.
