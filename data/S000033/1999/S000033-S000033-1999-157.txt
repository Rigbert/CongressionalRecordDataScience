 Chairman, it seems to me that in light of these instances, and many more which I have not gone into, there is no reason why this body should not pass this conservative, simple amendment.  We are calling for, as part of this to the amendment, a study of these three specific events; and we are also requesting recommendations from the intelligence community as to how these catastrophes could be avoided in the future.  So that is what this to the amendment does. It says level fund; and, second of all, we want some accountability on the part of the intelligence agency.
