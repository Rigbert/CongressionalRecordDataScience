Speaker, I submit three letters for printing in the Congressional Record: one from the CTIA, another from APCO, and the remaining one from the National Emergency Number Association in support of the legislation.               Cellular Telecommunications & Internet Association,                             Washington, DC, October 27, 2003.     Hon. Billy Tauzin,     Chairman,     Hon. John Dingell,     Ranking Member,     Committee on Energy and Commerce,     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Tauzin and Congressman Dingell: On behalf of      the Cellular Telecommunications & Internet Association      (CTIA), I would like to express our support for H.R. 2898,      the E9-1-1 Implementation Act of 2003. CTIA represents more      than 400 member companies, including both wireless carriers      and manufacturers of wireless telecommunications equipment.       Once in place, E9-1-1 location technology will speed      delivery of emergency services to people in need.      Unfortunately, too often, states and localities have diverted      E9-1-1 funds collected by carries from wireless consumers to      fund unrelated activities. This legislation will protect E9-     1-1 funds while simultaneously strengthening statewide      coordination and cooperation among local phone companies,      wireless carriers, and public safety. The wireless industry      has made important strides in developing and implementing E9-     1-1 location technology. H.R. 2898 will help ensure that      states and localities develop the necessary ``best      practices'' to efficiently and effectively deploy location      technology.       The wireless industry remains committed to implementing      this vital technology and applauds your leadership on this      important issue.           Sincerely,     Steven K. Berry.                                  ____                                         National Emergency Number                                                  Association,                                 Washington, DC, October 27, 2003.     Hon. John Shimkus,     Hon. Anna Eshoo,     House of Representatives,     Washington, DC.       Dear Representatives Shimkus and Eshoo: Those of us in the      public safety community have long championed the belief that      a robust nationwide Enhanced 9-1-1 (E9-1-1) system for      wireless telephone calls is one of the most important      components of a nationwide plan to promote national security      and public safety. The accomplishment of this goal requires      close coordination among public safety officials, the      communications industry, and relevant government officials.       On behalf of the National Emergency Number Association      (NENA), and our 7,000 members, we applaud your leadership,      initiative and co-sponsorship of H.R. 2898, the ``E9-1-1      Implementation Act of 2003.'' We further support your      leadership, by endorsing H.R. 2898 and the need for national      legislation to provide additional funding for state and local      government implementation of E9-1-1 across the nation.       In supporting H.R. 2898, we seek priority of our nation's      9-1-1 system. And as a national priority, we must stop the      improper siphoning of public funds that have been set aside      to upgrade the 9-1-1 system. Equally we must provide      additional assistance from the federal government to complete      the implementation of E9-1-1. Enabling our 9-1-1 system to      locate a caller in an emergency is fundamental to our      nation's homeland security, defense and response capabilities      in the 21st Century.       While there is much to applaud in the many ongoing efforts      to implement E9-1-1, the goal of E9-1-1 ``anywhere and      everywhere'' remains elusive. For this reason, we strongly      encourage and support a greater role from the federal      government to provide resources, leadership and expectations      to ensure a fully functional E9-1-1 system today; and well      into the future.       Again, we thank you for your leadership and urge the      Congress to take steps to improve our nation's 9-1-1 system.                                                   Richard Taylor,     President.                                  ____                                           APCO International,                              Daytona Beach, FL, October 27, 2003.     Hon. W.J. Tauzin,     Chairman, Energy and Commerce Committee,     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Tauzin: I am writing to reiterate our strong      support for H.R. 2898, the ``E9-1-1 Implementation Act of      2003.'' The bill will provide a critical source of funding to      help state and local governments to implement technology to      locate 9-1-1 emergency calls from wireless telephones.       FCC regulations currently require wireless telephone      companies to implement technology to locate 9-1-1 calls.      Without that capability, emergency first responders may be      unable to find emergencies in time to save lives and      property, especially where those reporting the emergency are      unable to identify accurately their exact location.       State and local government emergency communications      centers, known as ``Public Safety Answering Points'' or      ``PSAPs'' must upgrade their operations to receive and      process location information from wireless phones.      Unfortunately, many jurisdictions lack the resources to make      those upgrades, and other funding sources are often      insufficient. H.R. 2898 would establish a modest, but      critical source of additional funding for this life-saving      technology.       APCO is the nation's oldest and largest public safety      communications organization. Most of APCO's over 16,000      members are involved in the management and operation of      communications systems for state and local government police,      fire, EMS and other public safety agencies. APCO hopes that      Congress will move quickly to adopt this important      legislation.           Sincerely,                                                    Vincent Stile,                                                        President.  Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Shimkus), the author of the bill.  (
