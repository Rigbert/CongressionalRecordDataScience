 President, I rise today to introduce the Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act of 2011.  Introducing this bill today is bittersweet. As my colleagues know, we have been working to pass this bill for almost a decade now. But for all those years it was one of our dearest colleagues, Senator Ted Kennedy, who stood before this body to introduce the legislation.  We certainly miss Senator Kennedy's leadership, his passion, his dedication and his political skill.  But as I stand here today to introduce the Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act, I know that he would be proud to see the continued work and support for this bill.  Today, I am joined by Senator Collins, Senator Reed of Rhode Island and Senator Boxer as original cosponsors of this legislation.  It is my hope that in this Congress we can make some positive changes in this important area.  Let me start by explaining what the Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act does.  The Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act directs the Food and Drug Administration to regulate the misuse of antibiotics in agriculture. It requires drug companies and producers to demonstrate that they are using antibiotics to treat clinically diagnosable diseases in farm animals. It requires that companies defend the process of adding gross amounts of antibiotics to the feed and water of livestock and it requires them to prove that this practice does not contribute to antibiotic-resistance among humans.  Unfortunately, it has become a common practice in industrial agriculture to use antibiotics for ``growth promotion.'' This practice allows for animals kept in cramped quarters to grow artificially fast, and artificially fat.  The most concerning part is that the low doses of antibiotics fed to these animals breed antibiotic resistant pathogens. These pathogens make their way into our food, our water, and our communities.  Antibiotic resistance is one of the most significant public health challenges facing us today, and numerous peer-reviewed studies have concluded that the overuse of antibiotics in animal agriculture is making the problem worse.  A recent study published in the medical journal Clinical Infectious Diseases found that nearly 50 percent of grocery store meat was contaminated with antibiotic resistant pathogens. Even more concerning, 25 percent of all meat was contaminated with pathogens that were resistant to three or more types of antibiotics.  I have heard for years that antibiotics were the closest thing to a ``silver bullet'' in human medicine. But today, tens of thousands of people in the U.S. die each year from antibiotic resistant infections. So unfortunately we are learning the hard way that these precious, life saving drugs no longer work as well as they once did.  Antibiotic resistance is a real and growing problem, and its causes are man-made.  As our use of antimicrobial drugs has increased, so has the ability of bacteria to withstand their effects. The only way to preserve the effectiveness of antibiotics is to use them responsibly.  In human medicine, this means that doctors must use better discretion when prescribing antibiotics. As patients, we must do our part and finish the prescriptions given to us.  But antibiotics are also used in animal medicine, so veterinarians and farmers must also ensure that antibiotics are used responsibly.  I was surprised to learn that the Union of Concerned Scientists estimates that 84 percent of all antibiotic usage in this country is in animals such as chickens, pigs, and cattle. Even more surprising is the vast majority of antibiotic consumption by livestock is by animals that show no clinical signs of illness.  This type of treatment, referred to by doctors and veterinarians as non-therapeutic, creates the perfect breeding ground for antibiotic resistant bacteria. Unlike therapeutic doses of medicine that are prescribed when we, or any other animal gets sick, non-therapeutic doses of antibiotics are routinely added to the food or water of livestock that are not ill.  These doses are not large enough, or powerful enough, to eliminate all the bacteria inside their bodies. Instead, the small dose of antibiotics only kills off the weakest bacteria; leaving the strongest, most resistant bacteria behind to reproduce.  Recognizing the impending health crisis, some have taken dramatic action. In 1998, Denmark became the first country to ban the routine use of antibiotics in the food and water of livestock. The entire European Union followed suit in 2006. Australia, New Zealand, Chile, Korea, Thailand, the Philippines, and Japan have also implemented full or partial bans on non-therapeutic uses of antibiotics.  But the majority of producers in the U.S. have not followed suit; and it is time for a wakeup call.  That is why I am reintroducing the Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act. This legislation implements a precautionary principle when it comes to using antibiotics and requires that producers and drug companies affirmatively demonstrate that the non-therapeutic antibiotics in livestock production do not contribute to the incidence of antibiotic resistant infections in humans.  Put simply, if growth promoting antibiotics can't be used safely, they shouldn't be used at all.  The real strength of this legislation is that it takes an incremental approach. The new regulations regarding antibiotic use under PAMTA would only apply to the limited number of antibiotics that are critical to human health and are used non-therapeutically.  This means that any drug not used in human medicine is left untouched by this legislation.  PAMTA also preserves the ability of farmers to use all available antibiotics to treat sick animals.  By focusing on only the most egregious misuses of medically important antibiotics, PAMTA tackles the problem of antibiotic resistance where we know we can make the most difference.  I understand that some question the need for this legislation; they say that there is no evidence that antibiotic use in agriculture leads to infections in humans.  Unfortunately they are wrong.  Rear Admiral Ali S. Khan, MD, MPH, Assistant Surgeon General and Director of the Office of Public Health Preparedness and Response at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently testified in front of the House Energy Committee that ``studies related to Salmonella as both a human and animal pathogen, including many studies in the United States, have demonstrated that use of antibiotic agents in food animals results in antibiotic resistant bacteria in food animals, resistant bacteria are present in the food supply and are transmitted to humans, and resistant bacterial infections result in adverse human health consequences, e.g., increased hospitalization.  Doctor Joshua Sharfstein, Principal Deputy Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration also testified at the hearing and agreed with Rear Admiral Khan. The FDA, he said, ``supports the conclusion that using medically important antimicrobial drugs for production purposes is not in the interest of protecting and promoting the public health.''  Quantitative evidence from the EU and Canada also support these conclusions. In response to public health concerns about the rise of cephalosporin, an antibiotic, resistance in Salmonella and E. coli, chicken hatcheries in Quebec voluntarily stopped using the drug in February 2005. Following the ban, the public health agency of Canada reported a dramatic 89 percent decrease in the incidence of resistant salmonella in chicken meat and 77 percent decrease in related human infections. Once the drug was partially reintroduced in 2007, antibiotic resistant infections in people jumped back up 50 percent.  Unfortunately we are fighting an uphill battle with antibiotic resistant infections. Our tools and resources are diminishing even while the number and severity of these infections are increasing.  One example is Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, MRSA infections in 1974 accounted for only two percent of the total number of staph infections; in 1995 it was 22 percent; and by 2004 it was 63 percent.  CDC estimates that by 2005, there were 94,360 MRSA infections in the United States. Tragically, about 19,000 of them, 20 percent, were fatal because MRSA is nearly immune to almost every antibiotic used in modern medicine.  By comparison, in 2005 there were 17,011 deaths due to AIDS; so the scope and consequence of this problem is stunning.  Of course not all MRSA is derived from the overuse of antibiotics on the farm. Many infections are acquired in the hospital, and it is believed that these bacteria became resistant to antibiotics due to the misuse of drugs in human medicine.  But MRSA is also infecting individuals who have not been in a hospital setting.  There is strong evidence that at least one strain of MRSA infecting people iscoming directly from livestock. This strain, known as ST398, has been shown to disproportionately infect farmers and their families. Like all MRSA, ST398 is resistant to the antibiotics methicillin and oxacillin. But resistance to other antibiotics is also common among ST398 strains, which makes treatment especially challenging.  A recent study by the CDC in December 2009 showed that hospital acquired strains of MRSA and community acquired MRSA strains such as ST398 are trending in opposite directions.  The study found that community acquired MRSA, a type of MRSA that did not emerge in the hospital setting and is not contracted there, increased 700 percent between 1999 and 2006.  By contrast, hospital acquired MRSA cases declined roughly 10 percent over this same time period.  Over the past decade, it has become clear that MRSA is not just a problem for hospital administrators. More and more individuals are acquiring this devastating infection in their homes, at their gyms or in restaurants.  While it is exceedingly difficult to determine the exact extent that antibiotic use in agriculture influences individual MRSA cases, we know for certain that statistical evidence overwhelmingly suggests that a reduction of antibiotic use in agriculture will result in a reduction of highly resistant MRSA cases.  Since the Union of Concerned Scientists estimates that as much as 84 percent of all antibiotic usage in this country is in veterinary medicine, one can reasonably conclude that a reduction of antibiotic use in agriculture will result in a reduction of highly resistant MRSA cases.  The reason I am so committed to this legislation is that a reduction in highly resistant infections will save lives. One of my constituents shared a truly heartbreaking story.  The Don family, from Ramona, California, is a tight knit family. They are active in the community, and loved by their neighbors. Until recently, like most happy, healthy families, antibiotic resistant infections just wasn't a subject that came up much.  So when Mr. and Mrs. Don sent their son Carlos off to sixth grade camp in 2007, they never expected that an antibiotic resistant infection would change their lives.  Carlos was the picture of health. He was a bright, vibrant, athletic 12-year old, who loved to play football.  When he returned home from camp, he had a 104 degree fever and could barely walk. It was the sickest his parents had ever seen him.  When Carlos didn't get better the next day, they took him to Urgent Care. He was given a dose of antibiotics that the doctors said would knock the bug out in a few days.  But the drugs didn't work.  The next day Carlos was in even worse shape and he had to be rushed to the hospital by an ambulance. His new doctors put him on every single antibiotic the hospital had to offer.  Even at the extremely high levels prescribed to Carlos, the drugs still didn't work.  It took doctors 48 hours to find and acquire an antibiotic that was strong enough to kill the infection.  By that time Carlos' lungs, kidneys, liver, intestines and heart had all failed.  The only thing left, doctors told his parents, was his brain. The doctors said that Carlos knew his body was failing and that he was in a fight for his life.  It pains me to say that this story does not have a happy ending. Carlos lost his life because the antibiotics that we have relied on for 80 years didn't work.  No parents should ever have to undergo the heartbreak and the tragedy that the Dons went through in 2007.  Their son was as healthy and happy as any 12-year-old could be, but he was cruelly taken away from them because of a disease that we could not fight.  I believe that with this bill we have an opportunity to prevent other families from suffering from this same tragic story.  There are some who believe this legislation may actually make our food supply less safe. Their argument is that antibiotics keep our animals healthy, and healthy animals make for healthy food.  But research shows us that these concerns are misguided. Over 375 public, consumer, and environmental health groups including the American Medical Association, the American Public Health Association, and the Infectious Diseases Society of America, support the legislation because they believe that reducing antibiotic use in agriculture will protect the health and safety of Americans.  It is not just health groups that support this approach. The fact is that farmers and meat producers can keep their animals healthy without adding hundreds of pounds of antibiotics to the food and water of their animals.  In Denmark, one of the world's largest exporters of pork, producers have made modest changes to their husbandry practices and reduced overall antibiotic use by over 50 percent. Pork production has grown, and other animal health indicators such as litter size and average daily weight gain have improved.  In Iowa, hog farmers like Paul Willis and Jude Becker have shown that antibiotic-free production is possible in the heartland of America too.  In California, companies like Niman Ranch in Alameda have proved that Beef, Pork, Poultry and Lamb can be produced profitably in America on a large scale without the routine use of antibiotics. In fact, fast-food chain Chipotle Mexican Grill has grown a highly successful business based on meats raised without antibiotics, much of it supplied by Niman Ranch.  This bipartisan bill makes incremental changes to ensure that our actions on the farm do not negatively impact the health and well being of our farmers, their families, and every one of us who consumes the food they produce.  I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass these critical reforms.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1211       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Preservation of Antibiotics      for Medical Treatment Act of 2011''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       The Congress finds the following:       (1) In January 2001, a Federal interagency task force--       (A) released an action plan to address the continuing      decline in effectiveness of antibiotics against common      bacterial infections, referred to as antibiotic resistance;       (B) determined that antibiotic resistance is a growing      menace to all people and poses a serious threat to public      health; and       (C) cautioned that if current trends continue, treatments      for common infections will become increasingly limited and      expensive, and, in some cases, nonexistent.       (2) Antibiotic resistance, resulting in a reduced number of      effective antibiotics, may significantly impair the ability      of the United States to respond to terrorist attacks      involving bacterial infections or a large influx of      hospitalized patients.       (3)(A) Any overuse or misuse of antibiotics contributes to      the spread of antibiotic resistance, whether in human      medicine or in agriculture.       (B) Recognizing the public health threat caused by      antibiotic resistance, Congress took several steps to curb      antibiotic overuse in human medicine through amendments to      the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 201 et seq.) made by      section 102 of the Public Health Threats and Emergencies Act      (Public Law 106-505, title I; 114 Stat. 2315), but has not      yet addressed antibiotic overuse in agriculture.       (4) In a March 2003 report, the National Academy of      Sciences stated that--       (A) a decrease in antimicrobial use in human medicine alone      will have little effect on the current situation; and       (B) substantial efforts must be made to decrease      inappropriate overuse in animals and agriculture.       (5) In 2010, the FDA determined that--       (A) 1,300,000 kilograms of antibacterial drugs were sold      for use on food animals in the United States in 2009;       (B) 3,300,000 kilograms of antibacterial drugs were used      for human health in 2009; and       (C) therefore, 80 percent of antibacterial drugs      disseminated in the United States in 2009 were sold for use      on food animals, rather than being used for human health.       (6)(A) Large-scale, voluntary surveys by the Department of      Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service in      1999, 2001, and 2006 revealed that--       (i) 84 percent of grower-finisher swine farms, 83 percent      of cattle feedlots, and 84 percent of sheep farms administer     antimicrobials in the feed or water for health or growth      promotion reasons; and       (ii) many of the antimicrobials identified are identical or      closely related to drugs used in human medicine, including      tetracyclines, macrolides, Bacitracin, penicillins, and      sulfonamides; and       (B) these drugs are used in people to treat serious      diseases such as pneumonia, scarlet fever, rheumatic fever,      venereal disease, skin infections, and even pandemics like      malaria and plague, as well as bioterrorism agents like      smallpox and anthrax.       (7) Many scientific studies confirm that the nontherapeutic      use of antibiotics in agricultural animals contributes to the      development of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections in      people.       (8) The periodical entitled ``Clinical Infectious      Diseases'' published a report in June 2002, that--       (A) was based on a 2-year review by experts in human and      veterinary medicine, public health, microbiology,      biostatistics, and risk analysis, of more than 500 scientific      studies on the human health impacts of antimicrobial use in      agriculture; and       (B) recommended that antimicrobial agents should no longer      be used in agriculture in the absence of disease, but should      be limited to therapy for diseased individual animals and      prophylaxis when disease is documented in a herd or flock.       (9) The United States Geological Survey reported in March      2002 that--       (A) antibiotics were present in 48 percent of the streams      tested nationwide; and       (B) almost half of the tested streams were downstream from      agricultural operations.       (10) An April 1999 study by the General Accounting Office      concluded that resistant strains of 3 microorganisms that      cause food-borne illness or disease in humans (Salmonella,      Campylobacter, and E. coli) are linked to the use of      antibiotics in animals.       (11) Epidemiological research has shown that resistant      Salmonella and Campylobacter infections are associated with      increased numbers of ill patients and bloodstream infections,      and increased death.       (12) In 2010, the peer-reviewed journal Molecular Cell      published a study demonstrating that low-dosage use of      antibiotics causes a dramatic increase in genetic mutation,      raising new concerns about the agricultural practice of using      low-dosage antibiotics in order to stimulate growth promotion      and routinely prevent disease in unhealthy conditions.       (13)(A) In January 2003, Consumer Reports published test      results on poultry products bought in grocery stores      nationwide showing disturbingly high levels of Campylobacter      and Salmonella bacteria that were resistant to the      antibiotics used to treat food-borne illnesses.       (B) The Food and Drug Administration's National      Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System routinely finds      that retail meat products are contaminated with bacteria      (including the foodborne pathogens Campylobacter and      Salmonella) that are resistant to antibiotics important in      human medicine.       (C) In December 2007, the USDA issued a fact sheet on the      recently recognized link between antimicrobial drug use in      animals and Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureas      (MRSA) infections in humans.       (14) In October 2001, the New England Journal of Medicine      published an editorial urging a ban on nontherapeutic use of      medically important antibiotics in animals.       (15)(A) In 1998, the National Academy of Sciences noted      that antibiotic-resistant bacteria generate a minimum of      $4,000,000,000 to $5,000,000,000 in costs to United States      society and individuals yearly.       (B) In 2009, Cook County Hospital and the Alliance for      Prudent Use of Antibiotics estimated that the total health      care cost of antibiotic resistant infections in the United      States was between $16,600,000,000 and $26,000,000,000      annually.       (16) The American Medical Association, the American Public      Health Association, the National Association of County and      City Health Officials, and the National Campaign for      Sustainable Agriculture are among the more than 300      organizations representing health, consumer, agricultural,      environmental, humane, and other interests that have      supported enactment of legislation to phase out      nontherapeutic use in farm animals of medically important      antibiotics.       (17) In 2010, the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration      testified that the Danish ban of the non-therapeutic use of      antibiotics in food animal production resulted in a marked      reduction in antimicrobial resistance in multiple bacterial      species, including Campylobacter and Enterococci.       (18) In 2009, the Congressional Research Service concluded      that restrictions overseas on the use of antimicrobial drugs      in the production of livestock could impact U.S. export      markets for livestock and poultry.       (19) The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C.      301 et seq.)--       (A) requires that all drugs be shown to be safe before the      drugs are approved; and       (B) places the burden on manufacturers to account for      health consequences and prove safety.       (20)(A) The Food and Drug Administration recently modified      the drug approval process for antibiotics to recognize the      development of resistant bacteria as an important aspect of      safety, but most antibiotics currently used in animal      production systems for nontherapeutic purposes were approved      before the Food and Drug Administration began considering      resistance during the drug-approval process.       (B) The Food and Drug Administration has not established a      schedule for reviewing those existing approvals.       (21) Certain non-routine uses of antibiotics in animal      agriculture are legitimate to prevent animal disease.       (22) An April 2004 study by the General Accounting Office--       (A) concluded that Federal agencies do not collect the      critical data on antibiotic use in animals that they need to      support research on human health risks; and       (B) recommends that the Department of Agriculture and the      Department of Health and Human Services develop and implement      a plan to collect data on antibiotic use in animals.     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.       The purpose of this Act is to preserve the effectiveness of      medically important antibiotics used in the treatment of      human and animal diseases by reviewing the safety of certain      antibiotics for nontherapeutic purposes in food-producing      animals.     SEC. 4. PROOF OF SAFETY OF CRITICAL ANTIMICROBIAL ANIMAL                    DRUGS.       (a) Definitions.--Section 201 of the Federal Food, Drug,      and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321) is amended by adding at the      end the following:       ``(ss) Critical Antimicrobial Animal Drug.--The term      `critical antimicrobial animal drug' means a drug that--       ``(1) is intended for use in food-producing animals; and       ``(2) is composed wholly or partly of--       ``(A) any kind of penicillin, tetracycline, macrolide,      lincosamide, streptogramin, aminoglycoside, or sulfonamide;      or       ``(B) any other drug or derivative of a drug that is used      in humans or intended for use in humans to treat or prevent      disease or infection caused by microorganisms.       ``(tt) Nontherapeutic Use.--The term `nontherapeutic use',      with respect to a critical antimicrobial animal drug, means      any use of the drug as a feed or water additive for an animal      in the absence of any clinical sign of disease in the animal      for growth promotion, feed efficiency, weight gain, routine      disease prevention, or other routine purpose.''.       (b) Applications Pending or Submitted After Enactment.--     Section 512(d)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act      (21 U.S.C. 360b(d)(1)) is amended--       (1) in the first sentence--       (A) in subparagraph (H), by striking ``or'' at the end;       (B) in subparagraph (I), by inserting ``or'' at the end;      and       (C) by inserting after subparagraph (I) the following:       ``(J) with respect to a critical antimicrobial animal drug      or a drug of the same chemical class as a critical      antimicrobial animal drug, the applicant has failed to      demonstrate that there is a reasonable certainty of no harm      to human health due to the development of antimicrobial      resistance that is attributable, in whole or in part, to the      nontherapeutic use of the drug;''; and       (2) in the second sentence, by striking ``(A) through (I)''      and inserting ``(A) through (J)''.
