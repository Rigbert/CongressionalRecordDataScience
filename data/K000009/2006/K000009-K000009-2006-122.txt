Chairman, I just want to say this may be the first year America imports more food than she exports. This is not just a problem inside the borders of the United States. We have to keep our agriculture alive in this country, and it is becoming more and more difficult every year because of what is happening in the global economy and subsidies that are out there in other countries. Thank you for yielding.
