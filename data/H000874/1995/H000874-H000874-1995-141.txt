 Mr. Speaker, if I could ask the gentleman, the gentleman indicates that the 7-year Balanced Budget Reconciliation Act of 1995, H.R. 2491, will be considered next week. Our conferees have not heard anything about a conference. Could you apprise us on this side of the aisle when a conference might occur on this legislation?
