 All over my State, people will gather to recognize the sacrifice and service of military families and veterans throughout history.  It is a day set aside to bring people together, to learn from and support each other and to celebrate the families who serve on the home front while their wives, husbands, sons, daughters, and parents serve on the front lines.  America's military is the strongest in the world, and they draw their strength from families back home. Yet far too frequently, the sacrifices and dedication of military families have gone unacknowledged and unappreciated.  That is why Oregon will be proudly recognizing military families on this inaugural Military Families Appreciation Day.  In our Nation's recent history, millions of servicemembers have been placed in harm's way for our country, standing watch as freedom's guardian. But families, too, have stood watch at home, facing their own challenges, all too often alone.  Military families sacrifice so much--they are patriots cloaked in a quiet strength and they make all the difference to the success of each mission. They have faced the special challenges of long and repeated deployments, separations from loved ones, and frequent relocations with great courage and resolve. In doing so, their selfless dedication has directly contributed to the mission readiness of our soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, Coast Guardsmen, and Merchant Marines.  So to every military family, I want to offer a nation's thanks.  For the times you have stood and watched a ship sail from the harbor, an aircraft disappear into the clouds, or a bus convoy pull out of sight, not sure when your loved one would return, we thank you.  For the anniversaries, birthdays, and holidays you have celebrated alone, we thank you.  For the helping hand you have extended to other military families when there was need--truly creating a military family--we thank you.  A country is not strong because of its armed services alone, rather the armed services draw strength from the civilians who support them. With military families setting a superior example of devotion, courage, and commitment, America will always be a nation of strength.                          ____________________
