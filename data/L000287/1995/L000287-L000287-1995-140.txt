Mr. Speaker, not even the Speaker of the House agrees. His choice of a Historian for this House is unfit to serve. There is no room in this House for bigotry, racism, or anti-Semitism. I commend the Speaker for realizing his error, acting quickly, and firing his appointment.  The operation of this House, the recording of its history, should be nonpartisan. The House Administrator, the House Historian, these appointments should be made with the best interests of this House in mind, not the Speaker, not the Speaker or one political party.  Last week the American people were promised a new openness, a new way of doing business. But so far it looks like business as usual.  Mr. Speaker, this is not a Republican House, this is not a Democratic House. This is the people's House. Mr. Speaker, the people deserve better.                          ____________________
