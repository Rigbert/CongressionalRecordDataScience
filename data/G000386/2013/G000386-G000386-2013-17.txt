 President, today, I am announcing my intention to object to any unanimous consent request to call up and confirm the nomination of Mr. Jeh Johnson to be the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.  As ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I, along with other Senators on the committee, wrote a letter to Mr. Johnson last Friday and asked his views on a number of important matters, including our Nation's immigration policies and the fair treatment of whistleblowers. We asked if he would cooperate with us on oversight matters and work with us to improve immigration policies going forward. We have not yet received a response from Mr. Johnson.  Because the Judiciary Committee has primary responsibility over immigration matters, it is necessary to know any nominee's position on immigration policies before we can consent to the confirmation of a Secretary to head this very critical department. So, until we receive responses from Mr. Johnson to our letter, I will object to any unanimous consent agreement to move his confirmation.  I ask that a copy of the letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                      U.S. Senate,                                   Committee on the Judiciary,                                Washington, DC, November 15, 2013.     Mr. Jeh Johnson,     2001 K Street NW.,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Johnson: As members of the Senate Judiciary      Committee, we have an important responsibility to conduct      oversight of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which      has a broad and critical mission and houses several different      agencies with varying functions. Our committee has primary      responsibility over immigration matters, and we believe it      necessary to know any nominee's position on immigration      policies before we can consent to the confirmation of a      Secretary to head this very critical department We also seek      your commitment in cooperating on oversight matters and      working with us to improve immigration policies going      forward.       At your confirmation hearing, you stated that, ``[i]f      confirmed, I will work to implement all legislation enacted      into law.'' While we may have different views than President      Obama on how to reform our immigration system, we have all      repeatedly expressed our strong disapproval of the refusal of      this administration--and DHS in particular--to enforce our      immigration laws, contradicting duly enacted federal law      through administrative orders and internal memoranda. These      actions have eroded the rule of law and undermined Americans'      confidence in their government. We hope that you will commit      to discontinuing these lawless policies if confirmed.       So that we may properly carry out our constitutional duty,      we request that you provide answers to the questions below on      the important issues that you will confront if confirmed as      Secretary of DHS.                                General       1. In what ways, if any, would you depart from former      Secretary Napolitano's policies?       2. Do you find any of former Secretary Napolitano's      actions, or any current DHS policies, to be objectionable? If      so, what? What would you do differently?       3. Will you pledge to cooperate with congressional      oversight efforts and be responsive to all congressional      requests for information in a timely manner?       4. Do you believe whistleblowers who know of problems with      matters of national security should be prevented from      bringing that information to Congress?       5. Will you commit to ensuring that every whistleblower is      treated fairly and that those who retaliate against      whistleblowers are held accountable?       6. Given your past involvement in President Obama's      political campaigns, how would you maintain your independence      from the White House as one of our nation's top law      enforcement officers?                              Immigration       1. If confirmed as the head of the Department, you will be      responsible for the enforcement of the country's immigration      laws. Do you have any background or leadership experience in      the area of immigration law or immigration policy?       2. If confirmed, it will be your job to implement our      nation's immigration laws. In your testimony before the      Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee,      you stated that you support ``comprehensive, common-sense      immigration reform.'' Accordingly, we would like to know your      position regarding the following:       a. Should people here illegally be eligible for immigration      benefits, including legal status? If so, should those      individuals be responsible for all costs associated with it?      Should taxpayers shoulder any of the burden?       b. Should people here illegally who are in removal      proceedings be eligible for immigration benefits, including      legal status?       c. Should people who are subject to an order of removal      from the United States by the Department of Homeland Security      be eligible for immigration benefits, including legal status?       d. Should an illegal immigrant convicted of a felony      criminal offense be eligible for immigration benefits,      including legal status?       e. Should an illegal immigrant convicted of multiple      misdemeanors be eligible for immigration benefits, including      legal status?       f. Should illegal immigrant gang members be eligible for      immigration benefits, including legal status?       g. If an illegal immigrant provides information in an      application that is law enforcement sensitive or criminal in      nature, should that information be used by our government and      not be protected under confidentiality provisions? If an      illegal immigrant provides information in an application that      clearly renders him ineligible and commits a serious crime      that would warrant his immediate removal, shouldn't the      government be able to use that information to place him in      removal proceedings?       h. Should people here illegally be required to submit to an      in-person interview with adjudicators when applying for      immigration benefits, including legal status?       i. Should people here illegally that have been denied legal      status be placed in immigration proceedings and removed? If      not, why not?       j. If the Secretary of Homeland Security must revoke a visa      for someone on U.S. soil, should that decision be reviewable      in the U.S. courts?       k. In 1996, after the 1993 World Trade Center attack,      Congress mandated that the immigration service, with      cooperation from schools and universities, collect      information on foreign students. This system took years to      get up and running. In fact, it still wasn't in place on 9/     11. While it is operational today, there is still work to be      done to make that system effective. Most recently, the      Department stopped all efforts to upgrade the system. Do you      intend to make SEVIS upgrades a priority, if confirmed?       3. As a result of some of the actions of Secretary      Napolitano, particularly her Directive entitled ``Exercising      Prosecutorial Discretion with Respect to Individuals Who Came      to the United States as Children,'' several ICE agents,      including the President of the ICE agents and officers union,      the National ICE Council, Chris Crane, filed a complaint      against Secretary Napolitano stating that ``the Directive      commands ICE officers to violate federal law . . . violate      their oaths to uphold and support federal law, violates the      Administrative Procedure Act, unconstitutionally usurps and      encroaches upon the legislative powers of Congress, as      defined in Article I of the United States Constitution, and      violates the obligation of the executive branch to faithfully      execute the law, as required by Article II, Section 3, of the      United States Constitution.'' Moreover, Kenneth Palinkas, the      president of the National Citizenship and Immigration      Services Council, has likewise charged that USCIS employees      are required by the agency ``to grant immigration benefits to      those who, under law, are not properly eligible.'' In short,      her actions have caused a great deal of discontent among      immigration officers and agents, to say the least.      Accordingly, if confirmed, what will you do to improve the      morale of immigration officers and agents who are concerned      about these non-enforcement protocols issued by Secretary      Napolitano?       4. In the more than four years that she served as Secretary      of the DHS, Secretary Napolitano never agreed to meet with      the National ICE Council, the union that represents more than      7,000 agency employees, or the National Citizenship and      Immigration Services Council, the union that represents      12,000 agency employees. Will you meet with representatives      from these unions and, if so, when?       5. During the first five years of the Obama administration,      Secretary Napolitano and former ICE Director John Morton      issued numerous policy memoranda that order ICE     agents to restrict their enforcement of immigration laws to      illegal immigrants who have been convicted of violent crimes.      If confirmed, will you continue that policy?       6. Do you agree that a person who is in the United States      in violation of U.S. immigration law is subject to removal?       7. Among the aforementioned memoranda issued by former ICE      Director Morton, the memo dated March 2, 2011, designates      immigration fugitives as a priority for removal. Do you agree      that illegal immigrants who ignore deportation orders should      be removed from the United States?       8. Among the aforementioned memoranda issued by former ICE      Director Morton, the memo dated November 17, 2011, identifies      an illegal immigrant with a conviction for drunk driving as a      priority for removal. Do you agree that an illegal immigrant      who has been convicted of a drunk driving offense should be      removed from the United States?       9. All federal employees take an Oath, codified at 5 U.S.C.      3331, to ``support and defend the Constitution of the United      States . . . and that [they] will well and faithfully      discharge the duties of the office on which [they] about to      enter.'' How can an employee fulfill his or her oath if such      an employee is threatened with reprisal for executing the      laws enacted by Congress to which they are entrusted to      administer, and for not complying with an administratively-     created command to the contrary?       10. In June 2012, Secretary Napolitano issued a memorandum      ordering the implementation of the Deferred Action for      Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.       a. If confirmed, will you continue this program?       b. Do you believe that the President has the legal      authority to expand DACA through executive, regulatory or      policy prerogatives?       11. Do you believe that the issuance of prosecutorial      discretion directives, such as those mentioned above, is      within the legal authority of the Secretary of Homeland      Security?       12. Since Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678 (2001), Congress      has attempted to pass legislation that would amend the      Immigration and Nationality Act to authorize DHS to detain      criminal aliens beyond six months. Would you support such      legislation?       13. In September 2011, Secretary Napolitano suspended the      Border Patrol's practice of routinely screening mass      transportation vehicles and transportation hubs near U.S.      borders, which prompted a strong objection by the National      Border Patrol Council. If confirmed, would you reverse this      policy? If not, why?       14. Beginning in 2010, DHS has included in its statistics      for ICE removals the number of illegal immigrants apprehended      by the Border Patrol and then transferred to ICE for      processing. Do you support this policy?       15. In January 2012, the DHS Inspector General released a      report criticizing USCIS for pressuring its employees to      rubberstamp applications for immigration benefits. In that      report, nearly 25 percent of USCIS officers surveyed said      supervisors had pressured them to approve applications that      should have been denied.       a. Do you believe that current USCIS screening procedures      are sufficient to prevent fraud and threats to public safety      and national security?       b. If confirmed, would you change these policies? If so,      how?       c. Will you commit to ensuring that USCIS background checks      for every applicant for immigration benefits are properly and      effectively conducted?       d. Should employee performance evaluations at USCIS be      linked to the number of applicants for benefits approved, or      adjudicated?       16. Recently, the U.S. arrested a legal immigrant in      Illinois who had been convicted and served ten years in an      Israeli prison for her role in two terrorist bombings.      According to press reports, she was able to obtain both a      green card (in 1995) and citizenship (in 2004) by simply      omitting her conviction on her applications. She continued to      live in the U.S. for years despite the fact that the      conviction was public knowledge. Are you confident that the      current processes for screening applicants for immigration      benefits are able to identify and keep out criminals and      individuals who pose a threat to national security?       17. Some have argued that immigration judges should be      granted broad discretion to allow an illegal immigrant who      should be removed from the country to stay by waiving current      bars to admission and removal grounds for numerous crimes      (such as drug crimes, firearms offenses, domestic violence,      fraud, high speed flight at a checkpoint, and crimes      involving moral turpitude) if the judge finds that the      illegal immigrant's removal will cause hardship to a citizen      or lawful permanent resident or if the judge believes it is      in the public interest. Do you agree with this approach? If      so, please explain why and specifically, whether you believe      current immigration law is too harsh with respect to illegal      immigrants who engage in this type of criminal conduct.       18. On December 21, 2012, ICE announced that it decided not      to renew any of its agreements with state and local law      enforcement agencies that operate task forces under the      287(g) program, stating that ``other enforcement programs,      including Secure Communities are more efficient use of      resources.'' However, Secure Communities serves a completely      separate and distinct function. The 287(g) program trains      local officers to determine whether an individual is lawfully      present, including those with no prior contact with      immigration services. Secure Communities allows local law      enforcement to identify illegal immigrants only after they      have been booked into jail and if their fingerprints are      already in immigration databases. Moreover, ICE's own website      touts the 287(g) program as ``one of ICE's top partnership      initiatives.'' The website used to advertise the success of      the program: ``Since January 2006, the 287(g) program is      credited with identifying more than 304,678 potentially      removable aliens--mostly at local jails.'' Such statistics      appear to have since been removed. If confirmed, will you      commit to enter into 287(g) agreements with a qualified      requesting state or local jurisdiction?       19. After being criticized by certain special-interest      groups, the administration essentially halted all worksite      enforcement actions. According to the non-partisan      Congressional Research Service, in 2011, worksite enforcement      actions resulted in the arrest of 1,471 illegal workers out      of an estimated 8 million--.0001 percent. In the same year,      only 385 employers out of 6 million were fined for hiring      illegal workers. If confirmed, will you commit to reinstating      worksite enforcement, including enforcing immigration law      with respect to illegal alien employees?       20. If confirmed, what specific measures will you implement      to ensure that the Department of Homeland Security is in      compliance with all legal requirements of the Secure Fence      Act of 2006 (P.L. 109-367)?       21. In 2010, Secretary Napolitano suspended our nation's      only comprehensive border security measurement, known as the      operational control metric. More than three years have      passed, and the Department of Homeland Security has failed to      replace this metric. If confirmed, would you hold your      department accountable by regularly releasing a comprehensive      border security metric that measures the percentage of      illegal border crossers that escape apprehension by the      Department of Homeland Security?       22. Do you believe that the Department of Homeland Security      has the ability to achieve operational control of every      sector of our Southern border? If confirmed, would you commit      your department to achieving this standard?       23. Do you support the transfer of unused and unarmed      Department of Defense assets, such as detection and      communications equipment, to the Southern border in order to      help DHS achieve operational control of every sector of the      Southern border?       24. Our Southern border ports of entry are outdated and in      a state of disrepair--harming legitimate trade and travel,      while making our nation more vulnerable to sophisticated      criminal and terrorist organizations. If confirmed, what      specific measures would you take to revitalize and improve      security at our Southern border ports of entry?       25. Do you support making E-Verify permanent and mandatory      for all employers?       26. Serious national security issues have come to light in      recent months with respect to the EB-5 Regional Center      program, which allows foreign nationals to obtain a green      card if they invest in the United States.       a. Do you concur that more needs to be done to reduce      national security risks and to prevent fraud and abuse in the      program?       b. Do you have any plans to administratively improve the      program?       c. Will you make it a priority if you are confirmed?       27. DHS currently receives a portion of funds from each H-     1B visa application and provides these funds to USCIS for      fraud and abuse prevention efforts. However, ICE has a      responsibility to prosecute the cases but does not receive      any of these funds. Will you       28. Oversight conducted by the Judiciary Committee has      revealed that DHS is not enforcing the law prohibiting the      admission into the country of those who would be a public      charge. This has been confirmed by ICE and USCIS officers and      data on both admissions and removals. Oversight also      discovered a number of administration activities, including      advertisements in immigration materials and at foreign      embassies, encouraging foreign nationals to use federal      welfare programs. Can you please describe, in detail, how you      would restore vigorous enforcement of the public charge law      to protect taxpayers, including what efforts you would      undertake to reduce noncitizen enrollment in means-tested      welfare programs? Please be specific in your answer.       29. Dating back to 1996, Congress has mandated in six      statutes that a biometric entry-exit system be implemented.      In 2012, Rebecca Gambler, GAO's Director of Homeland Security      and Justice Issues, testified before the Judiciary Committee      that ``DHS faces challenges in identifying overstays due to      its general reliance on biographic entry and exit      information, rather than biometric information, hindering      DHS's efforts to reliably identify overstays. . . . Without      [biometric] exit capability, DHS cannot ensure the integrity      of the immigration system by identifying and removing those      people who have overstayed their original period of      admission--a stated goal of US-VISIT.'' For precisely that      reason, a biometric--and not a biographic--exit system must      be implemented to achieve real border security. Secretary      Napolitano refused to implement such a system, variously      claiming it was too expensive and/or that the technology did      not exist. However, an internal 2009 DHS report found      conclusively that biometric exit is effective and efficient,      and current data from industry demonstrates that the      technology is affordable.       a. Do you disagree with GAO or that a biometric exit system      must be implemented to ensure real border security?       b. Do you acknowledge that federal law requires DHS to      implement a biometric entry- exit system?       c. If confirmed, will you commit to implementing this      system within one year?       We appreciate your pledge of ``transparency and candor with      Congress,'' and look forward to your prompt response.           Sincerely,     Chuck Grassley.     Jeff Sessions.     Michael S. Lee.     Orrin Hatch.     John Cornyn.     Ted Cruz.                          ____________________
