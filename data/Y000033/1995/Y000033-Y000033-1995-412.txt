Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to introduce today, along with a number of my distinguished colleagues, including Jim Hansen, Jim Saxton, Ken Calvert, and J.D. Hayworth, the National Parks and National Wildlife Refuge Systems Freedom Act of 1995.  The purpose of this legislation is to ensure that our national parks and wildlife refuges are not closed in the future because of a lack of Federal funding to operate them.  During this past weekend, we witnessed the sad spectacle of the Department of the Interior closing our Nation's 369 parks and 504 national wildlife refuge units.  These lands, which comprise about 181 million acres, were acquired through the hard work of millions of American taxpayers, who paid for them with entrance fees, excise taxes, duck stamps, and income tax payments.  It is terribly wrong to close these facilities and to deny the American people the right to enjoy their beauty, splendor, and various recreational opportunities.  In the State of Arizona, Governor Fife Symington offered to operate and keep the Grand Canyon open by using the State National Guard personnel. Regrettably, the Governor's request was denied because the Department of the Interior currently lacks the legal authority to allow the States to manage these lands.  The National Parks and National Wildlife Refuge Systems Freedom Act will require the Secretary of the Interior to accept the services of State employees to operate any parks or refuge units when the Federal Government is in a period of a budgetary shutdown.  Under the terms of my bill, a State would not be forced to operate any park or refuge within its geographic boundaries, but would simply be given the opportunity to offer their services, like Governor Symington.  Furthermore, the term ``government budgetary shutdown'' has been narrowly defined to only cover those circumstances when there is a failure to enact a timely appropriations bill for the Department of the Interior and there is a lack of temporary or continuing appropriation funds.  Mr. Speaker, our national parks and wildlife refuge systems must never be closed again in the future. This legislation will ensure that if there is ever another budgetary meltdown, the American people will not be denied the chance to visit the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge, the Edwin B. Forsythe National Wildlife Refuge, Yellowstone National Park, or the Washington Monument.  I urge my colleagues to join with me in support of the National Parks and National Wildlife Refuge Systems Freedom Act of 1995.                          ____________________
