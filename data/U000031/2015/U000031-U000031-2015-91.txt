 Madam Chair, I strongly oppose this amendment because making this funding discretionary and subject to later appropriations is critically shortsighted for two reasons.  We thought that this might be a placebo amendment, but yes, it really is a poison pill that would undermine the victories the Republicans secured in 21st Century Cures, including transformative regulatory reforms at FDA and permanent entitlement savings in both Medicare and Medicaid.  Second, supporting the amendment means voting against the critical balance that we found to pay for these investments using mandatory savings in a way that reduces the deficit in working with the Appropriations Committee.  According to the CBO, this bill will reduce the deficit by some $500-plus million over the first 10 years, and we conservatively estimate that it cuts $7 billion in the second decade.  Third, more than 100 organizations have joined together to oppose this amendment. They represent a cross-section of organizations, including patient groups, universities, veterans, innovators, and medical providers.  I would ask my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the Brat amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.
