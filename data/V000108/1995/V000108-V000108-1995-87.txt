Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to rise today and pay tribute to an outstanding citizen of Indiana's First Congressional District, Ms. Migdalia Perez. On Monday, February 27, 1995, Ms. Migdalia will be honored as one of the recipients of the National Association of Private Industry Councils [NAPIC] 1995 distinguished participant awards. This event will take place at the NAPIC's conference in Washington, DC.  Ms. Perez, a resident of Portage, IN, is the only individual in the State of Indiana who is being honored, and 1 of 10 throughout the country. This is the first time a Hoosier is being honored by NAPIC. Moreover, on August 30, 1994, Migdalia was honored for successfully completing training programs through Kankakee Workforce Development Services. This award was part of an annual award ceremony honoring statewide graduates of the Indiana Workforce Development System.  Migdalia came to the United States from Puerto Rico with her husband, Alex, who suffers from muscular dystrophy. In order to succeed in the United States, Migdalia learned to read English. She then entered school at IVY Tech in the respiratory technician program while continuing to receive tutoring through the Portage Adult Education Center. At IVY Tech, Migdalia made the dean's list three consecutive semesters. Currently, she is employed as a respiratory technician at Methodist Hospital in Gary, IN. Migdalia and her husband how have two children, Alex and Danny. She is an excellent role model for her children and family.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my colleagues to join me in honoring this amazing woman, not only for her commitment to betterment of her self and her family, but for becoming a remarkable role model for her community.                          ____________________
