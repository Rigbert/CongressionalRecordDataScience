Speaker, it is with great pride and sincerity that I take this time to honor Dr. and Mrs. David and Nancy Gross of Schererville, Indiana. On Sunday, December 3, 2006, David and Nancy were honored for their years of service and many contributions to the Jewish Federation of Northwest Indiana and the community it serves. The Jewish Federation of Northwest Indiana honored David and Nancy at the 2006 Northwest Indiana Israel Dinner of State, which was held at the Jewish Federation Community Building in Munster, Indiana.  David Gross, originally from Canton, Ohio, has always proved himself to be a dedicated member of the Jewish community. From a very young age, David realized the need for community participation in causes aimed at supporting the State of Israel. As a fourth grade student, David's abilities in this regard began to emerge, as he organized an event that would raise over one thousand dollars for the Jewish United Fund (JUF). Throughout his youth, David was committed to the goals of the JUF, to help provide for the survival and welfare of the Jewish people and to benefit all mankind. Since relocating from Chicago to Northwest Indiana, following completion of his residency in Ophthalmology, David has continued to spend much of his spare time working with the Jewish community. He has served on numerous committees with the Congregation Beth Israel (CBI), and he has also contributed a great deal of time working on the Jewish Federation's annual fundraising campaign.  Nancy Gross, a native of Highland Park, Illinois, has always shared the same compassion and willingness as her husband to serve. Nancy has made her commitment to the Jewish community known through her contributions to several organizations, including ORT, which strives to educate communities with the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in an ever-changing environment and to foster self-sufficiency. Nancy has also served on and chaired several committees, including programs of the Jewish Center Youth Camp and K'ton Ton, where her children attended, not to mention her many contributions to the CBI, where she currently serves on the school board. Like David, Nancy has seen the importance of the Jewish Federation's annual fundraising campaign, even serving as co-chair for the campaign. Nancy's commitment to youth and her willingness to share her time and talents with her community is truly remarkable, and for this, she is most deserving of the honors bestowed upon her.  While they remain truly committed to the Jewish community, David and Nancy's greatest enjoyment is the time spent with their three beautiful daughters: Samantha, Rachel, and Elly. David and Nancy's commitment to improving the future for the youth and the entire Jewish community is surely an extension of their commitment to their daughters.  Mr. Speaker, at this time, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating Dr. and Mrs. David and Nancy Gross as they are honored for their service and dedication to the Jewish community. Their years of service have touched and improved the lives of all whom they have served. Their unselfish and lifelong dedication is worthy of the highest commendation, and I am proud to represent them in Congress.                          ____________________
