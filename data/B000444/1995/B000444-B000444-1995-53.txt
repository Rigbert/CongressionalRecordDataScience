 President, because the support is still out there and because the need for Amtrak services must still be met by the States and because the principle of increased State flexibility is still valid, I will continue to fight for this Senate language that has been dropped from the conference report. But because I do not want to waste more time on this proposal and tie up my friend, the chairman of the committee, who I again thank for his dogged support of this proposition at a time when so much of our legislative business is yet to be done, I will not introduce this motion to recommit. But I consider the loss of important Senate language a clear reason for me to vote against this conference report.  I also want my colleagues to know that I will seek another means by which to accomplish the goals of the Roth-Biden amendment, and I will continue to fight to get it put into law.  To put it to you very bluntly, Mr. President, the reason I am not going to pursue this right now is if this prevails and gets sent back to committee, these States that are looking for the flexibility will also in the meantime have additional moneys tied up. They will not be able to get moneys that are in this bill that they need now. So I am in kind of a catch-22 position. My purpose here is to help Amtrak and to give Governors of States flexibility to decide what their transportation network should look like. But if I succeed, it goes back to the House again and goes back into conference, and I am not at all sure, to be very blunt about it, whether or not my friend from Rhode Island, notwithstanding his Herculean efforts, would be able to prevail were we to send him back. So that is why I am withholding this motion. So I will yield.  I saw my colleague from Delaware, who is the lead sponsor on this amendment. I do not know whether he wishes to speak on this right now. But for the time being--is there any time under the control of the Senator from Delaware?
