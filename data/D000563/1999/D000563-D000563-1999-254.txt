President, I urge colleagues to oppose the Bond amendment. This sets the stage for lead mining in the Mark Twain National Forest, one of the most beautiful recreational areas in the Midwest. This is opposed by the Governor of Missouri, the attorney general of Missouri, every major newspaper in the State, a score of different groups of citizens living in the area, as well as environmental groups.  To open this area to lead mining is to run the risk of making an industrial wasteland out of one of the most beautiful recreation areas in Missouri. It is an area shared by those of us who live in Illinois and in many other States. At the current time, the Department of the Interior has the authority to review this. What the Senator from Missouri is attempting to do is to circumvent that process. That should not happen. Please, preserve this land owned by the taxpayers of America, which should not be exploited for lead mining purposes.
