Speaker, during the course of the next 24 to 48 hours there will be an extensive debate on the floor of this House of Representatives about a tax cut bill. Talk about a politician's dream, to stand up in front of the American people and say, ``Guess what? I've got a tax cut for you.''  Mr. Speaker, people applauded. They say, ``You're the greatest elected official in the world. How can you be so generous and so kind?''  Well, there will be some of us who will be questioning this tax cut, and you say, ``Wait a minute. Why would any politician in his right mind question the idea of a tax cut? Don't you want to promise people you're going to cut their taxes?''  Well, of course we do, and there are a lot of deserving people in America who should have their taxes cut, but unfortunately the Gingrich Republican tax cut bill is not a fair bill for this country.  First let me tell you this:  This year we have a $190 billion deficit, $190 billion more that we will spend than we take in. This tax cut proposed by the Gingrich Republicans is going to add about another $190 billion more to the national debt over the next 5 years, and, over 10 years, $630 billion more to the national debt. Why are we doing this at a time when we are cutting school lunches and other programs because of deficits? Why would the Gingrich Republicans want to give tax cuts away and add to the deficit, require us to cut even deeper into spending for education and for school lunches? Well, let me tell you why.  Take a look at what this tax bill does. It tells the whole story. Who is going to get the benefit of this tax cut? Working Americans? Folks who get up every day, pack the lunch box, punch the clock, drop the kids at day care, do the things you have to do? They will get a little bit, but look who the real winners are. Take a look at this chart. Who benefits from the Republican tax bill?  Under a $30,000 income, if you happen to have a family, making under $30,000, your average cut for your family is $124, $2 and, what, 80 cents a week or so? And then take a look. From 30,000 to 75,000, $760; 75,000 to 100,000 thousand, $1,572. Hang on to your hats, folks, when you get over $100,000. From 100,000 to 200,000 the Gingrich Republicans want to give you $2,465 in tax breaks, and the superrich, the privileged few over $200,000, $11,000 tax break, an $11,000 tax break to folks making over $200,000 a year?  Pardon me; what did I miss here? We are in a deficit? We are cutting school lunches? We are cutting back on student loans? We are reducing money for schools and education for our future so that folks making over 200 grand a year can have an $11,000 tax break? That does not make any sense.  Let me yield to my colleague from Texas.
