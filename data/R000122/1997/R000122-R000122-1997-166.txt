President, I pay tribute to a proud member of the Rhode Island community, Ms. Arlene DeSemone, who, sadly, passed away on March 11, 1997.  A leader in the insurance industry, Ms. DeSemone served as president of the Rhode Island Life Underwriters Association in 1992. She was president of the National Association of Insurance Women of Rhode Island from 1988 to 1990 and was named professional woman of the year by this organization in 1994. Ms. DeSemone received the R. Kelly Sheridan Award in 1996, as the outstanding life insurance professional of the year. In addition, Ms. DeSemone received the Lloyd Saunders Award for professional dedication to her clients and the industry, and served on numerous committees, including the first Rhode Island Department of Business Regulation Continuing Education Advisory Board.  Perhaps the greatest of Ms. DeSemone's contributions was her work in the fight against breast cancer. Despite her own personal struggle with the disease, Ms. DeSemone led the way in encouraging research efforts to find a cure for breast cancer. Ms. DeSemone cofounded the Rhode Island Breast Cancer Coalition in 1993, an organization whose initiatives received national praise and were recognized by President Clinton and the First Lady. The coalition continues to benefit from her efforts to raise consciousness about breast cancer.  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in remembering Ms. Arlene DeSemone for her many contributions to Rhode Island and selfless dedication to helping others. Certainly, Ms. DeSemone embodied the strength and determination we all seek to find in ourselves.                          ____________________
