President, I want to take a moment to speak about Guatemala, a country that receives too little attention by the Congress, where we have seen both progress and disturbing trends in recent years.  Guatemala is struggling to emerge from more than three decades of civil war in which tens of thousands of civilians, mostly Mayan Indians, were disappeared, tortured and killed. The majority of those atrocities were committed by the army.  A year and a half ago, Guatemala elected a new President, Oscar Berger, who pledged to support the implementation of the 1996 Peace Accords which his predecessors had largely ignored. President Berger's election offered hope for change, beginning with the downsizing of the military, his appointment of Nobel Peace Laureate Rigoberta Menchu as a Goodwill Ambassador, and his pursuit of corruption charges against former President Alfonso Portillo. I was among those who praised President Berger for those important and courageous initiatives.  However, I am concerned that after a promising beginning, corruption, organized crime, and human rights violations are getting worse.  In 2004, President Berger reduced the size of the Guatemalan military by 50 percent. However, to the consternation of many civil society organizations, the Interior Ministry announced that the Guatemalan military would continue to participate in joint law enforcement operations with the National Civil Police, in violation of the Peace Accords. This is also a concern because, according to the State Department, there are credible allegations of involvement by police officers in rapes, killings and kidnappings. Rather than prosecute these officers, they are often transferred to different parts of the country. Impunity remains a serious problem.  Organized crime is thriving in Guatemala, and the government faces an uncertain future if it is perceived as powerless against these wealthy criminal networks. In one day this year, 17 people were reportedly murdered in Guatemala City. Our Ambassador is reportedly confident that organized crime has not infiltrated the Berger administration, and President Berger deserves credit for removing Attorney General Carlos de Leon who was suspected of corruption. But he also needs to crack down on these violent gangs.  President Berger also deserves praise for his support of the proposed Commission for the Investigation of Illegal Armed Groups and Clandestine Security Organizations, CICIACS. His initial efforts ran into problems with the judiciary and continue to face opposition in the Guatemalan Congress. But the establishment of CICIACS would assist in the consolidation of democracy as well as in combating clandestine groups.  Reports of intimidation, kidnappings, and death threats remain all too frequent. In January and February of this year alone, Amnesty International documented that 26 human rights activists were threatened or attacked in Guatemala. More recently, on July 7, MarioAntonio Godinez Lopez, head of the Association for the Promotion and Development of the Community, an organization that opposes CAFTA, received a death threat. The next day, Alvaro Juarez, a human rights leader who worked with Alliance for Life and Peace and with the Association of the Displaced of the Peten, was assassinated. On July 11, five journalists were attacked with machetes by ex-civil patrol members. Ileana Alamilla, the President of the Association of Journalists of Guatemala, has warned that journalists are in increasing danger and that the government needs to take steps to protect them. These are only a few examples of the types of incidents that are common in Guatemala today.  A recent report indicates that the number of women murdered and sexually abused in Guatemala has also increased. As of mid-July, 326 women have been murdered this year in Guatemala, a country of only 14 million people. While the report suggests causes such as clandestine groups, ultimately it concludes that the lack of investigations and convictions, in other words, impunity, are at the root of the problem.  The Guatemalan Government also needs to more effectively address the agrarian conflicts by seeking greater input from indigenous and campesino organizations. I have been concerned with the government's support for land evictions, and the national police's role in the destruction of crops and houses of members campesino organizations. This explosive issue may worsen if President Berger does not find more effective ways to address the legitimate needs of landless people.  We should all be encouraged by the recent announcement that Anders Kompass will be heading the newly established office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in Guatemala. Having gained wide respect for his work in OHCHR offices in Colombia and Mexico, Mr. Kompass brings a wealth of expertise to Guatemala. I would hope that the State Department provides funds to help support this office.  Since 1990, the Congress has prohibited foreign military financing assistance for Guatemala because of the military's involvement in gross violations of human rights, and the lack of accountability for heinous crimes. The Senate continued that prohibition recently due to ongoing concerns with the inadequate pace of military reform. It is all too apparent that despite the downsizing of the military, the attitude that the military remains above the law has yet to change.  However, we do provide the Guatemalan military with expanded international military education and training assistance. In addition, we continue to provide counter-narcotics assistance. And this year we released prior year military assistance funds to address urgent equipment needs for drug interdiction, such as spare parts for aircraft.  Guatemala is at a crossroads. No one should be under any illusions about the difficulties of the many political, economic and social challenges it faces. Reform of Guatemala's corrupt and dysfunctional judicial system alone will take many years. But while President Berger has made progress, the culture of violence and impunity continues to thrive in Guatemala. And until there is clear evidence that he is more vigorously and effectively confronting the powerful interests that are responsible for these problems, it will be difficult if not impossible for the United States to support the Guatemalan Government as strongly as we would like to.                          ____________________
