 2251) for Mr. Brown:       The General Services Administration and the Federal      Aviation Administration should review and reform current      personnel rules and labor agreements regarding federal      assistance when relocating because of a change of duty      station.       The Senate is concerned about reports that, under FAA and      GSA rules, employees at the Denver, Colorado, ATCT and TRACON      were permitted to claim personal housing relocation      allowances in connection with their transfer from FAA      facilities at Stapleton Field to the new Denver International      Airport, even in some cases where an employee's new home was      farther from the new job site than the employee's former      home.       The FAA should immediately investigate this misuse of      public funds at Denver International Airport and reform their      personnel rules to end this kind of abuse.
