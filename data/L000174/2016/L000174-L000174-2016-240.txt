President, I appreciate the comments of the senior Senator from Delaware. We have plenty of time to get a nomination to the Supreme Court from the President and to confirm a Justice, just as this body has done 12 times in Presidential election years. I think probably the most recent, of course, was when Democrats controlled the Senate and we confirmed unanimously President Reagan's nomination in an election year, his final year in office. So it can easily be done. Besides, let us just do our job. We get paid to be here and to do our job. We ought to do it.  We also have the matter that each one of us has taken a very solemn oath before God to uphold the Constitution. The Constitution says the President shall nominate and the Senate shall advise and consent. We ought to do just what we all have solemnly sworn to do. I take my oath very seriously. I hope other Senators do too.  Now, Mr. President, today the full Senate is going to begin a discussion about one of the most challenging public health crises of our time--addiction to prescription painkillers and other opioids. In my home State of Vermont, there are few issues more pressing than opioid addiction. It is tearing apart families and communities--families and communities I have known all my life.  In March 2008, nearly 8 years ago, when I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I first held a hearing in Rutland, VT, about the challenges this epidemic presents in rural parts of our country. In subsequent field hearings, we learned about how communities like Rutland, VT--a beautiful community--were constructively seeking ways to get ahead of addiction. But we also learned--and I think we knewthis--that there are no easy answers, and we need a comprehensive approach. Education, prevention, and treatment are essential if we are to reverse the tide in this fight.  Vermont's all-hands-on-deck example serves as a model for other States and communities across the Nation. In fact, just last week an article in the Christian Science Monitor detailed how Vermont's pioneering approach has been embraced well beyond Vermont's borders.  So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Christian Science Monitor article entitled ``How one state turned its `heroin crisis' into a national lesson'' be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.  Opioid addiction is not a new issue. It is not new to me, and it is not new to Vermont. But it is about time that the full Congress gave this public health crisis the attention it deserves. The bill we begin to consider today, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, or CARA, represents a positive step forward, and I am proud to be a cosponsor of it.  For decades, the knee-jerk response in Congress to those who struggled with addiction was misguided. We embraced harsh and arbitrary mandatory minimums, we ignored effective treatment options, and we pushed addicts further underground and away from recovery. Such policies reflect a complete misunderstanding of the problem of addiction.  At my hearings and everywhere I went, we saw police officers, faith communities, educators, medical professionals, parents, and addicts coming together, saying that no one group had the answer but the community had to come together. Because we know addiction is a disease, we know our tools for combating addiction must be the same as other disease--a commitment to evidence-based education and proven techniques for prevention, treatment, and recovery programs.  As one who has served in law enforcement, I know that law enforcement is an important element in a comprehensive approach. That is why I worked to include in this bill an authorization for funding to expand State-led anti-heroin task forces. But this legislation is important because it treats addiction as the public health crisis that it is. The bill authorizes a crucial program that I helped create that expands access to medication-assisted treatment programs--programs that have been plagued by massive waiting lists. The clinic in Chittenden County, VT--that is the largest of our 14 counties--has seen its wait list lengthened to nearly a year. What happens when that wait list is long? Several people have overdosed and died while waiting for treatment. Those deaths were probably preventable. We shouldn't die waiting for treatment. We have to do better.  The bill also recognizes the devastating impact that opioid abuse has on rural communities. Just as in your State and every other State, we have rural communities. Vermont is predominantly rural communities. My home where my wife and I have lived since we got married is on a dirt road. We know rural America. We know it has been hit hard by addiction. Emergency medical services in rural communities are often limited. I am glad that the bill we reported out of committee includes my provision to support our rural communities for the overdose reversal drug naloxone.  Over the last decade, death rates from opioid overdoses have steadily climbed across the country. But there is a real disparity between rural communities and major cities. We found the more rural a location, the higher the death rate. Getting lifesaving drugs into more hands will save lives across the country, especially in our rural communities that are among the hardest hit.  This is not a partisan issue. I thank Senator Whitehouse and Senator Grassley for working with me on this legislation in our Judiciary Committee. I hope we will soon see its passage here in the Senate. But one authorization bill by itself is not going to end addiction. It is not going to end the deaths that we are seeing in rural America and in urban America.  We need a significant commitment of targeted funding to implement this bill. Senator Shaheen's $600 million emergency supplemental appropriations bill provides those resources, and I am proud to be a cosponsor of that legislation, as well.  In your State, my State, and the other 48 States right now, we passed larger emergency supplemental bills that addressed swine flu and Ebola. We do not have Ebola in our country, but we passed an emergency supplemental bill to address that. We need to address what we have right here within our country today. Swine flu and Ebola presented far, far fewer dramatic health risks to our communities. We need to take this challenge just as seriously.  The bill we are considering today has received strong bipartisan support and deservedly so. But I hope all the Senators supporting CARA today will also support Senator Shaheen's legislation. One goes hand in hand with the other. We need to authorize these advances in dealing with the opioid crisis, but then we actually need to fund them.  We cannot pretend that solving a problem as large as opioid addiction costs nothing. We have an opportunity to equip our communities with the support and resources they need to finally get ahead of addiction. Programs will save lives. That is a worthy investment.  It is very easy to say we will pass a law to stop opioid addiction. We can all feel good about voting for that. Who is going to vote for legislation to say ``let us continue opioid addiction''? But if we do not put the money in it, then, basically, we are saying we want to feel good but we are not going to do anything for you.  We spend money worldwide. Some of it is for good causes, and some of it is totally wasted. Here we have a problem in the United States of America, where our priorities are first and foremost to our country. If you saw some of the people I heard in these hearings all over our beautiful State, some of the families with whom I have talked across their kitchen tables, and a young woman who had been addicted and is now helping to counsel others and the story she told, or if you saw a movie or TV program, you would say it couldn't be that grim. Well, it was. It is.  These people go across all income brackets, all brackets of education. It is tearing apart parts of our communities across the country. Fortunately, we have had some very brave people stand up. I hope Senator Shaheen's appropriation goes through because, if it does not, we are saying all the right things, as we should, except for one thing: We are not going to pay for it. This is too important to say the check is in the mail; just wait and wait. We can do better. We can do better.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:          [From The Christian Science Monitor, Feb. 23, 2016]    How One State Turned Its `Heroin Crisis' Into a National Lesson                       (By Gail Russell Chaddock)       Paths to Progress: Vermont's pioneering focus on treatment      amid an opioid crisis is being embraced by politicians of      both parties--well beyond the state.       America's opioid addiction crisis, now claiming 78 lives a      day, is sweeping aside party lines both at the state level      and even in famously gridlocked Washington.       The nation's governors, from deep-red Alabama to bluest-of-     the-blue Vermont, are moving rapidly to a strategy of      treating illegal drug users rather than jailing them.       It's a shift that runs deep in public opinion, as well.      Some two-thirds of Americans now typically say that they      prefer providing treatment to long prison sentences.       ``This is an area where I can get agreement from Bernie      Sanders and Mitch McConnell,'' President Obama said at a      White House meeting with governors on Monday. ``That doesn't      happen that often, but this is one. And it indicates the      severity of the issue.''       But the governors are, in fact, well ahead of Washington on      this issue--as they were on welfare reform in the 1990s and,      more recently, sentencing reform.       Gov. Peter Shumlin (D) of Vermont, a leader in the pivot      from prisons to treatment, says he got into the addiction      fight after talking to people in his state.       ``I found we were doing almost everything wrong,'' he told      a forum on opioid and heroin addiction at The Pew Charitable      Trusts in Washington on Friday.       The best hope is to get more people into treatment, he      said. And the best time to do that is ``when the blue lights      are flashing and the handcuffs are on.''       Vermont, like other states in the Northeast, is facing      severe opioid challenges. In 2014, Governor Shumlin devoted      his annual State of the State address entirely to     Vermont's ``full-blown heroin crisis.'' Annual overdose      deaths from opioids had nearly doubled since 2004. The number      of people seeking treatment for opioid addiction had spiked      770 percent since 2000.                         what vermont has done       And so Vermont has taken a hard look at its approach.      Instead of jail, nonviolent offenders are given the option of      going into treatment. They start in one of the state's new      central clinics (hubs) and move on to a family doctor,      counselor, or therapist closer to home (spokes).       Vermont law also shields people seeking medical help for an      overdose from prosecution for manufacturing or selling drugs,      not just for minor crimes. It also was the first state to      legalize the sale of naloxone over the counter in      pharmacies--a drug aimed at reversing overdoses and saving      lives.       Other states have moved toward treatment instead of      incarceration, but Vermont has done it on a grander scale,      experts say.       ``You've seen some elected officials support legalizing      marijuana, some want to reform sentencing, some talk about      overdoses, but very few have tied all these together in a      comprehensive narrative,'' says Bill Piper, senior director      of national affairs for the Drug Policy Alliance in      Washington.       ``Vermont's governor is at the forefront, and what makes      him unique is that he's one of the few elected officials that      has connected the dots on the various issues,'' he adds.       As a pioneer state, Vermont has also identified some of the      limits of a treatment-centric strategy.       ``As you build out treatment, and particularly in rural      America, we can't get enough docs who are able to meet the      demand of our waiting lists,'' Shumlin told the president at      the White House meeting Monday.       But the most important issue, he told Mr. Obama, is to      ``come up with a more rational approach to prescribing      prescription drugs.''                     a bid to rein in prescriptions       Governors see legal prescriptions for drugs like OxyContin      as the gateway to heroin. ``Overprescribing of opioid      painkillers has fueled the nation's addiction crisis,''      according to a report from the National Governors      Association's Health and Human Services Committee. In a bid      to rein in prescriptions, governors on that committee plan to      develop a list of protocols to present to the full membership      at the next NGA meeting in August.       ``The United States represents 5 percent of the world's      population and consumes 80 percent of the world's opioids,''      said Gov. Charlie Baker (R) of Massachusetts, who chairs the      NGA's Health and Human Services Committee, on Saturday.      That's ``fundamentally flawed.''       When prescriptions are too hard to get--or too expensive--     addicts switch to heroin. ``Most of the heroin addicts we      treat started by using prescription opiates,'' says Brian      McAlister, author of ``Full Recovery'' and CEO of the Full      Recovery Wellness Center in Fairfield, N.J.       ``Some were prescribed by a doctor or dentist, others were      stolen from family or friends' medicine cabinets, and others      were purchased illegally just to party--but the party ends      very quickly. These drugs are highly addictive, and when the      supply runs out, the problems get worse.''                         at the national level       The prospect of politicians reining in pharmaceutical sales      is a stretch in the halls of Congress. In 1993, the GOP-     controlled Congress explicitly barred government from      negotiating lower drug prices with drug companies. Last year,      Big Pharma spent more than $235 million to influence policy      outcomes in Washington--the largest budget of any lobby group      in Washington.       Governors could set protocols on prescribing practices for      painkillers on their own, Shumlin told the president. ``But      it takes time,'' and ``it doesn't apply to all 50 states.''      Instead, he asked Obama to ``consider a national approach      which simply says, for minor procedures, we're going to limit      this to 10 pills and after that you've got to come back for      more.''       ``To be candid, the docs, the AMA [American Medical      Association] are resistant to listening to politicians like      us talking about how many pills to prescribe. But is there      something you could do on a national level that would help us      get out of this tragic mess?'' he added. Obama answered, at      length, but in the end deferred to the states. ``A very      specific approach to working with the docs, the hospitals,      the providers so that they are not overprescribing'' can be      done at the national level, he said. ``But it is most      profitably done, I think, if we have bipartisan support from      the governors so that by the time it gets to the national      level, there is consensus and there's not a lot of politics      involved in it.''       In a recent blog, AMA president Steven Stack called the      opioid epidemic a ``defining moment'' for the profession.      ``Our nation is needlessly losing thousands of people to a      preventable epidemic, and we must take action for our      patients.''
