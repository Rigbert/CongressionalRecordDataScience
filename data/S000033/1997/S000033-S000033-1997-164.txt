 Chairman.  Just in an informal sense, I would choose not to challenge the gentleman from Louisiana if I could have some assurances that he will work with me in trying to get some money to an agency outside of the DOD so that we can really look at the impact of chemicals on our soldiers. Is that something he would be interested in working with me on?
