Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for his courtesy.  Mr. Chairman, I do oppose the amendment. It is merely an amendment authorizing a study to determine whether or not the U.S. Office in Pristina ought to provide consular services. There are about 15,000 people that make that trip to Skopje every year. It is a burdensome situation for them.  But let me also point out there is some value to this debate in the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Franks), because it underscores the clear and nonambiguous intent here that we do not want to prejudge or predetermine the final status with regard to Kosovo. That is to be left to the negotiations.  Even if the State Department makes a recommendation that it is going to be left to a status negotiation, I think the gentleman's amendment and the fact we have had this debate helps to bring some light to that. This amendment would merely facilitate and expedite those individuals that would like to get their visas and to come here.  I thank the gentleman for yielding, I oppose the amendment, and I respect the gentleman.
