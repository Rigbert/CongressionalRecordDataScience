Speaker, I include in the Record the text of a speech delivered by former Secretary General of NATO Anders Fogh Rasmussen, who is a dear friend and former Prime Minister of our ally Denmark. He spoke at the ``Celebration of Democracy'' dinner hosted jointly by the National Democratic Institute and International Republican Institute, and his remarks testify to the strong bonds between our nation and its NATO allies. He also reaffirms a core component of our foreign policy: that the world needs strong American leadership in the years ahead, just as it benefitted from our leadership in the twentieth century.       I'm extremely pleased to see the International Republican      Institute and the National Democratic Institute work so      closely together in a bi-partisan manner to promote freedom      and democracy.       During the last 70 years, we've got used to a world where      protectionism was replaced by free trade, closed societies      were replaced by open societies, and dictatorship was      replaced by democracy. During these 70 years the world has      experienced an unprecedented era of peace, prosperity and      progress.       Now, we are living in an era where the fear of the      consequences of globalization has led to stronger support for      protectionism, fear over the influx of immigrants and      refugees has led to stronger support for closed borders, the      fear of chaos and weak leadership in democracies has led to      stronger support for tough men and autocracy.       Under these circumstances, there is a strong need for good      men and women who will stand up for the basic ideas upon      which we so successfully have built and developed our free      societies.       Secretary Albright and Senator McCain are such solid      people.       As American ambassador to the United Nations and as      Secretary of State you, Madeleine Albright, was a staunch      proponent of American engagement in the Balkans to stop the      bloodshed. And it wasn't until the United States took      leadership that a lasting peace was created.       As Secretary General of NATO, I asked you to lead the      preparations for a new strategic concept. You and your group      of experts did an outstanding job, and in 2010, we adopted a      new strategic concept for NATO.       Madeleine, you have always been a steadfast fighter for      freedom and democracy. And your mood can always be read in      the pins you're wearing. In the book, ``Read My Pins'', you      said: ``I had this wonderful antique snake pin. So when we      were dealing with Iraq, I wore the snake pin''. You had      balloons, butterflies and flowers to signify optimism and,      when diplomatic talks were going slowly, crabs and turtles to      indicate frustration.       John, I'm so happy to also be with you tonight. First of      all, congratulations on your re-election as US senator.      Recently you turned eighty, but if we didn't know, we      wouldn't believe it. You are still going strong, and you are      setting an example for all of us to continue working as long      as we can.       We have met on several occasions in Europe. You have been a      frequent guest at the Munich Security Conference, as leader      of the US delegation and as a highly valued speaker. We have      never doubted your position as one of the strongest American      voices in favor of American global leadership and continued      engagement in Europe.       You were disappointed that NATO did not engage more in      Syria. You also criticized me. Tonight I can tell you, I      agreed with you. But I couldn't get the allies to support      even prudent planning for an operation.       John, you have always remembered America's friends and      allies. I still recall how warmly you thanked me for my      personal support for the United States and my country's      contribution to international military operations all over      the world.       John, we owe you great respect. And I would like to use      this occasion to express my admiration and my gratitude for      your service to the United States and to the world.       We all know that Secretary Albright and Senator McCain      belong to different political parties. But they are united in      their desire to see freedom and democracy flourish in the      world. Madeleine and John, you represent the very best in the      American democracy: the bi-partisan support for American      global leadership.       Let me put it directly: the world needs a policeman. The      only capable, reliable and desirable candidate for that      position is the United States. We need determined American      global leadership.       The world is on fire. The Middle East is being torn up by      war, terrorism and humanitarian catastrophes that have forced      millions of people to flee. Europe is almost sinking under      the refugee burden and internal political division. In North      Africa, Libya has collapsed and become a breeding ground for      terrorists who are spreading instability throughout the      region. In Eastern Europe, a resurgent Russia has brutally      attacked and grabbed land by force from Ukraine. China is      flexing its muscle against its neighbors around the South      China Sea. North Korea is a rogue state that threatens its      neighbors and the United States with a nuclear attack.       There is a link between the American reluctance to use hard      power and this outbreak of fire. If the US retrenches and      retreats or even if the world thinks that the US retreats, it      leaves behind a vacuum that will be filled by the bad guys.       If the United States withdraws to concentrate on ``nation      building at home'', the forces fighting against liberal      democracy and our way of life will gain ground. The US will      be faced with stronger foes, weaker friends and a more      insecure world. That would definitely not make America great.       Appeasement doesn't lead to peace. It just incites tyrants.      Any failure to counter oppression will only invite further      oppression. That is the lesson of the twentieth century--a      lesson we must never forget.       That's why President Truman established a new, rules-based      world order, centered around a series of international      institutions and economic programs. He created an American      led world order that set the stage for the Cold War. Truman      elevated engagement to moral choice directly affecting every      single American citizen, because it was based on American      values. He said: ``I believe that we must assist free peoples      to work out their own destinies in their own way.''       In 1961, President Kennedy expressed what is probably the      strongest commitment to American global leadership ever given      by a president of the United States: ``Let every nation know,      whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any      price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any      friend, oppose any foe, to assure the survival and the      success of liberty.''       And President Reagan ended the Cold War peacefully due to      his firm conviction that capitalism is superior to communism.      He said: ``America's economic success is freedom's success;      it can be repeated a hundred times in a hundred nations''. He      was firmly convinced that peace does not come from weakness      or retreat. It comes from economic and military superiority.      Peace through strength.       President Truman showed strong leadership and effective      conduct by establishing the world order that for seven      decades secured an unprecedented peace, development and      wealth. President Kennedy came to stand as a beacon for the      free world with his energetic and eloquent communication. And      President Reagan led the United States and the world to the      victory over Communism and oppression by his firm conviction      of American exceptionalism.       Hopefully, future US presidents will combine President      Truman's effective conduct, President Kennedy's inspiring      communication and President Reagan's firm conviction. This      would prepare the ground for strong American global      leadership and a better and safer world. And make America      great again.       The United States is indispensable in its ability to      protect and promote freedom and to prevent conflicts, to      resolve conflicts and to help with post-conflict      reconstruction. However, the United States should not be left      to carry out that job alone: Smart American leadership should      strive for alliance-building.       There is a need to create an overwhelming, credible, and      strong democratic supremacy in order to counterbalance the      rising and assertive autocracies.       To create a stronger global democratic community, the      American president should use his convening power to assemble      the     world's true democracies in a strong ``Alliance for      Democracy''. It would be a community of shared values,      individual liberty, economic freedom, democracy, and the rule      of law; a community that would bolster the identity and      potency of democracy in a world where the forces of      oppression are trying to regain ground.       The Alliance for Democracy could help confront common      security challenges, including terrorism. It could work to      make the liberal capitalist democracies more prosperous,      competitive, and attractive by promoting commerce, economic      growth and job creation. It could help promote democracy      directly through advice, support, and assistance. It could be      a forum for the coordination of policies in other      international organizations, including push for reforms to      make the United Nations more effective. And the Alliance for      Democracy could also be used for joint action, particularly      humanitarian interventions.       Many of us are inclined to believe that the community of      values with the best story will win, that the West won the      Cold War because the better world view triumphed, and the      progress is inevitable.       However, the rise of autocratic powers and Islamic      radicalism reminds us that the victory of democratic powers      over oppression is not inevitable and it needs not be      lasting. History has taught us that we cannot be complacent.       Thomas Jefferson reminded us that ``the price of liberty is      eternal vigilance''. I will continue dreaming of the      predominance of capitalism and liberal democracy. I will not      accept the argument that certain people are not well suited      for democracy.       In a world that grows in freedom and democracy, people will      have a chance to raise their families and live in peace and      build a better future. The terrorists will lose their      recruits and lose their sponsors and lose safe havens from      which to launch new attacks, and there will be less room for      tyranny and terror.       But to ensure the progress of freedom and democracy, we      must ensure an invincible global balance in favor of the      forces of freedom and democracy.       You have just had presidential elections. I don't think the      American people have mandated retreat. On the contrary, I      believe that the outcome of the elections was a reaction to      the receding freedom and democracy and the growing terrorism      and autocracy that you have witnessed during recent years.       I trust America and American leadership. Of course, also      America makes mistakes. But who else should be the leader of      the free world? I'm tempted to quote Winston Churchill who      once said that the Americans will always do the right thing--     after having tried everything else.       Ladies and gentlemen, the world's democracies must rise to      the challenge. America must exercise determined global      leadership.                          ____________________
