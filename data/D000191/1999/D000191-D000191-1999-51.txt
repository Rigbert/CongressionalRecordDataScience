Yesterday, he showed up in my office again, said he understood there were problems and he will fix the program. Now today he has called and said he understands there are problems and he wants to fix the program.  I think if perhaps he meets with the chairman, who controls his budget and his salary, ultimately, and that of all his employees, and the ranking member, maybe this time he will deliver. But I have to tell my colleagues, I am put out by the fact that this is a year later and it has not happened.  And, also, I have to say that I have concerns that go beyond that to the concerns of the committee in terms of how these funds are being spent. And Mr. Lyons admits there is no authorization or control process beyond the local forest. I think that goes to the grave concerns.
