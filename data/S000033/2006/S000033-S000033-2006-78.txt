 Speaker, I wish to speak today about an extraordinary achievement by the teachers, administration and students of a small school in Vermont.  The Robinson Elementary School of Starksboro was one of five schools in the Nation chosen to receive this year's ``Creative Ticket National Schools of Distinction Award.'' The Creative Ticket School Awards provides national recognition ``of the role individual schools play in providing a creative learning environment for outstanding student achievement'' by recognizing ``schools that have developed exemplary arts education programs.''  The arts are a vital part of education, by connecting us through words and images and sounds to our past, by connecting us to one another in a vibrant human community, and by helping us to imagine a future where none are isolated or lonely or without hope. The wonderful work done at Robinson Elementary School is testimony that the arts are alive and flourishing--not just in, but especially, in the small towns of Vermont. And most especially, in Starksboro, a town of just under 2,000 residents.  This award is testimony to the inspired teaching which takes place at Robinson Elementary School, where art, drama, music and writing are integrated into the school curriculum. In particular, let me single out Vera Ryersbach, the art teacher at Robinson Elementary.  And of course I want to single out the students, for schools exist for their students, and the success of any program is measured by how hard and eagerly students pursue their studies. Twenty-five of the students at the 142-student school will be going to the Kennedy Center to perform on the Millennium Stage this coming March. But before that, there will be a community dance celebration in Starksboro, so all the students and community members can share in this great achievement.  Congratulations, too, to Robinson's principal Dan Noel, and to the supporting group for this endeavor, the Vermont Alliance for Arts Education and Anne Tyler, VAAE's executive director, and Elizabeth Miller, VAAE chair.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Page E86]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]       SMALL VERMONT SCHOOL WINS NATIONAL RECOGNITION IN THE ARTS                                 ______                                                           HON.
