 President. This is day 2 of the Senate Democrats' government shutdown, day 2 since the Democratic leader made the political calculation to do something that, according to a recent survey, even most Democrats don't support. He shut down the government to appease a portion of his party's leftwing base. It makes you shake your head. Who comes up with ideas like this?  Well, on Friday, a bipartisan group of Senators voted to advance a bill that would have kept the Federal Government open, provided 6 years of certainty for the State Children's Health Insurance Program--of which at least seven different Governors have written they are in dire straits--and allowed ongoing talks to continue on a variety of other important issues that we have been discussing here for a couple of months. Together, Democrats and Republicans had enough votes to pass it. Five Democrats crossed over and voted against shutting down the government, to keep the government open while we do our work.
