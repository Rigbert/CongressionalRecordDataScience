Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life of Rev. Imre A. Bertalan, devoted husband, father and grandfather, who served as a compassionate pastor of Calvin United Church of Christ and was known for his dedication to his church, his dedication to his Hungarian heritage, and advocating for his beloved East Toledo neighborhood, Birmingham. Imre passed away after a valiant struggle against cancer on August 29, 2017 in Latrobe Hospital in Latrobe, PA.  Imre was born in New Brunswick, New Jersey, on October 4, 1949 to Margaret and the Rev. Imre G. Bertalan. He graduated from New Brunswick High School, held a bachelor's degree from Rutgers University and a master of divinity degree from Princeton Theological Seminary.  Initially not intending to be a minister after graduating from seminary, Imre started as a community organizer and helped form the East Toledo Community Organization. He became a member of East Toledo's Calvin United Church of Christ, which was founded as the Hungarian Evangelical Reformed Church. He was elected pastor in 1979.  During his tenure as pastor, Imre reached out to the congregations of all of the religions in the neighborhood so that Calvin was not just known as a Hungarian church, but as a neighborhood church open to the entire neighborhood.  True to his Hungarian-American roots, Imre was integrally involved in efforts on behalf of America's ethnic communities. A strong representative particularly of the Hungarian-Americans with whom he shared a common heritage, Imre served on the boards of national Hungarian-American organizations for many years. He extended his national efforts to his family, instilling a love of their Hungarian tradition in all. He was encouraging, comforting, filled with abiding kindness and a gentle soul, always advising people that ``everything will be all right.''  After decades in ministry as pastor, Imre became the executive director of Bethlen Communities in Ligonier, PA, a retirement and nursing community founded by the Hungarian Reformed Federation of America. Even after his move to Pennsylvania, Imre and his wife maintained a home in the Birmingham neighborhood of Toledo and were active in the planning for the annual Birmingham Ethnic Festival.  Reverend Imre Bertalan will long be remembered for his dedication to his family, church, the Toledo community at large, and Bethlen Communities. A beautiful memorial service was held for Imre at Calvin United Church of Christ in East Toledo on September 23, 2017. We gathered together and gave thanks for theministry of Reverend Imre Bertalan. Just as importantly, we remembered a loving family man and friend.  We offer Imre's beautiful and artistic wife of almost 37 years, Magdalene ``Baba'' J. Ujvagi, Imre's children, Sara Davis, Magda Bertalan, Juli Bertalan, Margit Bertalan, and Imre Bertalan, his five grandchildren, his sisters Lillian Bertalan and M. Sarah Bertalan, his family and friends our prayers and hope. May they find comfort in the wonderful gift of Imre's life, their memories of their husband, father, brother, uncle, grandfather, friend, his imprimatur on his church and neighborhood. All that he did contributed to humanity's greater good and the glory of God.  Hungarian in his soul, a patriotic American, faithful Vicar of Christ, Imre Bertalan's life was writ large. His life will long echo in his family and friends, his congregations and those he served so well. I know he was welcomed home with ``well done, my good and faithful servant.''                          ____________________
