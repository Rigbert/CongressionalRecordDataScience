That office is one of the most forward-looking segments within the Department of Energy and the group that is driving the huge surge we are seeing across the country in energy innovation.  The future we all envision is in renewable energy, smart grids, energy storage, and energy efficiency. One hundred and ninety countries made it clear to the world that they support this new future in Paris at the end of the last year, and the funding of EERE is critical to ensuring the U.S. leads the world into that future.  Let me mention the solar energy account, in particular, is yielding serious benefits. The number of workers in this growing renewable sector has doubled over the last 5 years, and its rapid expansion shows no signs of slowing down, with solar projected to add 9.5 gigawatts of new energy this year, more than any other energy source.                              {time}  2000  It employs more Americans than work on oil rigs and in gas fields, just in the solar sector.  So I support this amendment to expand the Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Office and the increase in funding that Congressman Polis is offering for a clean energy future for all.
