 President, today I am reintroducing a comprehensive bill I first introduced last summer to make college more affordable for middle-class families. Formally titled the ``Growing the Economy for Tomorrow: Assuring Higher Education is Affordable and Dependable'' Act, it is known as the Get Ahead Act for short.  This legislation contains numerous provisions--some of which have been or will be introduced by others as separate bills; other provisions are novel to this bill--but they all have one thing incommon. They all are an attempt to renew our commitment to see that the American Dream of a college education remains within reach of all Americans.  Because, the plain truth is, that dream is slipping out of reach for many middle-class families. When I was in college 30 some years ago, my parents could send me to a State university for less than 5 percent of their income. And, it stayed about that much--college costs went up each year by about the same amount that the average family's income went up--until 1980. And, then, college costs exploded. Since 1980, the cost of public college tuition and fees has increased nearly three times faster than the average family's income.  We can debate endlessly the reasons why and who or what is to blame. But, all that middle-class families know is that the costs have skyrocketed, and they must constantly worry about how they will ever be able to afford to send their children to college.  For a long time now, Members on both sides of the aisle have believed that the Federal Government has a role and responsibility in helping Americans get to college. Not to guarantee that everyone in America goes to college, but to guarantee that no one who qualifies for college is turned away just because they cannot afford it. It is important for individual Americans--and it is important for the future of America as a whole.  But, I think it is legitimate to question that commitment today when costs are rising out of control; when we spend more on loans that have to be repaid and less on grants that do not; and when the tax law rewards investment in machines but not investment in people.  It is time, Mr. President, to renew and reaffirm our commitment to higher education. And, so, I offer the Get Ahead Act, and I invite my colleagues to join me in this effort.  Let me take just a few minutes to review what this bill would do. And, I ask that a much more detailed summary of the bill be included in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.  First, the Get Ahead Act provides direct tax relief for the costs of higher education. This is accomplished by creating a $10,000 tax deduction for college tuition and fees as well as the interest on student loans. We currently give tax breaks to businesses for investment in the future--in research and development and in the purchase of new plant and equipment. I support that. But, at the same time, we do not provide tax relief to middle-class families who invest in their own children's future through higher education. We should.  In addition, under the Get Ahead Act, all scholarships, including that used for room and board, would be excluded from taxable income, as was the case prior to the 1986 Tax Reform Act.  And, the tax exclusion for employer-provided educational assistance would be extended and made permanent. As my colleagues know, when an employer pays part or all of the costs of an employee's education, that does not have to be counted as income to the employee for tax purposes. Last year, we extended that provision through May 31, 1997. What my bill does is make it a permanent part of the Tax Code--so we do not have to keep coming back and extending it every year or so--and my bill ensures that the tax exclusion applies to both undergraduate and graduate education. Last year, unfortunately in my view, in extending the tax exclusion, we applied it only to undergraduate education.  Second, Mr. President, the Get Ahead Act encourages people to save for the costs of higher education. Specifically, it would allow individuals to withdraw funds from their Individual Retirement Accounts for education expenses--without incurring a 10-percent penalty tax. Also, more Americans would be able to take advantage of Series EE Savings Bonds. These are the bonds where you do not have to pay tax on the interest if the money from the bonds is used to pay for college tuition.  And, my bill would create Education Savings Accounts--accounts similar to IRA's. Each year, families could put tax free up to $2,000 per child into an ESA for their children. That money would accumulate tax free--and you would never have to pay taxes on it if the money was used to pay for college.  Finally, Mr. President, the Get Ahead Act would award merit scholarships to all students who graduate in the top 5 percent of their class. While the $1,000 scholarship would cover about two-thirds of the cost of a community college, I realize this is not a large sum of money for someone attending a 4-year institution, especially if it is a private college. But, it could make a difference for many students, and I believe that, regardless, it is important that we start to reward students who meet high academic standards.  There is one provision not in the bill that was in last year's bill. Last year, I included a section clarifying the Federal tax treatment of State prepaid tuition plans. Similar provisions were enacted last year as part of the minimum wage bill, and therefore I did not need to include them in this year's bill.  Mr. President, the Get Ahead Act is aimed at seeing that individual Americans have the opportunity to get ahead. In today's economy, in today's world, you need a college education to do it. And, for those who would criticize this proposal as a handout to the middle class, let them ponder what the future of America will be like if the vast masses of the middle class are denied a college education.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                           The Get Ahead Act title i--tax incentives for higher education; subtitle a--tax relief for higher education costs; section 101--deduction for higher education                                 expenses       An above-the-line tax deduction (available even to those      who do not itemize deductions) would be allowed for the costs      of college tuition and fees as well as interest on college      loans.       In the case of tuition costs, beginning in tax year 2000,      the maximum annual deduction would be $10,000 per year; a      maximum deduction of $5,000 would be available in tax years      1997, 1998, and 1999. The full deduction would be available      to single taxpayers with incomes under $70,000 and married      couples with incomes under $100,000; a reduced (phased-out)      deduction would be available to those with incomes up to      $90,000 (singles) and $120,000 (couples). The income      thresholds would be indexed annually for inflation.       Interest on student loans would be deductible beginning      with interest payments made in tax year 1997. Interest      payments could be deducted on top of the $10,000 deduction      for payment of college tuition and fees. There would be no      annual maximum and no income limits with regard to the      deductibility of interest on student loans.       Language is included to coordinate this tax deduction with      other education provisions of the tax code--to ensure that      individuals do not receive a double benefit for the same      payments. Specifically, qualified higher education expenses      that could be tax deductible would be reduced by any payments      made from Series EE savings bonds (and excluded from taxable      income), any veterans educational assistance provided by the      federal government, and any other payments from tax-exempt      sources (e.g. employer-provided educational assistance).      Also, tax-free scholarships and tax-excluded funds from      Education Savings Accounts (see section 112) would first be      attributed to room and board costs; the remainder, if any,      would count against tuition and fees and would reduce the      amount that would be tax deductible. However, if tuition and      fees still exceeded $10,000 even after the reductions, the      full tax deduction would be available.        section 102--exclusion for scholarships and fellowships       College scholarships and fellowship grants would not be      considered income for the purposes of federal income taxes.      This returns the tax treatment of scholarships and      fellowships to their treatment prior to the 1986 Tax Reform      Act (which limited the exclusion of scholarships and      fellowships to that used for tuition and fees).       Scholarships and fellowship grants would be fully      excludable for degree candidates. In the case of non-degree      candidates, individuals would be eligible for a lifetime      exclusion of $10,800--$300 per month for a maximum 36 months.       Language is included to clarify that federal grants for      higher education that are conditioned on future service (such      as National Health Service Corps grants for medical students)      would still be eligible for tax exclusion.       This section would be effective beginning with scholarships      and fellowship grants used in tax year 1997.      section 103--permanent exclusion for educational assistance       As part of the minimum wage/small business tax relief bill      enacted in 1996, the tax exclusion for employer-provided      educational assistance was reinstated retroactively and      extended through May 31, 1997. But, as of July 1, 1996, the      tax exclusion only applies to educational assistance for      undergraduate education.       This section would extend the employer-provided educational      assistance tax exclusion by making it a permanent part of the      tax code. In addition, it would retroactively reinstate the      tax exclusion for graduate education.  subtitle b--encouraging savings for higher education costs; section    111--ira distributions used without penalty for higher education                                 expenses       Funds could be withdrawn from Individual Retirement      Accounts (IRAs) before age 59\1/2\ without being subject to      the 10 percent penalty tax if the funds were used for higher      education tuition and fees. (However, withdrawn funds, if      deductible when contributed to the IRA, would be considered      gross income for the purposes of federal income taxes.)       This section would be effective upon enactment.                section 112--education savings accounts       This section would create IRA-like accounts--known as      Education Savings Accounts (ESAs)--for the purpose of      encouraging savings for a college education.       Each year, a family could invest up to $2000 per child      under the age of 19 in an ESA. For single taxpayers with      incomes under $70,000 (phased out up to $90,000) and married      couples with incomes under $100,000 (phased out up to      $120,000), the contributions would be tax deductible. (These      income thresholds would be indexed annually for inflation.)      For all taxpayers, the interest in an ESA would accumulate      tax free; the contributions would not be subject to the      federal gift tax; and, the balance in an ESA would not be      treated as an asset or income for the purposes of determining      eligibility for federal means-tested programs.       ESA funds could be withdrawn to meet the higher education      expenses--tuition, fees, books, supplies, equipment, and room      and board--of the beneficiary. Funds withdrawn for other      purposes would be subject to a 10 percent penalty tax and      would be considered income for the purposes of federal income      taxes (to the extent that the funds were tax deductible when      contributed). The penalty tax would not apply in cases of      death or disability of the beneficiary of the ESA and in      cases of unemployment of the contributors.       In addition, when the beneficiary of the account turns age      30 and is not enrolled in college at least half time, any      funds remaining in the ESA would be (1) transferred to      another ESA; (2) donated to an educational institution; or      (3) refunded to the contributors. In the first two cases,      there would be no penalty tax and the money would not be      considered taxable income. In the third case, the penalty tax      would not apply, but the funds would be counted as income to      the extent that the funds were tax deductible when      contributed.       Finally, parent could roll over funds from one child's ESA      to another child's ESA without regard to any taxes, without      regard to the $2000 annual maximum contribution to an ESA,      and without regard to the age 30 requirement note above.      Funds rolled over would also not be subject to the federal      gift tax.       Language is also included to allow individuals to designate      contributions to an ESA as nondeductible even if such      contributions could be tax deductible. This gives families      the option to build up the principal in an ESA while at a      lower tax rate, rather than having to pay taxes on unspent      ESA funds when the contributors are older and likely in a      higher tax bracket.       Tax deductible contributions to ESAs would be allowed      beginning in tax year 1997.   section 113--increase in income limits for savings bond exclusion       For taxpayers with incomes below certain thresholds, the      interest earned on Series EE U.S. Savings Bonds are not      considered taxable income if the withdrawn funds are used to      pay for higher education tuition and fees. This section      increases the income thresholds to allow more Americans to      use the Series EE Savings Bonds for education expenses.       Effective with tax year 1997, the income thresholds would      be the same as the income thresholds for the higher education      tax deduction (see section 101): $70,000 for single taxpayers      (phased out up to $90,000), and $100,000 for couples (phased      out up to $120,000). As with the higher education tax      deduction, these income thresholds would be indexed annually      for inflation.            title ii--scholarships for academic achievement       Beginning with the high school graduating class of 1998,      the top 5 percent of graduating seniors at each high school      in the United States would be eligible for a $1000 merit      scholarship. If an individual receiving such a scholarship      achieved a 3.0 (``B'') average during his or her first year      of college, a second $1000 scholarship would be awarded.       However, the merit scholarships would be available only to      those students in families with income under $70,000 (single)      and $100,000 (couples). These income thresholds would be      increased annually for inflation.       Funds are authorized (and subject to annual appropriations)      for five years. The first year authorization (fiscal year      1998) is $130 million. In each of the next four years (FY      1999-FY 2002), because the scholarships could be renewed for      a second year, the authorization is $260 million per year.      Total five-year authorization: $1.17 billion.                     title iii--deficit neutrality       To ensure that the ``GET AHEAD'' Act does not increase the      deficit, this title declares it the sense of the Senate that      the costs of the bill should be paid by closing corporate tax      loopholes.                                 ______                                       By
