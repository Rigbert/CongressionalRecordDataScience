 However, it is important that we get this bipartisan JOBS bill that passed the House overwhelmingly and that the President supports on down to the President. So it is going to be my recommendation to my Members, which I hope they will follow, that we oppose cloture on adding the Ex-Im to this bill.  I say to my friend the majority leader, I have discussed this with virtually all my Members. We believe that if you turn to the Ex-Im matter, we can pass it in a relatively short time with very few amendments related to the subject matter. But I think it is important that we get this JOBS bill down to the President.  I urge my colleagues at this particular point on this particular bill to oppose cloture.
