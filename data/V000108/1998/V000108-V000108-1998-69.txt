Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.R. 3246 and would like to take this opportunity to talk about union organizing. The people of the debate here are correct. Much work needs to be done. But the work to be done is not to stifle people's opportunity to associate with one another on an economic basis, but to protect access of workers to legitimate union representation. The real problem which needs to be addressed in this House is that every year clear majorities of workers at businesses across the country indicate their support for union representation and 1, 2 or 3 years later the representation is still not approved because it is tied up with appeals to the National Labor Relations Board. In the meantime, unscrupulous employers too often take advantage of the opportunity to illegally intimidate, fire or commit other unfair labor practices against workers in order to defeat subsequent votes on union representation. H.R. 3246 would simply aggravate this problem. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting against the bill. Instead this House needs to pass real labor law reform.
