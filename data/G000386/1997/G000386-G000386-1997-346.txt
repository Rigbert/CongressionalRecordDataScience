 President, today, as I introduce this legislation called the Family Farm Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act of 1997, it is a way that 54 of us in this body--and we will still yet get more cosponsors, I am sure--are saying, ``Shame on the Internal Revenue Service.'' This is our effort to hold the tax-collecting bureaucracy of the U.S. Government accountable to what Congress intended. We are holding them accountable to the taxpayers, and we will reduce somewhat the power of the IRS which comes through intimidation. I have worked very closely with three other Senators in a bipartisan fashion, Senator Dorgan, Senator Gorton, and Senator Baucus. I thank them for their leadership and their cooperation. We have been joined now by 50 of our colleagues in a broad bipartisan effort, with the support of the leadership of both parties, meaning Senator Lott and Senator Daschle. I think that the sort of membership cosponsoring this legislation speaks louder, frankly, than anything I can say about the rationale behind this bill.  This bill repeals a very large problem created by the IRS regarding farmer-deferred contract arrangements. The problem is currently at a crisis level because it is income tax time. Particularly, it is income tax time for the farmers of America who must file earlier than others.  The IRS has found a way to tax farmers for their deferred sales contracts. This is contrary to congressional intent. I know the Presiding Officer is from Kansas and he understands this, but some might not. A deferred sales contract is a situation where a farmer delivers his crop this year and gets paid by the local cooperative elevator, or privately owned elevator, or some other buyer next year. Since Congress intends farmers to be able to use the cash accounting method, deferred contracts have been a perfectly acceptable method to defer income to another year for taxation. It has been perfectly legal over a long period of time.  Now the IRS has unilaterally decided to deem these traditional deferred sales contracts as if, in the words of the IRS, these were ``installment sales'' agreements. The problem is that installment sales are subject to the alternative minimum tax. Then, of course, by doing this, the IRS puts the family farmer in trouble for things that, over a long period of time, have been entirely legal.  This IRS initiative is a way for the IRS to deny farmers the use of the cash accounting method. When Congress passed the Tax Reform Act of 1986, it specifically intended that farmers retain the cash accounting method. That same act repealed the income averaging method for farmers. Income averaging was a way for farmers to level out their regularly large fluctuations of income between years. Farmers can have those fluctuations because, while local farmers are affected by local weather and the weather all over the world.  Listen to the prices of soybeans today. You will find that whether or not it rains right now in Brazil or Argentina is impacting the price of soybeans in Iowa and Kansas. The crop prices are affected by crop disease and a host of other things that ordinary taxpayers take for granted, that farmers have no control over. When income averaging was repealed, Congress intended farmers to retain the cash method of accounting. We are here today with this bill because the IRS has effectively repealed cash accounting, in opposition to the intent of Congress.  Cash accounting is repealed because the traditional deferred sales contracts are the practical application of cash accounting. By applying the alternative minimum tax, IRS has repealed the deferral in deferred contracts. They are contracts but no longer deferred income. Thus, the IRS has unilaterally broken the promise that Congress made to farmers, and our legislation rights that wrong.  Ironically, the IRS knows it is in the wrong on this matter, but, of course, the IRS is going to go ahead anyway. After all, they encourage, from the top to the bottom of the IRS bureaucracy, auditors to go out and find all the income they can to tax, and to stretch the law as far as they can. And if they do it in this instance, in the case of taxing deferred sales contracts, do you think the Internal Revenue Commissioner or the Secretary of the Treasury is going to say to some auditor out there--slap their hands and say, ``You are wrong''? No, they are not going to do that. That would be the right thing to do, but they are not going to do that because that would discourage this attitude we have had in the IRS. They want to go out and get every dollar they can, even if they have to stretch the law to do it.  Well, in a sense, the Secretary of the Treasury, Robert Rubin--and I thank him--and IRS Commissioner Richardson--and I thank her--have agreed that this problem results from what they call legislative oversight in 1986, because they do not want to say their auditors may be wrong. So, they have agreed, in the spirit of this Presidency, this second term of office, that we are going to be bipartisan and we are going to work together to solve these problems. So Secretary Rubin and IRS Commissioner Richardson have said they would not oppose this legislation. They agree that Congress did not intend for farmer deferred contracts to make these contract incomes subject to the AMT. However, as I indicated, these two individuals believe they still must enforce what they know to be a bad law. Hence, the urgent need for our legislation.  You know, it would be really simple for the Commissioner to say, ``We are wrong. We are not going to collect this money.'' But they cannot do that, presumably.  Not only is this ruling of the IRS effective right now and into the future, it is also retroactive. It is retroactive because, since it is a new interpretation of an old law, the IRS can pretend it has not changed its position, though it obviously has. Since it is retroactive, farmers are exposed to audit, not only for the current year and upon future years, but also on previous years. This problem is now in crisis proportions for farmers. The IRS made its retroactive change in October of 1996. At that time, much of the 1996 crop was already harvested. Farmers had already entered the traditional binding deferred contracts. They normally do this throughout the 12 months of the year. So, do we wonder why it is all of a sudden a crisis among farmers?  Before the IRS release, farmers had every reason to believe they would enjoy the same legal tax treatment previously allowed by IRS.  Congress and the President must address and solve this problem as soon as possible. Farmers are required to file their tax returns before March 1, 1997. This is unlike most other taxpayers who have until April 15. If Congress waits until after March 1 to fix this problem, then hundreds of thousands of farmers all across this country will already have been injured.  The IRS knows it is wrong on this issue, but it is out of control. It injures its own public relations by actions such as this. It is a sad commentary that it takes an emergency action of Congress to make the IRS do its job as Congress intended. Nonetheless, our bill will do exactly that.  Mr. President, besides being on the Finance Committee where this legislation will be considered, I happen to also be a member of a commission the Congress set up last year to restructure the IRS. There are two Senators, two House Members, and 13 people from the private sector on that commission. We have 1 year from last fall to make our report to the Congress.  The charter from the Congress to all 17 of us is to, in a sense, make the IRS more user friendly. Although we are at the same time kept from recommending changes in tax policy, how we administer the existing Tax Code is what we are dealing. We are examining how the IRS does its work and what we can do to enhance that from an efficiency standpoint. We want to save the taxpayers money and also to make IRS more customer friendly.  After 6 months of being on this commission--though the ultimate good ismaking the IRS more efficient and more customer friendly--it is my opinion that we need to make the Tax Code so simple that every single taxpayer understands the Tax Code as well as any IRS auditor understands that Tax Code. The complexity of the Tax Code gives the IRS its power. It is the mystery of the Tax Code, a mystery that the bureaucrat can sort through and understand, and the inability of the taxpayer to do that which brings the power of the auditor that gives IRS its power. The power to intimidate comes through the tax system.  So I ask my colleagues to observe the action of the commission to restructure the IRS and work with Senator Kerrey from Nebraska and myself as representatives of the Senate on this issue. Let us know your opinions, but also understand that the complexity of the Tax Code is the major problem that we must fix. The bill that I am introducing today is just one very small example of the complexity of the Tax Code. It is an action against the intimidation of the IRS and impacts. In most cases, IRS usually attacks maybe just a few hundred taxpayers throughout the United States on some issues. On this particular issue, affecting a practice that has been legal by the farmers of the United States of America for decades, they are attacking thousands and thousands. They want farmers to think that all of a sudden what they have been doing is now presumably wrong.  I hope that Congress will work very quickly to pass this legislation before that March 1 deadline. It is badly needed to prevent an irreparable injury to farmers, and to make the Tax Code more understandable for the taxpayers. We also are sending a clear signal to the IRS: Shame on you.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 181       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Family Farm Alternative      Minimum Tax Relief Act of 1997''.     SEC. 2. MINIMUM TAX NOT TO APPLY TO FARMERS' INSTALLMENT                    SALES.       (a) In General.--The last sentence of paragraph (6) of      section 56(a) (relating to treatment of installment sales in      computing alternative minimum taxable income) is amended to      read as follows: ``This paragraph shall not apply to any      disposition--       ``(A) in the case of a taxpayer using the cash receipts and      disbursements method of accounting, described in section      453(l)(2)(A) (relating to farm property), or       ``(B) with respect to which an election is in effect under      section 453(l)(2)(B) (relating to timeshares and residential      lots).''       (b) Effective Dates.--       (1) In general.--The amendment made by this section shall      apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1987.       (2) Special rule for 1987.--In the case of taxable years      beginning in 1987, the last sentence of section 56(a)(6) of      the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (as in effect for such      taxable years) shall be applied by inserting ``or in the case      of a taxpayer using the cash receipts and disbursements      method of accounting, any disposition described in section      453(l)(2)(A)'' after ``section 453C(e)(4)''.                                  ____                                       Department of the Treasury,                                     Internal Revenue Service,                                Washington, DC, December 19, 1996.     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Grassley: Thank you for giving me the      opportunity to meet with you to discuss your concerns about      an Internal Revenue Service Technical Advice Memorandum or      TAM concerning the tax treatment of farmers. The TAM stated      that farmers utilizing deferred payment contracts for the      sale of farm commodities were required to include the amount      of the advanced sale for Alternative Minimum Tax or AMT      purposes in the year of sale.       As I told you in our meeting, we believe that this TAM      correctly interprets current law. I understand that Congress      may consider legislation early next session to change this      result for farmers who use the cash method of accounting. As      you may be aware, Secretary Rubin, in a letter to Senator      Daschle on the same issue, stated the following regarding      this legislative change, ``We would support the goals of this      effort, as a reasonable tax policy, and recognize it is      likely that Congress was not aware of the effect that its      1986 amendments to the AMT would have on farmers. I welcome      the opportunity to work with you to address this matter      through corrective legislation.''       We also will be pleased to work with you and Treasury on      the corrective legislation. Please feel free to contact me if      I can be of any further assistance.           Sincerely,                                        Margaret Miner Richardson.  s
