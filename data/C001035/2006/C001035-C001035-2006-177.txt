President, I appreciate the comments of the Senator from New York. The conditions in New York, as far as respiratory equipment, may have been different. But I have worked closely with Senator Voinovich on his broader bill. We reported it from the Homeland Security Committee. He offered it today as an amendment. I hope, perhaps, we can have a meeting of the minds on what is a real problem. We do not want those who were so brave that horrible day to not receive assistance, care, and monitoring for health problems associated with their bravery, regardless of which environment they were in.  The second issue I have to raise is the extent of the resources that will be needed to deal with this issue. I don't know the basis for the nearly $2 billion authorization that the Senator has come up with, so I cannot comment on it.  That leads me to my third point, which is the way the Senator has drafted this amendment, directing the Secretary of HHS, through the Director of the CDC, to allocate the funds. That means it is not in the jurisdiction of the Homeland Security Committee, oreven the Commerce Committee or Finance Committee. It is in the jurisdiction of the HELP Committee. So I have asked staff to notify the HELP Committee of this amendment so that they have an opportunity to review it.  With that, let me again repeat that I think the Senator from New York has identified a real problem. It is not germane to the underlying port security bill, but it is an urgent and real problem. It is in another committee's jurisdiction. We have a different approach that the Homeland Security Committee has taken in working with Senator Voinovich because this even goes beyond 9/11.  I know the Senator from New York has also worked with Senator Voinovich on his amendment, which is under the Homeland Security Committee's jurisdiction. So I suggest that we get some input from Senator Enzi and Senator Kennedy, since they are the committee of jurisdiction.  Thank you, Mr. President.
