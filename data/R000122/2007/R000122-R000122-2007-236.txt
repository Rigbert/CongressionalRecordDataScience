President, I would like to acknowledge that today, March 6th, 2007, we celebrate the 17th annual National Sportsmanship Day. Created by the Institute for International Sport at the University of Rhode Island in 1991, this initiative seeks to promote and develop the highest ideals of sportsmanship and fair play among not only America's youth but also the international community. Over its 17 years, more than 13,500 schools and 80 million individuals across all 50 States and many countries around the world have participated in National Sportsmanship Day activities. On this day, in elementary schools, middle schools, high schools, and colleges, students, teachers, coaches, and parents will discuss issues regarding sportsmanship and fair play.  This year, National Sportsmanship Day will focus on the themes ``Don't Punch Back, Play Harder'' and ``Defeat Gamesmanship.'' These themes will prompt participants to explore the practical values of ``competitive self-restraint'' and playing within the intended spirit of the rules. It is important for both our society and our culture that we instill these values in our youth. Additionally, the celebration will include the 14th annual USA Today National Sportsmanship Day Essay Contest.  I am pleased to say that Rhode Island is home to the Institute for International Sport and National Sportsmanship Day. For 17 years, the institute and this initiative have enhanced the nature and health of competition among our Nation's youth. The efforts of Senator Claiborne Pell and his able staff member Barry Sklar, Senator John Chafee, founder Dan Doyle, and many others have contributed to the success of this endeavor. I know that this year's National Sportsmanship Day celebration will continue to promote fair play and in so doing ensure a sound foundation of sportsmanship for today and for the future.                          ____________________
