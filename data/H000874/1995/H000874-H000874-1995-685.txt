Speaker, today I joined hundreds of college and university students from around the Washington metropolitan area in a rally against proposed cuts in student aid and loan programs. The average American family today simply cannot afford to send a child--much less two or three--to college without some form of student aid. That is why I believe that cutting student aid is penny-wise and pound foolish. The Republican tax cut bill wants to provide families with a $500 per child tax cut, while at the same time proposing that each student who receives student loans will pay, on the average, about $4,000 more in additional interest costs over the 10-year life of a loan.  At today's rally was a young graduate student from the University of Maryland. Mr. Dominic Perri spoke on behalf of the National Association of Graduate and Professional Students and spoke of the additional costs that he and thousands of graduate students across this country would be forced to pay under this Republican plan. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to share with my colleagues the remarks of Mr. Perri and urge my colleagues to read his remarks and understand the severity of these potential student aid cuts.   Remarks of Dominic J Perri, National Association of Graduate and                          Professional Students       Good Afternoon, my name is Dominic Perri. I am a graduate      student at the University of Maryland at College Park, and I      want      [[Page E809]] to speak to you on behalf of the National      Association of Graduate and Professional Students.       I want to talk to you about the effect the loss of the      interest exemption and other proposed cuts would have on      graduate and professional students. Lately opponents to      student aid have made statements that trivialize the effect      of these cuts.       One opponent of student aid here at the Capital claims that      the loss of the interest exemption would cost students just      $21 a month. ``So they won't be able to buy 2 CD's'' he told      USA Today.       Now, in addition to knowing where he buys his CD's, I'd      like to know where he got his numbers. You see, for the      graduate student who takes out loans to get an M.A., the loss      of the interest exemption means that the loan payments could      increase as much as $110 a month. Or to put in terms our      friend can understand, that's 11 CD's.       And just yesterday, another opponent of student aid claimed      that the loss of the interest exemption would cost just . . .      pennies a month.       Tell that to the graduate student who completes a Ph.D. and      winds up with over $68,000 in loans. The loss of the interest      exemption could cost this student an additional $33,000.      That's an increase of over $400 in the monthly payments, . .      . or 40,000 pennies.       So you see, while eliminating the interest exemption is a      disaster for undergrads, its even worse for graduate      students. Of course, the opponents of student aid have simply      chosen to ignore the effects these cuts would have on more      than a million graduate and professional students.       These cuts could drive many of these students right out of      school. That's a loss that this country cannot afford.       This is because graduate programs prepare the nation's most      highly skilled      workforce, including faculty, business and industry leaders,      social workers, physicians, ministers, researchers, and      professionals.       Research conducted by graduate students contributes      directly to economic growth. The University of California      says that graduate student research drove the development of      the biotechnology industry that today employs 80,000      Californians!!       In fact, studies show that U.S. economic production is      directly related to government spending in higher education.       In the last week Governor Carlson of MN and Governor George      Bush of Texas have both issued statements that ``quality      graduate education is crucial to the global competitiveness      of the United States.''       Graduate students are a valuable resource that the      opponents of student aid seemed to have ignored. They have      not taken calculated the devastating effect of their cuts on      this nation's graduate and professional students. (Pause) But      we have.       The National Association of Graduate and Professional      Students warns you not to be deceived by those who would      trivialize the effect of these cuts. These cuts are real,      unwise, and undermine the very foundation of higher      education.                               ____________________
