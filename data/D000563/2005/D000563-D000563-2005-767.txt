President, I thank the Senator from Mississippi for coming over to the floor because I knowthere are thousands of agricultural producers across the United States who were anxious to hear we are mindful of the disasters they have faced and in the region of Hurricane Katrina and other natural disasters across our country.  I ask unanimous consent that the following cosponsors be added to the amendment I have sent to the desk: My colleague from Illinois, Senator Obama, who shares my feelings on the drought that has faced our State, as well as my colleague from across the Mississippi River, Senator Bond.
