Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I would ask the ranking member if he does not object to the fact that the United Nations took $400 million of what was intended to be money to pay for inspections at a time when they were not having inspections.  I would ask the ranking member if he is not concerned with a report from the Wall Street Journal that the U.N. took $100 million from the Oil-For-Food Program and used it for operations.  I would be concerned whether the ranking member or any Republican or any Democrat is not concerned with the fact that a United Nations employee who was handling the Oil-For-Food Program, Mr. Sevan, has now written letters, according to Mr. Volcker's staff, suggesting that the information not be released regarding this program.  It is obvious there has been some misuse of money. I would like to suggest that the real story here is that many countries make decisions based on what is good for their country as representatives to the United Nations with no regard for the goals and ideals of the U.N. charter. Certainly this calls the Security Council's moral authority into question and degrades its capacity to respond appropriately to events throughout the world.  Is it any wonder that under pressure from these countries the U.N. could not agree to support us in Iraq? Is it any wonder that at the first threat of danger the U.N. pulled out of Iraq?  It seems to me, Mr. Chairman, that we need to carry out a full and thorough investigation and make changes if the U.S. is to continue with some degree of confidence. And we need to send this signal of this reduction with this kind of testimony regarding a $20 million reduction for the U.N. I think this action sends the beginning of a message that our country and the taxpayers of this country will not stand for this kind of abuse.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
