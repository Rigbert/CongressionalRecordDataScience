 We stand ready to continue to talk with him about any way that we can find that allows him and other colleagues on the other side to believe we have moved.  We also have to deal with a number of colleagues, both Republicans and Democrats, who believe as strongly as I do in safety. And we will continue to have those discussions and negotiations as long as possible.  The amendment sent forward by the Senator from Texas is about whether or not we can put provisions into legislation that require safety on our highways regarding Mexican trucks. Any effort by the Senator from Texas to change that and try to talk about other issues simply is not fact. This is an issue of safety. The provisions under the bill do, in fact, subject Mexican trucks to stricter provisions than do Canadian trucks, but there is a very good reason for that. It is shown on this chart.  Of the trucks that are inspected, 36 percent found in violation are Mexican trucks; 24 percent, American; only 14 percent, Canadian. It is very clear that Mexican trucks crossing the border have safety violations. That is why a number of our constituents across this country are telling us that, in order to move forward the NAFTA provisions, we need to ensure that our people who are driving on the highway, who see Mexican trucks or Canadian trucks or American trucks, know they are in fact safe.  This isn't discriminating against Mexico. It is ensuring the safety of the American public is something that this Congress and this Senate stands behind.  I am a supporter of NAFTA. I am a supporter of free trade. But I am not a supporter of allowing the American public traveling our highways to be unsafe. The provisions in the underlying bill do not violate NAFTA, no matter what the Senator from Texas says. That is not just my opinion. It is the opinion of the arbitration panel under NAFTA that said in their document:       The United States may not be required to treat applications      from Mexican trucking firms in exactly the same manner as      applications from United States or Canadian firms. . . . U.S.      authorities are responsible for the safe operations of trucks      within U.S. territory, whether ownership is United States,      Canadian or Mexican.  Clearly, they tell us that we have the right in this country to ensure that trucks coming across our borders are safe. That is what the Murray-Shelby amendment does. It is not just my opinion. It is the opinion of the NAFTA arbitration panel that is very clear about that.  The Senator from Texas is trying to say we are violating provisions of NAFTA. We are not. We are assuring, as we have a right to under the treaty, that people who travel in this country, families who are on vacation, traveling to work, dropping their kids off at school, know that the trucks on the highway with them follow specific safety provisions. That is what the underlying amendment does.  The amendment before us clearly is an attempt to gut those safety provisions and will mean that families in this country cannot be assured of their safety.  We have a right under NAFTA to do that. As a supporter of NAFTA, I will fight with everything I have to assure that the American public is safe under any treaty obligation we have.  I thank the Chair.                       Vote On Amendment No. 1033
