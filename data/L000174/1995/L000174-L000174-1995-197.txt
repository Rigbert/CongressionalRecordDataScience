President, I want to thank Senators Gramm, Hollings and Levin for working with me to find an appropriate solution to the zebra mussel problem that has overtaken the Great Lakes and Lake Champlain. I hope Senators Hollings and Levin can join me in a brief colloquy on the Hollings-Levin-Leahy amendment.  For Senators who may not be familiar with the zebra mussel, I want to briefly describe the challenge facing the State of Vermont. Zebra mussels, which are tiny, fresh-water mollusks the size of my thumbnail, threaten to choke off 25 percent of Vermont's drinking water, clog our hatcheries and unravel the Lake Champlain ecosystem.  We did not ask for the mussels, but we got them. I was scuba diving in Lake Champlain this summer and was shocked to find mussels taking over the lake bottom, historic ship wrecks included. Three years ago we had no zebra mussels--this summer I found mussels by the handful.  The zebra mussel problem in Lake Champlain deserves immediate and swift action. This pest poses a serious risk to the water resources throughout Vermont, economic opportunities along the lake, and the health and safety of Vermonters. In the not-so-distant future, some Vermonters may turn on their taps to find nothing flowing, as these mussels have blocked water intakes and delivery systems up and down the shoreline.  The biggest hurdle our States face is the fact that there is no proven control technology. It is like the State of Vermont looking for a solution to cancer--by itself. The Hollings-Levin-Leahy amendment provides a modest contribution of Federal assistance that will help address the zebra mussel problem.  My understanding is that this amendment includes $100,000 specifically for Vermont to tackle the problem. Our State Legislature has appropriated millions of dollars to address the problem, and this token of Federal support will make a big difference.
