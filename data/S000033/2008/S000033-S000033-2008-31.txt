 Specifically, the article focuses on how a small group of people in the White House--the President, the Vice President, the Vice President's Chief of Staff, and a few others--decided through their own twisted interpretation of the Constitution that with the President's say-so alone, they had the power to perform warrantless surveillance on innocent Americans known as the NSA warrantless wiretapping program. They created a program almost completely outside of the authority of our laws based on the principle that because the President of the United States is the Commander in Chief, and it is his job to protect the country, anything they think of that protects this country--anything that fights terrorism--is justified under the Constitution. That, in my view, is dead wrong.
