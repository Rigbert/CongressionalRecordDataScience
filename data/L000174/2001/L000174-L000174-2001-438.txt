President, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this resolution to honor our Federal, State and local law enforcement officers who gave the ultimate sacrifice for our public safety. I commend Senator Campbell for his leadership in submitting Senate Resolution 63.  I want to recognize the other cosponsors of the resolution on the Senate Judiciary Committee: Senators Hatch, Kennedy, Thurmond, Biden, Grassley, Kohl, DeWine, Feinstein, Sessions, Feingold, Brownback, Schumer, McConnell, and Durbin.  Since my time as a State prosecutor, I have always taken a keen interest inlaw enforcement in Vermont and around the country. Vermont has the reputation of being one of the safest States in which to live, work and visit, and rightly so. In no small part, this is due to the hard work of those who have sworn to serve and protect us, and we should do what we can to honor them and their families.  Our Nation's law enforcement officers put their lives at risk in the line of duty everyday. No one knows when danger will appear. Unfortunately, in today's violent world, even a traffic stop may not necessarily be ``routine.''  Each and every law enforcement officer across the Nation deserves our heartfelt respect and appreciation on Peace Officers Memorial Day.
