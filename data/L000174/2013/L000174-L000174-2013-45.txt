President, we are at a watershed moment in the history of intelligence oversight, like nothing I have seen since the Church Committee. Some of the recent revelations have led to important national conversations about the scope of our Nation's intelligence gathering powers here at home, and to renewed legislative efforts to recalibrate those authorities and the related oversight regimes. The USA FREEDOM Act that Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner and I introduced last week along with more than 100 members of Congress does just that.  It is important, however, to acknowledge that some of the leaks have led to needless risk to our national security and have threatened our relationships with some of our most important international partners.  And all of this leads back to a 29-year-old contractor named Edward Snowden.  Let me make clear once more that I do not condone the way any of these highly classified programs were disclosed. I am deeply concerned about the potential damage to our intelligence gathering capabilities, foreign relationships, and national security.  I am also deeply concerned that one person could wreak this much havoc in such a short period of time. Especially in the wake of the Private Manning leaks, I do not understand how the National Security Agency could have allowed this to happen.  This past weekend, Colbert King wrote in the Washington Post that this damage was, in a sense, self-inflicted. I ask unanimous consent that the King op-ed be printed in the Record. As Mr. King put it, ``I want to know how Snowden got his hands on so much of the nation's most sensitive intelligence and was able to flee the country, all within three months.''  I want to know too. We need to hold people accountable for allowing such a massive leak to occur and we need to change the way we do business to ensure that we prevent this type of breach in the future. In public and in private, I have continued to ask the leaders of the intelligence community to tell me who is being held accountable and what is being done to prevent this from happening again.  Without adequate answers to these questions, the American people are rightly concerned that their private information could be swept up into a massive database, and then compromised. The NSA has acknowledged that it is collecting U.S. phone records on an unprecedented scale, and that it is also collecting massive amounts of Internet content against targets abroad, which also includes some communications of law-abiding Americans. And yet the government asks us to trust that it will keep this information safe, and that we should have faith in its internal policies and procedures.  This plea comes from the same intelligence community that the FISAcourt found to have made substantial misrepresentations about the scope of its collection; and the same intelligence community that allowed Edward Snowden to steal such vast amounts of information.  And it comes from the same intelligence community whose inspector general just wrote to tell me that he is unable at this time to conduct a communitywide review of government activities conducted under section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act and section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. I ask unanimous consent that the September 23, 2013, letter from a bipartisan group of Senate Judiciary Committee members to the inspector general of the intelligence community be printed in the Record, as well as his November 5, 2013, response.  The intelligence community faces a trust deficit, and I am particularly concerned that the NSA has strayed and overreached beyond its core missions. One important step toward rebuilding that trust would be for the NSA to spend less of its time collecting data on innocent Americans, and more on keeping our Nation's secrets safe and holding its own accountable.  The Senate Judiciary Committee will continue its work on these issues in the next few weeks. On November 13, the Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology, and the Law will hold a hearing on Senator Franken's Surveillance Transparency Act, which I have cosponsored. And on November 20, I have invited back to the committee Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, NSA Director Keith Alexander, and Deputy Attorney General James Cole for another hearing to review the intelligence community's surveillance authorities.                [From the Washington Post, Nov. 2, 2013]      Latest NSA Spying Revelations Distract From the Real Issues                          (By Colbert I. King)       What's this about governments spying on their closest      allies?       We called it ``the bubble.'' It was a 12-by-15-foot      acoustic conference room made of clear plastic and aluminum.      There were at least five inches of space between the walls of      the bubble and the walls of the room in which it was located.      The bubble's plastic walls, ceiling and floor allowed visual      inspection for electronic listening devices, or ``bugs.''       As an extra security measure, a noise-generating machine      was installed in the outer room to prevent interception of      any discussions of classified information within the bubble.      The outer room was secured by a combination lock, the code      known only to my office.       The first U.S. ``bubble'' was installed after hidden      microphones were found in American diplomatic missions in      Moscow, Prague and elsewhere in the 1960s.       Our bubble, within a room on an upper floor of the U. S.      Embassy in Bad Godesberg, West Germany, was a countermeasure      against possible technical penetration by the Soviet KGB and      the East German Stasi. But Eastern Bloc countries weren't the      only concern.       Our bubble allowed classified discussions to occur beyond      the hearing of our host and ally, the-then Federal Republic      of Germany, and our friends down the road in the French and      British embassies.       That was nearly 50 years ago.       This year, in my current capacity, I was sitting in the      office of an ambassador in Washington when a member of his      staff alerted him to an important call. There was a phone on      the ambassador's desk. But he left the room to take the call.       It turns out that his prime minister was calling from      overseas. The ambassador went to a secure location in the      embassy where he could conduct a confidential conversation.       True, he was in the capital city of his nation's closest      ally. But the matter to be discussed was for the ears of his      countrymen only, U. S. friendship notwithstanding.       Today, as the United States has been doing for decades,      close allies in Europe, the Middle East and elsewhere take      similar precautions even when their missions are in friendly      countries.       Gentlemen may know that it is bad form to read each other's      mail or to eavesdrop. But in diplomacy and national security,      the desire to know what another country is up to tends to      overwhelm any sense of rectitude.       Consequently, the European outrage over snooping among      friends may be slightly overdone. That is an entirely      separate matter from the National Security Agency's (NSA)      vacuum-cleanerlike collection of the communication records      and metadata of millions of Americans, including private      citizens and, apparently, foreign citizens both here and      overseas. The scope of that intelligence-collection program,      disputed by Gen. Keith Alexander, the director of the NSA,      this week is the cause of uproar around the country and in      Congress. There is still much to sort out and probably      reform.       The monitoring of foreign leaders' phone calls, however, is      closer to the larger deed of spying on allied governments.       Which takes us to an indelicate question: Why is a foreign      leader, a repository of a nation's secrets, communicating by      text messages and smartphone?       The most junior Foreign Service officer or government civil      servant entrusted with sensitive information assumes that e-     mails and cellphones are susceptible to eavesdropping. What      makes a head of state behave as if he or she is immune from      monitoring?       Which brings up another tactless question: Why haven't the      security services of those foreign leaders developed      countermeasures to prevent successful spying on personal      communications?       The danger here isn't simply that the NSA may have      overstepped its bounds with respect to U.S. allies. The      intelligence services of the foes of Germany, France, Spain,      Brazil and the like may have the capacity to listen in on      high-level conversations.       The naivete of outraged foreign leaders and their      vulnerability to spying are nearly--but not totally--as      surprising as the scale of NSA snooping.       The NSA revelations, meanwhile, should not draw attention      away from the revelations' primary source: Edward Joseph      Snowden.       How in the world is it possible that a high school dropout      with a GED, a community college student who didn't graduate,      a failed Army recruit and security guard can catapult himself      into a CIA information technology job, an overseas posting      and subsequently a $200,000-a-year job with a company      contracted to do NSA work in Hawaii, where he was able to      gain access to the crown jewels of America's secrets?       Whistleblower, traitor, patriot: Debate the labels all you      want. The government has charged him with espionage. Take it      up with Attorney General Eric Holder.       I want to know how Snowden got his hands on so much of the      nation's most sensitive intelligence and was able to flee the      country, all within three months.       Damage? Done by the U.S. government to itself.                                  ____                                                      U.S. Senate,                                   Committee on the Judiciary,                               Washington, DC, September 23, 2013.     Hon. I. Charles McCullough III,     Inspector General of the Intelligence Community, Office of          the Director of National Intelligence, Washington, DC.       Dear Inspector General McCullough: Recent disclosures about      classified government surveillance activities have generated      significant public discussion about the breadth of these      programs, many of which are conducted pursuant to the Foreign      Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), and the need for      appropriate oversight and checks and balances.       In particular, concerns have arisen about activities      conducted under Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act and      Section 702 of FISA, which was enacted as part of the FISA      Amendments Act of 2008. Recently declassified documents      appear to reveal numerous violations of law and policy in the      implementation of these authorities, including what the FISA      Court characterized as three ``substantial      misrepresentation[s]'' to the Court. These declassified      documents also demonstrate that the implementation of these      authorities involves several components of the Intelligence      Community (IC), including the National Security Agency,      Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation,      Central Intelligence Agency, and the Office of the Director      of National Intelligence, among others.       We urge you to conduct comprehensive reviews of these      authorities and provide a full accounting of how these      authorities are being implemented across the Intelligence      Community. The IC Inspector General was created in 2010 for      this very purpose. Comprehensive and independent reviews by      your office of the implementation of Sections 215 and 702      will fulfill a critical oversight role. Providing a publicly      available summary of the findings and conclusions of these      reviews will help promote greater oversight, transparency,      and public accountability.       In conducting such reviews, we encourage you to draw on the      excellent work already done by the Inspectors General of      several agencies, including the Department of Justice, in      reviewing these authorities. But only your office can bring      to bear an IC-wide perspective that is critical to effective      oversight of these programs. The reviews previously conducted      have been more narrowly focused--as might be expected--on a      specific agency.       In particular, we urge you to review for calendar years      2010 through 2013:        The use and implementation of Section 215 and      Section 702 authorities, including the manner in which      information--and in particular, information about U.S.      persons--is collected, retained, analyzed and disseminated;        applicable minimization procedures and other      relevant procedures and guidelines, including whether they      are consistent across agencies and the extent to which they      protect the privacy rights of U.S. persons;        any improper or illegal use of the authorities or      information collected pursuant to them; and        an examination of the effectiveness of the      authorities as investigative and intelligence tools.       We have urged appropriate oversight of these activities      long before the problems     with the implementation of these FISA authorities became      public. We believe it is important for your office to begin      this review without further delay.       Please proceed to administratively perform reviews of the      implementation of Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act and      Section 702 of FISA, and submit the reports no later than      December 31, 2014. Thank you in advance for your efforts to      ensure a full accounting of the implementation of these      surveillance authorities across the Intelligence Community.           Sincerely,         Patrick Leahy, Charles Schumer, Sheldon Whitehouse,            Christopher Coons, Richard Blumenthal, Chuck Grassley,            Ted Cruz, Michael S. Lee, Jeff Flake.                                  ____         Inspector General of the Intelligence Community                                 Washington, DC, November 5, 2013.     Memorandum for: See distribution.     Subject: IC IG Review of Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act          and Section 702 of FISA Authorities.       Thank you for your 23 September 2013 letter requesting that      my office review the Intelligence Community's (IC) use of      Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act authorities and Section      702 of FISA authorities.       At present, we are not resourced to conduct the requested      review within the requested timeframe. As you stated in your      letter, several IC inspectors general have oversight of the      IC's use of foreign electronic surveillance authorities.      While my office has the jurisdiction to conduct an IC-wide      review of all IC elements using these authorities, such a      review will implicate ongoing oversight efforts. Therefore, I      have been conferring with several IC Inspectors General Forum      members in order to consider how such a review might be      accomplished given the potential impact to IG resources and      ongoing projects. As my IG colleagues and I confer regarding      the possibility of conducting a joint review of the requested      topic, I will keep you and the committee staff informed.       Again, I thank you for your continued support of the IG      community. If you have any questions regarding this subject,      please contact me or my Legislative Counsel, Melissa Wright,      at 571-204-8149.           Sincerely,                                       I. Charles McCullough, III,     Inspector General of the Intelligence Community.                          ____________________
