President, I first want to apologize to the chairman and ranking member that I came to the floor and realized they were in the process of doing this because I certainly would have spoken to them in advance before making this request. But I hope they will agree to this request.  We have just been informed at the Department of Defense that we have now lost our 2,500th soldier in Iraq. Last October, when we lost our 2,000th, the Senate observed a moment of silence in respect for all of the soldiers and those serving in uniform and their families. I would like to ask if the chairman would consider amending his request so that between the two rollcalls, when Members are on the floor, that they would come to their chairs and we would observe a moment of silence in respect for our troops and for this notification that we have reached this sad milestone.
