Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy, since we are on opposite sides in this debate this evening. But I wanted to follow on something Mr. Obey said, because I used to work for a former President in the United States and I understand quite a bit about the way OMB operates.  One of the most shocking things I learned as a White House staff member was that you might have somebody in front of you who was the OMB examiner on agriculture this year, and then next year they switch that person to defense or switch them out to another agency, and you find out they do not know the details about anything.  I was shocked that the defense examiners at OMB have nowhere near the experience that the Members of this institution do, and this is really where historical memory and where experience in detail rests.  So I would agree with the gentleman from Wisconsin, we need a lot more sunlight over there on the executive side. We have total sunlight over here. And I have a totally different impression of the OMB as a former White House staff member than I ever did before, when I used to hold them in very high esteem until I realized they did not know the details of many programs. They just shifted them around, and they did not have the kinds of commitment and depth of knowledge that Members of Congress do.
