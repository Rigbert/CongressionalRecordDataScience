Chairman, the gentleman's amendment would eliminate all nondefense funding for Yucca Mountain. High-level radioactive waste exists in over 38 States. I believe it is irresponsible to leave it where it is forever, and it is essential to have a repository where it can be safely left for up to a million years while the radioactivity decays away.  This waste comes from maintaining our nuclear weapons stockpile and from spent fuel from civilian nuclear reactors that generate 20 percent of all electricity in the United States.  Yucca was chosen by Congress in 1982 as a permanent geological repository for high-level waste and billions have been spent to characterize the site and prepare for licensing and construction.  Failure to open Yucca Mountain and take custody of commercial spent nuclear fuel will cost the taxpayers over $7 billion by 2017 when the repository could open. Cutting funding and delaying the filing of a license application by only a year will simply exacerbate the problem and increase this cost by more than a half billion dollars.  Failure to proceed with a reasonable approach to disposing of spent nuclear fuel will cause the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to stop licensing new nuclear reactors and extending the licenses of existing plants. Every new and extended license must satisfy the waste confidence clause. So this amendment will constrain our ability to grow our economy without emitting any more greenhouse gasses. In the coming years, it will choke off nearly 20 percent of U.S. electricity generated by nuclear power plants.  And, again, we have tried to strike a very reasoned balance in this bill as far as funding for the repository and other programs to initiate a sound nuclear industry in the short term, and I am opposed to the gentleman's amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
