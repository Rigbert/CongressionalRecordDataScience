 President, I wish to make a few comments on the muzzle loader amendment which we are considering.  The purpose of the amendment is to exempt certain muzzle loading weapons from regulation under the Gun Control Act (GCA), 18 U.S.C. Chapter 44. Under current law, ``antique firearms'' are exempted from the definition of ``firearm'' in section 921(a)(3) of the GCA and are, therefore, not subject to the interstate controls, licensing provisions, record keeping requirements, or restrictions on possession that apply to firearms. Thus, antique firearms can be sold interstate via mail-order, no records of their sale are kept, and they may be lawfully possessed by any U.S. citizen. The existing definition of ``antique firearm'' exempts firearms manufactured in or before 1898, replicas of such firearms that utilize matchlock, flintlock, percussion cap, or other primitive types of ignition systems including primers and battery cup primers and other replica firearms that utilize ammunition that is no longer available in commercial channels.  In recent years, there has been a strong increase in popularity in hunting and target shooting involving muzzle loading firearms which could not have been foreseen when the current law was written. As in any other sporting equipment, the technology was refined to provide safer and more reliable equipment, much like the compound bow evolved from the original long bow. Most states now offer a muzzle loading hunting season to improve deer herd management. There have been numerous technological improvements inmuzzle loading weapons, including safer propellant, safety mechanism, projectiles, and ignition systems.  As is the case with the compound bow, many of the muzzle loading weapons now produced bear little physical resemblance to traditional antique firearms produced prior to 1898. Significantly, they all require the placing of a propellant down the barrel, pushing a bullet down the barrel on top of the powder, then placing an ignition system behind the powder just as all muzzle loaders have for more than 100 years. Since the BATF has determined that certain of these weapons are not ``replicas'' under the definition of ``antique firearms'', they are regulated as ``firearms'' under the GCA. The BATF has restricted only one inline muzzle loader, the Knight DISC rifle, which is produced in my home state of Iowa, even though Remington states that their muzzle loader is built from their 700 Centerfire.  The amendment would expand the definition of the term ``antique firearm'' to encompass these modern muzzle loading sporting firearms used by hunters, target shooters, and other sportsmen. The amendment would include within the definition of ``antique firearm'' a weapon that: (1) is a muzzle loading rifle, muzzle loading shotgun, or muzzle loading pistol; (2) is designed to use black powder or a black powder substitute; (3) uses any ignition system; (4) cannot use fixed ammunition; (5) does not use the serial numbered frame or receiver of a firearm; (6) has not been converted from a firearm; and (7) cannot be readily converted to fire fixed ammunition by replacing the barrel, bolt, or breechlock.  The language requiring that the antique firearm not use the frame or receiver of a serial numbered firearm, not be converted from a firearm, and cannot be readily converted to fire fixed ammunition is to prevent the conversion of modern firearms into percussion cap ``antique firearms''. BATF is concerned that, without this language, various single shot, bolt action, slide action and semi-automatic weapons, and even certain machine guns, could be converted into muzzle loading weapons and then converted back to fire conventional fixed ammunition merely by replacing the barrel or other components. The weapon could then be sold as an ``antique firearm'' without any GCA controls. Many components which alter the form and function of firearms are available to be easily converted from one form of firearm to another. However, there are no products currently in commercial trade which would convert a muzzle loader to a firearm or a firearm to a muzzle loader.  Since the amendment is limited to muzzle loading rifles, muzzle loading shotguns, and muzzle loading pistols, it would not allow grenade launchers, bazookas, machine guns, or anti-tank guns to be excluded from the regulation. Also, since this amendment will be adopted on the floor, there isn't any report language to assist courts and industry in interpreting the status of muzzle loaders. I hope my comments will serve this purpose.

(a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--       (1) in 1995, the Internal Revenue Service indefinitely      postponed the 1994 Taxpayer Compliance Measurement Program, a      program of audits using random selection techniques (in this      section referred to as ``random audits'');       (2) Congress, taxpayer groups, tax practitioners, and      others criticized the program because of its cost to and      burden on taxpayers;       (3) there is no law preventing the Internal Revenue Service      from resuming its Taxpayer Compliance Measurement Program;      and       (4) random audits may be overly burdensome on taxpayers,      particularly low-income taxpayers.       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate      that--       (1) the Internal Revenue Service should make it a top      priority to ensure fairness to taxpayers when selecting      returns for audit;       (2) the Senate does not approve of the use of random audits      of the general population of taxpayers or tax returns; and       (3) the Internal Revenue Service should not conduct random      audits of the general population of taxpayers or tax returns.                           amendment no. 3346       (Purpose: To make modifications to language in Title III)       At the appropriate place, strike and insert the following:       On Page 40, line 25, after the word ``campaign,'' strike      through Page 41, line 16 through ``campaign,'' and insert in      lieu thereof ``(3) ONDCP, or any agent acting on its behalf,      may not obligate any funds for the creative development of      advertisements from for-profit organizations, not including      out-of-pocket production costs and talent re-use payments,      unless (a) the advertisements are intended to reach a      minority, ethnic or other special audience that cannot be      obtained on a pro bono basis within the time frames required      by ONDCP's advertising and buying agencies, and (b) it      receives prior approval from the Senate Committee on      Appropriations, (4) ONDCP will secure corporate sponsorship      equaling 40 percent of the appropriated amount in fiscal year      1999, the definition of which is a contribution that is not      received as a result of leveraging funds to receive said      sponsorship, corporate sponsorship equaling 60 percent of the      appropriated amount in fiscal year 2000, corporate      sponsorship equaling 80 percent of the appropriated amount in      fiscal year 2001, corporate sponsorship equaling 100 percent      of the appropriated amount in fiscal year 2002, and will      report quarterly on its efforts to meet this goal, (5) ONDCP      is mandated to use appropriated funds solely to fund the      anti-drug media campaign to include only the purchase of      media time and space, talent re-use payments, out-of-pocket      advertising production costs, testing and evaluation of      advertising, evaluation of the effectiveness of the media      campaign, the negotiated fees for the winning bidder on the      request for proposal recently issued by ONDCP, partnership      with community, civic, and professional groups, and      government organizations related to the media campaign,      entertainment industry collaborations to fashion anti-drug      messages in movies, television programming, and popular      music, interactive (Internet and new) media projects/     activities, public information (News Media Outreach), and      corporate sponsorship/participation, (6) ONDCP shall not      obligate funds provided for the national media campaign for      fiscal year 1999 until ONDCP has submitted the evaluation and      results of Phase I of the campaign to the Senate Committee on      Appropriations, and may obligate up to 75 percent of these      funds until ONDCP has submitted the evaluation and results of      Phase I of the campaign to the Committees,''
