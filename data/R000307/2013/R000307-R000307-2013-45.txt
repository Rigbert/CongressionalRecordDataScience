Werfel. I have been present when he has tried to inform the committee of full cooperation. Now we find out what full cooperation is, more especially as the President has indicated these scandals are so-called phony scandals and repeated by Mr. Lew.  The Senator stated there are 65 million pages that should be available to the committee, which is stunning--stunning--in the job we would have to do. But out of those requested, only 21,500 documents have been presented. Of the 21,500, only 15,000--well, 15,000 pages, but those are nonpriority documents.  Thereby, if you try to figure out when this would be done, it would be in 2016; is that correct?
