 President, President Obama's approach to national security policy began with unworkable ideas on the campaign trail, and it has been marked by some consistent themes, like inflexible commitments to drawing down our conventional military posture from across the globe, like an excessive reliance on international organizations, like a tendency toward the use of Special Operations forces to train and equip units in other countries.  What do we see as we look back now at the twilight of his Presidency? We have seen increased instability in places such as Iraq, Afghanistan, and Yemen. We have seen the evolution of Al Qaeda in Iraq into ISIL and its expansion into Libya, Syria, and the Sinai.  In just a few short months, the next Commander in Chief, regardless of party, will be faced with the consequences of the President's failed foreign policy and will need to adapt an insufficient defense modernization program to tackle both the challenges posed by terrorism and by adversaries like China, Russia, and Iran.  This is why we need to use the remaining months of this administration to help prepare the next administration, regardless of party, to deal with the news it is about to inherit. That iswhat we are doing on the floor right now. The Defense bill before us will modernize our military and provide our troops with more of the tools they need to confront the threats we face. It will help prepare the next Commander in Chief to confront the complex challenges of today and of tomorrow. It is serious policy--policy that will keep our country safe, and after years of this administration's spin and failures, that is what our people deserve.                          ____________________
