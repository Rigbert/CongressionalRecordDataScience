CORNYN. I will yield in a moment.  That has to be embarrassing. It shows a lack of confidence in the President's commitment to enforce the rule of law. I think it is a problem. I think the President can help mitigate that problem and help restore the impression that you are not going to get a free pass if you make it to our southern border.  I will gladly turn the floor over to my colleague.
