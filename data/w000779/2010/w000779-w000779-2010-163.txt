 Grant County is home to just 7,500 people. It is located in rural eastern Oregon. The county is larger than some States. With majestic mountains, rivers, and valleys, its beauty is unprecedented. Those who live there are proud of their home. They work hard and they watch out for each other. Last month, they proved it in a way that should make everyone proud to be an American.  A few weeks ago, a man came to town calling himself the national director of the Aryan Nations, one of the most infamous hate groups in America. He declared that he was looking for a place for a national headquarters and that Grant County would be perfect. Amazingly, he said the values of his organization and the values of Grant County were the same.  He couldn't have been more wrong.  Since the local newspaper, the Blue Mountain Eagle, reported on his visit, Grant County has risen as one to show this man that there is no way that their home is going to be the headquarters for hate.  To express their outrage, the residents of Grant County stood on street corners in the city of John Day waving flags and holding signs making it clear that the Aryan Nations was not welcome. The people of Grant County stood together in supporting diversity and tolerance in their community. All over the county, green ribbons symbolizing their support for equality streamed from car antennas, hung from fences, and pinned proudly to their clothes. Signs are in businesses and homes. Cars are emblazoned with messages of support for their community and opposition to hatred.  More than 1,000 people jammed into two public meetings held on February 26. They were there to learn how to make sure the Aryan Nations would not succeed. There were so many that the meeting room couldn't hold them all. You know there is something special going on when one out of every six residents of a small rural county comes, to learn how to protect their community from a group who would destroy it. Since then, the Grant County Human Rights Coalition has been formed. It is a remarkable group of people, all working to make their home a better place.  The people of Grant County have shown us all what a community looks like. As an Oregonian and as their U.S. Senator, I could not be more proud of them.                          ____________________
