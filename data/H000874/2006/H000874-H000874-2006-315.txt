I was going to ask him about the days for the appropriation bills, but I believe the gentleman has already indicated which days you anticipate that: Tuesday, the Ag bill; Wednesday, the Energy and Water, or Wednesday and Thursday; and then Homeland Security on Thursday.  Would you anticipate that one of those bills might go over till Friday, or is there other legislation that might be on the calendar for Friday?
