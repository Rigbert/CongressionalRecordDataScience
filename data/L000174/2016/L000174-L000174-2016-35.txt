President, Vermonters understand the value of hard work and perseverance, and we take pride in passing those values from generation to generation. Our communities thrive on family-owned businesses built on these values. They form the roots of success in our Green Mountain State, and it is those who own and operate them who are providing the leadership that will carry our State into the future. Today I want to recognize one exceptional Vermont family for the success of their multigenerational Vermont enterprise and their continued commitment to Vermont values.  Founded in 1870, Allenholm Farm is Vermont's largest apple orchard. At its helm is Ray W. Allen, whose great-grandfather Rueben Allen planted the farm's first apple trees more than 150 years ago, and Ray's wife and partner, Pam. After graduating from the University of Vermont with a degree in agriculture, Ray returned to the family farm he had worked as a child, eventually purchasing it from his father in 1960. More than five decades of running the farm haven't slowed Ray down, and he can still be found fixing machinery, giving tours of the orchard, and loading delicious Vermont apples into trucks for shipment.  Like many Vermont businessowners, Ray knows the value of diversification. In addition to the apples it sells to local grocery stores and cider makers, the farm harvests raspberries, blueberries, and cherries, some of which are sold to Vermont's world-renowned Alchemist Brewery. Ray and Pam, his wife of 31 years, work together to make hundreds of apple pies that are then baked fresh on demand. The autumn season brings thousands of guests, often multigenerational families themselves, for pick-your-own apples and visits to Willie and Sassafras, the farm's pet donkeys. Visitors may also enjoy maple creemees, a soft serve ice cream that is as unique to the State as the patented Vermont Gold apple variety is to Allenholm Farm.  Ray's dedication to his farm is matched only by his commitment to his family's legacy. As he hands down his knowledge of the apple business to his children, grandchildren, and now great-grandchildren, he passes on something else: a commitment to building on the past to create a successful Vermont for future generations.  I ask unanimous consent that an October 1 story from the Burlington Free Press about the successful Allenholm Farm in South Hero, VT, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Burlington Free Press, Oct. 1, 2016]          Localvore Since 1870 at Allenholm Farm in South Hero                           (By Sally Pollak)       South Hero.--When the apple pies are sold out, the goats      are spitting out grain-filled ice cream cones, and the porta-     potties need to be emptied, it's been a busy weekend at      Allenholm Farm.       Count last weekend as very busy. Thousands of people      visited the South Hero orchard, the owners estimated.       ``The groups were really big,'' co-owner Pam Allen said.      ``Generational groups.''       Allenholm Farm, founded in 1870, is itself multi-     generational--seven and counting. The farm in South Hero is      thought to be the oldest commercial orchard in the state,      according to its owner, Ray W. Allen. Allen, who will turn 80      next month, has owned and operated the farm for 56 years. His      great-grandfather, Ruben Allen, planted the first apple trees      at the farm almost 150 years ago; the last of the original      trees died in 1978.       At one time, Allenholm Farm was a diversified family farm      with dairy cows, sheep, hogs and poultry, horses for plowing.      These days, the 275-acre farm is primarily an apple orchard,      with 2,000 trees growing on roughly 25 acres. The farm also      produces cherries, berries, pears and pumpkins.       Farm animals are confined, mostly, to a petting zoo, though      a donkey named Willy sometimes strolls down South Street,      site of the farm. That's when Ray C. Allen, sheriff of Grand      Isle County and son of Ray W. Allen, telephones his      stepmother with a message:       ``Your husband's ass is in the middle of the road again,''      the sheriff tells her.       This is family duty, he said. Not law and order.       Ray W. Allen, steadfast and true to the farm, is also a bit      of a wanderer. Over the years he has gone off to high school      at Lyndon Institute in the Northeast Kingdom; run 25      marathons; appeared on stage in community theater, served as      a trustee at the University of Vermont, his alma mater; and      volunteered as an EMT--late-night calls before early-morning      chores.       Monday morning he was up at 3:15 for a bank run to deposit      the weekend's cash. At 4:30, he was back home in his kitchen,      hand-mixing pie dough for some of the 2,500 pies Allenholm      Farm makes each year. (Ray Allen mixes the dough; Pam Allen      makes the filling.)       At 5 a.m., he and his grandson, Brandon Allen, met at the      big gray storage shed across from the farmstand to load      trucks with boxes of apples for delivery to Hannaford      supermarkets.       ``It's a good time,'' Brandon Allen said. ``Quality bonding      time at 5 in the morning.''                  storied history of apple production       The Champlain Islands have a long history of quality apple      production, said Terry Bradshaw, apple specialist at UVM and      director of its Horticulture Research Center. The lake      climate--which makes for a cooler summer and protects against      frost--provides superior growing and ripening conditions,      especially for McIntosh apples, he said. In addition, access      to the lake in the early 20th century meant transportation      for shipping fruit north to the port of Montreal and south to      New York.       ``It's historic,'' Bradshaw said of Allenholm Farm.       The history dates to the founding of Vermont. Pam Allen,      Ray Allen's second wife, is a descendant of Thomas      Chittenden, Vermont's first governor. Ray Allen descends from      Moses Robinson, the state's second governor.       ``Illegitimate,'' Allen said of his ancestry.       More recent farm history includes the end of dairying about      half a century ago, and getting in on the craft beer boom.      Allen sells his cherries to the Alchemist, the Stowe brewery      that makes Heady Topper. The cherries are used in a beer      called Petit Mutant. Perks of this job include beer delivery      to the farm by Alchemist brewer John Kimmich.                               `cool guy'       But the main crop is apples, and the primary variety is      McIntosh. A crew of six seasonal farm workers from Jamaica      are the apple pickers. The men live at the farm in a former      dairy barn converted to housing. Winston Waugh, from St. Ann,      Jamaica, has worked at Allenholm Farm for about 20 years.       ``He's a cool guy,'' Waugh said of Ray Allen. ``He's quite      OK.''       Picking is hard work, Waugh said, especially in cold      weather. It's crucial not to bruise the fruit, he said.       The season's dry weather calls for ``selective picking,''      Allen said, as opposed to stripping a tree of fruit.      Selective picking yields 50 to 60 bushels of apples per day      per picker, he said. When you strip a tree, an apple-picker      brings in about 90 bushels a day.       The size of the apples is important, too. Apples that are      three or more inches in diameter are worth $40 a bushel; two-     and-a-half to three inches are worth about $30 a bushel; less      than two-and-a-half inches sell for $5.50 to $7 a bushel,      Allen said.       In the winter and into spring, before the apple trees      bloom, Allen is in his orchards pruning trees. He fixes      machinery and works in the farm store, which is open until      Christmas Eve.       Last spring, Allen had surgery to replace both his knees.      He wore them out not from farming or running, but by wearing      Western-style boots 365 days a year, he said. Allen didn't      want to sit around on the couch, drink beer, and feel sorry      for himself, so he challenged himself to be active. Within      six days, he was driving around the farm.       ``He's a character,'' his son said.       His roles include welcoming visitors to Allenholm Farm and      leading tours. Allen expects future generations will fulfill      these and other duties; but he has no plans to retire.       ``I would hate to be the one to lose it,'' he said. ``This      is the 146th year. I sure don't want to be the first one to      lose the farm.''                          ____________________
