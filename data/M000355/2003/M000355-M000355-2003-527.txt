 As earlier ordered, there will be four moments of silence which will be denoted by the ringing of ceremonial bells outside the Senate Chamber. There will be other events throughout the day as a remembrance of this day and all Senators are invited to anticipate.  As announced by the majority leader, no rollcall votes will occur on Thursday or Friday. However, the Senate will conduct business on those days. Tomorrow, the Senate will consider the FCC resolution as well as the energy and water appropriations legislation. Any votes ordered will be sequenced to begin on Monday beginning at 5:30.                          ____________________
