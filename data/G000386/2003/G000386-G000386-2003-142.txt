 President, I rise to speak on the amendment Senator Domenici and I offered to address a regulation recently proposed by the Office of Personnel Management; a regulation that is wrong-headed.  Congress and the executive agencies have long enjoyed a mutually beneficial relationship where executive branch employees are detailed to congressional offices. These details typically exist for 1 to 2 years.  As a result, the executive branch has an opportunity to have its employees learn about the legislative process and oversight activities. Likewise, the legislative branch has an opportunity to utilize the expertise of executive branch employees. Everyone benefits.  The regulation proposed by the Office of Personnel Management will inevitably ruin the benefits of this long-term practice.  The regulation proposed by the Office of Personnel Management for example, seeks to reduce to 6 months the time that a detailee can spend in Congress. This is too short a time for even the most industrious of detailees to understand the intricacies of the legislative process and contribute to that process.  Moreover, this regulation attempts to limit the activities in which executive branch employees can engage while under the direct supervision of a Congressional office in an effort to micro-manage from afar. This is unacceptable.  Senator Domenici and I have offered an amendment to prohibit the use of any funds for the implementation ofthis regulation that will severely reduce the number, availability and benefit of executive branch detailees to the legislative branch to the detriment of all.  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.  I yield the floor.
