President, Senator McCaskill has left an indelible mark on the Senate. A former prosecutor in Missouri, she brought the fight to protect the most vulnerable in her State and across the country to her work here in the U.S. Senate.  Her work to preserve the Affordable Care Act and protect victims of sexual harassment and violence speak to the depth of her convictions. She has also shown great talent safeguarding our Nation and holding our government accountable as a former chair of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and as a member of the Armed Services Committee.  Senator McCaskill has fought hard to protect college students from sexual harassment and assault on campus. Senator McCaskill has even spoken of the sexual harassment that she herself faced as a young woman in the Missouri State Legislature. Long before the Nation began talking openly about the extent of sexual harassment and assault across all sectors of our society brought into the open by the #MeToo movement, Senator McCaskill prepared a report on the extent of sexual harassment and assault on college campuses. But Senator McCaskill has never been a woman content with report-writing; she introduced a bill to help address the issue. And when the Senate didn't move on that bill, she worked directly with colleges, holding public roundtables to call attention to the issue.  That is a just a glimpse of the determination that Senator McCaskill brings to all of her work on behalf of her constituents. She is a straight shooter. In the face of misinformation campaigns about the Affordable Care Act, Senator McCaskill has always stepped up to promote the truth. I have always admired her commitment to preserving that law that helps so many of her rural constituents.  As a former chair of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, and a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator McCaskill has dedicated much of her Senate service to keeping our country safe. I greatly appreciated her support for my National Guard Empowerment Act, which finally gave our National Guard the tools it needs to protect our Nation and take care of its members.  I will miss Senator McCaskill's tenacity, and I am sure that Missouri and the Nation will too. Missouri is losing a champion in the Senate. Marcelle and I wish her, her husband, Joe, and her family the very best in this new chapter.                          ____________________
