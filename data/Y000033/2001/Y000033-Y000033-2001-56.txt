Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, I want to get back to the point that when we work on legislation, we do the best we can within the House of the people. And to have other Members question the integrity of the House during a period of debate following the 2 weeks after we pass the bill, and then to have the Secretary of Transportation mention something that might be a reality, and to say that the administration is not fulfilling the obligation of the Congress is not correct.  Mr. Chairman, I respectfully request Members, do not use this as a political issue as has been used for the past 4 weeks. Let us seek good, sound security. Let us fund it and make it correct.
