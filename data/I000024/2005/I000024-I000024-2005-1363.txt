As you can see behind me, the Washington Post today ran an editorial cartoon that, yes, actually blames the Sumatra tsunami on global warming. Are we to believe now that global warming is causing earthquakes? The tsunami, of course, was caused by an earthquake off Sumatra's coast deep beneath the sea floor, completely disconnected from whatever the climate was doing at the surface. Regrettably, the tsunami-warming connection merely confirms the state of fear extremists are so eager to create. As Terence Corcoran of Canada's Financial Post wrote: ``The urge to capitalize on the horror in Asia is just too great for some to resist if it might help their cause . . . Green Web sites are already filling up with references to tsunami risks associated with global warming.''  There is something inhumane about that, that they would capitalize on the tragedy of a hundred thousand people to push a hoax like global warming.  To address this, let's ask some simple questions: Is global warming causing more extreme weather events of greater intensity, and is it causing sea levels to rise? The answer to all of these is emphatically no. Just look at this chart behind me. It's titled ``Climate Related Disasters in Asia: 1900 to 1990s.'' What does it show? It shows the number of such disasters in Asia, and the deaths attributed to them, declining fairly sharply over the last 30 years.  Let's take hurricanes. Alarmists linked last year's hurricanes that devastated parts of Florida to global warming. But this is patently false. Credible meteorologists were quick to dismiss such claims. Hugh Willoughby, senior scientist at the International Hurricane Research Center of Florida International University stated Plainly: ``This isn't a global-warming sort of thing. . . It's a natural cycle,'' A team led by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Dr. Christopher Landsea concluded that the relationship of global temperatures to the number of intense land-falling hurricanes is either non-existent or very weak. In this chart you can see that the overall number of hurricanes and the number of the strongest hurricanes fluctuated greatly during the last century, with a great number in the 1940s. In fact, through the last decade, the intensity of these storms has declined somewhat.  What about sea level rise? Alarmists have claimed for years that sea level, because of anthropogenic warming, is rising rapidly. Based on modeling, the IPCC estimated that sea level will rise 1.8 millimeters annually, or about one-fourteenth of an inch.  But in a study published this year in Global and Planetary Change, Dr. Nils-Axel Morner of Sweden found that sea level rise hysteria was overblown. In his study, which relied not only on observational records, but also on satellites he concluded that: ``there is a total absence of any recent `acceleration in sea level rise' as often claimed by IPCC and related groups.'' Yet we still hear of a future world overwhelmed by floods due to global warming. Such claims are completely out of touch with science. As Sweden's Morner puts it, ``there is no fear of massive future flooding as claimed in most global warming scenarios.''  What I have outlined today will not appear in the New York Times. Instead you will read much about ``consensus'' and Kyoto and hand wringing by its editorial writers that unrestricted carbon dioxide emissions from the United States are harming the planet. You will read nothing, of course, about how Kyoto-like policies harm Americans, especially the poor and minorities, causing higher energy prices, reduced economic growth, and fewer jobs. After all, that is the real purpose behind Kyoto, as Morgot Wallstrom, the EU's environment minister, said in a moment of candor. To her, Kyoto is about ``leveling the playing field'' for businesses worldwide--in other words, we can't compete, so let's use a feel-good treaty, based on shoddy science, fear, and alarmism, which will have no perceptible impact on the environment, to restrict America's economic growth and prosperity. Unfortunately for Ms. Wallstrom and Kyoto's staunchest advocates, America was wise to the scheme, and it has rejected Kyoto and similar policies convincingly. Whatever Kyoto is about--to some, such as French President Jacques Chirac, it's about forming ``an authentic global governance''--it's the wrong policy and it won't work, as many participants in Buenos Aires conceded.  I recommend--and I will include at the end of my remarks--the economic study which was done by the Wharton School of Economics talking about what would happen to America and the cost of global warming. If we should sign on to Kyoto, what would it cost? They go into detail. They talk about doubling the price of energy. They talk about the price of fuel more than doubling.  Keep in mind this is the economic survey. They talk about the cost to the average family of four in America being $2,715 a year by 2010.  People have to understand that the economic destruction of our country is something that would inure to the benefit of the European Union and many others who are in competition with us. We have to understand that there is an economic motive behind it which one would have to seriously consider.  Despite the bias, omissions, and distortions by the media and extremist groups, the real story about global warming is being told and, judging by the success of Michael Crichton's ``State of Fear,'' much to the dismay of certain groups, it is now being told to the American public.  I think one thing which we all have to understand in this body is we have to recognize the fact that we have an energy crisis in America today. Right now, there are a few people around the country who are now catching on that it is true. We need all forms of energy to run this great machine called America. Our forms of energy can be nuclear, they can be renewable, they can be fossil fuel, coal, oil, gas, all of the above. It is what we will have to have in order to be competitive.  Chairing the committee and being active in the upcoming energy bill, we anticipate being realistic in thinking about not just ourselves today--not just my four kids or my 12 grandchildren and future generations--but you are going to have to run this most successful, highly industrialized machine ever conceived in the history of the world. And you can't do it sitting around closing the door on all opportunities that we have for energy. Certainly one is coal.  Certainly we need to look at this whole issue of global warming and what the real motives are of these people who are behind this.  I gave a speech on this floor the last session and talked about the amount of money--I am also going to insert that for the Record--being paid to elect people, money that is being filtered through a lot of these organizations. There is a lot of money made out there by causing people to be fearful, by making people afraid, by making people feel that the world is coming to an end. It is not.

On each and every occasion, you only received a partial      collection of facts about historical temperature and      temperature trends that would lead an interested listener to      believe that anthropogenic global warming was responsible for      the large change in Alaskan temperatures observed over the      past 30 to 40 years. In fact, a natural climate shift in the      Pacific Ocean that occurred in 1976 is responsible for the      observed climate changes in Alaska. Below is a list of      researchers, many from the Alaska Climate Research Center at      the University of Alaska, who could have supplied you with      these facts that were missing from your hearing:                               Scientists     Gerd Wendler, Director and Professor Emeritus, Martin          Stuefer, Research Associate, Martha Shulski,          Climatologist, Brian Hartmann, Assistant Climatologist,          Alaska Climate Research Center, University of Alaska          Fairbanks, 903 Koyukuk Drive, P.O.

One thing      for sure is that the earth's climate has and will continue to      change as a result of various natural and anthropogenic      forcing mechanisms.       ``This page features the trends in mean annual and seasonal      temperatures for Alaska's first-order observing stations      since 1949 (Fig. 1), the time period for which reliable      meteorological data are available. The temperature change      varies from one climatic zone to another as well as for      different seasons. If a linear trend is taken through mean      annual temperatures, the average change over the last 5      decades is about 3.0  deg.F. However, when analyzing the      trends for the four seasons, it can be seen that most of the      change has occurred in winter and spring, with less of a      change in summer and even slight cooling in autumn (see Table      below).       ``Considering just a linear trend can mask some important      variability characteristics in the time series. Figure 2      shows clearly that this trend is non-linear: a linear trend      might have been expected from the fairly steady observed      increase of CO2 during this time period. The      figure shows the temperature departure from the long-term      mean (1949-2003) for the average of all stations. It can be      seen that there are large variations from year to year and      the 5-year moving average demonstrates cyclical behavior. The      period 1949 to 1975 was substantially colder than the period      from 1977 to 2003, however since 1977 no additional warming      has occurred in Alaska with the exception of Barrow and a few      other locations. In 1976, a stepwise shift appears in the      temperature data, which corresponds to a phase shift of the      Pacific Decadal Oscillation from a negative phase to a      positive phase. Synoptic conditions with the positive phase      tend to consist of increased southerly flow and warm air      advection into Alaska during the winter, resulting in      positive temperature anomalies.

Key Quote or Synopsis       ``The ice cover of the Arctic Ocean is considered to be a      sensitive indicator of global climate change. Recent      research, using submarine-based observations, suggests that      the Arctic ice cover was thinner in the 1990s compared to an      earlier period (1958-1979), and that it continued to decrease      in thickness in the 1990s. Here I analyze subsurface ice      thickness (draft) of Arctic sea ice from six submarine      cruises from 1991 to 1997. This extensive data set shows that      there was no trend towards a thinning ice cover during the      1990s. Data from the North Pole shows a slight increase in      mean ice thickness, whereas the Beaufort Sea shows a small      decrease, none of which are significant. Transects between      the two areas from 76 N to 90 N also show near constant ice      thicknesses, with a general spatial decrease from the Pole      towards the Beaufort Sea. Combining the present results with      those of an earlier study, I conclude that the mean ice      thickness has remained on a near-constant level around the      North Pole from 1986 to 1997.''

Key Quote or Synopsis       Vinje constructed a 135-yr time series of sea ice extent in      the Nordic Seas and found that while April sea ice extend has      declined by about 33 percent during this period, more than      half of the decline occurred before 1900. Vinje concluded      that ``the time series indicates that we are in a state of      continued recovery from the cooling effects of the Little Ice      Age, during which a maximum sea-ice expansion was observed      around 1800, both in the Iceland Sea and the Barents Sea.''                                  ____                               Scientists     Igor V.

Key Quote or Synopsis:       ``The rapid reduction of arctic ice thickness in the 1990s      may be one manifestation of the intense atmosphere and ice      cyclonic circulation regime due to the synchronous actions of      the AO [Arctic Oscillation] and LFO [low-frequency      oscillation]. Our results suggest that the decadal AO and      multi-decadal LFO drive large amplitude natural variability      in the Arctic making a detection of possible long-term trends      induced by greenhouse gas warming most difficult.''                                  ____                        Topic: Greenland Melting       Another topic one which you heard testimony was the rapid      melting of Greenland ice sheets and their potential      contribution to rapid global sea level rise. However, none of      the panelists told you that there has been an overall decline      in Greenland temperatures during the past 60s years, and that      despite the warming trend in Greenland during the last decade      or so, temperatures still have not reached levels as high      there as they were during the 1930s and 1940s.

Key Quote or Synopsis       ``The Greenland surface air temperature trends over the      past 50 years do not show persistent warming, in contrast to      global average surface air temperatures. The Greenland      coastal stations temperature trends over the second half of      the past century generally exhibit a cooling tendency with      superimposed decadal scale oscillations related to the NAO.      At the Greenland ice sheet summit, the temperature record      shows a decrease in the summer average temperature at the      rate of about 2.2 deg. C/decade, suggesting that the      Greenland ice sheet at high elevations does not follow the      global warming trend either.       ``A significant and rapid temperature increase was observed      at all Greenland stations between 1920 and 1930. The average      annual temperature rose between 2 and 4  deg.C in less than      ten years. Since the change in anthropogenic production of      greenhouses gases at that time was considerably lower than      today, this rapid temperature increase suggests a large      natural variability of the regional climate.       ``High anticorrelations (r = -0.84 to -0.93) between the      NAO index and the Greenland temperature records suggest a      physical link between these processes. The recent negative      shift of the NAO correlates with 1990s warming in Greenland.      The NAO may play a crucial role in determining local      Greenland climate during the 21st century; resulting in a      local climate that may defy the global climate change. This      possibility should be considered in models of ice sheet melt      and future sea level rise. Forecasting changes in the NAO may      be a primary factor in predicting the future Greenland ice      sheet mass balance.''                                  ____                               Scientists     Edward Hanna, Institute of Marine Studies, University of          Plymouth     John Cappelen, Danish Meteorological Institute, Copenhagen,          Denmark                                 Paper       Recent cooling in coastal southern Greenland and relation      with the North Atlantic Oscillation, Geophysical Research      Letters, 30, doi:10.1029/2002GLO15797, 2003.
