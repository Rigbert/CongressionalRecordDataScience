Lee Sarokin, Judge Richard Paez, and Judge Marsha Berzon, contrary to the implication of my good friend from Utah.  I actually have sympathy for my friend from Utah. He has been put in an untenable position. He is seeking to uphold an unreasonable position taken by the White House. The White House is trying to tell the Senate what to do. He is being a good soldier and I commend him for that.  The fact is, if the Senate was allowed to be the Senate and make its own decisions and not let the White House dictate what to do, this matter would have been settled a long time ago. We would have followed the tradition and logic set forth by former Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson when he was Attorney General. He indicated that such material should be provided to the Senate. He wrote:     . . . I have taken the position that committees called upon      to pass on the confirmation of persons recommended for      appointment by the Attorney General would be afforded      confidential access to any information that we have--because      no candidate's name is submitted without his knowledge and      the Department does not intend to submit the name of any      person whose entire history will not stand light.  The White House has access to Mr. Estrada's papers. It is hard to believe that they have not reviewed these papers. They are part of the information that the administration has about one of its nominees. All previous administrations followed the path of working with the Senate and making sure that the entire history of the person would stand the light of scrutiny. This administration does not want us to know.
