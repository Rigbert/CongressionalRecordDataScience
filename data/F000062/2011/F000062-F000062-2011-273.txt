 President, today I am introducing the ``Ban Poisonous Additives Act of 2011,'' a bill that would ban the chemical Bisphenol A, known as BPA, from all children's feeding products. I thank my cosponsors Senators Schumer, Kerry, Sanders, and Franken for their support.  I vowed in the last Congress not to give up, and this is why I am introducing a bill that bans the use of BPA in baby bottles, sippy cups, infant formula, and baby food containers: the products used to provide food and beverages to the most vulnerable.  I have a deep, abiding concern regarding the presence of toxins and chemicals in the daily lives of Americans. BPA is an endocrine disruptor, which means that it interferes with the way hormones work in the body.  The evidence against BPA is mounting, especially its harmful effects on babies and children who are still developing.  I believe we have an obligation to safeguard babies and children from unnecessary exposure to this chemical that is linked to so many health problems.  Over 200 scientific studies show that even at low doses, BPA is linked to serious health problems including: Cancer, Diabetes, Heart Disease, Early puberty, Behavioral problems, Obesity.  This chemical is so widespread it has been found in 93 percent of Americans.  Babies and children are particularly at risk to the exposure of BPA because when they are developing, any small change can cause dramatic consequences.  It may not surprise you that the chemical industry continues to insist that BPA is not harmful. According to at least one study, there is reason to be skeptical about research coming from chemical companies.  In 2006, the journal Environmental Research published an article comparing the results of government funded studies on BPA to BPA studies funded by industry.  The difference is glaring.  Ninety-two percent of the government funded studies found that exposure to BPA caused health problems.  Overwhelmingly, government studies found harm. None of the industry funded studies identified health problems as a result of BPA exposure. Not one.  Clearly, serious questions are raised about the validity of the chemical industry's studies. The results also illustrate why our nation's regulatory agencies should not and cannot solely rely on chemical companies to conduct research on their own products.  The fact that so many adverse health effects are linked to this chemical, the fact that this chemical is so present in our bodies, and the fact that babies are more at risk from its harmful effects leads me to believe that there is no good reason to expose our children to BPA.  This is why we are introducing legislation that protects all babies across the country, no matter which state they happen to live.  This bill will ensure that parents no longer have to wonder whether products they buy for their babies and children will harm them now or later in life.  This bill: Bans the use of BPA in baby bottles and sippy cups within 6 months; Bans the use of BPA in baby food within 1 year; Bans the use of BPA in infant formula within 18 months; Requires that the FDA issue a revised safety assessment on BPA by December 1, 2012; and Includes a savings clause to allow states to enact their own legislation.  This bill makes sense. It's a reasonable step forward to protecting our children's health.  Major manufacturers are already phasing out BPA from their food and beverage products for children.  Food and beverage products for children all have safe, alternative, BPA-free packaging available right now.  Major baby food and formula manufacturers offer BPA-free alternatives including: Nestle's GOOD START, Similac powdered infant formula, Enfamil powdered infant formula, Nestle liquid formula, and Similac liquid formula.  At least 14 manufacturers of baby bottles either offer some BPA-free alternatives or have completely banned its use. They are: Avent, Born Free, Disney First Years, Dr. Brown's, Evenflo, Gerber, Green to Grow, Klean Kanteen, Medala, Munchkin, Nuby Sippy Cups, Playtex, Think Baby, and Weil Baby.  Many major retailers have taken action and sell BPA-free baby bottles and cups: CVS, Kmart, Kroger, Rite Aid, Safeway, Sears, Toys ``R'' Us and Babies ``R'' Us, Wal-Mart, Wegmans, and Whole Foods.  Eight states have already enacted laws banning BPA from children's products: Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin.  Other countries have already moved forward to restrict this chemical. Canada declared BPA a toxic substance, and banned it from all baby bottles and sippy cups. Denmark and France have national bans on BPA in certain children's products.  The European Commission banned BPA from baby bottles, protecting consumers in the European Union.  Clearly, the problem has been recognized and steps are being taken by countries, states, companies, and retailers to remove this harmful chemical.  Let me briefly explain what BPA is.  BPA is a synthetic estrogen. As I stated previously, it is a hormone disruptor and interferes with how hormones work in the body. This chemical is used in thousands of consumer products to harden plastics, line tin cans, and make CDs. It is even used to coat airline tickets, grocery store receipts, and to make dental sealants.  It is one of the most pervasive chemicals in modern life. And, as with so many other chemicals in consumer products, BPA has been added to our products without us knowing whether it was safe or not.  Alternatives exist because there is growing concern about the harmful effects of BPA. The chemical industry continues to try to quiet criticism by reassuring consumers that BPA is safe.  I don't buy it.  As I previously stated, over 200 scientific studies show that exposure to BPA, particularly during prenatal development and early infancy, are linked to a wide range of adverse health effects in later life.  Because of their smaller size and stage of development, babies and children are particularly at risk from the harmful health effects of BPA.  These serious effects include: increased risk of breast and prostate cancer; genital abnormalities in males; infertility in men; sexual dysfunction; early puberty in girls; metabolic disorders such as insulin resistant Type 2 diabetes and obesity; and behavioral problems such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD.  It continues to astound me how, even with this extensive list of potentially serious health effects, we continue to allow this chemical to be put in our products.  Moreover, additional science continues to be released, confirming the potential for BPA to cause severe problems:  Recently, the University of California, San Francisco published a small scale study finding that human exposure to BPA may compromise the quality of a woman's eggs retrieved for in vitro fertilization, IVF.  A study of over 200 Chinese factory workers found evidence that high levels of BPA exposure to adversely affect sperm quality in humans.  Researchers at the University of Nebraska Medical Center recently published a study concluding that BPA has biochemical properties similar to human carcinogens.  I want to underscore the importance and the urgency of withdrawing BPA from these children's products.  Well-known and respected organizations and Federal agencies also have expressed concern about BPA:  The President's Cancer Panel Annual Report released in April 2010 concluded that there is growing evidence of a link between BPA and several diseases, such as cancer.  The Panel recommended using BPA-free containers to limit chemical exposure.  A 2008 study by the American Medical Association suggested links between exposure to BPA and diabetes,heart disease and liver problems in humans.  The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) linked BPA in high concentrations to cardiovascular disease, and Type II diabetes.  Given these conclusions, it is critical we act now to protect the most vulnerable, our infants and toddlers from this chemical.  Children receive no benefit by having a baby bottle or cup coated with BPA.  In the last Congress, I vowed not to give up in my fight to ban BPA. After working hard for many months to reach an agreement with Senator Enzi on a more limited ban, I was sincerely disappointed that this agreement was blocked by the chemical industry from being included in the food safety bill.  I want to reiterate the importance of this legislation. I strongly believe we need to take action on this.  I don't think we can take a chance with our children's health.  BPA has been linked to developmental disorders, cancer, cardiovascular complications, and diabetes by credible scientific bodies. The evidence that BPA is unacceptably dangerous is mounting. Yet it remains in thousands of household and food products.  This is a reasonable, common sense bill.  Now, the time comes again for this body to take a stand and move forward to protect the health of America's children.  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting my legislation, the Ban Poisonous Additives Act of 2011.  I look forward to working with my colleagues on this important issue.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 136       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
