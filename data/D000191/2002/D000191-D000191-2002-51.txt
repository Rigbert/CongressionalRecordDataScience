The President has already sent military advisers to the Philippines and the Republic of Georgia. His axis of evil comments lumped Iran, Iraq, and North Korea together as potential targets for future U.S. military action. He also indicated he wants to get the United States more deeply involved in Colombia's civil war by helping the government fight guerrilla armies rather than targeting the drug trafficking done by all parties in the war in Colombia.  Article I, section 8 of the United States Constitution grants Congress the exclusive authority to declare war. As commander-in-chief, the President conducts or would conduct day-to-day operations of our U.S. military. The Constitution and the War Powers Resolution of 1973 grants Congress the prerogative to decide whether or not to send U.S. troops into hostility.  The use of force resolution approved by Congress specifically safeguarded Congress' war powers by noting nothing in the resolution supersedes any requirement of the War Powers Resolution.  While Congress overwhelmingly authorized the President to use military force to respond to the September 11 terrorist attacks, the Congressional authorization was limited in scope. Specifically, the joint resolution stated the President is authorized to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed or aided the terrorist attack that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations or persons.  Thus far, the United States intelligence agencies with their secret $32 billion a year budget could not predict the attacks and cannot uncover any links between Iraq and the attackers. Now, many in the administration are latching on to a magazine article written by Seymour Hirsch in the New Yorker who does not get $32 billion a year from the taxpayers, who has uncovered purported links between some Kurds and the al Qaeda as a potential excuse to attack Iraq.  In December, I sent a letter along with a number of other Members of Congress to the President pointing out the limitations on the use of force authorization and reminding him that he would have to come, as his father did, to the United States Congress for authorization if he desired and felt there was a case to be made to attack Iraq. I have as yet to have a substantive response to that letter.  We at this point, I believe, have sort of a budding imperial presidency, the likes of which we have not seen since Richard Nixon.  There are other areas that are very troubling with this presidency. The nuclear posture review. According to a leaked version of the classified nuclear posture review, the Bush administration is contemplating using nuclear weapons as offensive weapons rather than merely to deter an attack against the United States. They now say they would target seven countries, Russia, China, Libya, Syria, Iraq, Iran and North Korea. This, in fact, includes countries who are not known to have nuclear weapons, an extraordinary change in U.S. policy. They want to develop small, more friendly nuclear weapons that could be used, they believe, in limited instances.  Of course, this would blur the line between conventional nuclear arms, would undermine the nonproliferation treaty which 187 countries have signed, including the United States of America, and that is a very disturbing trend. As Ronald Reagan once said, a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.  We have the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, the most successful treaty on arms limitations in the history of the world, which the President wishes to unilaterally abrogate, calling it a relic of the Cold War. The Constitution is more than 200 years old. I would hope that the President would not find that to be a relic. It is still very relevant today, as is the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. If it is scrapped as the President wishes, if he can legally do that, that is in question, it is likely that China, Russia and other countries would engage in a new crash program to expand nuclear weapons against our potential defenses which, of course, as we all know, the Star Wars fantasy does not work in any place, but it is a great place in which to dump two or three or $400 billion of hard-earned taxpayers' money.  Finally, in the defense budget we have seen an extraordinary proposal that we should have a 1-year increasethat far exceeds any increases at the height of the Cold War, the Vietnam War, anything since World War II, to build Cold War weapons against enemies that no longer exist. Hopefully this Congress will act soon to rein in this administration, reexert its authority and bring some sanity to these policies.{time}  2030                          ____________________
