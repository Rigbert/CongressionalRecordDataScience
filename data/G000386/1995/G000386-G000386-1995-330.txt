 President, President Clinton was asked, at his most recent news conference, how he could explain the ethical controversies surrounding his administration--and these are the words of an inquiring press--``* * * after [he] came into office promising the most ethical administration in history.''  I wanted to take this opportunity to discuss how the President reacted to that inquiry at his news conference.  First, he responded to allegations about Roger Altman's ethical troubles. President Clinton stated that:       Roger Altman resigned even though he had violated no law      and no rule of ethics.
