 President, I rise today to introduce important tax legislation to help address the current energy shortage in our country. The legislation, entitled the ``Growing Renewable Energy for Emerging Needs [GREEN] Act,'' will extend and expand the tax credit for homegrown, clean-burning, renewable biomass.  As many of my colleagues know, I authorized the section 45 credit in the Senate and it was included in the Energy Policy Act of 1992. However, the tax credit for the production of energy from biomass is set to expire on January 1, 2002. For this reason, I am introducing legislation to extend and expand the credit to help sustain the many benefits derived from biomass.  Last month, I introduced S. 530 to extend the wind energy portion of section 45, which has been extremely successful. The purpose of today's bill is to extend and expand the biomass portion of section 45 to include technologies such as biomass combustion and cofiring biomass with coal-fired facilities. Formerly, section 45 only allowed the use of closed-loop biomass.  The clean, controlled combustion of biomass, which consists of sawdust, tree trimmings, agricultural byproducts, and untreated construction debris, is another proven, effective technology that currently generates numerous pollution avoidance and waste management public benefits across the nation.  In addition, biomass energy displaces more polluting forms of energy generation while decreasing our dependence on foreign oil. Our national security is currently threatened by a heavy reliance on foreign oil.  Biomass can also produce enormous economic benefits for rural America. Rural economies will grow because of the development of a local industry to convert biomass to electricity. Moreover, studies show that biomass crops could produce between $2 to $5 billion in additional farm income.  In order to retain the environmental, waste management, and the rural employment benefits that we could receive from the existing ``open-loop'' biomass facilities, my bill rewrites section 45 to allow tax credits for clean combustion of wood waste and similar residues in these unique facilities.  Importantly, we have also ensured that the definition of qualifying biomass materials is limited to organic, nonhazardous materials that are clearly proven to burn cleanly without any pollution risk. Also, to allay any concern that biomass plants might burn paper and thus possibly jeopardize the amount of paper that is available to be recycled, I have specifically excluded paper that is commonly recycled from the list of materials that would qualify for the credit.  I believe this bill provides a common sense combination of current and new technologies to help maintain the economic, environmental and waste management benefits derived from biomass power. The current electricity shortage in California and the soaring prices of home heating fuel and natural gas this winter are reasons enough to support and accelerate this renewable energy.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 756       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Growing Renewable Energy for      Emerging Needs (GREEN) Act''.     SEC. 2. CREDIT FOR ELECTRICITY PRODUCED FROM BIOMASS.       (a) Extension and Modification of Placed-in-Service      Rules.--Paragraph (3) of section 45(c) of the Internal      Revenue Code of 1986 is amended--       (1) by striking subparagraph (B) and inserting the      following new subparagraph:       ``(B) Closed-loop biomass facility.--In the case of a      facility using closed-loop biomass to produce electricity,      the term `qualified facility' means any facility--       ``(i) owned by the taxpayer which is originally placed in      service after December 31, 1992, and before January 1, 2007,      or       ``(ii) of the taxpayer which is originally placed in      service before December 31, 1992, and modified to use closed-     loop biomass to co-fire with coal before January 1, 2007.'',       (2) by striking ``2002'' in subparagraph (C) and inserting      ``2007'', and       (3) by adding at the end the following new subparagraphs:       ``(D) Biomass facilities.--In the case of a facility using      biomass (other than closed-loop biomass) to produce      electricity, the term `qualified facility' means any facility      owned by the taxpayer which is originally placed in service      before January 1, 2007.       ``(E) Special rules.--In the case of a qualified facility      described in subparagraph (B)(ii) or (D)--       ``(i) the 10-year period referred to in subsection (a)      shall be treated as beginning no earlier than the date of the      enactment of this paragraph, and       ``(ii) subsection (b)(3) shall not apply to any such      facility originally placed in service before January 1,      1997.''.       (b) Biomass Facilities.--       (1) In general.--Section 45(c)(1) of the Internal Revenue      Code of 1986 (defining qualified energy resources) is      amended--       (A) by striking ``and'' at the end of subparagraph (B),       (B) by striking the period at the end of subparagraph (C)      and inserting ``, and'', and       (C) by adding at the end the following new subparagraph:       ``(D) biomass (other than closed-loop biomass).''.       (2) Biomass defined.--Section 45(c) of such Code (relating      to definitions) is amended by adding at the end the following      new paragraph:       ``(5) Biomass.--The term `biomass' means any solid,      nonhazardous, cellulosic waste material which is segregated      from other waste materials and which is derived from--       ``(A) any of the following forest-related resources: mill      residues, precommercial thinnings, slash, and brush, but not      including old-growth timber,       ``(B) solid wood waste materials, including waste pallets,      crates, dunnage, manufacturing and construction wood wastes      (other than pressure-treated, chemically-treated, or painted      wood wastes), and landscape or right-of-way tree trimmings,      but not including municipal solid waste (garbage), gas      derived from the biodegradation of solid waste, or paper that      is commonly recycled, or       ``(C) agriculture sources, including orchard tree crops,      vineyard, grain, legumes, sugar, and other crop by-products      or residues.''.
