President, I want to take this opportunity, along with my distinguished colleagues, Senators Kennedy, Cleland, Grams, Daschle, DeWine, Lautenberg, and Levin, to reintroduce legislation recognizing the importance of the institution of the Presidency. My legislation would redesignate ``Washington's Birthday'' as ``Presidents' Day,'' honoring George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and Franklin Roosevelt. In taking this step, we would honor three of our nation's most important leaders, Presidents who led our nation through our greatest challenges and crises. In so doing, we would be celebrating the contributions that these and other great Presidents have made to the development of freedom and democracy in our great nation.  Our democracy depends upon the participation of a well-informed electorate--citizens who take their civic responsibilities seriously. However, many Americans appear to have lost confidence in our political system. In the last presidential election, less than half of eligible voters--49 percent--voted. In the 1998 midterm elections, only 36 percent of the voting populace cast their vote to determine the future of our nation. This was the lowest voter turnout since 1942, over 50 years ago. The turnout rate among younger voters is even lower.  Tests administered by the National Assessment of Educational Progress found that almost 60 percent of high school seniors lacked even a basic understanding of American history. These findings indicate that too many Americans feel a sense of alienation from the political process and do not believe that government and political involvement are relevant to their lives.  In this time of cynicism about American politics, we must restore the faith and pride of our citizens in our government. Passage of this legislation will recognize three of our nation's greatest leaders and the enduring strength of the Office of the Presidency. It will remind all of us--but particularly young people who are our nation's future leaders--of the important contributions made by Presidents of the United States and the principles on which our nation was founded.                          ____________________
