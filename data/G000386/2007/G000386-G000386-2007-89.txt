 President, I would like to comment on the status of the alternative minimum tax, AMT.  There is some good news regarding the need to do a patch to protect 19 million families. If you look back over the last few months, I have come to the floor several times to urge my friends in the Democratic leadership in both bodies to focus on this problem and get legislation ready. Earlier today, I urged the House to begin work on an AMT patch bill. I urged them to send it to the Senate so that Chairman Baucus and I will have a vehicle to deal with this pressing problem.  We have a few weeks to act before the IRS forms are finalized. After that time, there could be big problems for taxpayers and the Internal Revenue Service.  I was pleased to read in this afternoon's press reports that Chairman Rangel is going to process an AMT patch bill.  I also want to commend our Finance chairman, my friend, Senator Baucus, for convening an informal meeting of the Finance Committee to discuss this pressing matter. I hope the Democratic leadership provides Chairman Baucus floor time to take up a committee bill.  On a related point, at a press event earlier today, in answer to a reporter's question, I indicated that we could look at measures to insure that certain high-income taxpayers who pay no regular income tax or AMT pay some tax. I would like to elaborate on that comment.  I have referred many times to the IRS statistic of high income taxpayers who pay no regular income tax or AMT. The statistic is that, for the tax year 2004, IRS Statistics of Income reported that 2,833 taxpayers with incomes over $200,000 paid no income tax. That same group paid no AMT as well. I will ask to have inserted in the Record a copy of that statistic.  The reason this group does not pay tax is defects in the AMT. What I was saying is that the AMT is defective in its original purpose. That is, to make sure that all high-income taxpayers pay some tax. I was not arguing for a tax increase on high-income taxpayers who are paying either regular income tax or AMT. I was arguing that, if anything, if the AMT's original purpose is to be served, then insure that those not paying ANY tax, pay it.  Mr. Presdient, I ask unanimous consent to have a copy of the statistic to which I referred printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:   TABLE 1.--RETURNS WITH AND WITHOUT U.S. INCOME TAX: NUMBER OF RETURNS, BY SIZE OF INCOME UNDER ALTERNATIVE                                             CONCEPTS, TAX YEAR 2004                                  [All figures are estimates based on samples]----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          Returns by size of adjusted gross income                                           ---------------------------------------------------------------------                                             All returns      under        $50,000      $100,000     $200,000 or  Returns by tax status, size of expanded  --------------  $50,000 \1\      under         under         more                  income                                 --------------   $100,000      $200,000   -------------                                                 (1)                   ----------------------------                                                               (2)           (3)           (4)           (5)----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                All returns Total.....................................   132,226,042    91,302,396    28,166,641     9,735,569     3,021,435Under $50,000 [\1\].......................    90,478,783    89,700,020       767,886         8,163         2,714$50,000 under $100,000....................    29,115,600     1,572,295    27,186,378       353,025         3,901$100,000 under $200,000...................     9,564,057        27,792       205,880     9,279,698        50,687$200,000 or more..........................     3,067,602         2,289         6,497        94,683     2,964,133        Returns with U.S. income tax Total.....................................    90,876,672    50,767,865    27,371,775     9,718,430     3,018,602Under $50,000 \1\.........................    50,003,838    49,336,042       659,474         6,609         1,713$50,000 under $100,000....................    28,278,142     1,413,628    26,509,632       351,123         3,759$100,000 under $200,000...................     9,532,119        17,365       197,144     9,267,112        50,498$200,000 or more..........................     3,062,574           831         5,524        93,587     2,962,632       Returns without U.S. income tax Total.....................................    41,349,370    40,534,531       794,866        17,139         2,833Under $50,000 [\1\].......................    40,474,945    40,363,978       108,411         1,555         1,001$50,000 under $100,000....................       837,458       158,667       676,746         1,902           142$100,000 under $200,000...................        31,938        10,428         8,736        12,586           189$200,000 or more..........................         5,028         1,458           973         1,096         1,501----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\1\ Includes returns with adjusted gross deficit or with negative expanded income.NOTE: Detail may not add to totals because of rounding.Source: IRS, Statistics of Income Division, June 2007.                          ____________________
