Mr. Speaker, the dirty secret of the pro-abortion movement is the method of abortions themselves. More than two decades after Roe the Nation remains woefully uninformed concerning the violent and abusive methods routinely used to kill unborn babies. The abortion industry has cleverly sanitized and marketed abortion with an endless stream of euphemisms. In abortion mills throughout the land abortionists dismember kids with razor blade tipped knives connected to suction machines or inject deadly poisons into the child.  Today hearings begin in the Committee on the Judiciary to outlaw what is known as partial birth abortions. Here is how the originator of this terrible method of abortion describes it: [[Page H6026]]   After delivering most of the baby he says the surgeon then takes a pair of blunt, curved, Metzenbaum scissors in the right hand. He carefully advances the tip, curved down, along the spine and under his middle finger until he feels it contact the base of the skull under the tip of his middle finger. The surgeon then forces the scissors into the base of the skull. Having safely entered the skull, he spreads the scissors and then they suck the brains out of that baby.  Mr. Speaker, this is barbaric. This legislation would outlaw this egregiously barbaric procedure.  The surgical assistant places an ultrasound probe on the patient's abdomen and scans the fetus, locating the lower extremities. This scan provides the surgeon information about the orientation of the fetus and approximate location of the lower extremities. The tranducer is then held in position over the lower extremities.  The surgeon introduces a large grasping forcep, such as a Bierer or Hern, through the vaginal and cervical canals into the corpus of the uterus. Based upon his knowledge of fetal orientation, he moves the tip of the instrument carefully towards the fetal lower extremities. When the instrument appears on the sonogram screen, the surgeon is able to open and close its jaws to firmly and reliably grasp a lower extremity. The surgeon then applies firm traction to the instrument causing a version of the fetus (if necessary) and pulls the extremity into the vagina.  By observing the movement of the lower extremity and version of the fetus on the ultrasound screen, the surgeon is assured that his instrument has not inappropriately grasped a maternal structure.  With a lower extremity in the vagina, the surgeon uses his fingers to deliver the opposite lower extremity, then the torso, the shoulders and the upper extremities.  The skull lodges at the internal cervical os. Usually there is not enough dilation for it to pass through. The fetus is oriented dorsum or spine up.  At this point, the right-handed surgeon slides the fingers of the left hand along the back of the fetus and ``hooks'' the shoulders of the fetus with the index and ring fingers (palm down). Next he slides the tip of the middle finger along the spine towards the skull while applying traction to the shoulders and lower extremities. The middle finger lifts and pushes the anterior cervical lip out of the way.  While maintaining this tension, lifting the cervix and applying traction to the shoulders with the fingers of the left hand, the surgeon takes a pair of blunt curved Metzenbaum scissors in the right hand. He carefully advances the tip, curved down, along the spine and under his middle finger until he feels it contact the base of the skull under the tip of his middle finger.  Reassessing proper placement of the closed scissors tip and safe elevation of the cervix, the surgeon then forces the scissors into the base of the skull. Having safely entered the skull, he spreads the scissors to enlarge the opening.  The surgeon removes the scissors and introduces a suction catheter into this hole and evacuates the skull contents.                          ____________________
