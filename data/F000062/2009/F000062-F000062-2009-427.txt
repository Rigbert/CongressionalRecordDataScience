 President, I rise today to introduce a bill on behalf of myself and Senator Kyl to mitigate the immigration and security risks associated with the Visa Waiver Program and its expansion.  The Visa Waiver Program leaves open both a major gap in our domestic security and a way to exploit our immigration laws. The Strengthening the Visa Waiver Program to Secure America Act would give the Department of Homeland Security, DHS, new tools to secure the Visa Waiver Program, consistent with the recommendations made by the 9/11 Commission.  The bill would set a maximum low visa overstay rate for all visa waiver program countries; require a reevaluation of visa waiver program countries within 1 year; mandate that the administration will lose its authority to continue to expand the program if it does not track 97 percent of those exiting and departing at our airports--based on arrival data, not just departure data; require an audit of the electronic travel authorization system, ESTA; and require current visa waiver countries to report on lost or stolen visas in order to remain in the visa waiver program.  Senator Kyl and I have held multiple hearings over the years and time and time again we have expressed concern and requested improvements, but no changes have been forthcoming in how the Department of Homeland Security intends to implement this program.  The hearings and the recent Government Accountability Office report found that the administration is not doing what it should to secure the program. Instead, the Visa Waiver Program has continued to expand without meeting the security needs of our country.  In fact, just today the administration has announced that it has met the deadline for the electronic travel authorization system, ESTA, to be fully operational. However, the GAO report found that ESTA--the one security check for visa waiver travelers prior to arrival at our Nation's airports--has not been implemented effectively by the administration to make it a workable system for the airlines and embassies.  The GAO report also found that the administration is still unable to track who comes in and out of this country. This is especially significant given that the program was recently expanded to countries with high visa overstay rates, bringing the number of participating countries to 35.  This means that for the citizens of 35 countries--including Australia, Singapore, Slovenia, and the United Kingdom--entering the United States is as simple as purchasing an airline ticket and arriving at the airport with a valid passport in hand.  The result is that these travelers not only bypass the interview and individualized security screening process, but they are also lost once they arrive in the U.S. because DHS is only checking when individuals depart at our airports, not if they overstay their visit.  It is estimated that 40 percent of the current undocumented population are people who have overstayed their visas. That means that if there are 12 millionundocumented people now in the U.S., 4.8 million people overstayed their visa. The Visa Waiver Program is the achilles heel of our immigration system.  The security risks associated with the Visa Waiver Program are even greater--Our Nation's security experts have stated repeatedly that the program provides an attractive option to terrorists looking to do Americans harm.  At a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on September 27, 2007, DNI Director Mike McConnell testified that Al Qaeda is purposefully recruiting Europeans because they do not require a visa to come into this country.  As Director McConnell said, this tactic gives Al Qaeda ``an extra edge in getting an operative or two or three into the country with the ability to carry out an attack that might be reminiscent of 9-11.''  Secretary Chertoff reiterated these concerns when he stated that ``terrorists are increasingly looking to Europe as both a target and a platform for terrorist attacks'' against the United States.  In an interview with BBC's ``World News America,'' Secretary Chertoff acknowledged, ``the first time we encounter [visa waiver travelers] is when they arrive in the United States and that creates a very small window of opportunity to check them out.''  These security risks are particularly apparent when we look at the statistics on the number of fraudulent and stolen passports and other international documents.  Between January 2002 and June 2004, 28 foreign governments, including visa waiver countries, reported 56,943 stolen blank foreign passports to the State Department. And just this summer, a security van in London was hijacked, resulting in the loss of 3,000 blank British passports and visas that were destined for overseas embassies.  DHS's own Inspector General, Clark Ervin has testified that: ``The lost and stolen passport problem is the greatest security problem associated with the Visa Waiver Program. Our country is vulnerable because gaps in our treatment of lost and stolen passports remain.''  The Strengthening the Visa Waiver Program to Secure America Act would put necessary security checks firmly in place and provide greater program oversight.  We must act now to secure the Visa Waiver Program. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 203       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
