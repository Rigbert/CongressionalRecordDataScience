 President, there is good news from Georgia this morning. In a second bloodless revolution in that country, former Soviet official and Ajaria troublemaker Alan Abashidze fled into exile after thousands of opponents--including some from within his own police and military forces--took to the streets to demand change.  Abashidze's hasty departure is a great victory for the people of Georgia and their leaders, particularly President Saakashvili and Prime Minister Zhvania. By seeking a non-violent solution to the crisis in the breakaway region of Ajari, Saakashvili and Zhvania demonstrated patience in the face of Abashidze's hostile provocations--designed to spark a military conflict.  Reports of the celebrations in the streets of Batumi are inspiring, particularly those of reformers waving American flags along side their own country. I want to remind my colleagues such symbolism is a reality in Iraq, where Georgian soldiers serve alongside U.S. and Coalition forces.  My message to the people of Georgia is clear: America will continue to stand with them as they champion the cause of democracy. We will continue to help them build a country--and institutions--dedicated to the furtherance of freedom and the rule of law.  Once again, democracy triumphs in Georgia.                          ____________________
