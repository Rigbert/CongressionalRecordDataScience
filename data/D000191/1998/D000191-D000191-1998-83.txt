  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, today we have the stealth plan to fix the system of taxation in America, to repeal the entire Tax Code. Well, not the entire Tax Code, not the most regressive part of the Tax Code.  Seventy-two percent of the American people pay more in FICA taxes than they do income taxes to the Federal Government. Guess what? That 72 percent of the American people are left out of this phony election year proposal. But what is included, what we are going to repeal is the mortgage home deduction. That is the one, the one shelter, that middle income, working Americans have available to them is a deduction for the interest on their home mortgage. That is repealed. That is gone.  We are also going to repeal that which provides for employer-provided health care and charitable deductions. Guess what? This stealth proposal is a dagger aimed right at the heart of working Americans under the guise of helping them. So once again, the Republicans can service the special interests that are doing so well under the current code, but want to do better under a new one.                          ____________________
