 President, the Obama administration is trying to impose deeply regressive energy regulations that would eliminate good-paying jobs, punish the poor, and make it even harder for Kentuckians to put food on the table. Their effect on the global carbon levels? Essentially a rounding error. Their effect on poor and middle-class families? Potentially devastating. Yet the deep-pocketed leftwingers who increasingly call the shots in the Obama White House don't seem to care. Just like with their decision on Keystone last month, the Obama administration is putting facts and compassion to the side in order to advance their ideological agenda.  Higher energy bills and lost jobs may be a mere trifle to some on the left, but it is a different story for millions of middle-class Americans in Kentucky and across the country. Senators from both parties are saying that we should be standing up for the middle class instead. That is why we have joined together to work toward overturning these two-pronged regulations.  I am happy to report that the bipartisan measures we filed last month to overturn these regressive regulations have now been made available for consideration by the full Senate. The first measure pertains to regulations on existing energy sources, while the second pertains to regulations on new sources. Together they represent a comprehensive solution.  Senator Capito has been a leader in this effort, and I thank her for her hard work. That hard work will continue as the Senate and House both take up the measures and pass them. That is the right thing to do for middle-class Kentuckians and middle-class Americans who have suffered enough under this administration already.                          ____________________
