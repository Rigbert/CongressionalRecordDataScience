 President, I respectfully submit into the Congressional Record a statement from Mayor Richard J. Riordan of Los Angeles on the issue of the Davis-Bacon Act and Prevailing Wage laws.  Mr. President, I ask that Mayor Riordan's full statement be printed in the Record.  The statement follows:                     Invest Now, or Pay More Later                     (By Mayor Richard J. Riordan)       ``You can pay now or pay later'' is more than grandmotherly      advice. It is a healthy dose of financial wisdom which all      levels of government ought to heed. In fact, the pay now      approach is a goal-oriented investment strategy that      considers current and future needs. The pay later scenario is      highly reactive, unpredictable and void of strategy.       Unfortunately for Angelenos and our local businesses      community, Los Angeles city government is too reliant on the      pay later approach, which really translates to ``pay more      later.'' The cost to the city by failing to invest is      hundreds of millions of dollars in deferred maintenance and      the taking of precious investment dollars for short-term      crises. For example, due to years of inadequate funding for      street maintenance, 111 miles of Los Angeles City streets are      beyond repair and must be totally reconstructed at an      estimated cost of $150 million. It costs five times as much      to reconstruct a street as it does to maintain it.       Investment in affordable housing, streets, sidewalks,      parks, library buildings, schools, water storage, railways,      airports and port facilities is good business. Directly, this      investment in infrastructure generates tens of thousands of      construction jobs. Over the long-term, it creates a climate      where businesses will stay and come out of their own self-     interest because the quality of life is better--streets are      safer, long term economic      [[Page S5270]] investment is more secure and more jobs are      available.       But it takes a lot more taxpayer dollars to build      infrastructure.       It takes investment in human capital, too, and the same      ``invest now or pay more later'' logic should apply. There      are some existing strong partnerships between the public and      private sectors and organized labor which have wisely adopted      a goal-oriented strategy. Prevailing wage laws--created by      the federal, state and local governments, in partnership with      the building trades and business--have attracted skilled      labor with the expertise and experience to complete projects      on time and within budget. The Santa Monica Freeway is a      shining example; it was reconstructed to the highest quality      standards, ahead of schedule and under budget in the      aftermath of the Northridge earthquake. Public infrastructure      projects have also expanded career opportunities for young      people. Some of the best technical training in our region is      available through the organized building trades. The      facilities are first rate, and the curriculum is fully up-to-     date and forward looking.       Against the strong arguments for pay-now versus pay more      later, those in the Washington beltway who would eliminate      the Davis Bacon Act are shortsighted in their thinking.      According to a recent study by the University of Utah      Economics Department, in the nine states which have repealed      prevailing wage laws, the pay more later rule has kicked in,      with the net result being reduced wages for construction      workers, increased workplace injuries and deaths, a decline      in job training, a loss of tax revenue to the state and      increased cost overruns.       Retaining the Davis-Bacon Act and our prevailing wage laws      is critical to the public private partnership which has      worked so well in developing our public infrastructure and      the highly skilled workforce upon which it depends. In so      doing, we can continue to build great projects, produce the      good paying jobs and careers our economy must have, and save      millions of taxpayer dollars in the process. And we can all      rest a little easier knowing that the next time the earth      moves, we will still have skilled contractors and      construction workers needed to get the job done.                               ____________________
