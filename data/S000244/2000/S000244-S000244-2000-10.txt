SHORT TITLE.       This title may be cited as the ``Networking and Information      Technology Research and Development Act''.     SEC. 202. FINDINGS.       The Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Information technology will continue to change the way      Americans live, learn, and work. The information revolution      will improve the workplace and the quality and accessibility      of health care and education and make Government more      responsible and accessible. It is important that access to      information technology be available to all citizens,      including elderly Americans and Americans with disabilities.       (2) Information technology is an imperative enabling      technology that contributes to scientific disciplines. Major      advances in biomedical research, public safety, engineering,      and other critical areas depend on further advances in      computing and communications.       (3) The United States is the undisputed global leader in      information technology.       (4) Information technology is recognized as a catalyst for      economic growth and prosperity.       (5) Information technology represents one of the fastest      growing sectors of the United States economy, with electronic      commerce alone projected to become a trillion-dollar business      by 2005.       (6) Businesses producing computers, semiconductors,      software, and communications equipment account for one-third      of the total growth in the United States economy since 1992.       (7) According to the United States Census Bureau, between      1993 and 1997, the information technology sector grew an      average of 12.3 percent per year.       (8) Fundamental research in information technology has      enabled the information revolution.       (9) Fundamental research in information technology has      contributed to the creation of new industries and new, high-     paying jobs.       (10) Our Nation's well-being will depend on the      understanding, arising from fundamental research, of the      social and economic benefits and problems arising from the      increasing pace of information technology transformations.       (11) Scientific and engineering research and the      availability of a skilled workforce are critical to continued      economic growth driven by information technology.       (12) In 1997, private industry provided most of the funding      for research and development in the information technology      sector. The information technology sector now receives, in      absolute terms, one-third of all corporate spending on      research and development in the United States economy.       (13) The private sector tends to focus its spending on      short-term, applied research.       (14) The Federal Government is uniquely positioned to      support long-term fundamental research.       (15) Federal applied research in information technology has      grown at almost twice the rate of Federal basic research      since 1986.       (16) Federal science and engineering programs must increase      their emphasis on long-term, high-risk research.       (17) Current Federal programs and support for fundamental      research in information technology is inadequate if we are to      maintain the Nation's global leadership in information      technology.
