So if it is reported next week, I am not sure when the conferees are going to meet and consider it. But it is, again, indicative of the fact that on our side, we do not get notice of, or we are not being included in, conferences. That is not, we believe, the way the process ought to work.  Mr. DeLAY. If the gentleman will yield, I just want to correct the gentleman, in that the gentleman has been invited to any formal conferences that have been held and I am sure that to finish the work of the conference, formal conferences will be held on these bills so that Members can look at them and make determinations as to whether they will support them or not. If the gentleman is not being invited to formal conferences, let me know, and I will make sure that he gets the invitation.
