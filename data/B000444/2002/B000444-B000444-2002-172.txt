 President, over the past few weeks, banners have startedto appear on light-posts in my home town of Wilmington, DE, announcing the celebration of the 200th anniversary of E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, more familiarly and succinctly known as the DuPont Company.  It is a fairly modest call of attention to a remarkable event and a remarkable business institution. DuPont is the oldest company in Delaware, and certainly one of the oldest in our Nation; it has employed hundreds of thousands of people in my State and millions around the world; it is a leader in scientific innovation that has remained dynamic throughout its history, changing with the times and, with more patents than any other American firm, sometimes itself changing the times.  One symbol of DuPont keeping and even setting the pace, will soon be seen by NASCAR fans around the country. DuPont is the primary sponsor of Jeff Gordon's race team, and beginning this month, Mr. Gordon will be driving a special DuPont 200th anniversary car, which was unveiled in Wilmington last fall.  The name DuPont is familiar throughout and well beyond our Nation, but many of our citizens, even NASCAR fans, may not realize how familiar DuPont products are in their daily lives, and may not know much of the history of the company that has endured and evolved, with a central place in our scientific and economic life, and with such great importance to our State of Delaware.  Founded in 1802 by Eleuthere Irenee du Pont, with $36,000 in capital, 18 shares at $2,000 a piece, DuPont began as a gunpowder plant, Eleutherian Mills, on the Brandywine River near Wilmington. By 1811, DuPont was the largest manufacturer of gunpowder in the United States.  Explosives long remained an important aspect of the company. During World War I, DuPont supplied the Allies with 1.5 billion pounds of military explosives, as well as providing American industry with half the dynamite and blasting powder needed for construction and mining. And during World War II, DuPont produced 4.5 billion pounds of military explosives, as well as nylon for parachutes, tents, ropes and other military supplies. The company also contributed to the Manhattan Project, with the Hanford plant in Washington and the Oak Ridge plant in Tennessee, and built and operated chemical plants related to the war effort.  It was in the company's 100th anniversary year, 1902, that three of E.I. du Pont's great-grandsons bought out old partners, and started to move toward diversification, opening Eastern Laboratory and, in 1903, the Experimental Station in Wilmington. DuPont was soon in the dye business, the rayon business, and after a company researcher named William Hale Church made cellophane moisture-proof in 1927, the food packaging business. DuPont research in the 1920s also led to the development of a quick-drying paint for cars, which helped speed the manufacturing process, so DuPont's automotive history goes back a long way.  The 1930s saw the development of, among other products, nylon, the first true synthetic textile fiber, which I mentioned was so important early on in World War II supplies; Teflon', which evolved in part out of war-related research and which we know from our own kitchen supplies; Butacite', which is used in shatter-proof glass; and Lucite'.  The 1950s brought the development of Mylar', which has uses from balloons to insulation, as well as Dacron' polyester, Orlon' acrylic fiber and the well-known Lycra' brand fiber, which can stretch to five times its size without losing its shape. DuPont also started its serious global investment, with the opening of the International Department, in 1958.  In 1964, researcher Stephanie Kwolek, whom I have had the pleasure of meeting, developed the remarkably strong fiber that we know as Kevlar', which, in its application in body armor, has saved thousands of police officers' lives. Tyvek', which we see so often as building wrap, was also developed for commercial application in the 1960s, as was Nomex'--where we again give credit to Dr. Kwolek, along with Paul Morgan, for their research. Nomex' is a heat-resistant fiber with a range of uses, the most well known of which is in protective gear for fire-fighters. Corian', which is now so familiar as a counter-top surface, followed shortly after.  To summarize where DuPont was at the close of the 1960s in terms of its leadership and innovation, especially in textile fibers, I'll note that when Neil Armstrong walked on the moon in 1969, he was wearing a space suit made up of 25 layers; 23 of those layers were DuPont materials.  The DuPont Company has continued to explore science-based solutions to real-world problems in a range of markets, from health care and nutrition to apparel and textiles to performance coatings and polymers to construction and electronics, always working to develop new products and to find innovative applications even for old workhorses like polyester and nylon. Just to note two current efforts, DuPont is undertaking leading-edge work in biotechnology, notably soy proteins, and in polymers, with an advanced technology now known as Sorona'.  Among the many events in this anniversary year, in April, DuPont will be presented with the National Building Museum's 2002 Honor Award, and I am proud to serve on the Leadership Committee for that event. In announcing the award, the Building Museum folks noted, ``It is difficult to imagine many aspects of modern construction without DuPont products, which make buildings safer, more durable, and more efficient.''  In addition to its industry leadership, the DuPont Company has set the standard, which has been followed by other leading businesses in our State, for outstanding corporate citizenship. The Company has long engaged in generous charitable giving and support of non-profit agencies, both near its corporate home in Delaware and in communities where it operates throughout the world, as well as supporting and encouraging volunteer work and community leadership by its employees. DuPont has made a particular and extensive investment in science education and research, from kindergarten classrooms to university laboratories.  So this 200-year-old Company remains an innovator, an investor in sustainable and successful communities, and a charitable leader in Delaware, across the country and around the world. I have not always agreed with the Board Chairs and CEOs of the DuPont Company over the last 30 years, but I have always respected them, and deeply respected the place of honor that the DuPont Company has earned in Delaware and in the international business community.  So on behalf of the DuPont Company's neighbors and fellow citizens in Delaware, I am proud to honor its 200th anniversary, and to extend congratulations to the company's board, executive leaders and employees, along with our very best wishes for continued success in bringing ``The miracles of science''' to life in a way that serves us all.                          ____________________
