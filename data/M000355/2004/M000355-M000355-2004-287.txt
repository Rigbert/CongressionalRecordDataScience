 President, for the information of all Senators, tomorrow, following morning business, the Senate will begin consideration of the Goss nomination. Under the previous order, there will be up to 6 hours of debate prior to a vote on confirmation. It is my hope we will not require the entire allotment of debate time. Senators should expect a vote on the nomination sometime tomorrow afternoon, and that vote will be the first vote of tomorrow's session.                          ____________________
