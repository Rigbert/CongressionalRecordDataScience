Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague, Mrs. Capps. And I also want to thank Chairman Dingell and Ranking Member Barton, and others who have had a real hand in moving this legislation before us.  I rise today in support of this resolution, a resolution recognizing the impact of lung cancer and the recent recommendations of the Lung Cancer Progress Review Group of the National Cancer Institute. This group's process is a comprehensive, collaborative, integrated approach to control and eliminate lung cancer. The group was tasked with making recommendations, strategizing, and reporting on progress made in an effort to control and eliminate lung cancer.                              {time}  1400  The group was able to identify scientific priorities and needs and set forth a national agenda for research on lung cancer.  This Progress Review Group made the recommendation to foster the creation of scientifically integrated multi-institutional research consortia organized around the problem of lung cancer rather than around specific research disciplines. The recommendation speaks to the ongoing work at the NIH as well as in the private sector for cross-cutting research. And as a Congress, it is our responsibility to endow these researchers to best pursue answers. This report clarifies the benefits of broad science. Putting disease research into silos so that, as so many authorizing bills often do, is not always helpful to the greater goal. Let's take these recommendations to pursue a multilevel, multidisciplinary science in an effort to find a cure for lung cancer or thousands of other diseases that afflict the world. Reducing the mortality rate of lung cancer is an objective to which we all can subscribe. It is our responsibility to make sure that the scientists have the tools and the access necessary to pursue a cure.  So many of us here have been with someone at a bedside that is suffering from this awful disease, one of the worst. It is a great step forward that we can pass this legislation, to see the research come about, the funding with it, so that some day in fact we will have a cure to prevent this tragedy in families across the globe.  I yield back the balance of my time.
