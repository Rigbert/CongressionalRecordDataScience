President, Since it is Valentine's Day, I would like to offer a few brief comments on the heart health status of our nation. It is a serious concern in my state of Oklahoma and all across the country. Today over two thousand Americans will die from some form of cardiovascular disease, and in my state of Oklahoma, almost 45 percent of all deaths this year will be from cardiovascular disease. Heart disease is the number one leading cause of death in Oklahoma and in America. This is a sad state of affairs.  Although some children are born with heart conditions, and others may have a genetic tendency toward developing cardiovascular disease, there are many people suffering who could have prevented the onset of heart disease. A healthy diet and regular cardiovascular exercise can prevent high blood cholesterol levels, obesity, and high blood pressure, all of which are risk factors for heart disease.  I appreciate the work of the American Heart Association and others in raising awareness of the risk factors, warning signs, and preventative lifestyle behaviors that are crucial in our fight against this type of disease. This year the focus of Heart Month, which we celebrate every February, is Being Prepared in a Cardiac Emergency. I encourage all of my fellow Americans to take a CPR class, and I urge parents to teach their children how to call 9-1-1 in an emergency. Taking just a few cautionary steps can save lives.  Heart-shaped cards and candies inundate us this week and especially today. When we see these playful reminders of Valentine's Day, let us be reminded of how we must take care of our heart health and continue to fight the tragedy of heart disease in our Nation.                          ____________________
