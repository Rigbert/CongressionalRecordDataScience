Speaker, I rise to recognize the sesquicentennial anniversary of Christ Episcopal Church, located in Huron, Ohio. The congregation comes together with the community in celebration of this milestone event on August 3, 2012.  Organized in 1837, the church cornerstone was laid on May 23, 1938. The church building is in a beautiful setting overlooking Lake Erie and parkland. A steeple was completed in 1876, followed by the placement of a bell in 1881. That bell has called worshippers over the centuries through the present day. As its congregation grew and changed with the modern day, the church added classrooms, a kitchen, fellowship hall, choir room, offices, meeting rooms, library, a chapel and columbarium. In 1975 a new steeple was erected along with a modern impressionist stained glass window of the Living Christ behind the altar. Though modernized, the church has retained its original feel. As one of Ohio's oldest churches, Christ Church is on the National Register of Historic Places.  Of note, in its 175 years the parish has been served by only nineteen rectors with long pastorates marking their service. Each brought a leadership distinct and dynamic. A truly faith-filled parish, the members of Christ Church have never locked its doors. Since its earliest days, the church is always open for prayer and meditation. The church and its members hold true to Christ's message explained in Matthew 18:20, ``Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there I am in the midst of them.'' Faith and fellowship have guided the congregation nearly since our region's founding. We proudly commemorate this 175th anniversary while looking forward to Christ Church's future.                          ____________________
