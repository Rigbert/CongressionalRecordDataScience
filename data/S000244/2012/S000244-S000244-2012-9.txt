Speaker, I rise today in regards to H.R. 5652, the Sequester Replacement Reconciliation Act of 2012.  Eliminating the threat of our massive national debt must be a top priority for this Congress. I am pleased that House Republicans have identified and put forward a sensible plan. This reconciliation bill will forestall the Budget Control Act's sequestration cuts to defense while, at the same time, offer alternative reductions in federal spending. This measure is a critical first step in getting our fiscal house in order and doing so in a responsible manner.  In addition to the number of spending reforms that are included in H.R. 5652, there is an important reform that was proposed--meaningful medical liability reform. Specifically, H.R. 5, the Help Accessible, Efficient, Low-cost, Timely Healthcare, which seeks to ensure that the cost of frivolous litigation is not passed on to consumers in the form of higher health-care premiums by capping non-economic damages in medical liability lawsuits. While I am supportive of these efforts, I currently own shares in multiple corporations that may benefit from its enactment.  While my participation in legislative consideration of H.R. 5652 would not appear to violate current House Rules and established precedent, as in all matters susceptible to subjective examination, there are no bright line rules to determine whether a Member should recuse himself or herself in legislation that may benefit that Member in a personal or financial manner. While this may be a gray area, I do not want to raise any potential ethical questions regarding my participation in this legislation. As a result, I have acted to dispel any appearance of conflict by recusing myself from legislative consideration of H.R. 5652 in the 112th Congress.
