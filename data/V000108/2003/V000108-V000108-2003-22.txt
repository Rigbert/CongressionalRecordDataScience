Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the recognition, and I rise in strong opposition to the Udall-Porter amendment. The chairman, I think, has stated the case very aptly. At the beginning of my remarks, I would like to make three points, however.  I would note, as other speakers have done, the absence of the gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. Berkley) from the First Congressional District of Nevada. Unfortunately, because of an illness in her family, she was not able to be here. Despite my opposition to the Udall-Porter amendment, I would note for the record her strong support of it, her continual lobbying on behalf of the people of Nevada on this particular issue.  I would like to make three points. The first is this is a matter of consensus. The House has spoken on this issue. The House passed a Yucca Mountain approval resolution in May of 2002 by a vote of 306 to 117. The Senate passed the resolution by voice vote, and the President signed it into law in July of last year.  Secondly, this is a matter of time, and time is of the essence. The 2010 target for opening a permanent repository is now 12 years later than the deadline set on January 31, 1998, for DOE to begin taking waste from nuclear plant sites.  Finally, this is a national security issue. There are over 100 operating reactors, 103, with closed sites that need to have their waste removed. This is a national security issue. We need to have this waste in one place, under guard and contained. I am strongly opposed to the amendment.
