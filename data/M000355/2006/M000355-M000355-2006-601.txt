 It has been made perfectly clear, by statements by the National Security Adviser of the new Iraqi Government, that it is not the policy of the Iraqi Government to grant amnesty to those who killed American soldiers.  I hope we can move past this reaction to some lower level Iraqi official, since fired from the Iraqi Government, over his ill-advised and basically untrue suggestions about what the policy of the Iraqi Government would be toward those who may have killed American soldiers.  I yield the floor.
