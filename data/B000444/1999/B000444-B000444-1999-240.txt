 Nance Foreign Relations Act, Fiscal years 2000 and 2001.''  Admiral ``Bud'' Nance was a dear friend of the chairman and a close friend of many of us in the Senate.  He served his country with extraordinary distinction, and in the final years of his life served as Staff Director to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. One of Bud Nance's objectives, which he shared with the chairman, was to see this particular legislation become law.  The Senate's approval today will be a major step to that end. When this legislation becomes law we will have authorized the payment of most of the United States arrearages to the United Nations and encouraged significant reforms in that body.  In addition, the Congress will have authorized the funding of our activities overseas for the years 2000 and 2001.  I look at those dates and can't help but think that in many ways, this being but just one, your friend, our friend, Bud Nance, will indeed be with us as we enter the new millennium.  I would like to thank the majority staff for their work in helping put this bill together--particularly Steve Biegun who assumed the role of staff director after our friend Bud Nance passed away.  Patti McNerney has been tireless as majority counsel in leading the complex staff negotiations that helped make this bill possible.  I would also like to thank Brian McKeon, our minority counsel for his hard work and the rest of the minority staff, including Jennifer Park and our Pearson Fellow, Joan Wadelton who put many long hours in with the rest of the majority and minority staff. We would not be looking at final passage today without all their dedicated efforts.
