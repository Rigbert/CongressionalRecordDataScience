Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Mexico [Mr. Richardson] for yielding, and this one is for Bob. They have one for the Gipper, but this one is for Bob.  Bob Lagomarsino, as the gentleman just mentioned, led this effort to establish the Channel Islands. I cannot think of a better tribute to a person who worked so hard, and so I wanted to thank those Members who lead this charge with him, and I want to thank them for working to bring this legislation to the floor.
