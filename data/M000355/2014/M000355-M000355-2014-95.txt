 This is one of the hardest issues that we face in Congress, and it has been helpful to have my colleague Senator Paul working so hard on resolving it. He wanted an amendment on a repatriation proposal on the highway bill that we will soon be debating, and I want to thank him for setting it aside for the time being. We will, however, be addressing highway funding again later, and I promise to protect his right to offer his amendment and secure a vote on its adoption.                          ____________________
