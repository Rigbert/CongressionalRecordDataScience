President, I thank the majority leader, Senator Reid, who was here earlier today talking about the economic stimulus package. What I have tried to do is to understand at this moment where the Republicans are, and it is hard to follow because initially there was agreement between the Republican and Democratic leaders in the House--Speaker Pelosi, Congressman Boehner, and Secretary Paulson of the Bush administration.
