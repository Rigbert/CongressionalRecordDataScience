Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend, Mr. Neal, for yielding.  I rise with a heavy heart to join him in opposing this mean-spirited, reckless bill.  Mr. Speaker, 30 years ago, I was elected to fight for and to serve the people of my district. Today, they are calling and begging for us to slow down and to do this the right way. In their heart of hearts, the public knows that the safety net will be used to pay for this reckless corporate tax cut.  Taxpayers know that this shameful deal destroys the hopes and dreams oftoo many as it robs poor Peter to pay wealthy Paul. That is not right. That is not fair. That is not just.  Mr. Speaker, you cannot hide the truth from the sick, the elderly, the disabled for whom this bill may mean life or death. You cannot hide the truth from the middle class, working, and immigrant families who need every penny to make ends meet. You cannot hide the truth from teachers who try to lend a helping hand to students who struggle to get an education.  I, for one, refuse to hide the truth about this bill's attack on the separation of church and State.  Mr. Speaker, as we abandon our constitutional duty and sacrifice our moral authority, I fear that history will not be kind to any of us.  In another time, in another period, Members of Congress came together in a bipartisan fashion. They met, debated, and passed a tax bill that served the best interest of all people--not just a select few. They took their time. They did it right, and we should be doing it right.  Today, the Record must reflect the sad truth of this missed opportunity. H.R. 1 steals from our veterans, our seniors, our children, and from generations yet unborn All taxpayers expect, demand, and deserve better--much better--than legislation which would put politics before the good of the people.  This bill is a shame, a disgrace, and honestly, Mr. Speaker, it breaks my heart. I urge each and every one of my colleagues to vote ``no.''
