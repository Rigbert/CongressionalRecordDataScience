 President, I rise today to introduce legislation that lifts the unfair limits on how much people can save in their employer's pension plan. Last year, Congress took an important first step in helping people prepare for retirement through educating the public about private savings and pensions. But education can only go so far. We also must remove the barriers that prevent working Americans from achieving a secure retirement.  Removing the barriers means taking a fresh look at some of the provisions in the Internal Revenue Code which discourage workers and employers from putting money into pension plans. One of the most burdensome provisions in the Internal Revenue Code is the 25 percent limitation contained within section 415(c). Under 415(c), total contributions by employer and employee into a defined contribution (DC) plan are limited to 25 percent of compensation or $30,000 for each participant, whichever is less. That limitation applies to all employees. If the total additions into a DC plan exceed the lesser of 25 percent or $30,000, the excess money will be subject to income taxes and a penalty in some cases.  To illustrate the need for elimination of the 25 percent limit let me use an example. Bill works for a medium size company in my home state of Iowa. His employer sponsors a 401(k) plan and a profit sharing plan to help employees save for retirement. Bill makes $25,000 a year and elects to put in 10 percent of his compensation into the 401(k) plan, which amounts to $2,500 per year. His employer will match the first 5 percent of his compensation, which comes out to be $1,250, into the 401(k) plan. Therefore, the total 401(k) contribution into Bill's account in this year is $3,750. In this same year Bill's employer determines to set aside a sufficient amount of his profits to the profit sharing plan which results in an allocation to Bill's account in the profit sharing plan the sum of $3,205. This brings the total contribution into Bill's retirement plan this year up to $6,955.  Unfortunately, because of the 25 percent of compensation limitation only $6,250 can be put into Bill's account for the year. The amount intended for Bill's account exceeds that limitation by $705. Hence, the profit sharing plan administrator must reduce the amount intended for allocation to Bill's account by $705 in order to avoid a penalty. Bill is unlikely to be able to save $705, a significant amount that would otherwise be yielding a tax deferred income which would increase the benefit Bill will receive at retirement. Bill's retirement saving is shortchanged by $705 plus the tax-deferred earnings it would have generated.  Now let us look at Irene. Irene works for the same company, but she makes $45,000 a year. She also puts in 10 percent of her compensation into the 401(k) plan, and her employer matches five percent of her salary into the account. That brings the combined contribution of Irene and her employer up to $6,750. She would also receive a contribution of $3,205 from the profit sharing plan. This brings the total contribution into Irene's pension plan for that year to $9,955. She is also subject to the 25 percent limit, but for Irene, her limit would not be reached until $11,200. She is able to put in her 10 percent, receive the five percent match and receive the full amount from the profit share because her amount doesn't exceed the limit.  Despite the fact that Bill and Irene have the same discipline to add to their pension plans and save for their retirements, Bill is penalized by the 25 percent limitation. By lifting the 25 percent limit, we can provide a higher threshold of savings for those who need it most.  Permitting additional contributions to DC plans will help women ``catch up'' on their retirement savings goals. Women are more likely to live out the last years of their retirement in poverty for a number of reasons. Women have longer lifespans, they are more likely to leave the workforce to raise children or care for elderly parents, are more likely to have to use assets to pay for long-term care for an ill spouse, and traditionally make less money than their male counterparts. Anyone who has delayed saving for retirement will get a much needed boost to their retirement savings strategy if the 25 percent limit is eliminated for employees.  Not only does this proposal help individual employees save for retirement but it also helps the many businesses, both small and large which are affected by 415(c). First, the 25 percent limitation causes equity concerns within businesses. Low and mid-salary workers do not feel as if the Code treats them equitably, when their higher-paid supervisor is permitted to save more in dollar terms in a tax-qualified pension plan.  Second, one of the primary reasons businesses offer pension plans is to reduce turnover and retain employees. Employers often supplement their 401(k) plans with generous matches or a profit-sharing plan to keep people on the job. The 415(c) limitation inhibits their ability to do that, particularly for the lower-paid workers who are unfairly affected.  Third, this legislation will ease the administrative burdens connected with the 25 percent limitation. Dollar limits are easier to track than percentage limits.  Finally, I want to placate any concerns that repealing the 25 percent limit will serve as a windfall for high-paid employees. The Code contains other limitations which provide protection against abuse. First, the Code limits the amount an employee can defer to a 401(k) plan. Under section 402(g) of the Code, workers can only defer up to $10,000 of compensation into a 401(k) plan in 1998. In addition, plans still must meet strict non-discrimination rules that ensure that benefits provided to highly-compensated employees are not overly generous.  The value to society of this proposal, if enacted, is undeniable. Increased savings in qualified retirement plans can prevent leakage, meaning the money is less likely to be spent, or cashed out as might happen in a savings account or even an IRA.  There will be those out there who recognize that this bill does not address the impact of the 415 limit for all of the plans that are subject to it. I have included language that would provide relief to 401(k) plans and 403(b)plans, for example. Plans authorized by section 457 of the Code--used by state and local governments and non-profit organizations have not been specifically addressed. I want to assure organizations who sponsor 457 plans that I support ultimate conformity for all plans affected by the 415(c) percentage limitation. Over the next couple of weeks, I hope to work with these organizations to identify the changes that are necessary to achieve equity and simplicity for their employees. In the mean time, this is a positive step toward enhancing the retirement savings opportunities of working Americans.  We have begun to educate all Americans about the importance of saving for retirement, but if we educate and then do not give them the tools to allow people to practically apply that knowledge, we have failed in our ultimate goal to increase national savings. Let's help Americans succeed in saving for retirement. In helping them achieve their retirement goals, they help us to achieve our goal as policymakers of improving the quality of life for Americans.  I would like to thank the Profit Sharing Council of America and the many members of the Retirement Savings Network for their considerable help in championing this proposal. I ask unanimous consent that their letter of support be included in the Record. I also want to thank an Iowa company, IPSCO, in Camanche, Iowa, and its many employees for bringing this issue to the forefront. I ask unanimous consent to include a letter from IPSCO in the Record, and note that their letter was accompanied by a petition signed by nearly 200 employees. Finally, I want to extend my appreciation to Senators Breaux, Jeffords, Graham, and Baucus for co-sponsoring this important bill. I encourage all of my colleagues to give careful consideration to lending your support to this legislation.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                   March 25, 1998.     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       We, the undersigned organizations, commend you for      introducing the Enhanced Savings Opportunity Act that repeals      the Section 415(c) 25% limitation currently imposed on      employees participating in defined contribution plans and      pledge our support of your efforts to obtain passage.       This legislation promotes a conducive environment for      expanding the savings opportunities in employer-provided      retirement programs by removing one of the impediments that      prevents employees, especially lower-paid employees, from      taking full advantage of profit sharing, 401(k), 403(b), and      other defined contribution programs. It will also decrease      the burdensome testing currently imposed on plan      administrators and better enable companies to take advantage      of the new SIMPLE 401(k) program for small employers.       For example, the Enhanced Savings Opportunity Act will      permit employees who leave and reenter the workforce, many of      whom are women, to make larger contributions when they are      working, in effect allowing them to ``catch up'' their      contributions. It will also promote equal treatment by      allowing all employees to defer up to $10,000 of their income      into a 401(k) plan. Finally, the existing section 415(c) 25%      limitation frequently requires that a company limit its      contributions to lower-paid employees who take full advantage      of the savings feature of a 401(k) plan. By modifying Section      415(c) you will permit more generous company matching and      profit-sharing contributions to its employees. Similarly,      your legislation will allow participants in 403(b) plans to      increase savings in those plans. We appreciate your efforts      to preserve equity by extending relief to 401(k), 403(b), and      other types of defined contribution plans.       Again, thank you for introducing the Enhanced Savings      Opportunities Act. Please feel free to call on us as you move      forward to seek its enactment.

Hon. Charles Grassley,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Grassley: Currently Code 415(c) of the IRS      rules does not permit an employee to receive contributions      that total more than 25% of his or her income or more than      $30,000. The intent was meant to limit the contributions of      highly paid executives. Defined contribution plans have      become a very popular method to save for retirement, but the      rules have not kept pace with the times. Now, non-executives      are slighted by the rules that were designed to help them by      limiting the amount that can be put away for retirement.       Since 1994 the 415(c) code has prevented IPSCO from      contributing the fully allocated, pretax funds, to each      employee's retirement fund. Each year several thousand      dollars of pretax money, earmarked for retirement, has been      disbursed as taxable income to many employees. The employee's      retirement plan is short changed, because the plan cannot      receive all of the funds that it should and the employee ends      up with taxable earnings that were intended for retirement.      Non-executive employees should not have artificial limits set      on their retirement savings.       If your efforts are successful and a bill is passed to lift      the percentage limits on contributions to retirement      contributions this problem will be redressed.           Yours truly,                                                  IPSCO Employees.                                 ______                                       By
