President, I wish to engage the distinguished Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee and the Defense Subcommittee, Senator Stevens, in a brief colloquy regarding the Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps program (JROTC).  As Chairman Stevens may know, the Chicago Public Schools have developed and implemented a very successful JROTC program. Since the program began, it has served over 7,500 cadets from all four branches of the armed services and helped these students achieve better grades, attendance, conduct, and higher graduation rates. The Chicago Public Schools are now in need of expanding the successful JROTC program to an additional 10 high schools, including the Chicago Military Academy at Bronzeville. And, they are attempting to enter partnerships with all of the branches of the armed services in order to better serve interested students.  The Senate bill includes an increase for JROTC of $3.5 million. Is it the understanding of Chairman Stevens that successful programs like the one in Chicago should be able to work with the Department of Defense and the various branches to receive funding?
