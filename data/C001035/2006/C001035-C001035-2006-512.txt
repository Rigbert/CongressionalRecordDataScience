He is correct. The amendment I propose to section 3622 does not and is not intended to preclude any interested party from securing a hearing before the Postal Regulatory Commission if it believes that the rates being charged or the manner in which services being provided to that mailer or mailer group violates the act. It is my hope that in conference that we can work to assure that the Postal Regulatory Commission does not become embroiled in attempts to resolve disputes as to internal affairs or purely operational decisions of the Postal Service. This provision is intended to protect the rights of the mailing public against the potential for monopoly abuse or other unjust or unfair conduct by the Postal Service in terms of rates charged or the nature of service provided.
