Mr. Speaker, this Congress has focused much needed attention on U.S. foreign policy with respect to the internationally recognized right to freedom of religion and the right to practice one's personal faith. As Co-Chairman of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe and for the benefit of my colleagues, I would like to direct the attention of this House to the Department of State's ``OSCE Implementation Report 1998'' and, more specifically, the sections concerning religious freedom issues.  In Central Asia, the recognition of religious liberty has been mixed. The Constitution and laws of the Kyrgyz Republic provide for the right of all citizens to choose and practice their own religion. However, these rights are not being effectively protected in practice. In December 1996, the President issued a decree creating new legal obstacles for registering church congregations. In 1997, a new law failed to pass the parliament that would have severely limited religious liberties. Similarly, in its seventh year of independence, Kazakhstani citizens enjoy basic religious rights, although the government is inclined to regulate the activities of foreign religious associations. Current law in Turkmenistan requires 500 signatures before registration is granted and in Uzbekistan, similar restrictions apply to religious groups.  In Eastern Europe, although there are signs of progress, there are some countries that could be potential trouble spots. In 1997, Russia enacted a potentially discriminatory law concerning religion which imposes new restrictions on the establishment of new religious organizations. In Moldova, there is currently in force a 1992 law on religion that contains some restrictions to religious liberty and could inhibit the activities of some religions, although these provisions are reportedly not being enforced. In Ukraine, despite the 1991 law which has positive provisions, a 1993 amendment to that law has been used to restrict the activities of foreign religious organizations. Foreign religious workers have encountered resistance from Ukrainian local officials when trying to renew visas or seeking the use of public buildings for religious services. These kinds of government activities may violate commitments found in the Helsinki Final Act, Basket III, Section 1d, in which the participating states confirm that religious faiths can have contacts and meetings among themselves.  The focus of the report on the Baltic States is Latvia where freedom of religion is constitutionally well established. Under the 1995 Law on Religious Organizations, the Government of Latvia does not require religious groups to register. However, there is incentive to do so in that certain rights and privileges will be afforded to them only if they register. The Justice Ministry has registered some 800 congregations under this law but still denies registered status to Jehovah's Witnesses, the Latvian Free Orthodox Church, the Church of Christ Scientist, and the Rock of Salvation Church. With respect to foreign missionaries, they are allowed to hold meetings and proselytize only if Latvian religious organizations invite them. In particular the Jehovah's Witnesses have encountered severe obstacles under the current Latvian legal framework. As one of the privileges afforded to registered religious organizations, Latvian law allows for religious education to be provided to students in public schools on a voluntary basis by representatives of registered faiths. Elsewhere in the Baltics, Estonia has yet to clarify the implementation of a new visa law enacted in January which could potentially restrict residency of foreign missionaries to ninety days during any six month period. The Baltics merit a close watch, despite some favorable reports.  In the Caucasus, both Azerbaijan and Armenia have strict laws prohibiting foreigners from proselytizing. While Azerbaijan does respect ``domestic'' faiths, placing no restrictions on them, many foreign groups have reported harassment. The Ministry of Justice has deniedregistration to one such group but does allow it to continue to function. The Helsinki Commission in investigating this case has learned that, because of this church's work among the refugee population, the Azeri government continues to refuse to register the humanitarian aid arm of the church but continues to refuse registration to their religious body. Unfortunately, this appears to be a pattern the Azeri Government follows when it receives a benefit from a group it does not want to register.  In Armenia there are similar concerns. In September of 1997, a new law was enacted by parliament, designed to stifle the growth of non-Armenian Orthodox churches by tightening registration requirements for non-Apostolic religions and also by tightening funding restrictions so that foreign-based churches are not allowed to be supported by funds from headquarters outside Armenia. Despite this, however, a variety of faiths regularly hold services.  While there has been progress in the OSCE region, there remain areas where significant violations of religious liberty are occurring in Eastern and Central Europe. I commend the ``OSCE Implementation Report 1998'' to my colleagues as an interesting study of the progress and problems of the region.                          ____________________
