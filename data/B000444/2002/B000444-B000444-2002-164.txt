 President, the energy bill that we will pass today is not the most perfect bill--there are a number of things in this bill that I don't like. What we will pass today is the product of two months of debate and changes, and it is a compromise. It offers the basis for a comprehensive and balanced plan to address the energy needs of this country.  Anyone who drives a car or pays an electric bill knows that over the past two years there have been huge fluctuations in oil and gas prices. The bill that will pass the Senate today by a bipartisan vote will increase energy supplies--fossil fuels and alternative sources such as ethanol, biodiesel, wind, solar and geothermal--will help stabilize prices, and will do so in an environmentally sensitive way. It provides tax incentives to spur new oil and gas production and development of renewable sources, while also promoting responsible conservation. It includes important consumer protections and assistance for low income persons, particularly the elderly who live on fixed incomes. And I was also pleased that this bill protects the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge from oil drilling, and takes important steps toward cutting greenhouse gas emissions.  I am voting in favor of this bill today because it provides an important framework for a national energy policy. I think that there is more we can do and I am hopeful that in conference, the House and Senate will work together to improve this legislation.
