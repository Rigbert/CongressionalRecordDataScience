President, this is an attempt to write the DC gun laws and to take away the authority of the elected government of the District of Columbia to write its own laws relative to firearms consistent with the new Supreme Court decision. If the Senator from Texas were making such a proposal for the city of Dallas or the city of Houston or the city of San Antonio, it would have some credibility because that is her State. But to make this request that we would overrule the power of the elected government of DC to implement the Supreme Court decision is inappropriate.  On behalf of Senators who have signed a public letter in opposition to the bill that passed the House, Senators Lautenberg, Feinstein, Menendez, Mikulski, Akaka, Jack Reed, Ted Kennedy, John Kerry, Chris Dodd, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Ben Cardin, and myself, I object.
