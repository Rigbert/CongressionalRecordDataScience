I am pleased to have Senators Daschle, Kennedy, Feingold, and Bingaman as cosponsors for this anti-crime bill.  The Seniors Safety Act is a comprehensive bill that addresses the most prevalent crimes perpetrated against seniors, including health care fraud, nursing home abuse, telemarketing fraud--and bribery, graft and fraud in pension and employee benefit plans. In addition, this legislation would help seniors obtain restitution if their pension plans are defrauded.  Older Americans are the most rapidly growing population group in our society, making them an even more attractive target for criminals. The Department of Health and Human Services has predicted that the number of older Americans will grow from 13 percent of the U.S. population in 2000 to 20 percent by 2030. In Vermont, seniors comprise about 12 percent of the population, a number that is expected to increase to 20 percent by 2025.  Crime against seniors has remained stubbornly resistant over the last decade. According to a 2000 Justice Department study, more than 90 percent of crimes committed against older Americans were property crimes, with theft the most common. As our Nation addressed our violent crime problem, we did not take a comprehensive approach to deterring the crimes that so affect the elderly, like telemarketing fraud, health care fraud, and pension fraud. The Seniors Safety Act provides such a comprehensive approach, and I urge the Senate to pass it.  The Seniors Safety Act instructs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to review current sentencing guidelines and, if appropriate, amend the guidelines to include the age of a crime victim as a criteria for determining whether a sentencing enhancement is proper. The bill also requires the Commission to review sentencing guidelines for health care benefit fraud, increases statutory penalties both for fraud resulting in serious injury or death and for briberyand graft in connection with employee benefit plans, and increases criminal and civil penalties for defrauding pension plans.  Telemarketing fraud is one crime that disproportionately harms Americans over age 50. The Seniors Safety Act seeks to fight the perpetrators of fraud--schemes that often succeed in swindling seniors of their life savings. Some of these schemes are directed from outside the United States, making criminal prosecution more difficult.  The Act would provide the Attorney General with a new and substantial tool to prevent telemarketing fraud the power to block or terminate service to telephone facilities that are being used to defraud innocent people. The Justice Department could use this authority to disrupt telemarketing fraud schemes directed from foreign sources by cutting off the swindlers' telephone service. Even if the criminals acquire a new telephone number, temporary interruptions will prevent some seniors from being victimized.  The bill also establishes a ``Better Business Bureau''-style clearinghouse at the Federal Trade Commission to provide seniors, their families, and others who may be concerned about a telemarketer with information about prior law enforcement actions against the particular company. In addition, the FTC would refer seniors and other consumers who believe they have been swindled to the appropriate law enforcement authorities.  Criminal activity that undermines the safety and integrity of pension plans and health benefit programs threatens all Americans, but most especially those seniors who have relied on promised benefits in planning their retirements. Seniors who have worked faithfully and honestly for years should not reach their retirement years only to find that the funds they relied upon were stolen.  The Seniors Safety Act would add to the arsenal that federal prosecutors can draw upon to prevent and punish fraud against retirement plans. Specifically, the Act would create new criminal and civil penalties for defrauding pension plans or obtaining money or property from such plans by means of false or fraudulent pretenses. In addition, the Act would enhance penalties for bribery and graft in connection with employee benefit plans. The only people enjoying the benefits of pension plans should be the people who have worked hard to fund those plans, not crooks who get the money by fraud.  Health care spending consists of about 15 percent of the gross national product, or more than $1 trillion each year. Estimated losses due to fraud and abuse are astronomical. A December 1998 report by the National Institute of Justice, NIJ, states that these losses ``may exceed 10 percent of annual health care spending, or $100 billion per year.''  As more health care claims are processed electronically, more sophisticated computer-generated fraud schemes are surfacing. Some of these schemes generate thousands of false claims designed to pass through automated claims processing to payment, and result in the theft of millions of dollars from federal and private health care programs. Fraud against Medicare, Medicaid and private health plans increases the financial burden on taxpayers and beneficiaries alike. In addition, some forms of fraud may result in inadequate medical care, harming patients' health as well. Unfortunately, the NIJ reports that many health care fraud schemes ``deliberately target vulnerable populations, such as the elderly or Alzheimer's patients, who are less willing or able to complain or alert law enforcement.''  We saw a dramatic increase in criminal convictions for health care fraud cases during the 1990s. These cases included convictions for submitting false claims to Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance plans; fraudulent billings by foreign doctors; and needless prescriptions for durable medical equipment by doctors in exchange for kickbacks from manufacturers.  We can and must do more. The Seniors Safety Act would allow the Attorney General to bring injunctive actions to stop false claims and illegal kickback schemes involving federal health care programs. The bill would also provide law enforcement authorities with additional investigatory tools to uncover, investigate, and prosecute health care offenses in both criminal and civil proceedings.  In addition, whistle-blowers who tip off law enforcement officers about health care fraud would be authorized under the Seniors Safety Act to seek court permission to review information obtained by the government to enhance their assistance in False Claims Act lawsuits. Such qui tam, or whistle-blower, suits have dramatically enhanced the government's ability to uncover health care fraud. The Act would allow whistle-blowers and their qui tam suits to become even more effective.  Finally, the Act would extend anti-fraud and anti-kickback safeguards to the Federal Employees Health Benefits program. These are all important steps that will help cut down on the enormous health care fraud losses.  As life expectancies continue to increase, long-term care planning specialists estimate that over 40 percent of those turning 65 eventually will need nursing home care, and that 20 percent of those seniors will spend five years or more in homes. Indeed, many of us already have experienced having our parents, family members or other loved ones spend time in a nursing home. We owe it to them and to ourselves to give the residents of nursing homes the best and safest care they can get.  The Justice Department has cited egregious examples of nursing homes that pocketed Medicare funds instead of providing residents with adequate care. In one case, five patients died as a result of the inadequate provision of nutrition, wound care and diabetes management by three Pennsylvania nursing homes. Yet another death occurred when a patient, who was unable to speak, was placed in a scalding tub of 138-degree water.  This Act provides additional peace of mind to nursing home residents and their families by providing federal law enforcement with the authority to investigate and prosecute operators of nursing homes for willfully engaging in patterns of health and safety violations in the care of nursing home residents. The Act also protects whistle-blowers from retaliation for reporting such violations.  This title of the Seniors Safety Act would authorize the Attorney General to use forfeited funds to pay restitution to victims of fraudulent activity, and authorize the courts to require the forfeiture of proceeds from retirement-related offenses. In addition, it would exempt false claims actions from being stayed in bankruptcy proceedings and ensure that debts due to the United States from false claims actions are not dischargeable in bankruptcy.  We all deserve to age with dignity and free of the threat of abuse or fraud. No one can guarantee that this will happen, but the Senior Safety Act can be a powerful new tool to help crack down on those who prey upon older Americans. This effort is about all of us and our families.  These are problems that have persisted too long. It is past the time for the Senate to act. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1286       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

(a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:       (1) The number of older Americans is rapidly growing in the      United States. According to the 2000 census, 21 percent of      the United States population is 55 years of age or older.       (2) In 1997, 7 percent of victims of serious violent crime      were 50 years of age or older.       (3) In 1997, 17.7 percent of murder victims were 55 years      of age or older.       (4) According to the Department of Justice, persons 65      years of age and older experienced approximately 2,700,000      crimes a year between 1992 and 1997.       (5) Older victims of violent crime are almost twice as      likely as younger victims to be raped, robbed, or assaulted      at or in their own homes.       (6) Approximately half of all Americans who are 50 years of      age or older are afraid to walk alone at night in their own      neighborhoods.       (7) Seniors over 50 years of age reportedly account for 37      percent of the estimated $40,000,000,000 in losses each year      due to telemarketing fraud.       (8) A 1996 American Association of Retired Persons survey      of people 50 years of age and older showed that 57 percent      were likely to receive calls from telemarketers at least once      a week.       (9) In 1998, Congress enacted legislation to provide for      increased penalties for telemarketing fraud that targets      seniors.       (10) It has been estimated that--       (A) approximately 43 percent of persons turning 65 years of      age can expect to spend some time in a long-term care      facility; and       (B) approximately 20 percent can expect to spend 5 years or      more in a such a facility.       (11) In 1997, approximately $82,800,000,000 was spent on      nursing home care in the United States and over half of this      amount was spent by the Medicaid and Medicare programs.       (12) Losses to fraud and abuse in health care reportedly      cost the United States an estimated $100,000,000,000 in 1996.       (13) The Inspector General for the Department of Health and      Human Services has estimated that about $12,600,000,000 in      improper Medicare benefit payments, due to inadvertent      mistake, fraud, and abuse were made during fiscal year 1998.       (14) Incidents of health care fraud and abuse remain common      despite awareness of the problem.       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--       (1) combat nursing home fraud and abuse;       (2) enhance safeguards for pension plans and health care      programs;       (3) develop strategies for preventing and punishing crimes      that target or otherwise disproportionately affect seniors by      collecting appropriate data--       (A) to measure the extent of crimes committed against      seniors; and       (B) to determine the extent of domestic and elder abuse of      seniors; and       (4) prevent and deter criminal activity, such as      telemarketing fraud, that results in economic and physical      harm against seniors, and ensure appropriate restitution.     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.       In this Act:       (1) Crime.--The term ``crime'' means any criminal offense      under Federal or State law.
