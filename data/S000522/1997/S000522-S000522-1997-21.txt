Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2195, which has now 27 cosponsors from both sides of the aisle, represents a modest but important first step toward enforcing already existing U.S. law regarding slave-made products. First it authorizes $2 million in fiscal year 1999 for additional monitoring by the United States Customs Service for products made with slave labor. Second, it requires the Commissioner of Customs to report to Congress on the manufacture and export of products made with slave labor. Finally, it expresses the sense of Congress that the President should determine whether China is frustrating implementation of the memorandum ofunderstanding, and if the answer is affirmative, then he should begin negotiations for a new MOU with effective monitoring procedures.  I can say parenthetically, that cannot start a moment too soon, because I have been watching this as chairman of the Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights for a number of years, and we know that despite some action that has been taken, the MOU and its follow-on document was flawed.  Mr. Speaker, the bill is directed, as we know, primarily toward China. This is not because we are unfairly singling out China, but because China is far and away the biggest source of slave-made goods. In the words of George Weise, the Commissioner of the U.S. Customs Service, ``China is currently by far the country most frequently associated with the export of prison labor-made goods to the United States.''  As a matter of fact, in the first 60 years of the existence of section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930 as amended, which provides U.S. Customs with its primary authority concerning the importation of convict or forced labor, the United States took action twice against products produced in a Soviet gulag and in a Mexican prison. Since September 1991, however, the U.S. Customs Service has banned nearly 2 dozen Chinese products. These just represent the tip of the iceberg. For the Record I will submit those couple of dozen at the appropriate time, Mr. Speaker.  Let me just also point out, Mr. Speaker, we have had a number of hearings in the Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights. As a matter of fact, back in 1995, April 3, we had the first hearing ever on survivors of the Laogai. We heard from Harry Wu, Catherine Ho; we heard from Tang Boiqiao, who was one of the protesters at Tiananmen Square, and they describe in absolutely riveting and nauseating detail what actually goes on day in and day out in the Laogai. It is horrific.  They talked about using cattle prods. As a matter of fact, the Tibetan monk who testified before our committee, Palden Gyatso, could not get through Rayburn security when he came in with a cattle prod, and then he told us what they do with the cattle prod. We had to go down and escort him through. He said, this is commonplace. His teeth are ruined. The genitals often get inflicted with this terrible and hideous device, and they do that on women and on men.  Catherine Ho talked about as a Catholic how she had been mistreated, and to read the words are to make you sick. That this goes on day in and day out, and they make products that do end up on our shelves.  There are those who may disagree, who think this is hyperbole. Look at the list, and the list will grow if we demand enhanced enforcement. This legislation is just a modest step in demanding some additional enforcement.  The gentleman from Virginia [Mr. Wolf] and I have been in gulags. We were in a Beijing prison camp where we saw jelly shoes and socks being made for export. Yes, the Chinese authorities shut down that one, but for every one that is shut down, there are another thousand plus that are operating and littering the countryside of China where these things are made.                              {time}  2015  We saw 40 Tiananmen Square activists, men and women, these were men in this case, who put their lives on the line for democracy, who were slaving away for these products that were going to be sent overseas to the United States.  Let me also point out, Mr. Speaker, that the lack of vigorous enforcement of U.S. laws against slave-made goods does not merely support repression within China, it also hurts American manufacturers.  For example, at a May 22, 1997, hearing of my subcommittee, we received testimony from a man by the name of Peter Levy, an American manufacturer of office supplies. Mr. Levy, who was curious about how one of his competitors was able to sell certain products at such low prices, launched his own investigation. It led him to a prison compound in Nanjing, China, where his competitor's products were being assembled by prisoners at a Chinese gulag in Laogai, and I understand because of what Mr. Levy did, the United States Customs Service has now taken that case and is investigating that case for, hopefully, some prompt action.  This legislation is modest, I hope everyone can support it, and I thank the gentleman from California [Mr. Matsui] and my good friend from Illinois [Mr. Crane] for their support as well.

My name is Tang Boiqiao and I am a former student      of Hunan Teachers' College. In July 1989, I was arrested by      the Communists because of my organizing and participating in      the Hunan student movement. I was held until July 1990 before      finally being sentenced to 3 years' detention. My crime was      called counterrevolutionary propagandizing and incitement.       In October of that year, I was transferred to the Hunan      Province Longxi Prison for reform through labor. In January      1991, I was unexpectedly released from prison.       After my release, I was again arrested because of my      continued involvement in the popular movements and human      rights activities. Following the summer of 1991, I fled      China. In April 1992, I entered the United States and sought      political asylum.       My reason for coming here today is to share with you my      experiences while in the Laogai.       I was first arrested in July 1969 in Guangdong Province,      after which I was held in three different detention centers      where I was forced to labor with my fellow prisoners. While      at Guangdong No. 1 Detention Center, I made toys which had      the words ``Made in China'' in English written on them. I was      allowed to eat only twice a day.       Next, I was transferred to Changsha in Hunan and spent more      than a year at the Changsha No. 1 Detention Center. During      this time I suffered through the darkest and most hopeless      existence. For more than 4 months straight, I was questioned      about my case an average 10 hours a day in what the      Communists call exhaustive tactics. This Laogai forced its      prisoners to produce match boxes. There were no labor rewards      but every month the cellmates, which had the highest      production numbers, were given one cheap cigarette a day. The      police or officials forced the prisoners to work day and      night so that they could report increased production output      and receive cash incentives. We would work for at least 12      hours per day. The longest day was one when we worked 23\1/2\      hours with a half-hour food break.       Because I would refuse to work, the public security police      would often arrange for the other prisoners to abuse and beat      me. One day I was beaten three different times by seven or      eight young prisoners, two of which were convicted murderers.      The first time, because I was unwilling to be forced to      labor,     they beat me until I bled from the eyes, ears, nose, and      mouth. The second time, because I resisted when they tried to      force me to kneel down, they used anything they could find in      the cell to beat me, including a wooden stool, heavy wooden      sticks and metal cups and bowls. The last time they beat me      while I could not move and lay on the floor hunched over.       At this, the public security police were still not      satisfied, so that evening they held a struggle session and      ordered every prisoner in the Laogai to viciously beat me.      That night I developed a fever of 104 degrees, which      persisted for more than a week. I was unable to even sit      upright.       While there were many methods used in torturing people at      this Laogai, the most often used tools were the electric      police baton and shackles. There were more than 10 kinds of      shackles, including thumb shackles, so-called earth shackles,      all kind of wrist shackles, chain shackles, chain-link      shackles, door frame shackles, heavy shackles and others. The      most simple method was to conduct a political study class      where the prisoners needed to attend for long periods of time      while shackled. I personally experienced electric shocks and      many kinds of shackles.       The Laogai prisons used different types of abuse and      control than those of the detention centers. After I was      transferred to the prison, when I was first assigned to a      prison brigade, we were shown the three unforgettable phrases      that were written on the wall of the prison entrance. ``Where      are you? What are you? What are you to do here?''       Later in the daily political study classes, we needed to      follow these questions with the responses, ``This is a      prison. I am a criminal. I am here to receive reform through      labor.'' We also had to sing three songs at the beginning of      every political study class. The songs were ``Socialism is      Good,'' ``Without the Communist Party There Would be no New      China'' and ``Emulate Lei Feng.'' Lei Feng was a 1950's      Chinese Communist martyr.       The kind of billboard you see above the prison there has      these three slogans that the prisoners see when they enter      the prison, ``Where are you? What are you? And what are you      doing here?'' And the other sign there says, has the slogans,      ``Labor production is the way, reform is the main goal.''       The words ``Socialism is good'' begins ``Socialism is good.      Socialism is good. Everyone in a socialist society is      improved.'' The lyrics of ``Without the Communist Party,      there would be no new China'' are ``Without the Communist      Party, There Would be no New China, the Communist Party is      united for the people. The Communist Party is united to save      China.''       The meaning of the last song is that we should all be like      the Communist hero Lei Feng. That is, ``Loyal to the      revolution, loyal to the party, standing in the field erect      and unwavering, Communist thinking emits knowledge.'' I      realized that this was how they would force us to reform our      thinking, so I refused to sing the three songs.       The police used many methods to try to intimidate and      coerce me into cooperating, and in the end, I was sent to the      prison of prisons, solitary confinement. Its length and      height are barely enough to hold a man, and it has solid      walls with only a tiny slit in the door. It very easily makes      men think like animals in a cage.       These are only some of the stories of my time in the      Laogai, yet all of the mistreatment and abuse I suffered in      the Laogai is just a drop of water in a great river. When you      think of all the abuses of the millions of Chinese citizens      still condemned in the Laogai, my story is just the tip of      the iceberg.       Thank you very much.       Mr. Smith. I want to thank you for your very eloquent      testimony and for bringing the horrors, however succinctly      you described them, to the attention of this subcommittee. I      know that many of the members will be reading this transcript      and will be reading your description of what you went through      personally and what others have gone through with a great      deal of empathy and the sense of horror. And I think we lose      that sometimes in Congress when we are so far removed from it      and we make policy in some-what of a vacuum and, again, to      know what we are a part of and complicit in when we are      dealing with the Chinese economic system and products      manufactured in Laogai like what you made could be well      finding our ways onto to our own shores, makes us--should      make us act more responsibly and to bend over backwards not      to be complicit in that kind of horror.       So I thank you.       What I thought we might do in the subcommittee is ask all      of our witnesses to testify first and then to ask members of      the subcommittee to pose questions at that time.       I would like to call to the witness chair Catherine Ho.      Mrs. Ho is a Catholic who was accused of counterrevolutionary      crimes. She spent 21 years in the Chinese Gulag system.       And I would ask you to proceed however you may wish. Your      full statement will be made a part of the record.                statement of catherine ho, catholic nun       Ms. Ho. My name is Catherine Ho.       One of the goals of the Laogai camps is to break the human      spirit through torture of the body. But even worse than the      bodily abuses is the unceasing assault of the prisoner's      thoughts and individual will. This is especially true of the      suffering endured by the millions of women condemned to the      Laogai.       I was born into a well-educated family in Shanghai. My good      parents sent me to an excellent Catholic high school. There I      became a Catholic. I studied very hard and should have had a      bright future. Instead, I was arrested and imprisoned by the      Communist government before I was even 18 years old. I was      arrested on September 8, 1955, as was our bishop in Shanghai,      Cardinal Kung. Kung is now in the United States receiving      medical care.       Between 1953 and 1955, the church-run schools and hospitals      in Shanghai were taken over by the Communists. The church's      charitable institutions were simply closed. The foreign      missionaries had already been expelled as imperialists. The      Chinese priests and the bishops were all targets of the      Communists and were either killed or arrested one after      another.       Most of the Christians were forced to go through      brainwashing. They faced losing their jobs or educational      opportunities. And they also faced being sent to the Laogai      camps or prisons to suffer because of their faith. Religious      people were continuously persecuted by Communists.       We did not oppose the government. We only wanted to      practice our religion but the Communists said it was a crime      against China. The only reason I was put in jail was because      I was an active Christian. I was a member of the Legion of      Mary, which is a devout missionary organization. And I did      missionary works. I refused to renounce our church and did      not want to be a part of the Communist-controlled church.       Because of my faith, they put me in jail. They isolated me      from the outside world. They tried to confuse me with all      their propaganda. But I knew they told lies. I could not go      against my conscience. I could not deny my faith. I could not      give up my faith, which is such a precious gift that many      Christians were willing to die for it.       At first they sentenced me to 7 years in the Laogai Prison      in the labor camp as a counterrevolutionary. I was not      allowed legal representation. I did not even have a trial.      When they found out that I had still not changed my mind      after my 7 years, they would not let me go. They kept me in      the Laogai camp for 21 years.       The Chinese Communists cannot tolerate religion, especially      the Christian religion. They have a hatred for everything      which involves believing any god above or beyond human kind.      To this day, they are still persecuting and imprisoning      religious believers.       I would like to now give you some examples of the      systematic abuse and the persecution of the Laogai camps.      These Laogai camps are in no way like the prisons we know of      in this country. No way. Words are not enough to convey the      horrible day-to-day realities of the prisoners in the Laogai.       Physically we were always hungry, tired, and filthy. The      women were forced to do heavy labor, like plowing the desert,      raising cattle, or running a tea farm. The physical torture      of our body was so extreme that many women's menstruation      ceased in many of the women in the Laogai camp. This put      great strain on both a women's body and her mind. There were      never any medical treatments of this or other sicknesses.       Despite these exhaustive and grueling conditions, we were      forced to produce high-level products. For example, I was in      a Laogai camp tea farm for about 10 years. This is the Laogai      tea farm.       The women prisoners were forced to plant the trees, take      care of the plants, and then process the tea leaves into red      or green tea. I spent another 4 years weaving silk and cloth      in Laogai factory. On the surface, it was a textile factory      in Hangzhou, but the workers were all women prisoners doing      forced labor. In the factory, there were two constant      pressures upon us. First was the physical fatigue. I was      forced to work very hard for 14 hours a day. I had to fight      exhaustion just to keep from falling into the machines.      Second was the constant supervision. Since we were told that      the products we made were for export to foreign countries,      they watched our every move to be sure we made no mistakes.      If there were mistakes or someone did not appear to be      working hard, we were severely punished. They used ankle      fetters, handcuffs, solitary confinement, and other means to      punish us.       Today I often wonder if the tea I drink or the silk I wear      comes from Laogai camps and is made by all those poor Laogai      slaves still suffering in China.       Daily we were assaulted mentally. We were continually      brainwashed. We were not allowed to say our prayers or to      read bibles. I remember clearly my first day in the detention      center. I kneeled down on the muddy ground, bowed my head,      and begged for the Lord to give me the strength. The warden      immediately scolded me, ``Who told you to kneel down? Even at      the door of death, you keep up your superstitions. This is a      counterrevolutionary activity.''       In the Laogai, we were not allowed to hear and read      anything but the Communist propaganda. We had to spend 2      hours everyday reading Mao's book and reciting the prison      regulations. I remember one 60-year-old sister who made a set      of small rosary beads out of thread so it will not be      discovered and confiscated by the guards.       The continuous brainwashing helped destroy all human love      and was a denial of all basic human rights.       Spiritually, it was a constant struggle. We faced constant      despair and always heard the     discouraging and threatening comments of the authorities. A      prisoner had to confess her crime everyday, which meant      scolding oneself and accusing oneself of being guilty of the      greatest of crimes against the people and the government.       Every prisoner was degraded. They minimized their own value      of being human. They were separated from their families and      society. They were tortured in a dark hell that had no      foreseeable end. They fought the despair and hopelessness of      thinking that they were to spend the rest of their lives as      slaves in the Laogai.       One woman refused to work on Sundays. She would say prayers      instead of singing revolutionary songs in front of Mao's      portrait. One day she was dragged out to the field where we      were working and beaten to death in front of all of us.       I said the Communists' aim is to torture the body and break      the human spirit in every possible way and at every possible      opportunity. When the warden told me my beloved sister had      died, he simply said, ``The People's Government acted      humanely. It is all over now. You should not cry because that      is against the rules. And it would have a bad effect on the      feelings of the others about thought reform.'' They did not      let us laugh. They even did not let us cry.       They succeeded to the point where to many it looked like      there was no future, no hope. The prisoners in the Laogai      camp were always in a deep depression. I myself prayed to God      to let me die. I wanted to die more than I wanted to live      because the circumstances were too horrible. Even if you did      not want to continue living under this condition, they would      not let you die. There was a constant suicide watch.       God sustained us nevertheless. My faith preserved me. God's      grace helped me live through this nightmarish journey.      Finally my prayers were answered. After my parents had      written many, many letters to the Government from Hong Kong,      my husband, my son and I were allowed to leave the Laogai in      December 1978.       Today, I sit before you, which I had never dreamed 20 years      ago. I sit before you to take this opportunity to tell you      the truth, to tell you the facts as I have myself      experienced. But I speak not for myself but for the thousands      of brothers and sisters who are still living this terrible      existence.       Thank you for listening to me tell my story. I hope that      you may better understand the realities of the Laogai through      my account of it. Thank you.       Mr. Smith. Mrs. Ho, I want to thank you for your very      moving testimony and just observe that there is a conference      on women slated for Beijing in the fall of this year and the      voice and the testimony, the witness that you have made today      is something that needs to be heard at that conference.       Unfortunately, it is most likely going to be a conference      that has more of a Western-oriented focus and issues of the      abuse of women in the Laogai probably will not get mentioned      at all. But I think it behooves us, and I know from my      position as chairman of this subcommittee I will push hard to      try to ensure that you and people who have the kinds of      experiences that you have had at the hands of your jailers      get an opportunity to make your voice known at that very      important conference.       And I do want to thank you for your witness and certainly      your courage under such extreme pressure and your witness for      faith and the grace that surely had to have been within you      to preserve you during that very difficult time. It is very,      very inspiring indeed. So I thank you for that testimony.       I would like to--and again at the conclusion of our      witnesses, I would ask my subcommittee colleagues and myself      to--we will pose questions to our fine witnesses.       I would like to ask Father Cai if he would come to the      witness table at this time.       Father Cai is a Catholic priest. He was accused of      counterrevolutionary crimes and for that spent 35 years in      the Chinese Laogai. A remarkable man who has persevered and      who has had perseverance under such extreme situation, and      who is here to give us an account of what went on.       And I would ask, Father, if you would proceed as you would      like. Your full statement will be made a part of the record.              STATEMENT OF CAI ZHONGXIAN, CATHOLIC PRIEST       Mr. Cai. My testimony of my Laogai is that of a labor-camp      life. My name is Cai Zhongxian. I am a Catholic priest of the      Society of Jesus.       I was ordained in 1940. I was arrested and charged as a      counterrevolutionary in 1953 because of my refusal to      cooperate with the Communist authority and denounce the Roman      Catholic Church.       I was unexpectedly released without explanation in 1956. It      turned out that the Communist hoped that the leniency showed      to me would convince me to collaborate with the Party to      persuade other Catholics to become members of the officially      sanctioned Patriotic Catholic Church. This Patriotic Catholic      Church is nothing more than a Communist puppet organization.      When I refused to cooperate, I was once again arrested. So I      was detained twice for a total of 7 years at the Shanghai      Detention Center without charge or trial until I was finally      sentenced to a 15-year term in 1960.       I was then sent to a Laogai camp in Jiangxi Province, which      served as a brick factory. A lot of people avoided dying of      starvation mostly because they supplemented the rationed food      by eating frogs, snakes, and rats.       In 1962, four other priests and I were confined in a 6 by      12 foot windowless room that was filled with an inch of      standing water. Despite this ill treatment and the other      inhumane conditions, I continued my services as a Catholic      priest. I even successfully converted some of the guards who      were charged to watch us.       At the completion of my sentence, I was 62 years old. But I      was not fully released at that time. The Government forced me      to accept forced job replacement in the Laogai labor camp      because I was originally charged with the      counterrevolutionary crime.       I knew that a forced-job replacement assignment means a      life sentence laboring at the Laogai labor camp. I labored at      the Nanchang No. 4 prison for 11 years as a forced-job      replacement worker.       In 1981, at the age of 74, I was again arrested for my      continued activity as a Catholic priest. I was sentenced to      serve another 10-year term as a Laogai slave.       In 1988, I was released fully and unexpectedly. I was 81      years old at the time of my release. I served a total of 35      years in the labor camp. I cannot begin to tell you how many      people, among them many of my friends and my disciples      disappeared completely for every one that survived.       Thank you for inviting me here. I hope I have helped you      gain an understanding of the Communist government's      willingness to use the Laogai to destroy its citizens' human      rights. There are still priests in the Laogai camp.       Thank you.       Mr. Smith. Thank you, Father, very much for that moving      testimony as well. I am 42 years old, and when I think that      you have spent 35 of your years in the Laogai simply because      of your faith in Christ, it is truly moving and I know every      member of this subcommittee will take and remember your      testimony.       The Chinese Communists obviously do not discriminate when      they repress, and all people of faith who follow the lead of      God as they believe it is leading, are equally repressed. And      to give a unique perspective as it relates to the suffering      of the people of Tibet, we are very pleased to welcome Palden      Gyatso, a Tibetan monk, who spent, like Father, 32 years of      his life in the Chinese Laogai, and will give the insights      that he got from that and will recount and give witness to      the suffering and cruelty that was imposed upon him.       Please proceed.                statement of palden gyatso, tibetan monk       Mr. Gyatso. My name is Palden Gyatso.       Mr. Kelsang. I am Kelsang, who will be the translator for      him today.       Mr. Gyatso. I have longed for this moment most of the last      36 years and it is like a dream come true, and I would like      to thank the chairman and the other members of the committee      for giving me this opportunity to be here today. And consider      it not only as an honor but also a responsibility to inform      the U.S. Congress about the abuses that Tibetans are      suffering today in Tibet.       I have been in prison for 24 years and for 8 years I was in      a Chinese labor camp and during my days in prison, the      Chinese never fed us enough and we were forced to rummage      through the food that was meant for the pigs. And we were      also driven to eat things like leather, bones, and grass, and      it could be any bones, human as well as animal.       So since food was not enough, we were forced to eat leather      that we wore, and we also had to resort to eating things like      worms and, as I said, grasses.       And a lot of people died due to starvation, and I was      around 30 years old then, and some of the other things that      went on during my stay in prison, along with not getting      enough food, we were also made to work in the fields. We were      substituted for cows in plowing the field.       The reason why the Chinese put me in prison was because I      had called for more freedom and I had demanded more rights,      and the Chinese considered that to be engaging in      revolutionary activities, and these instruments that you see      before me today are some of the tools that were used to carry      out the torture on me.       Now, this is a piece of the electric baton that was used      and forced through my mouth and what happened was since this      had electric shocks, it totally damaged my teeth.       And I also saw Chinese prison officials inserting this into      a woman's vagina, and even today I know of women who have      difficulty in going to the bathroom because of the damage      that they suffered.       And I still bear today on my body some of the marks that      were inflicted because of this torture. For instance, because      of the self-tightening handcuff here, even today I have scars      on both my hands and they do not function properly. And some      of the other things that the Chinese did was keeping me      suspended in the air, and then beating with rifle butts and      piercing me with bayonets and pouring hot water over my body.      And as a result, I have injury marks on my head and on my      hands.       And I was even a witness to a couple of people who were      sentenced to death. As soon as the Chinese announced that      someone was to be sentenced to death, what they did was they      would force that political person of engage in singing songs      and dancing. The bullets that were used to kill someone, as      well as the ropes that were used to hang someone, even the      expenses involved for that would be deducted from the      convicted person.       These practices that go on in Chinese prisons and labor      camps in Tibet reflect the overall abuses going on today. And      in this regard, I would sort of especially like to mention      the trip by Ambassador Lilley in April 1991.       And I have kept this diary to this day, and this is a diary      that I kept while I was in prison.       Mr. Gyatso. And I have a slide of the day and the month      when then Ambassador Lilley visited Drapchi Prison in Lhasa.      That is the site of the Utritu prison in Lhasa where I spent      9 years.       That is a shot of Sangyip prison where I spent 10 years.       That is a shot of Drapchi prison where I spent 7 years.       And that is a map of Lhasa and the ones in red, they show      the detention facilities in Lhasa and they number about eight      today. And the ones in yellow and orange are military and      police complexes. And the ones in green are really what is      left of the traditional Tibetan area in Lhasa today.       In April 1991, then ambassador James Lilley, along with two      American officials, visited the Drapchi prison. And what      Palden Gyatso and his other friends in prison did was they      tried to present to Ambassador Lilley a petition detailing      the Chinese abuses in prison. But what happened was      ambassador Lilley--he was shaking his hands with one of the      prisoners and on his other hand he had the petition, but then      one of the Chinese guards just snatched away the petition and      after Ambassador Lilley left, the petition was given to the      warden of the prison, and because after he left, the Chinese      officials called in the Army. They had to go through a really      hard time.       And the other aspect of the visit was that every time when      such a delegation does visit any Tibetan prisons, the Chinese      put on a very different show. The prisons are cleaned up and      more food is provided. Just to give the impression that the      prisoners are healthy and that there is nothing wrong with      them.       And two of the individuals connected with presenting the      petition to Ambassador Lilley, Lobsang Tenzin and Tenpa      Wangdak, were detained in solitary confinement because of the      action.       The prisoners were then transferred to Nepal Tramo labor      camp close to Lhasa. After that the army came in and then      they started beating us up and started torturing us.       These are only a few instances of the various atrocities      committed by the Chinese on the Tibetans, and whatever I have      told you today is true and I am really glad that I have had a      chance to come here today and inform you all about this. And      please remember that there are still people inside Tibet      today who are going through similar experiences that I      have gone through.       Thank you very much.       Mr. Smith. Mr. Gyatso, I thank you for your, again, very      moving testimony and by actually visually displaying the      implements used to repress people and to torture them. You      bring an additional dimension to our understanding, feeble as      it is, to what it must be like to live under the horrors of      this terrible Gulag system.       And, you know, what we have been hearing so far, and I know      my colleagues and I all feel this, and that is you are      witness, and Father Cai, you as well, to unspeakable horrors.      And to think that this Government, the U.S. Government, and      many other Western governments, continue to trade and to do      business with the dictatorship in Beijing as if none of this      is going on, or as if it can be put in a compartment and all      other trade and commerce and diplomatic niceties can occur      with all of these unspeakable horrors going on baffles me and      angers me, and I think it does you as well.       Again, I think on this committee and among Members on both      sides of the aisle who care so deeply, our hope is to raise      human rights to the level that it deserves. It ought to be      central in our relationship with the Peoples Republic of      China and any other country of the world, not a sub-issue.      Regrettably it is a subissue at the current time.       I would like to ask Mr. Frank Wolf, Congressman Wolf, if he      would like to join us. Mr. Wolf is a leader in human rights      and has been very active, particularly on the issue of China      and the use of Gulag labor and the importation of those      products, and religious freedom as well.       I would like to call our final panel before going to      questions to appear before the subcommittee. And the first to      speak will be Mr. Liu, who is the son of a      counterrevolutionary, a man who was first imprisoned at the      age of 13. A man who, because of the affiliations of his      father, who was in the prior government, was targeted for      this mistreatment, and then spent a total of 25 years in the      Chinese Laogai.       Mr. Liu, if you could present your testimony, and your full      statement will be made a part of the record, and you may      proceed as you care to.               statement of liu xinhu, juvenile prisoner       Mr. Liu. My name is Liu Xinhu. My father was an official in      the former government. The Communist Party, on the pretext      that he would disrupt labor discipline, arrested him and sent      him to a reeducation-through-labor prison camp in 1958. He      was sent to the Baimaoling Farm to serve his sentence.       In 1958, I was 13 years old. Because I was the eldest son      in the family of a counterrevolutionary, the Communist      government found an excuse, which had no legal precedent, and      sent me to live at the same Laogai prison farm as my father.       After being released from the Laogai sentence at the farm      in 1966, I was ordered to continue forced labor at the farm      as a forced-job placement worker.       In 1974, I was once again labeled a counterrevolutionary      element because of my political attitudes. I was placed under      even stricter controls. I was detained until my release in      1983. During the 25 years I spent in the Laogai, I suffered      innumerable beatings and torments.       The Baimaoling farm is internally known as the Shanghai No.      2 Laogai general brigade. It is located in the southeast area      of Anhui Province. Its scale is enormous and it holds an      average 50,000 Laogai prisoners, Laojiao prisoners, and jiuye      personnel. It produces tea, rice, valves and toys, as well as      other goods.       Besides the farming that I did at the Laogai prison, I was      also part of a so-called corpse brigade. At that time there      was massive starvation in China and people were dying by the      scores. And so they needed people to bury the bodies, and I      was a part of that corpse brigade.       My father and I were detained in different sections of the      farm and we were not permitted to see each other. The public      security police only told me in 1993 that he had died and      that I had to go and claim the corpse. Once at the      crematorium, I saw his cold and pale body. I was given these      clothes that he was wearing and I cried bitterly. I felt that      my father was braver than I was because he dared to determine      his own end to his difficult life and gain his freedom.       Mr. Liu. The first pair of clothes that you saw were the      clothes that I took off my father's body in 1993.       These clothes are the clothes that I wore. And these are      also clothes that I wore.       I now live in the United States and I have a family of my      own. I deeply hope that my children and all other children,      as well as future generations, do not have to suffer these      kinds of tortures and difficulties.       Thank you all very much for your concern about the Chinese      Laogai system.       Mr. Smith. Thank you very much. Mr. Liu, for your testimony      and, again, by showing us the prison garb. You remind us      again that this is a reality that has to be dealt with. It is      not something that is in the past. It is current. It is as      current as today. And unfortunately our policies vis-a-vis      the PRC act as if the rogue government that has the power in      Beijing somehow should be treated with respect. And when you      so disrespect your own citizenry to use torture and to impose      so much pain and cruelty, it behooves this Congress I think      to up the ante and be much more concerned about human rights      than we are with profits.       So I thank you for your very strong statement.       Our last witness will be Harry Wu. Harry Wu is someone who      many of us have come to know and greatly admire because of      his tremendous courage. Not only did he spend 19 years in the      Chinese Laogai, but he also has gone back risking his own      life, possible imprisonment and death, to bring more      information out to bear further witness to the continued      repression by the Peoples Republic of China.       And, Harry, we are indebted to you for providing this      information. Anyone anywhere in the world who cares about      human rights has to look up to you as one of the great giants      and leaders in the cause of human rights.       I would ask you to, if you would, present your testimony at      this point.                         statement of harry wu       Mr. Wu. Ladies, gentlemen, my name is Wu Hongda and English      name is Harry Wu.       I was born in Shanghai in 1937. During my second year of      college, in 1957, the students were encouraged by the      Communist Party to express their opinions and concerns about      the direction of the country. Although I initially kept      quiet, in the end I offered a few criticisms, including my      opinion that the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956 was in      violation of international law, and I stated my feelings that      the Communists were treating the common people as second-     class citizens. Because of these comments, I was denounced as      a capitalist counterrevolutionary rightist.       I was arrested and, without a trial, sentenced to life in      the reeducation labor camp in 1960. I was told this was      because of my poor political attitude. My life sentence was      mostly a result of my family's political background because      my father was a banker. While I was held in the Laogai, my      mother died. I found out 15 years later she committed suicide      by taking sleeping pills shortly after she was told of my      arrest. I discovered this only after returning to Shanghai      years later to collect her ashes.       In December 1969 I was released from my Laogai sentence.      That did not mean I was freed from the camp and allowed to      return to my home. Instead, I was forced to resettle      permanently at the Laogai coal mine and serve as a forced-job      placement personnel. In other words, I was not released at      all and forced to continue as forced labor until my final      release from the Laogai system in 1979.       I spent 19 years in the Laogai at 12 different forced labor      camps. I was forced to do slave labor at agricultural farms,      a chemical factory, a steel plant, and a coal mine. I was      regularly denied food and during one period nearly starved to      death. Torture permanently damaged my back. I had my arm      broken during a beating. I was nearly killed in a coal mine      accident.       I had to become a beast to survive day-to-day life in the      Laogai. Today, all over the so-called new China there are      millions still fighting to survive the Laogai.       Mr. Chairman, the subcommittee has heard today short      descriptions of the experiences of six Laogai survivors. I      would like to now present a brief overview of the origins,      structures, and scope of the system.       With your permission, Mr. Chairman, I will submit a more      detailed statement of this for the record.       Every totalitarian regime must have means to control and      suppress opposition. The Nazis in Germany had their      concentration camp systems throughout Europe, which housed      millions of people whose religion, race, or political views      made them targets of persecution. The vast Gulag in the      former Soviet Union was first created to remove the White      Russians from society soon after the revolution which brought      the Communists to power. Throughout its history, the Gulag      served as a destination, often final, for both penal      criminals and those who opposed Stalin and other Soviet      leaders.       The Chinese Laogai, in its origins, was quite similar to      the Gulag. But Mao adapted the Soviet model to the Chinese      context. The Laogai became a tool of the people's democratic      dictatorship in fighting dissent within an ongoing class      struggle.       The official function of the Laogai is to remove counter-     revolutionaries and other criminal offenders from the      population and to place them under state supervision. In the      Laogai, prisoners undergo thought reform and reform through      labor and are reshaped into new socialist persons. Arrests      and sentences, even for common criminals, are based as much      on class background and political standing as on criminal      activity and only reinforce the true nature of the system:      absolute political control.       The term ``laogaidui'' is used as shorthand by the Chinese      people in much of the same way Gulag was used in the Soviet      Union. It instills fear in the average person. The existence      of the Laogai remains the central human rights issue in China      and Tibet today.       As a system, its scope, numbers of the camps and prisoners,      degree of cruelty, and a fundamental inhumanity long      surpassed the Soviet Gulag.       Today I want to focus on the Laodong gaizao, laojiao, and      jiuye components. One thing, all of them were mixed together      into one idea to use the so-called thought reform and forced      labor.       Official Communist Party documents from the 1950's say that      the Laogai is, ``The process of labor reform of criminals      which essentially is an effective method of purging and      eliminating all criminals and counterrevolutionaries.''       In 1988, the Ministry of Justice published a criminal      reform handbook which summed up the purpose of the Laogai as      follows: ``The primary task of our Laogai facility is      punishing and reforming criminals. To define their functions      concretely, they fulfill the tasks in the following three      fields: punishing criminals and putting them under      surveillance; reforming criminals; and, organizing criminals      in labor and production, thus creating wealth for the      society.''       This is clear acknowledgement of the state-run slave labor      of the Laogai system.       Laojiao, or reeducation-through-labor, plays a unique role      within the Laogai system. It was created as a last resort,      extreme alternative to the existing reform through labor      policy. It was established in the 1950's after the Communists      had nearly eliminated all of the remaining enemies of the      revolution from the capitalist classes.       The Communist labeled this the highest level administering      of discipline. To this day, the Chinese Government maintains      that reeducation-through-labor is not part of the judiciary      system. In fact, as in its early days, the Government      intentionally used the reeducation-through-labor policy to      imprison people in force labor camps, without even a trace,      for periods of 2 to 3 years.       Evidence exists indicating that reeducation-through-labor      is more widely used today than ever. And a large number of      the students, intellectuals, workers, and religious believers      and dissidents are currently locked in the reeducation camps      for their criminal activities. These camps are fundamentally      no different from the other forced labor camps in the      system.       Thought reform and reform-through-labor are both the      principal methods of the Laogai camp. There is a saying in      the Laogai camps that goes, ``There is an end to Laogai and      laojiao, but jiuye is forever.''       Before 1980, almost 90 percent of the Laogai prisoners and      laojiao prisoners were never fully released from the system.      They were simply transferred into a forced-job placement      personnel or what we call jiuye. Personnel, within the camps.       The official explanation of the forced-job placement is,      ``To fully implement labor reform policies and ensure public      safety.'' This practice continues today on a large scale, but      not as much as prior to 1980. Part of the reason for forced-     job placement is that the Communists realize they cannot      trust Laogai prisoners or laojiao prisoners; the people who      have suffered greatly and seen the true nature of the      Communist system. Also these prisoners are necessary to      maintain production in the camps considering the constant      flow of the new prisoners. In other words, their experience      in the operation of the Laogai is necessary to keep the      system working.       All Laogai prisoners are forced to labor to compel reform      and become new socialist persons. New arrivals are subject to      immediate, daily, lengthy integration sessions and forced to      admit their crimes. These sessions may last days, weeks, or      months. In some cases, they last years.       The official Laogai policy is reform first, production      second. The prisoners of the Laogai face constant      brainwashing. The value system of the society as a whole has      not place in the Laogai. The prisoner is stripped of his      morals, his beliefs, his religions, his individual will, his      sense of right or wrong. They are encouraged to stand      together with the Government and denounce their crimes. They      are completely retrained to follow the moral order of the      Communist Party and its society.       If a prisoner resists, he or she is tortured. There is much      evidence coming to light that thought reform is less and less      successful. This apparently persuaded the Laogai officials to      rely more and more on physical torture. This situation is      understandable as it becomes clear that even the Communists      no longer believe their own ideology.       But struggle meetings are still held. Mao Tse Tung's      teachings are still used and those that show a poor political      attitude are beaten.       Laogai prisoners reform progress is judged in part by their      productive output. Prisoners have a work quota and punished      if it is not met. Food is withheld. Beatings are given.      Solitary confinement is common and already limited family      visits and contacts are eliminated.       In adding this as summary, Mr. Chairman, I would like to      address the number of the people who have gone through the      Laogai system and how many are still there in China and Tibet      today.       The Chinese Government 2 years ago stated that 10 million      people had been sent to the camps since they came to power.      And at this point, 2 million are still in some 685 camps.      This is a ridiculous figure. Who can believe that in a      country of 1.2 billion people, over the 45-year history, only      10 million people have been in prison.       One should never, of course, believe any number they give      to the public. In fact, no one will probably ever know the      true number of the people they executed and sent to the      camps.       I am submitting for the record my detailed analysis.\1\ I      estimate that since 1949 more than 50 million people have      been Laogai or laojiao prisoners. Remember, laojiao or      reeducation-through-labor is not considered by the Communists      to be imprisonment. Therefore, they do not count these people      in either their 10 million figure or in the current two      million figure.       Neither do they today count those in the province, county      or village detention centers, military prisons or secret      prisons.       We at the Laogai Research Foundation have documented nearly      1,100 camps, a list of which I am submitting for the record.      Our list does not include detention centers or military or      secret prisons, nor is it a complete list of labor camps. We      are learning of others every month.       Mr. Chairman, if we consider reform through labor,      reeducation-through-labor, and forced-job placement personnel      prisoners alone, I believe the Chinese Government has between      8 to 10 million people in the Laogai today.       Mr. Chairman, thank you for offering us, survivors of the      Laogai, from China and from Tibet, the opportunity to improve      your understanding of the world's most extensive forced-labor      camp system. A system which is a human rights abuse of      momentous proportions.       This is the first hearing on the Laogai ever conducted by      any democratic legislative body in the world. We are very      grateful. Thank you.
