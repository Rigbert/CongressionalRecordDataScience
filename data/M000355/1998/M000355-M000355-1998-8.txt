 President, I rise today to draw attention to the foreign policy catastrophe unraveling in Kosovo. Yogi Berra immortalized the phrase ``this is deja vu all over again''--and that is just what we are seeing in Kosovo--Bosnia, all over again. Today, just like yesterday and the day before, men, women, and children in Kosovo are living and dying witnesses to a rerun of the tragic experience suffered by Bosnia for three brutal years. Hundreds of thousands of civilians are, once again, the victims of our false promises and a deeply flawed policy.  Take a minute to review the events as they have unfolded on the ground to establish exactly what I think Belgrade has learned about United States policy. What Milosevic and his mafia have figured out is--we bluster and threaten,we issue ultimatums and condemnations, but the policy is hollow, the threats are empty, the show is a charade.  A recent Congressional Research Service chronology provides stark evidence of this sad pattern of Western threats and demands, always swiftly challenged by vicious Serbian violence and assaults against Kosovo's civilians. And, the response to these attacks? Concessions and inaction.  The United States has not failed alone. We are joined in this collective dishonor by the G-7 nations, the OSCE, the European Union, the Contact Group, and even the United Nations which have individually and collectively reneged on commitments made to take action to stop the bloodshed, to produce a cease-fire, to prompt a withdrawal of Serb troops, and to protect the rapidly mounting numbers of refugees and displaced people.  The CRS report tell us:  On January 8, the six nations of the Contact Group declared Kosovo a matter of priority urging a peaceful dialogue to begin between parties. This message was reinforced by Special Envoy Gelbard in meetings with Milosevic in Belgrade. The response, within days, was attacks by the Serbian police on a small village leaving ethnic Albanians dead and more wounded. While this was a relatively small assault, the beginning of the coming trend was marked by 20,000 people turning out for the funeral in protest of that action.  On February 23, Gelbard announced some minor concessions to the Serbs including restoring landing rights for their airlines. At the same time the Contact Group foreign ministers issued a statement expressing concern about the lack of progress in dialogue. In an attempt at balance and fairness they even condemned terrorist acts by the Kosovo Liberation Army and reiterated their lack of support for Kosovo independence.  What did the Serbs do in response to these generous gestures? Within three days, Serbian forces launched major attacks on villages in central Kosovo. CRS reports the attacks were ``spearheaded by thousands of Serbian police and Interior Ministry troops and resulted in 20 to 30 deaths mostly of ethnic Albanians.''  On March 2, the United Stats and the European Union joined voices in condemning violence by Serb forces. On March 5, Serb police and special anti-terrorist units ``began their second largest offensive in central Kosovo. KLA strongholds were attacked with armored vehicles and helicopter gun ships * * * the assault continued for 2 days and claimed the lives of 6 police officers and over 50 Kosovar Albanians.''  On March 4, Mr. Gelbard said, ``I guarantee you we simply won't brook any renewal of violence,'' followed on March 7, by Secretary Albright who issued her now famous ultimatum. She said, Milosevic ``will have to pay a price. The international community will not stand by and watch the Serbian authorities do in Kosovo what they can no longer get away with doing in Bosnia.'' Her statement was backed up by a Contact Group declaration demanding Milosevic take specific steps within ten days including withdrawing paramilitary troops and allowing Red Cross access conflict zones.  As the Contact Group was issuing its statement, in a gruesome public spectacle, Serb troops dumped 51 bodies at a warehouse, each one an ethnic Albanian, 25 of them were women and children. Before international forensics experts could complete autopsies, the Serbs bulldozed the bodies into a mass grave.  This pattern of challenge and brutal response continued weekly through the spring and summer. Threats of western actions have been dismissed by Serb attacks, after attack, after attack.  Villages are shelled, burned and looted. Crops and fields are burned. The death toll and refugee population swells. Yesterday a Kosovo journalist told me that the Serbs have now destroyed 400 of the 700 villages in Kosovo.  And, the world watches. Deja vu all over again.  I thought we had reached an all time low in June when 84 NATO planes carried out a six nation exercise in Albania and Macedonia intended as a show of strength and force. The Washington Post summed up the events saying, ``Yugoslavia's reply to threats of NATO air strikes could be heard for miles around in the nightly bombardment of border villages.''  Mr. President, the tragedy continues. Winter's cold curtain now falls upon the weakened shoulders of tens of thousands of families expelled from their homes, in hiding in the mountains and forests of Kosovo. Soon, we will begin to see the heart-rending, pitiful images of ailing, elderly women, clutching babies and toddlers, every possession they could salvage strapped to their backs, stagger out of hiding, hoping to cross borders into safe haven, but more likely, stumbling into harm's way.  And, this time, Mr. President, the consequences of inertia are deadly serious. I agree with Ambassador Holbrooke's assessment that Kosovo is ``the most explosive tinderbox in the region.'' Unlike Bosnia, the long-standing frictions involving Kosovars, Albanian, Serbs, and Macedonians have consequences in Greece and Turkey--precarious NATO partners in the best of times.  The conditions in Kosovo have demanded action for months. Instead we have been a state of policy stall. Now, as much in recognition of the weather, the Administration has turned a lethal pattern of appeasement into a dangerous policy of collaboration and containment.  Let me point to two examples of the current approach which seeks a partnership with Belgrade rather than protection of innocent refugees. As conditions worsen, the Administration seems seized with a containment strategy, which balances on improving delivery of relief while controlling what they view as potentially messy regional spillover problem.  There are two prongs to this misguided effort. First, let me describe what the Administration is considering on the relief front. Earlier this month, administration officials announced plans to work in Kosovo through twelve centers established by Serb security forces to distribute emergency food and supplies to the victims of this savage war. I am not sure what surprised me more--the fact that we would work with the very forces which carried out the atrocities creating hundreds of thousands of victims, or the fact that we decided to encourage this cooperation by actually making food available to Serb troops. The new chief of the Bureau for Humanitarian Affairs offered and has provided thousands of food rations to Serb troops fresh from bloody killing fields. He even asked NGO representatives to cooperate with this plan and work through these twelve centers. As one representative described it to me, the NGOs were the bait, intended to lure refugees into Serb centers. AID claims that this plan was agreed to by the major non-government organizations carrying out humanitarian relief in Kosovo, but I can't find one that thinks collaborating with Belgrade makes any sense.  This effort to control and contain the problem also has a military component--but the wrong military component. Last week, the foreign Operations Subcommittee was briefed on Administration plans to provide $7.3 million in security assistance loans to Macedonia. This train an equip initiative will provide night vision goggles, surveillance radar, ammunition, body armor, howitzers and trucks to 3,000 Macedonian soldiers--troops with long-standing ties to Serbian security forces. Coincidentally, Macedonia also has an ethnic Albanian community which suffer what many describe as apartheid-like conditions.  Arming the Macedonians is the wrong substitute for the current policy failure in Kosovo. Having failed to talk Milosevic into submission, this program strikes me as a complete retreat in which the United States is supplying an effort to establish a cordon sanitaire isolating Kosovo. Strengthening Macedonian troops may have a defense purpose but it also clearly serves an offensive one--to curb the flow of people and supplies into and out of Kosovo.  I hope we all learned at least one lesson in Bosnia--we pay a huge price for imposing an unfair and imbalanced embargo against only one party in a conflict. In good conscience, I for one, cannot support an initiative designed intentionally or otherwise to surround and choke off Kosovo. I have madeclear to the Secretaries of State and Defense that I will not release the funds for this reprogramming unless and until appropriate action is taken to produce results in Kosovo.  Secretary Albright has repeatedly stated that the only kind of pressure Milosevic and his mafia understand is the kind which exacts a real price for his unacceptable conduct. His campaign to burn Kosovo to the ground was launched as the Administration pushed Kosovars to the negotiating table and continues as we speak today. it is well past the time for threats of sanctions and NATO flyovers. The Administration must move decisively, offering the necessary leadership to back up our ultimatums with the effective use of air strikes and force in order to secure our common goals: a cease fire, the withdrawal of Serb forces, and the protection of refugees, displaced people and relief efforts.  Balkan history provides substantial evidence that Belgrade's abuse of force demands a commensurate response. Without this fundamental guarantee, diplomacy will most certainly fail and we will bear witness to yet another of Milosevic's genocidal slaughters. His victims will not only be those who suffer, lose their life possessions, and die on Kosovo's fields. He will also destroy American honor and credibility--taking along with that what shred of hope there is for us to lead this troubled world onto a peaceful path into the next century.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.                          ____________________
