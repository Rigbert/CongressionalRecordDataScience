Speaker, I am pleased to recognize an outstanding woman of my district, Anna M.H. Verhesen. Ann was awarded the Key to the Golden Door Award by Toledo's International Institute on March 31, 2001. This award is given to a naturalized citizen who has made a significant contribution to the betterment of people. I join with people from throughout my community in congratulating Ann on her receipt of this award.  A dedicated and tireless advocate for the poor, unrecognized, and underserved, Ann's passion was grown in her while a very young child as she and her family protected many people fleeing Nazi persecution in Holland. Born to Hendrikus and Henrika (Kluesssjen) Verhesen in 1932, Ann began her career in service while still in the Netherlands and employed as a child care and social worker until emigrating to Canada with her family in 1959. While in Canada, Ann took her vows as a Grey Nun. In 1968, she came to the United States, serving in child care at the St. Lawrence Home in Massachusetts. A 1970 fire burned her very badly, and that accident brought her to Toledo, to the St. Vincent Hospital Burn Unit for healing. After her release, she was a counselor for substance abuse and mental health patients, and she created the Tennyson Center, the hospital's substance abuse detoxification and treatment unit. She subsequently returned to Massachusetts continuing her social work, and serving as vocation director for the Grey Nuns until 1979. She returned to St. Vincent's in 1981 and was the coordinator of community services for the next decade. During her tenure she established the Open Door, a men's half-way house for alcoholics and its counterpart for women, Harbor House, and David's House for people with AIDS. She became a vocal advocate for the homeless among us. Even while actively engaged in this work Ann pursued her studies, receiving her undergraduate degree in 1981 and her Master's in 1992. She left the Grey Nuns in the latter 1990s and now counsels in private practice. She was sworn in as a United States citizen in 1994.  Even before Pope Paul VI voiced, ``If you want peace, work for justice'' Ann Verhesen lived this creed. The International Institute perfectly explains her avocation in awarding the honor, ``A model of gentle yet persistent advocacy for the outcast, Ann has reached out to those whom society has no time or interest in assisting. She has challenged hospitals to address their services to those who are addicted, while simultaneously challenging those who are addicted to change their lives. Ann is often the silent force behind change.'' This is a truly fitting tribute to a most remarkable yet humblest of women.                          ____________________
