President.  Today I have described just some of the damage the 30-hour rule is doing to municipal employees, to providers of home health care and hospice services, and to those who work in our school systems. Nationwide, 100 school systems have had to scale back the hours of their workers already. Employees in all industries--for-profit and non-profit, private sector and public sector--are similarly affected.  Regardless of the varying views of Senators in this Chamber on the Affordable Care Act, surely we ought to be able to agree to fix this problem in the law that is hurting workers' paychecks and creating chaos for employers. Senator Donnelly has introduced bipartisan legislation with Senator Joe Manchin and Senator Lisa Murkowski that would do just that. It is the Forty Hours is Full Time Act, and I urge all of my colleagues to join us in supporting it.  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                              National Association                                      For Home Care & Hospice,                                  Washington, DC, January 6, 2014.     Hon. Susan Collins,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Joe Donnelly,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Collins and Donnelly: I am writing to offer      our support for the ``Forty Hours Is Full Time Act.'' The      National Association for Home Care & Hospice (NAHC) is the      leading association representing the interests of the home      care and hospice community since 1982.       Currently the provision in the Affordable Care Act (ACA)      that imposes penalties on employers with more than 50 full-     time equivalent employees for not providing health insurance      for their ``full time'' workers defines an employee working      just 30 hours a week as full time. This definition of full      time is entirely out-of-keeping with standard employment      practices and could cause irreparable harm to many home care      agencies and the patients they serve.       The great majority of the estimated 25,000 home care      agencies are small businesses under the standards of the      Small Business Administration, but most are considered      ``large employers'' subject to the employer mandate under the      ACA because of the number of workers they employ. All told,      there are over 2 million persons employed in home care. These      home care agencies are innovative job creators that provide      much needed compassionate, high quality care to elderly and      disabled individuals in their homes and communities.       The majority of personal care home care workers do not      receive employee health insurance because home care agencies      have three problems that are fairly unique: reliance on      government programs such as Medicaid where payment rates as      low as $11 an hour won't cover the increased costs of      providing health insurance; consumers of private pay home      care who are often elderly and disabled with fixed, low      incomes; and a home care workforce with widely varying work      hours primarily to accommodate the needs of their infirm      clientele.       Home care agencies that are unable to provide health      insurance or absorb the ACA penalties will have to restrict      their employees to no more than 29 hours per week to ensure      their workers are considered part-time under the ACA. A      survey that NAHC concluded in December 2014 showed that the      employer mandate would weaken patient access to care, reduce      wages and working hours of home care staff, and require home      care companies to restructure their operations to rely on      part-time caregivers. Home care companies that primarily      provide Medicaid services and those that service private pay      personal care clients were most susceptible to these adverse      outcomes as Medicaid funding is already stretched and seniors      on limited incomes are unable to spend more on home care.       Our survey showed:       1. 82.54% of home care and hospice companies do not provide      health insurance to all of their employees because of      reliance on government program payments and service to      individuals with limited incomes       2. 46.2% of those companies face a financial penalty under      the employer mandate ranging as high as $4.5 million       3. 73.3% of the companies would reduce the working hours of      employees to under 30 per week in order to avoid the cost of      health insurance or financial penalties that they cannot      afford       4. 22.16% of the businesses expect to close because of the      financial penalties       5. 83.2% of the companies expect that access to home care      in their community would be reduced with fewer providers of      care, more restrictive patient admission criteria to fit a      part-time workforce, and restrictions on service areas.       6. 88.46% expect that access to Medicaid home care will no      longer be sufficient to meet client's needs       Home care agencies are an essential part of the network of      services that our growing population of elderly and persons      with disabilities rely on. The last thing we need is an      obstacle to helping them grow and create much needed jobs.      Simple common sense solutions are often the best answers to      complex problems. As far as most people are concerned 40      hours a week equates with full time employment.       Thank you for offering this important legislation.           Sincerely,                                          Val J. Halamandaris,                                   President, National Association     for Home Care & Hospice.                                  ____                                                December 19, 2014.     Hon. Collins,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of AASA: The School      Superintendents Association, the Association of Educational      Service Agencies, the National Rural Education Association      and the National Rural Education Advocacy Coalition, I write      to express our support for the Forty Hours is Full Time Act.      Collectively, we represent public school superintendents,      educational service agency administrators and school system      leaders across the country, as well as our nation's rural      schools and communities. We have followed closely the      Affordable Care Act and stand ready to implement the law, and      see your proposed legislation as one way to alleviate an      unnecessarily burdensome regulation.       The Forty House is Full Time Act would change the      definition of 'full time' in the Affordable Care Act (ACA) to      40 hours per week and the number of hours counted toward a      'full time equivalent' employee to 174 hours per month. The      current ACA arbitrarily sets the bar for a full work week to      30 hours. This is inconsistent with how most Americans think:      full-time is a 40 hour work week. The current definition      causes confusion among employers who struggle to understand      and comply with the new requirements, especially ones that      are in conflict with long-standing practices built on the      long-standing 40-hour work week premise.       We welcome the opportunity to ensure our employees have a      positive work environment and we remain committed to      providing a robust set of work benefits. We are concerned      that the ACA, as currently written, puts additional, undue      burden on school systems across the nation, many of whom will      struggle to staff their schools to meet their educational      mission while meeting the strict 30-hour regulation.       We applaud your continued leadership on this issue and look      forward to seeing the Forty Hours is Full Time Act move      forward.           Sincerely,                                               Noelle M. Ellerson,          AASA, The School Superintendents Association, Associate       Executive Director, Policy & Advocacy, AESA, NREA and NREAC                                               Legislative Liaison.
