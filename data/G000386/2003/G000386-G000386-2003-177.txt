 President, I rise today to honor an Iowan who has given his life in service to his country. PFC David Kirchhoff suffered heat stroke in Iraq and was evacuated to a base in Germany where he died. His wife Brooke was with him when he passed away. Private Kirchhoff is the fifth Iowan and the first member of the Iowa Army National Guard to be killed since the start of military operations in Iraq. David Kirchhoff graduated from Metro High School in Cedar Rapids, IA and lived most recently in Anamosa. In addition to his wife Brooke, David leavesbehind his parents, Larry and Nancy Kirchhoff, and two children. Nothing I can say can alleviate their sense of loss, but they remain in my thoughts and prayers. The death of a fellow Iowan brings home the incredible cost of war for me and for other Iowans. David Kirchhoff served his country honorably and was a dedicated soldier, but it is important that we remember him also as a husband, a son, a father, and a friend. Many Iowans are getting to know David Kirchhoff through news stories. We can identify with him and I know many people feel his loss whether they knew him or not. As we honor his tremendous sacrifice, we also honor his life and his memory lives on.  Mr. President, I also come before the Senate today to pay tribute to a fellow Iowan, PVT Michael J. Deutsch. On July 31, 2003, while serving our country in Operation Iraqi Freedom, Private Deutsch was killed when an explosive round hit the armored personnel vehicle in which he was riding. A 2000 graduate of Dubuque Senior High School, Michael Deutsch joined the U.S. Army in 2002. He served with the 1st Squadron, 1st Armored Cavalry Division in Budingen, Germany before being deployed to Iraq. I would like to express my deepest sympathy to his parents, Wayne and Ilene Deutsch, as well as the rest of his family, his friends, and his community during these difficult times as they cope with their loss. All of America mourns its fallen sons and daughters, yet we feel an overwhelming sense of appreciation for those who risk their lives for our sake. It's soldiers like Michael that protect our country against those who wish to steal what generations of Americans have worked so hard to maintain--our freedom.  After leaving for the Army, Michael wrote these words to his father:     When changes come we're never ready.     Always thinking of what we should have done.     But I am strong.     You have seen to that.     As I move on I carry with me that which you have given to me,            your love.  It is always a tragedy when a young life is ended prematurely, but Private Michael J. Deutsch's legacy of bravery and ultimate sacrifice is one for which we, as Americans, will forever be in his debt.
