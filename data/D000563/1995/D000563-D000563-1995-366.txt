Speaker, I wish some of my Republican friends would just spend a few minutes visiting a WIC clinic, just a few minutes, to see the real faces of women and their children who come to those clinics each day and with the help of a system that is very successful raise healthy children who really are tomorrow's future.  For the Republicans it is just statistics. It is just welfare. But for the rest of America, it is the real life that we lead.  There was an amendment before the committee which suggested we should continue to have competition and bidding for infant formula under that program. The competition and bidding that Democrats push save American taxpayers over $1 billion a year. And yet the Republicans, on a partisan vote, rejected that. The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday why, because the four largest infant formula companies in this country stand to gain $1 billion more in profits because the Republicans walked away from this cost efficiency which Democrats have pushed.  Forty percent of the infants in America today are in the WIC Program. We cannot have a strong America if we do not have strong children. Let us stick with the programs that work.                          ____________________
