 President, reports of alleged mismanagement within the Federal Bureau of Investigation have been in the news, recently. Most of the reports reflect issues in the FBI's vaunted crime lab. These allegations of mismanagement come on the heals of FBI management disasters with Waco, Ruby Ridge, Filegate, and Atlanta, as well as others.  The average citizen is wondering if this premiere law enforcement agency is out of control. The deputy director of the FBI, Weldon Kennedy, understands the significance. Two weeks ago, he said the following:       The single thing most responsible for the success of the      FBI is that ``people are confident that if they come to the      FBI, the matter will be handled professionally and well. If      that trust ever breaks down, not only is the FBI in trouble,      but the American people are in trouble.  Mr. President, that is the issue. Weldon Kennedy hit the nail squarely on the head.  The issue is trust and confidence in the Nation's No. 1 law enforcement agency. And in the context of other, recent management fiascos at the FBI, skepticism is validly the order of the day.  Indeed, allegations of problems in the FBI lab are troubling. I have been working, parallel to the Justice Department's inspector general, to find out if the allegations are true or not. The IG's report is due for public release on or about March 14.  So far, the FBI has responded to the allegations in a less than credible way. First, they shot the messenger--Dr. Frederic Whitehurst, the lab scientist who first raised the allegations.  Next, the FBI used the typical ``everything's okay'' strategy to make the public think there was no problem. But that was contradicted by the facts. Weldon Kennedy said the problems in the lab wouldn't compromise any past, present, or future case.  That statement raised a lot of eyebrows. The deputy attorney general, Jamie Gorelick, refused to confirm Mr. Kennedy's wild optimism. Her refusal to do so totally undercut Mr. Kennedy's statement. Mr. Kennedy's credibility came into question. Even Mr. Kennedy had to back off his own statement. On February 6, he admitted, ``Maybe I was overstating the case.''  But then, in a letter to me dated February 21, Mr. Kennedy went right back to defending his wildly optimistic statement--that no past, present or future case is in danger. In my view, Mr. Kennedy is playing fast and loose with reality, with a purpose to mislead the public, and mislead Congress. The simple fact is, it is much too premature for Mr. Kennedy to be making groundless predictions. For him to do so anyway shows a strategy to mislead.  Third, I have learned that it is not just Dr. Whitehurst who has alleged wrongdoing in the FBI crime lab. Others have as well. So in the near future, I will resume speaking to my colleagues about this issue, Mr. President. At that time, I intend to discuss a very specific case with specific allegations of alleged wrongdoing. Today, however, I intend for my remarks to remain general.  Finally, I fear the FBI has covered up the lab's shortcomings. The FBI has been aware of many of these specific problems for more than 10 years. Yet, there have been few, if any, fixes to the problems. I suspect the reason is that the obvious solution is for the lab to be accredited; but the lab is so poorly configured and maintained that it can't be accredited. So instead, the FBI calculated that it's better to ``cover it up''until the new lab is constructed down at Quantico in the year 2000.  If true, Mr. President, this decision by the FBI would be appalling. I am not prepared at this time to conclude that this is the FBI's intent. But if it is, not only is the FBI in trouble, so are the American people, as Mr. Kennedy so aptly put it. Because if this is true, it is not just a problem with the FBI crime lab; it's a problem with the FBI's overall leadership.  As I mentioned, the IG report will be released to the public no sooner than March 14. Meanwhile, the FBI is out there spinning. In Mr. Kennedy's February 21 letter, he says the IG report, once we all read it, will ultimately reveal no problems. Here's what he says:       [T]he Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General      found no instances of perjury, evidence tampering, evidence      fabrication, or failure to report exculpatory information.  That's true, but irrelevant. Mr. President, never in my 16 years of sitting on the Judiciary Committee have I found a more misleading statement by an official of the FBI. It has a designed purpose of making the public think everything is under control at the FBI crime lab.  Well, everything is not under control. The fact of the matter is--and the FBI is well aware of this, which is why Mr. Kennedy made this statement--the IG did not investigate to determine if there were any crimes committed by FBI agents--like, perjury, evidence tampering, evidence fabrication, or failure to report exculpatory information. The IG's charter was to determine management problems and administrative problems--not crimes.  The criminal investigation comes next. Because the IG also has the right the refer issues for possible criminal referral. And I predict, Mr. President, that the FBI will have to back off of that statement as well, when all of this is over.  Mr. President, what we're seeing in the FBI lab issue is systemic. It reflects a culture that says the FBI is more interested in a conviction than they are in the truth. They don't reveal all the facts. Only enough to make their case. This is what I intend to show in a future statement before this body. The issue will be the FBI shaving evidence to get a prosecution.  That's not cricket. It's not American. And it can't be tolerated. I grew up the son of a farmer. My father taught me to be proud of the FBI. Its image was that it could do no wrong. A whole generation of people like me grew up believing the FBI could do no wrong. Now, that confidence, that trust, has been shaken.  Finally, Mr. President, let me send a shot across the bow. There are rumors I'm hearing that the FBI intends to fire Dr. Whitehurst right after the IG report is released. My message today to the Bureau is, ``you fire Dr. Whitehurst, and you will cause a protracted battle with the Congress over the integrity of the FBI's leadership.''  In the end, it will be shown that the standards of the FBI crime lab have been far short of their vaunted reputation. It will be shown that the FBI was well aware of these problems, but chose to do little, if anything, to fix them. It will also be shown that the problems, would not have been addressed by the IG were it not for the courage of Dr. Whitehurst.  This is a wake-up call to the FBI. The public will not tolerate an arrogant response by the FBI in this matter. Too much is at stake; namely, the integrity of the criminal justice system in America. I intend to keep this issue before the American people. I will make sure they understand they have a choice between an FBI with integrity, and an FBI that plays fast and loose with the truth.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Weldon Kennedy's February 21 letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                            Department of Justice,                              Federal Bureau of Investigation,                                Washington, DC, February 21, 1997.     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Grassley: The Attorney General shared a copy      of your February 13th letter with me. While the Department of      Justice will respond directly to you, because you suggested      that I misled you and the public I am compelled to respond to      the inferences which you have raised about my personal      integrity.       First, let me state that I share your belief that any      public servant who misleads the public or Congress should be      held accountable regardless of his rank or position. As not      only a career civil servant but a sworn law enforcement      officer with more than thirty-five years of service to this      Nation, I hold dear not only my personal reputation for      integrity but also my duty to uphold and defend the      constitution. As one who has been charged with the      responsibility to investigate the alleged criminal acts of my      fellow citizens, I assure you that I am extremely sensitive      to my own responsibility, as well as that of other      governmental officials such as you to avoid rash judgments      and to devote every effort to insure the accuracy of my      conclusions.       I remain convinced everything said during our briefing of      you is accurate. I further do not believe what Ms. Gorelick      said is inconsistent with our position, a position fully      supported by the facts.       If you recall from our briefing, Mr. Maddock explained in      great detail about how every allegation with even the      slightest potential for Brady implications was referred to      the appropriate prosecutor to determine if the information      should be supplied to the defense counsel. This process has      been ongoing for more than a year and was undertaken out of      an abundance of caution to ensure there is no doubt we have      more than met any legal obligation to disclose even      potentially exculpatory information to criminal defendants.      The fact that information is provided to defendants ensures      their right to a fair trial, but is does not mean that a      defendant is not guilty or that a successful prosecution      will not or should not be brought. That is the process to      which Ms. Gorelick referred and which the FBI fully      supported.       What I said during our briefing and to the public was that      no prosecutions have been compromised. That remains as      accurate today as when I said it. No past or current      prosecutions have been compromised and we know of no      information that indicates a future case will be compromised.      There is no basis to conclude otherwise in spite of      journalistic sensationalism which has misled you and the      public to believe the contrary.       Through a series of malicious leaks and gross speculation      by the press and other uniformed persons, doubt has been cast      on the whole of the FBI Laboratory. As I reported to you,      after 16 months of intensive investigation, the Department of      Justice Office of the Inspector General found no instances of      perjury, evidence tampering, evidence fabrication, or failure      to report exculpatory evidence. Neither did the inquiry find      any support for spurious allegations charging systemic      evidence contamination or improper evidence handling.       I believe when you are afforded the opportunity to review      the report including our lengthy response, the basis on which      I made the statement will be apparent. I also hope this helps      you understand why the comments by Ms. Gorelick are not ``at      odds'' with what I said either to you or to the public.           Sincerely yours,                                                Weldon L. Kennedy,     Deputy Director.                          ____________________
