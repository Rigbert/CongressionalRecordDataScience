I thank the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee.  Mr. President, I rise in support of the overall balanced budget plan and rise expressing some reservations in regard to many of the amendments that we are considering, the pending amendments; some 45 of them, as a matter of fact.  If nothing else, I wanted to pay a personal tribute in behalf of the taxpayers of Kansas and thank the chairman of the Budget Committee for his leadership, his perseverance, his patience. He has the patience of Job. I must confess, having come from the lower body, as described by Senator Byrd, and being the chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, I am not sure I had the patience of Senator Domenici. We now spell ``persevere'' D-o-m-e-n-i-c-i.  How many hours, I ask of the chairman, if he could respond, how many days, even years, have been involved? Does he have any estimate in regard to the hours he has spent late, early--he and Chairman Kasich of the House? If he gives me an estimate, what is it? 10,000?
