 The time has come for Senators who think they ought to put a hold on a bill to be able to continue to put a hold on a bill or a nomination, but it is also time to show that you have guts enough to let the people know who you are and, more importantly, to let your colleagues know who you are. So if there is something wrong with a piece of legislation or a nomination, we can find out what it is and move the business of the Senate ahead.  This is something that is going to make the Senate a much more efficient place to work and get the people's business done, and it will do what is most important--the public's business in public.  I yield the floor.
