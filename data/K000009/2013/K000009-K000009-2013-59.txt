Speaker, the majority leader and the Tea Party Caucus have been railing against providing sufficient SNAP funding that provides food to the hungry. This is certainly not something to be proud of. I have never understood making scapegoats out of the most vulnerable Americans.  The majority has been holding up passing bills to keep our country afloat in 2014 because they want to demonize ordinary Americans who are struggling to make ends meet. The Republican majority seems to enjoy the company of the very wealthy who are eating cake, while casting aside those who have really been scraping by economically. Some have lost their jobs due to outsourcing overseas, their homes to Wall Street greed, and for too many can barely maintain a foothold in the middle class.  So let me propose a deal. Let's transfer out three of the massive government buildings in Virginia that employ thousands of people in the majority leader's Seventh Congressional District of Virginia and let's move those jobs to Ohio's Ninth Congressional District. Culpeper's loss would be Cleveland's gain.  After we strike this deal, we in Ohio will enjoy the guaranteed jobs and income flows to which the Seventh District of Virginia has grown accustomed. We can cash in on the regular flow of funds to the majority leader's district that he takes for granted, including being the number one State for Federal procurement in the whole country. Let's harmonize Ohio's unemployment rate with Virginia's.  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the majority leader's harsh let-them-eat-dirt proposal. He lives in an insulated economy. Ohio does not. We want responsible government that values every citizen. Let no one in America go hungry.                          ____________________
