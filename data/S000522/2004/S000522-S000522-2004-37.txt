Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on International Relations be discharged from further consideration of the Senate bill (S. 2292) to require a report on acts of anti-Semitism around the world, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.  The Clerk read the title of the Senate bill.
