President, I am privileged to join Senator Tom Harkin to introduce the Fair Pay Act.  Early in the next century, women--for the first time ever--will outnumber men in the U.S. workplace. In 1965, women held 35 percent of all jobs. That has grown to more than 46 percent today. And in a few years, women will make up a majority of the work force.  Fortunately, there are more business and career opportunities for working women today than 30 years ago. Unlike 1965, Federal, State, and private sector programs now offer women many opportunities to choose their own future. Working women also have opportunities to gain the knowledge and skills to achieve their own economic security.  But despite these gains, working women still face a unique challenge--achieving pay equity. Women currently earn, on average, 28 percent less than men. That means for every dollar a man earns, a woman earns only 72 cents. Over a lifetime, the average woman will earn $420,000 less than the average man based solely on her sex. This is unacceptable.  We must correct this gross inequity, and we must correct it now.  How is this possible with our Federal laws prohibiting discrimination? It is possible because we in Congress have failed to protect one of the most fundamental human rights--the right to be paid fairly for an honest day's work.  Unfortunately, our laws ignore wage discrimination against women, which continues to fester like a cancer in workplaces across the country. The Fair Pay Act of 1997 would close this legal loophole by prohibiting discrimination based on wages.  I do not pretend that this act will solve all the problems that women face in the workplace. But it is an essential piece of the puzzle.  Equal pay for equal work is often a subtle problem that is difficult to combat. And it does not stand alone as an issue that women face in the workplace. It is deeply intertwined with the problem of unequal opportunity. Closing this loophole is not enough if we fail to provide the opportunity for women, regardless of their merit, to reach higher paying positions.  The Government, by itself, cannot change the attitudes and perceptions of individuals or private businesses in hiring and advancing women, but it can set an example. Certainly, President Clinton has shown great leadership by appointing an unprecedented number of women to his administration. Just last week, Madeleine Albright became the first woman Secretary of State for the United States of America. I am confident she will do a great job, and I look forward to the day when a woman reaching this high an office is not news simply because of her gender. We are moving toward that day, but we are not there yet.  The private sector also has a long way to go to provide equal opportunity. The report released recently by the Glass Ceiling Commission found that 95 percent of the senior managers of Fortune 1000 industrial and Fortune 500 companies are white males. The Glass Ceiling Commission also found that when there are women in high places, their compensation is lower than white males in similar positions. This wage inequality is the issue we seek to address today.  For the first time in our country's long history, this bill outlaws discrimination in wages paid to employees in equivalent jobs solely on the basis of a worker's sex. I say it is about time. I commend Senator Harkin for introducing the Fair Pay Act, and I am proud to be an original cosponsor of it.  The Fair Pay Act would remedy gender wage gaps under a balanced approach that takes advantage of the employment expertise of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission [EEOC], while providing flexibility to small employers . In addition, it would safeguard legitimate wage differences caused by a seniority or merit pay system. And the legislation directs the EEOC to provide educational materials and technical assistance to help employers design fair pay policies.  A few months ago, I was privileged to help organize the first annual Vermont Women's Economic Security Conference in Burlington, VT. At this conference, I heard about the daily triumph of Vermont women succeeding in the workplace, even though many of them are paid below their male counterparts. These woman did not complain. No, they are proud to be earning a living. But they want to be paid fairly, and they should be paid fairly.  It is a basic issue of fairness to provide equal pay for work of equal value. The Fair Pay Act makes it possible for women to finally achieve this fundamental fairness. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.                                 ______                                       By
