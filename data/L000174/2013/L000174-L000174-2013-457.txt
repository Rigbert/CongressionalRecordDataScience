President, I have been privileged to serve Vermonters for many years as a voice on foreign policy matters, and I am always reminded that my work is a reflection of the outward looking posture of the people of my State. Vermonters have a long history of defending human rights and social justice at home and abroad. The longest functioning international exchange program is based in Vermont, and there are over 3,600 nonprofits registered in Vermont that are carrying out programs to protect the environment, support public health, and many other activities here and abroad.  These small businesses help bring Vermont values to such far off places as Vietnam, central Africa, the Middle East, and Central America. One example of the far-reaching contributions Vermont small businesses make every day is the BOMA Project. Based in Manchester, VT, Kathleen Colson started the BOMA Project in the mid-2000s as a way to help women in Kenya escape extreme poverty. Kathleen's company replaces loans with grants and creates opportunities for these women to start small, sustainable income-generating businesses. To date, her company has launched over 1,100 micro-enterprises across northern Kenya.  Other examples of Vermont organizations doing innovative work to improve the lives of people overseas are the Institute for Sustainable Communities, Pure Water for the World, Clear Path International, the ARAVA Institute for Environmental Studies, and World Learning. And there are many others.  A February 10, 2013, article by the Associated Press quoted Peace Corps recruiter Brian Melman as he spoke about the people who work with these Vermont organizations: ``These are people who are willing to think big with small resources. They will go outof their way to make relationships with anyone that they can and to make believers out of all they come across because the passion is so genuine.'' That article, entitled ``Vt. home to many worldwide development groups,'' is notable because it points out the many ways our small State has contributed in a big way to those less fortunate all across the globe. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows:               [From the Associated Press, Feb. 10, 2013]             VT. Home to Many Worldwide Development Groups                            (By Wilson Ring)       Dorset, VT. (AP).--From a converted garage in Dorset, James      Hathaway helps rid Afghanistan and Vietnam of land mines. A      few miles away in Manchester, Kathleen Colson helps women in      northern Kenya start businesses.       They are just a few of the nonprofit, non-governmental      organizations that call Vermont home while doing work      worldwide in fields as varied as promoting democracy or clean      water. Besides working on development projects in some of the      remotest and neediest parts of the globe, the organizations      are also pumping millions of dollars and hundreds of jobs      into the Vermont economy.       ``These are people who are willing to think big with small      resources. They will go out of their way to make      relationships with anyone that they can and to make believers      out of all they come across because the passion is so      genuine,'' said Peace Corps recruiter Brian Melman, who      earned a graduate degree at the University of Vermont in      Burlington and has also lived in Montpelier.       ``There are people in Vermont who accomplish amazing things      with just about nothing,'' he said.       While many of the organizations are small, taken as a      whole, Vermont's international nonprofit sector appears to      boost the state's economy.       Though precise figures for international nonprofits are      hard to come by, a 2011 Vermont Community Foundation report      found that 3,626 domestic and international nonprofit      organizations bring $2.5 billion to the state, about 12      percent of the gross state product.       Some groups do local fundraisers. Others attract grant      money from foundations while the larger ones work on      contracts with government agencies.       The Montpelier-based Institute for Sustainable Communities,      formed in 1991, does environmental, health care and other      projects in Serbia, China, India and Bangladesh. It's working      with Burlington's Champlain College to learn more about the      international organizations in Vermont.       ``There's a wealth of global experience hidden in our hills      and valleys, and most people don't know it,'' said vice      president Barbara McAndrew. ``Putting together a real picture      of Vermont's international footprint helps us build      connections between people working in the same regions. It      can raise our profile with national and international funders      and it helps us attract and retain talented people.''       Melman said that the same sense of community and the desire      to help that he sees in Peace Corps volunteers is what led      Vermonters to form nonprofits, in many cases based on work      they did while overseas in the Peace Corps or other service.      Vermont, per capita, produces more Peace Corps volunteers      than any other state.       Burlington, he said, ``was just absolutely awash with      nonprofits,'' Melman said. ``We used to joke that there were      more nonprofits than people.''       One of Vermont's first international NGOs was the      Brattleboro-based organization now known as World Learning.      The organization employs 185 people and does work with      education, exchange, and development programs in more than 60      countries. It was founded in 1932.       ``Even back then, Vermont was attracting innovative,      different thinking individuals,'' said Simon Norton of World      Learning.       Norton, who lives in Nevada but travels to Vermont      frequently, said there are pockets across the country that      have ``the same vibe'' as Vermont and have many groups      working across the globe. He mentioned the San Francisco      area; parts of Seattle; Flagstaff, Ariz.; Boulder, Colo.; and      Asheville, N.C. In Vermont, it's statewide.       ``People choose to either stay or move to Vermont for those      small-town community values,'' he said.       Colson fits the profile. She said she got her first taste      of Africa through a program offered by her college and later      spent 25 years in Africa running safaris. In the mid-2000s      she branched out and started working on a program that helps      women start tiny income-generating businesses in areas where      opportunities are otherwise unavailable. Now her program, the      BOMA Project, has a staff of four.       A native of western New York, she and her husband moved      back to the U.S. to raise their children in a small town      similar to where she grew up.       Colson now spends about three months a year in Kenya where      she travels with an armed bodyguard.       ``To be able to be in that place and then come home to      Vermont . . . all of a sudden you are in one of the safest      places on the planet,'' Colson said.       Many of the organizations are in Vermont's larger      communities, but others are on back roads. Hathaway helped      found Clear Path International in the converted garage      outside his Dorset home in 2000, where he still works as its      communications director. The organization's main office has      since moved to Bainbridge Island, Wash.       Rutland-based Pure Water for the World, which helps provide      clean water to communities in Honduras and Haiti, employs      three people in Vermont and about 25 overseas. It has a      budget this year of $1.2 million, much of which comes from      individual donations, said the group's executive director,      Carolyn Crowley Meub.       ``I know individuals who have a small NGO they run from      their living room and are doing all kinds of interesting work      from these seemingly small, sleepy towns that are incredibly      connected to the world,'' said Norton.                          ____________________
