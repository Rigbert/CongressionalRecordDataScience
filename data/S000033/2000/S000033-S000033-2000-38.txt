 Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Ohio for yielding me this time.  Mr. Chairman, what we are talking about is one of the great health care crises facing this country, and that is that millions of Americans cannot afford the outrageously high cost of prescription drugs in this country.  They know that an absurd situation exists by which, when an American spends $1 for a prescription drug manufactured in the United States, a German spends 71 cents, somebody in Sweden spends 68 cents, the United Kingdom spends 65 cents, and in Italy 51 cents for the same exact drug.  So what this amendment says very simply is we want to know the price that the pharmaceutical industry is selling that product abroad for. We want to know, in fact, how come a Canadian pharmacist can buy Tamoxifen, a widely prescribed breast cancer drug, for one-tenth the price that an American pharmacist can buy that same product. Meanwhile we know that the pharmaceutical industry makes a profit in Canada, selling the product at one-tenth the price that our people have to pay for it.  All over this country today, elderly people and many other people are making terrible decisions about whether they can afford the prescription drugs they need to ease their pain and to keep them alive. The more knowledge that we have about the pricing situation in the pharmaceutical industry, the better we will be in being able to address this crisis.
