President, the Senator from Alabama is raising a point of order on a revenue issue that simply does not apply to this amendment. I believe the Senator from Alabama is talking about a Congressional Budget Office report that was done on the House legislation on this matter, and I would just like to inform my colleagues that this amendment contains a change from the House legislation, a change that was added at the direct request of a number of managed care organizations, that deals with this question of revenue.  If I could briefly engage the Senator from Alabama on this matter? The Senator from Alabama, I know, is trying to juggle a number of matters, but I would like to ask the Senator from Alabama, does he have a Congressional Budget Office report at this time that specifically cites this revenue projection on my amendment which is pending before the Senate?
