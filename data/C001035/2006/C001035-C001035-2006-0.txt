President, Lincoln Chafee came to the Senate in 1999 under the most difficult of circumstances. He had just lost his beloved father, and was being asked to fill the shoes of one of the most noble and principled Members ever to serve in this Chamber. He rose to that challenge, and I have been honored to work alongside him.  Like the illustrious Senator John Chafee, Senator Lincoln Chafee came from a political tradition I am proud to share--that of the New England moderate. This tradition stands for a strong defense of freedom and for fiscal responsibility, for government that is unobtrusive in people's lives when it can be, yet compassionate and involved when it must be.  Lincoln Chafee was a quiet voice of moderation, but spoke with a strong voice, a voice of conviction and integrity, on such issues of critical importance to our Nation as environmental protection and energy independence. When, in the spring of 2005, the very fabric of the Senate was threatened by a bitter impasse over the issue of judicial filibusters, I was proud to join Senator Chafee in the so-called gang of 14 that forged a productive, bipartisan solution.  I had the opportunity to work closely with Linc in the 109th Congress when he joined the Homeland Security Committee. The committee brought about great progress during that Congress with successful legislation on port security, chemical security, and rebuilding our Nation's emergency management structure after the catastrophic government response to Hurricane Katrina. Linc's steady, thoughtful, and informed approach to the issues greatly aided these endeavors.  I was especially impressed by Linc's understanding that true homeland security begins at home. As the 2006 hurricane season approached, and as we were still struggling to overcome the failures of government in the 2005 season, he called for and organized a Homeland Security field hearing in Rhode Island so his colleagues could better appreciate the daunting challenges faced by our first responders in coastal States and communities. That hands-on approach, devoid of pretense and directed toward results, exemplifies Lincoln Chafee's approach to government.  I know that the father would be proud of the son. And I know that all Americans join me in thanking Lincoln Chafee for 7 years of outstanding service, and in wishing him the very best in the years to come.                        tribute to senator frist  Mr. President, As we come to the close of a Congress that has seen too much partisan struggle, it has been heartening to observe the bipartisan outpouring of deep respect and kind regard for the retiring senior Senator from Tennessee, Doctor Bill Frist.  I join in that praise. Senator Frist has exemplified the collegial traditions of the Senate, balancing forthright advocacy for his views and for his party's positions with courtesy and respect for those who disagreed with him. He has been an effective Senator for his beloved State of Tennessee, a skillful leader for his party caucus, and a gentleman in his dealings with Senate colleagues.  We all know that many of our fellow citizens are cynical about Congress, seeing this branch of government as a haven for politicians fixated on short-term political advantage and personal aggrandizement. They should take note of people like Senator Frist, who is truly an example of a Renaissance man in government.  If a writer created a protagonist with the interests and accomplishments that Senator Frist has shown, an editor would be nervous about taxing readers' credulity. Yet the facts are plain. Our friend from Tennessee is not only a hard-working and successful political leader, but also a surgeon, a teacher, a philanthropist, an author, an aircraft pilot, a marathon runner, and a devoted family man.  Members of Congress have many opportunities to enact measures that will protect, enrich, and save lives. But we usually act at a distance, as agencies use the authorities and carry out the mandates we create. Few of us can take credit for personally saving lives as Doctor Frist has done many times at the operating table. And few of us can bring to bear the combination of professional training and personal dedication that he has displayed on his repeated medical missions to Africa and in his policy work on the HIV-AIDS crisis. He was also the first doctor on the spot for the 1998 shootings of two Capitol Police officers, and he ably served as an informed spokesman for Congress during the 2001 anthrax attacks in the Capitol mail system.  Senator Frist has served his party well. As chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee in 2002, he helped restore the party's majority in the Senate. As the unanimously elected majority leader, he served both his party and his country well on policy matters like tax-law changes that eased burdens on citizens and encouraged growth in business activity and employment.  Senator Frist also supported the Medicare prescription-drug benefit and the creation of Health Savings Accounts--measures that have saved billions of dollars for the elderly and given millions of Americans new opportunities for controlling their health-care costs. These are especially helpful legislative initiatives in States like my native Maine, where the proportions of senior citizens, small-business owners, and the self-employed are significant.  Senator Frist leaves this chamber with an overflowing and bipartisan store of goodwill and gratitude. I am pleased to be among the many Senators offering thanks for his years of service and best wishes for many years of good works to come.                      TRIBUTE TO SENATOR SANTORUM  Mr. President. In his eloquent and touching farewell address delivered to this body on December 6, 2006, Senator Rick Santorum began with one word to describe his feelings as he concluded this phase of his life. The word was ``gratitude,'' and it describes the feeling I have for his 12 years of outstanding service here.  Rick Santorum is a person of strong convictions--convictions that are built upon a solid foundation of faith, love of country, and devotion to the people of Pennsylvania. But as he stood firm for his political philosophy, Rick Santorum recognized the obligation we all share to overcome our differences to work on behalf of our citizens. He spoke his mind, but he acted from his heart.  Two issues in particular exemplify Rick's dedication to meeting the real needs of real people. Like Maine, Pennsylvania is a large rural State in which access to home health care services is essential for our older and disabled Americans. Home health has become an increasingly important part of our health care system. The kinds of highly skilled, and often technically complex, services that our Nation's home health caregivers provide have enabled millions of our most frail and vulnerable citizens to avoid hospitals and nursing homes and stay just where they want to be--in the comfort and security of their own homes.  When Medicare payments for home health care were in jeopardy, Rick Santorum joined me as an original cosponsor of bipartisan legislation to restore funding, and he was a key to its success. Throughout his Senate career, he has been a compassionate champion of quality health care for those in need. It is telling that his Senate career, which included so much valuable work in this area, ended with passage of his landmark bipartisan Combating Autism Act, which will do much to improve the quality of life for children with autism and their families.  The second issue I would like to highlight is education. Rick Santorum has been a leader in making our schools safer, and in strengthening math and science education. But he also understands that quality education begins not in Washington or in the State capitals, but in the classroom. From my talks with teachers throughout Maine, I know that a great many of them expend not just great amounts of energy to educate our children, but often dig deep into their own pockets to buy classroom supplies and to advance their own professional development. The $250 tax deduction I authored in 2001 for educators who use their own funds to cover these expenses would not have become law without the strong advocacy of Rick Santorum with his former colleagues in the House of Representatives.  And, finally, when the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee held hearings in early2006 in response to the lobbying scandals in Washington, one of our first witnesses was Rick Santorum, a long-time advocate of lobbying reform. When our reform legislation passed our Chamber overwhelmingly, Senator Santorum said the Senate ``stepped up in a big way.'' The Senate stepped up in large part because this person of high ideals was pushing it along.  Mr. President, in his farewell address, Senator Santorum stated that although he often disagreed--often vigorously--with many of his Senate colleagues on the issues, he never doubted the sincerity of their convictions. Staunch advocacy tempered with respect for the views of others is the hallmark of the Senate, and it is a central part of Rick Santorum's legacy. I thank him for his service, and wish him and his family all the best in the future.                       TRIBUTE TO SENATOR TALENT  Mr. President. As the 109th Congress draws to a close, I want to say thanks and farewell to one of its hardest-working and most dedicated members, Senator Jim Talent of Missouri.  I have had the privilege of working with Senator Talent as a member of the Armed Services Committee and its Seapower Subcommittee, which he has chaired.  Working with Senator Talent has always been rewarding. He has been a prodigious Senator and brings to bear on defense issues both detailed knowledge and long-range vision. His final speech on the floor of the Senate displayed those qualities, as he surveyed the state of readiness and equipment in our national defense, and persuasively warned of the dangers of under-investment in personnel and material.  Senator Talent's focus on seapower issues may seem to go against type. Missouri does not spring readily to mind in a word-association test for ``Navy'' or ``shipbuilding,'' as Maine or Mississippi might. But the Senator from Missouri has been as dedicated to working through seapower issues as any coastal Senator.  Senator Talent was a key player in settling on a dual-lead shipyard strategy for the Zumwalt-class DDG-1000 destroyers, formerly known as the DD(X). As a Senator from a shipbuilding State, I am naturally well pleased with this policy. But as a United States Senator, I also share Senator Talent's conviction that it is a wise national strategy to preserve shipbuilding capabilities in multiple locations. He has also been a leading voice in deliberations on the CGX ship class that will constitute our next generation of guided-missile cruisers.  Senator Talent brought extraordinary intellectual gifts to the Senate. After distinguishing himself in undergraduate work at Washington University and in legal studies at the University of Chicago, he clerked for Judge Richard Posner of the Seventh Circuit and taught at the Washington University School of Law.  His academic prowess was reinforced with practical political experience. After winning a seat against long odds in the Missouri legislature, he established himself as a popular and respected political figure. Moving on to the U.S. House, he was an early and influential voice in the debate that ultimately led to a fundamental reform of Federal welfare law. This combined 16 years of legislative service served him well when he took his seat in the Senate.  Besides his dedication to chairing the Seapower Subcommittee, Senator Talent has been a leading advocate for promoting alternative energy, for helping small businesses form associations to buy health insurance, and for expanding the Federal fight against sickle-cell blood disease. To these and other issues he brings a powerful combination of intellect, research, deliberation, and collegiality.  In November, Senator Talent lost a close contest for reelection in a difficult campaign year. We cannot quarrel with the decision of the voters, but we can respectfully regret that the Senate will lose the benefit of Jim Talent's wise and gentlemanly presence. I join my colleagues in wishing him and his family well, and in expecting many more contributions to the public good from this man of many gifts and accomplishments.                          ____________________[Pages S11851-S11854]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                      HONORING SENATORIAL SERVICE                               bill frist
