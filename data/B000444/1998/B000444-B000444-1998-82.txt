 President, let's get it straight what this does. All of you came to me and said, ``I can't vote for the Craig amendment because it expands gambling on the Internet.'' What the Kyl amendment does is expands gambling.  Right now it is illegal to use the wire to place a bet. U.S. Code 18, section 1084, Transmission of Wagering Information Penalties. Read it. I don't have a minute. It is illegal now.  What the Kyl amendment does is make what is now illegal legal for certain carved-out exceptions which benefit--and there is nothing wrong with this, depending on your interests--which benefit certain segments of the gambling industry. That is what this does.  If I had more than a minute, I would explain in more detail. This expands gambling. It does not cut back on gambling. It expands it. What is now illegal in certain areas becomes legal.
