 Speaker, Charles F. Orvis founded the Orvis Company in 1856 to sell high quality fly-fishing equipment.  The Orvis Company has been doing exactly that--selling the best in fishing equipment throughout the entire world--ever since. The reel that Charles Orvis developed, a ventilated fly reel, is still the basis of most modern fly reels. In fact, the Orvis Company is the oldest fishing rod manufacturer in the world, selling rods made in Vermont all over the globe. And its catalogue business is older than that of Sears or L.L. Bean, for it has been in existence for over a 100 years. Currently its 26 annual catalogues--Orvis mails out over 50 million catalogues a year--help generate the company's remarkable sales of over $250 million annually.  Orvis has deep, deep roots in Vermont, but it has shown the flexibility to adapt to a growing international market. It has distributors in 25 countries, and sells widely in both England and Japan. Although Orvis has its headquarters in Manchester, Vermont, where its flagship store of 23,000 square feet is also located, Orvis has 30 retail stores across the United States and in England. Its network of dealers is truly global, with dealers in not only North and South America, but Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia.  But Orvis is not just about success in retailing. The company has a deep commitment to preserving the natural environment. Each year Orvis puts 5 percent of its pre-tax profits into conservation projects and, works to multiply its commitments--and the commitments of its customers--by matching donations from customers to its forest/wetland and biodiversity projects.  With 150 years of success behind them, we wish the owners and employees at Orvis many more years of success ahead, both in retailing and in working to conserve and preserve our precious natural heritage.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Page E1656]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]  AMERICA'S OLDEST MAIL ORDER CATALOGUE COMPANY CELEBRATES ITS 150TH                               ANNIVERSARY                                 ______                                                           HON.
