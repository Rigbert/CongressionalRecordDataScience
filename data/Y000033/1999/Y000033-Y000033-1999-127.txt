Mr. Speaker, on the eve of his 80th birthday, I rise tonight to pay tribute to an American hero, Captain Curtis J. Zane, United States Navy Retired.  Captain Zane, or Casey, as he is known among his friends, is not a hero in the popular sense of media. He is really one of those many silent and unsung American heroes who, when their Nation called, put everything on the line to protect our freedom. He is one of those heroes who strives every day to find the right balance between devoting time to work and financial success and just taking time to experience the sheer joy of living.  Born on July 4, our Independence Day, in 1919, in Cleveland, Ohio, Casey Zane has seen and lived the greatest part of this century, the American century. His parents came from Poland at the turn of the century, and like so many millions of immigrants, came to this country to begin a new life.  They married here and had five children. Casey is the youngest. While his father worked long and hard hours in the Cleveland steel mills, Casey attended school in Cleveland, selling newspapers before and after school with his brothers, Hank and Al.  After taking a year off to work following the tragic death of his father at the hands of a drunk driver, Casey graduated from John Hay High School in 1938. He was elected president of his graduating class. Casey's mom and brothers and sisters pulled together and were determined that he, Casey, would be the first of the family to attend college.  In 1939, he started at Ohio State University. After 3 years there, with war clouds looming, Casey signed up for and took Navy flight training from November of 1941 through September, 1942, in Kansas City and Corpus Christi.  From November, 1942, through June, 1943, Casey flew PBY's and B-24s in combat patrol missions in the South Pacific with Patrol Squadron 14, and beginning in March of 1943, with the famed Black Cat Patrol Squadron 101, under the command of Lord Louie Mountbatten.  Casey flew combat patrol missions that covered areas in Australia, Papua New Guinea, New Caledonia, the Coral Sea, the Solomon Islands, Indonesia, and the Java Sea. During those perilous years of combat and sacrifice, some of Casey's closest friends lost their lives or were wounded at the hands of the imperial Japanese forces. Fortunately for us and for myself, Casey is one of the survivors.  After combat duty from July, 1944, through May, 1946, Casey was instructing B-24 pilots at Hutchinson, Kansas. He was married on March 10, 1945, to a wonderful lady, Dorothy Dix Kavanagh, Dickey, as we call her, Kavanagh, whom Casey had met while in Ohio State, one of seven children born to Ohio farmers Fred and Mabel Kavanagh. All seven of the Kavanagh children have lived to see their 50th wedding anniversaries.  Casey and Dickey have been married for 54 years and have two daughters, two sons-in-law, one son, a daughter-in-law, four grandchildren, and two great grandchildren. They have the kind of mutual respect and supportive relationship that lasts forever. Both Casey and Dickey have a deep and abiding faith in God and continue to live honest and moral lives.  Throughout the remainder of Casey's Navy career, he continued to put it on the line for this country. After the war, Casey and Dickey served in Saipan. In fact, after transiting aboard the vessel Breckenridge from Norfolk to Saipan, Dickey and new daughter Susan had more sea time than Casey did at that time.  Further assignments included Fleet Air Wing Staff, Naval Air Station, Jacksonville, Florida, then aboard the aircraft carrier the USS Leyte as communications officer. Later the Zanes were transferred back to Jacksonville, Florida, where Casey served as executive, then commanding officer, Patrol Squadron 18, performing anti-submarine warfare missions off Florida and in the Caribbean.  During the Cuban missile crisis, Casey served at the Command Post of the CINCLant Fleet, Norfolk, Virginia. In the early sixties he was stationed at the Navy's Bureau of Personnel, and in 1965 took command of vital Cold War U.S. Navy communications bases at Londonderry, Northern Ireland, and Thurso, Scotland.  After duty in Ireland and Scotland, Casey returned to his last hitch at the Pentagon and retired as a Navy Captain in November of 1968, having served our Nation defending our freedom for a little over 27 years.  During his Navy years, Casey completed Navy flight and aviation pilot training, U.S. Command and General Staff College, Aviation Ordnance School, General Line School, post-graduate Naval Command Communications School, and U.S. Naval War College.  His medals and decorations include the American Defense Service Medal; the American Campaign Medal; the Air Medal; the Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal, for three stars; World War II Victory Medal; National Defense Service Medal, one star.  After the Navy, Casey was not finished by a long shot. He and his wife decided it was time to work, to hunker down and make a little money. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s and early nineties Casey and Dickey both became hard working real estate agents and brokers in the greater Northern Virginia area. Casey had a very successful second career in land development and commercial and industrial real estate.  My personal relationship with Casey goes back for more than 25 years. During that time he visited my home State of Alaska many times. In fact, as a great campaign supporter and worker he rightfully credits himself with more than one of my narrow campaign victories.  As a young man Casey was a scratch golfer and later carried a single digit handicap for years. Over 30 years a member of the Army-Navy Country Club, Casey can still break 90 on a regular basis.  Even as he approaches his 80 years young this Fourth of July, Casey is as active as ever. He works out three times a week, stays in excellent shape, maintains a delightful sense of humor, and still drinks his vodka on the rocks, sports a license plate that declares life is too short to smoke cheap cigars. God willing, my wife Lu and I will have many more years of close friendship to look forward to with this very special man and his very special family.  As I recollect on the meaning of July 4, I will, along with many other friends and family, celebrate on that day the birth of a particularly good friend, an American hero who was willing to give his all to our Nation.  Mr. Speaker, please join my colleagues and me in wishing a very happy 80th birthday to Captain Curtis J. Zane, United States Navy Retired. Happy birthday, Casey. You are my sweetheart.                          ____________________
