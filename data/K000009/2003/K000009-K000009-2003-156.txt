Speaker, one hundred years ago in Toledo, Ohio a revolution took place. In September 1903, a machine allowing the mass production of glass bottles changed the industry, and it changed the world as ``the most significant advance in glass production in over 2,000 years'' as noted by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. The company that grew out of this invention, Owens-Illinois, is celebrating its centennial anniversary.  At the dawn of the last century, Michael J. Owens was a young glass blower working in Toledo's Libbey Glass factory. Another inventive visionary and civic leader, Edward Drummond Libbey became Mr. Owens' primary backer as Mr. Owens developed his idea for the complete mechanization of glass bottle making. Though machines were patented in the latter half of the nineteenth century, all relied heavily on human toil. In 1903, Michael J. Owens patented a fully automated ``bicycle pump'' which operated in a similar fashion to this machine. The Owens Bottle Machine Company was incorporated on September 3, 1903.  In two years, the company was able to begin commercial sales with a machine that could make ten bottles per minute. It was the first of many patented machines which developed products including glass building blocks, tumblers, plywood, paper cups, metal cans, television tubes, flat electronic display panels, corrugated boxes, lab glassware, plastic soft drink bottles, medicine vials, glass cookware, plastic and glass containers for food and beverages, and materials for range tops and telescope mirror blanks.  The company's sharp minds developed many innovations we know today and use in our everyday lives including the method for fusing graphics onto bottles, squeezable dispensers for foodstuffs, disposable and recyclable bottles, child-proof medicine bottles, tamper-resistant containers, plastic toothpaste pumps, microwavable food containers, barrier shields to prevent the release of carbonation for plastic soft drink bottles, the design of 2 liter bottles and many other types of bottles, and even the ``clamshell'' packages for McDonald's hamburgers.-  Within twenty years of the founding of Owens Bottle Machine Company, machines manufactured 94 percent of the bottles. This innovation pleased the National Child Labor Committee, which in 1913 praised the Toledo technological advance in reducing child labor. The labor saving machines were also beneficial to the glassblowers, whose profession when practiced manually was devastating to their health.  By 1920, the Owens Bottle Company was the nation's largest bottle manufacturer, and Toledo earned its nickname as the ``glass capitol of the world,'' a moniker still proudly borne today.  In 1930, several years after the deaths of its founders, an acquisition of the Illinois Glass Company brought William Levis on board. Mr. Levis' contributions to the success of the newly christened Owens-Illinois Company are widely held to be as significant as its founders'. During the depths of the Great Depression in 1930, Owens-Illinois made $2.7 million. He foresaw the end to Prohibition, and was ready to capture the market on glass bottles when alcohol production resumed in 1933. William Levis invested heavily in glass fiberization technology, leading to the development of another well-known Toledo company, Owens-Corning. He also brought Toledo's Libbey Glass Company into the fold.  By 1950, Owens-Illinois was the largest glass bottle manufacturer in the world. With factories all over the world, employment worldwide reached 80,000 people including scientists, researchers, skilled labor, and management. Today its signature building, a glass skyscraper in downtown Toledo, stands as a monument to its zenith years.  Even though the company declined somewhat during the 1980s years of hostile corporate takeovers, Owens-Illinois remains a viable leader on the world market stage and one of Toledo's principal companies. One of every two bottles produced worldwide is made by Owens-Illinois or one of its subsidiaries. It is Toledo's second largest company as it begins its second century of operation. I am proud to salute its workforce past and present. America looks forward to the creative technology of its future.                          ____________________
