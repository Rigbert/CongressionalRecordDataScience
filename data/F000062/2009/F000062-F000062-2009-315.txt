 President, it is with a very heavy heart that I rise today to inform the Senate of the recent passing of one of the most incredible civil servants it has been my honor to know. Sadly, Brian O'Neill, the National Park Service superintendent at the Golden Gate National Recreation Area in San Francisco, passed away last week following complications from heart surgery.  To know Brian was to have known an extraordinary human being; someone who was completely devoted to his profession, his family, his friends, and to the national parks he so dearly loved.  Since 1986, when he became the superintendent at Golden Gate, Brian has been the inspiration and the driving force behind the success of one of the largest urban parks in the world. What set him apart, though, was not just a talent for the day-to-day management of a national park, but his grasp of the principal that a park is far more than a circle drawn on a map. He knew early on that, for a park to flourish, particularly an urban park, it needed the support of the local community, and that the best way to build that support was through the building of partnerships--partnerships that were the product of personal relationships.  Brian understood that a single park employee could only produce a set amount of work. But if you could turn that employee into an ambassador for the park, then others could be brought in to lighten the load and advance the cause. That is why Brian often said that what he really did was run a ``friend-raising'' business. And with well over 20,000 volunteers, I would say Brian's instincts were pretty good.  Too often in what passes for political discourse today the term ``bureaucrat'' is used as a pejorative. Anyone who would suggest such a meaning obviously never met Brian O'Neill. He was, by any definition and in the finest tradition of the civil service, the consummate bureaucrat; a skilled manager whose talents, whose energy, and whose sheer larger-than-life personality will be missed. I am proud to have had the privilege of knowing Brian O'Neill.  Mr. President, I am sure I speak for all my Senate colleagues in expressing my sincere condolences to Brian's friends, his coworkers, and especially the O'Neill family.                          ____________________
