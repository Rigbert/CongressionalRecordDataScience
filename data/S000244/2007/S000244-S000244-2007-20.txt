Speaker, I rise in opposition to this conference report. While I applaud the overall goal of this legislation to ensure that America remains competitive in a global economy, particularly in the areas of math and science, research and education, several provisions included in the report remain of concern to me and should be of concern to the entire House.  The conference report authorizes $43.3 billion over 3 years. I appreciate that the conferees were willing to compromise by bringing the overall funding closer to the House version, but this agreement remains $20 billion above the House-passed level.  Members of this Chamber spoke in favor of the lower level of $24 billion when the House overwhelmingly passed the motion to instruct earlier this week. How soon we forget.  It is not fiscally responsible to pass a conference report that nearly doubles the House-passed authorization. We need to foster American science and mathematics innovation, but we shouldn't be breaking the bank to do so. I am afraid this bill will be another example of congressional over-promising and heightening expectations because the appropriators will never come close to funding these amounts.  Roughly half of the spending authorization included in the 21st Century Competitiveness Act conference report is designated for the National Science Foundation.                              {time}  1645  When I was chairman of this committee, I fought to increase funding for the NSF because I recognized that this agency is the foundation for new advances in medicine and technology. When the House passed H.R. 2272, we included language to double the NSF's budget over a 10-year period, a goal I support, thereby meeting the President's American Competitiveness Initiative's goal.  But the conference report goes well above and beyond this initiative, adding billions of dollars to the bill's final price tag. Finding ways to save is never a fun task, but given that our Federal deficit is expanding by the minute, increasing the NSF budget well above double over 10 years is not in our Nation's best financial interests.  If the economy is wrecked due to deficit spending and inability to manage the national debt, all of the good things that the sponsors of this legislation hope will come about will end up being ruined because the economy is not able to sustain what we propose here.  I'm also disappointed to see that the grants promoting coal-to-liquids technology and advanced nuclear reprocessing research were not included in the conference report. Language passed by the House would have given priority to grants to expand domestic energy production through coal-to-liquids and nuclear reprocessing research. With energy prices in constant flux, now more than ever we must find ways to reduce our dependence on foreign energy and encourage energy production here at home, also a keystone to continued economic prosperity.  A comprehensive, balanced energy policy is necessary to improve and sustain America's energy infrastructure. It's regrettable that the conference report does not reflect this objective.  For these reasons, I am opposed to this report. I will support the motion to recommit offered by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Shimkus).
