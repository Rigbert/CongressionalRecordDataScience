Speaker, but that does not give me any clarity in terms of the five appropriations bills. The supplemental appropriation bill, of course, is not a part of those bills, although, obviously, Health and Human Services is being put under a great deal of pressure by carrying out the terms of the law that we passed in 2008 signed by President Bush. They need resources. The supplemental is to give them the resources.  This is a scheduling conference. It is not just now, in my view, limited to next week, because we are not going to be here for 5 weeks thereafter, and Members want to know what they should anticipate as substantively going to be on the agenda in the 3 short weeks that we will have left, essentially, before the election.  So I can't tell from the gentleman's answer, Mr. Speaker, whether or not any of those five appropriations bills--I know seven have passed--are intended to be brought to the floor.  I yield to the majority leader.  Mr. McCARTHY of California. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  The gentleman initiated this with inquiring about the schedule for next week. As I stated earlier, in the schedule for next week we do not have anything considered in the regular appropriations process, but we could possibly have a supplemental appropriation next week.
