  Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota for his leadership on this issue. I have been very proud to cosponsor the bill with him, and it has been a very important bill in California.  I will never forget going to a school in Hollywood, CA, speaking to a fourth grade class and asking that class, What is your No. 1 fear?  Do you know what it was? It was getting shot in class or on the way to school. I didn't believe it, so I asked the class: Well, how many of you have even heard gunshots? In the fourth grade of this Hollywood elementary school, every single hand went up.  Then I remember going to Reseda High School and embracing a mother whose son had been shot in a hallway for no reason at all, just shot dead by another student. That is when I came back and sort of firmed up my resolve to really try to do something about it.  In 1993--this is the year before we passed this bill, gun-free schools--the Oakland school officials confiscated 60 guns; Fresno school officials confiscated 43 guns; San Jose, 175 guns; Los Angeles, 256 guns; Long Beach, 37 guns; and San Diego, 30 guns.  These are the schools of California. Who can learn when a youngster has a .45 in their pocket? I don't think your son or daughter could learn. I know my son or daughter or granddaughter couldn't learn in a school if guns are present. So this is a good bill.  I share the frustration of Senator Dorgan. I wasn't shaving that morning, but I did read the New York Times, and what I saw in the New York Times amazed me, because what it said was that no school security guard, seeing a bulge in a youngster's pocket, could go up to that youngster and say, ``What do you have in your pocket?''  If you see a bulge in somebody's pocket, you can have a reasonable belief that they are carrying a weapon, particularly in a day and age where we have 160,000 students a year going into schools with weapons. That is a reasonable belief if there is a bulge.  We know for a fact that many schools now have metal detectors, that many schools routinely search backpacks. What does this court finding do to these routine searches? I think it decimates them.  So we have submitted to you a bill which we hope will correct this. I know that gun-free schools work. In Los Angeles, when they put in a gun-free-school bill, gun incidents went down by 65 percent. In San Diego, gun incidents in school were cut in half.  What we contend is that any school that takes Federal money should have a zero tolerance policy for guns in that school. That means you bring a gun to school, you are expelled for 1 year. No ifs, ands, or buts, you go out. The superintendent has the ability to be able to see there is some alternative placement if that is available and to provide counseling for the youngster. But the point of this is, it has to be enforced. For the New York City Family Court to strike down a gun being entered into evidence that was confiscated by a bona fide security person in the course of their duties on school grounds to me just boggles my mind.  Let me talk just for a moment about what happens if this ruling stands and if we don't address it legislatively. I think it is really a shot in the back of school districts that are attempting to eliminate gun violence in their schools. How many school security guards and teachers will now hesitate to be just a little bit more vigilant in protecting the millions of good, innocent kids who are in our schools? How many overworked and underpaid teachers, fearful for their safety, will decide that this is the last straw and simply turn away from teaching if they can't go out there and say, ``I think you may have something in your backpack that is contraband. Open it up.'' Or, ``Susie,'' or ``Jeff, what is that bulge in your pocket? Let me see what you have in your pocket.''  This raises the whole kind of commonsense aspect: Should a youngster in a school have the same privacy rights that a youngster in a home would have? I don't think so. I think a minor should be subject to search for contraband, to search for possession of a weapon, and if we let our laws in this country bend over so backward that a security guard or a teacher can't say, ``Show me what you have in that pocket,'' or ``Show me what I think you have in that backpack,'' or ``I have reason to believe you may have something you shouldn't have in your locker; I am going to open it up and look at it,'' I think any effort to protect youngsters in schools will go right out the window.  So I think that what we are trying to do today--Senator Dorgan, myself, I know I talked with Senator D'Amato about this. I know he has said, ``Let's work together.'' I am delighted to see he is on this bill as well.  It is extraordinarily important that we get guns out of our schools, and thiscourt decision was just a major setback, because what it said is, you can't enter the gun into evidence, you can't make it stick. I cannot fathom how any judge could do this.  I am not entirely sure that the remedy we present today is the full remedy that we need. I think it may even need beefing up in itself. But I think it is a real start in the right direction, and I think it is extraordinarily important that Senators on both sides of the aisle really state to the public their belief that guns must not be brought to school, that knives must not be brought to school, that drugs, for that matter, should not be brought to school, and that we reinforce this in every way, shape or form we can legislatively.  I am very, very pleased and proud to join with the Senator from North Dakota, once again, in hopes that this body will take prompt action in the early part of the next session. My hope also is, as this case proceeds on appeal, that common sense may reign. I cannot believe that the Framers of the Constitution of the United States of America wanted a situation whereby a youngster could be search-proof in a school for a weapon of destruction.                                 ______                                       By
