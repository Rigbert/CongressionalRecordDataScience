President, I thank the sponsor of the legislation. I would like to ask him this question. Virtually every example the Senator has given, every compelling example he has given for this legislation involves doctors paying malpractice premiums. Yet as he has written this legislation, it goes far beyond providing limitation of liability for doctors. It includes limitation of liability for HMOs, managed care, pharmaceutical companies, medical device manufacturers, and nursing homes.  Can the Senator from Nevada explain to me why he has not come before us and argued on behalf of HMOs and why their exposure to liability for wrongdoing is a source of concern and leads to, he thinks, the need for legislation?
