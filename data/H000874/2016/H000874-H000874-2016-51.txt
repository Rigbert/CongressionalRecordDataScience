Speaker, all of us were deeply shocked and heartbroken to learn of the assassination of five police officers in Dallas last night. Nothing can ever justify the cold-blooded murders of those who have sworn to protect and serve. Such an act does nothing to bring back those who were killed by police in previous days--killings that also shocked the conscience of our country.  Violence only begets violence, not justice.  The killings of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile at the hands of law enforcement officers were horrifying and unacceptable. Their families deserve a full investigation and for justice to be served--just as those five fallen officers deserve justice. Justice for all--those officers who were shot in Dallas and their families deserve that.  As we mourn, we remember that the way we bend the arc of the moral universe towards justice is by bending it together. In the days ahead, let us focus on what unites us and on our shared determination to see justice prevail.  Black lives matter. Law enforcement officers' lives matter. Justice matters. Life matters.                          ____________________
