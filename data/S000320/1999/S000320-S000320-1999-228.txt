 President, I will take a minute this evening to thank Senator Coverdell and also Senator Feinstein for having the foresight and initiative to expand and to improve upon what is already a highly successful weapon in our Nation's fight against international narcotics trafficking.  The International Emergency Economic Powers Act was expanded 4 years ago under Executive order to target specific drug trafficking kingpins operating from Colombia.  Our colleagues' legislation expands upon that Executive order by allowing similar actions to be taken against additional kingpins worldwide.  Any future designation of foreign narcotics traffickers under this act would still be made by the President, but recommendations to the President will now come from the entire U.S. counter-narcotics community, to include law enforcement, intelligence, and regulatory officials.  Once designated, those foreign drug kingpins would soon see their access to the U.S. economy completely disappear.  Without the ability to place illicitly derived proceeds into commerce and trade in the United States, these kingpins and their illicit organizations will wither and fade away.  Denying these foreign traffickers the opportunity to participate in the vibrant and growing U.S. economy is truly a decisive weapon in the war on drugs.  I again thank my colleagues for their fine work on this measure. I also state for the Record that I fully support and approve incorporating their measure into the Legislation Authorization Act which is before the Senate. I also state that my colleague, the vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee, Senator Kerrey, has asked I note for the Senate that he also concurs in this amendment and extends his congratulations.  I urge adoption of this amendment.
