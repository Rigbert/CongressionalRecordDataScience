Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3090 is a bill that I introduced in consultation with the Alaska Federation of Natives and ongoing negotiations and redrafts with the Department of the Interior and the Elim Native Corporation.  Considerable time has been spent to resolve the Elim land provision, and I want to especially thank Cindy Alona, Marilyn Heiman, Paul Kirton, Kim Harb, and Chip Markell of the Department of the Interior, Roy Jones and Jeff Petrich, minority chief counsel and committee staff, for their commitment to resolve this important land issue for the Elim Native Corporation.  H.R. 3090 will authorize the Elim Native Corporation, a village corporation established under section 19(b) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, to select and have conveyed to it 50,000 acres of Federal land in an area north of the former Norton Bay Reservation.  This acreage will replace 50,000 acres deleted from the reservation in 1929 by executive order from the reservation established for the benefit and use of the people whose descendents are today the shareholders of the Native Village Corporation. This bill would also amend ANCSA to permit shareholder common stock to be transferred to adopted-out native children and descendents.                              {time}  1045  The last provision of the bill would amend the definition of ``settlement trust'' under ANCSA to permit Native Corporations to establish settlement trusts in which potential beneficiaries include shareholders, Natives and the descendants of Natives. Because ANCSA was enacted to benefit all Natives, this amendment is in keeping with that original intent of that legislation.  At the same time, the interests of the Alaska Native Corporation shareholders are protected because this option is available only to those corporations whose shareholders vote, by a majority of all outstanding voting shares, to benefit nonshareholders.  Mr. Speaker, I also wanted to voice the support of the State of Alaska for this bill. The State of Alaska could not submit anything in writing; however, have verbally supported this important bill for the people of Alaska.  The Coastal Coalition, a conservation group in Alaska, and Donald C. Mitchell, a noted ANCSA attorney, have both submitted letters in support of the bill. As my colleagues can see, we have a wide range of support for passage of this bill.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the passage of this legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this important legislation. It is long past time to right a wrong done 70 years ago. I am particularly pleased that we in this Congress can act to do that.  I have a longer statement which I would like entered in the Record, and I would just reflect in closing that it is always a good day when we can act to undo the wrongs done by a Republican President.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill. While Congress generally should be very cautious when amending the 1971 Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act to change land allocations, in the case of Elim Native Corporation there are unique circumstances and special equities which justify this legislation.  Without the knowledge or consent of the Eskimo village of Elim, President Hoover deleted 50,000 acres from the Norton Bay Reservation in 1929. Although the 1971 Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act provided for the conveyance of 300,000 acres to Elim Native Corporation, reflecting the boundaries of the Norton Bay Reservation as it existed at that time, the residents of Elim have long been seeking to have the deleted lands restored.  While the Department of the Interior has maintained that Elim does not have a legal entitlement to the additional 50,000 acres, it is my understanding that they, along with the State of Alaska, are now prepared to support this legislation as a matter of equity.  And there does appear to be substantial equities in this case. According to Don Mitchell, a historian and former counsel to the Alaska Federation of Natives, the deletion of 50,000 acres from the Norton Bay Reservation is ``one of the most grievous cases of social and economic injustice'' in Alaska history.  Because the original reservation lands are no longer available for selection, the bill provides for an alternative conveyance of 50,000 acres which are adjacent to the corporation's existing lands. As amended, the bill incorporates language which has been negotiated with the Department of the Interior and includes important conservation safeguards such as easements for public access, restrictions on commercial timber harvest, and non-development buffers on river corridors.  Mr. Speaker, I would be remiss without recognizing the crucial role of RepresentativeDon Young in developing this legislation. The villagers of Elim have a strong champion as the Chairman of the Committee on Resources and without his dedication to their cause we would not be here on the House floor today.  I urge that my colleagues support the bill.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
