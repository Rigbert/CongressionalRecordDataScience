Bennett, the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority, Airports Authority, who has announced his retirement after 14 years of exceptional public service to the agency, the region, and the Nation. During his tenure at the Airports Authority, Mr. Bennett expertly guided the significant expansion and modernization of Washington Dulles International Airport and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, while simultaneously undertaking the challenge of managing the Dulles Toll Road and constructing the long planned Metrorail line to Dulles Airport and Loudoun County.  Whether one is a visitor to either of these world-class airports or watching the construction of the Metrorail line, it is not difficult to appreciate the bold vision and many accomplishments of Jim Bennett. Reagan National and Dulles International Airports combined served a total of more than 40 million passengers in 2009. In difficult economic times, both airports retained service to all top 50 domestic markets, bringing valuable, new air service to the metropolitan Washington region. Mr. Bennett's leadership also brought to completion $3 billion of capital development projects, providing improved passenger service and enhanced ability to accommodate increased air service and passenger volume.  At Dulles International, a new security mezzanine and the state-of-the-art AeroTrain, were recently put into service. These monumental improvements return Dulles International to the form and function that Architect Eero Saarinen, envisioned for this beautiful landmark when it opened in 1962. At Reagan National, Mr. Bennett guided the addition of expanded parking and completion of a new Public Safety Communications Center to expand the Airports Authority's emergency operations capabilities.  In everything Jim Bennett has done, the interests of the public have been paramount. He has guided reinvestments in Washington Dulles and Reagan National Airports ensuring that these valuable facilities are equipped to serve travelers throughout the next decades, continuing to be important economic catalysts, providing jobs and business development opportunities for the region. He took on the Dulles Metrorail Project, proposing an innovative financing plan to bring transit service to Dulles Airport and the entire Dulles Corridor. The project is on budget and on schedule, indicative of Mr. Bennett's stellar management skills.  This region has had the unique benefit of having had one the country's finest airport managers, as well as a consummate public servant, in Jim Bennett. We all owe him a debt of gratitude for his leadership, integrity, humility and inspiration. I ask that my colleagues join me and the National Capital region in expressing our heartfelt gratitude to Jim Bennett for his vision and legacy of transportation improvements that he has left for the region and the Nation.                          ____________________
