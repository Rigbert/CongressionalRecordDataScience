Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments and for his telling of the story of Juan Dixon. Frankly, all of the young men on that team have faced adversity at one time or another. All of us have. As a matter of fact, Coach Williams' dad died shortly before the final tournament, and they overcame that. They overcame it as a team, they overcame it as individuals, because as the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cummings) said, they had a great deal of courage and a great deal of a sense of purpose, and what a joy it is.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Foley).
