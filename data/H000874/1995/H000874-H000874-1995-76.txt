Speaker, I understand what the gentleman from Maine just said, and we all know what is going on. The President is trying to make his point, and the Republicans are trying to make their point.  The gentleman from Maine, who is new here but, I am convinced, knows full well that if all the appropriation bills had been sent down and we had resolved the differences between the President and the House, which there are substantial differences, then we would not need a continuing resolution and Government would not be shut down.  The fact is, as the gentleman knows, that most of the appropriation bills have not been sent on to the President. As the gentleman also knows, there are substantial differences. As a matter of fact, there were substantial differences in your own party with reference to the Interior bill, which was recommitted with many votes from your side of the aisle.  Although we are going to move ahead, and I am not opposing this rule because I think we want to move ahead, everybody here knows there are substantive differences on the VA-HUD bill. There are substantive differences on the Commerce-State-Justice, both of which, in my opinion, will lead to the President's rejecting them on policy grounds.  The fact of the matter is you want to make your point, which is a political message point on the 7-year balanced budget. I understand that. But the fact of the matter is that sending messages, which is what you are doing, because, in my opinion, the CR for which I voted, as the gentleman probably knows, the last page, the 16th page, was a message page. It had no legal impact on either the Congress or the President. Ultimately, it was a message page trying to get him to sign on to something that he may then say, ``Well, that is not exactly what I meant,'' and you would make the political point.
