 The funds are needed to construct new restrooms, visitor orientation space, staff offices, and an art storage facility. Without these improvements the park will not be able to provide basic visitor, museum and administrative services.  The Senate allocation is more generous than the House number. Should the Senate provide funds for this project, can I ask the gentleman to consider supporting this construction project?
