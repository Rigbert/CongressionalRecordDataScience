 He and Senator Reed have already processed more than 100 amendments to the bill with broad bipartisan input. Unfortunately, the two sides have now reached an impasse on further amendments. Senator McCain has offered a reasonable list that could have been voted on this afternoon, but it appears we are not able to enter that agreement because of issues unrelated to NDAA. Therefore, it is my hope that we can move to finish the bill sooner rather than later and vote to invoke cloture this afternoon.  The Senate will vote on a critical HUD nomination after lunch, and it is my hope that we can move the cloture vote on NDAA to occur in that stack after lunch.  Our next order of business will be, following the Defense authorization bill, the nomination of the Solicitor General. This is the person in the Justice Department who argues before the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court October term begins shortly.                           Order of Procedure  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 1 p.m. today, the Senate proceed to executive session for the consideration of Calendar No. 109, as under the previous order, and that following disposition of the nomination, the Senate resume legislative session and consideration of H.R. 2810.
