Leahy) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:                              S. Res. 135       Whereas Branko Jelen, Steve Pratt, and Peter Wallace are      three humanitarian workers employed in Yugoslavia by CARE      International, the relief and development organization,      providing food, medicines and fuel to more than 50,000      Serbian refugees in Serbia and to displaced ethnic Albanians      in Kosovo;       Whereas Steve Pratt and Peter Wallace, two Australian      nationals, were detained on March 31, 1999, and later accused      of operating and managing a spy ring and being employed by a      spy ring, and Branko Jelen, a Yugoslav, was arrested one week      later on the same charges;       Whereas on March 30, the organization CARE International      had received a letter of commendation from the Yugoslavian      government about CARE International's humanitarian work in      Yugoslavia;       Whereas one of the three humanitarian workers, Steve Pratt,      appeared on Serbian television on April 11, and he was      coerced into saying that he had performed covert intelligence      activities;       Whereas the three humanitarian workers were held without      access to outsiders for 20 days;       Whereas on May 29 a military court dismissed every element      of the original indictment, but then proceeded to convict the      three CARE International workers on an entirely new charge of      passing on information to a foreign organization, namely CARE      International, and sentenced Pratt to 12 years, Jelen to six,      and Wallace to four;       Whereas this last charge was introduced at the reading of      the verdict, denying lawyers for the three any opportunity to      mount an appropriate defense;       Whereas it appears these humanitarian workers were      convicted of providing ``situation reports'' to their head      office and other CARE International offices around the world,      based on legitimately gathered information, necessary to      enable CARE International management to plan their      humanitarian assistance in a rapidly changing context and to      inform CARE International management of the security      situation in which their staff were working;       Whereas the convictions of these three humanitarian workers      raise serious questions regarding the ability of humanitarian      aid organizations to operate in Yugoslavia, with implications      for their operations in other areas of conflict around the      world;       Whereas the three humanitarian workers are innocent,      committed no crime, and are being held prisoner unjustly;       Whereas Yugoslavia needs humanitarian workers who feel      secure enough to do their work and who are not at risk of      going to prison on false charges; and       Whereas many leaders around the world have raised the issue      and sought to free the captives, including Kofi Annan, Nelson      Mandela, Marti Ahtisaari, Mary Robinson, and Jesse Jackson;      Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That the Senate--       (1) urges the Government of the United States and the      United Nations to undertake urgent and strenuous efforts to      secure the release of the three CARE International      humanitarian workers; and       (2) calls upon the Government of the Federal Republic of      Yugoslavia to send a positive signal to the international      humanitarian community and to give these workers their      freedom without further delay.
