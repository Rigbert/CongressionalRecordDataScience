President, I rise today to speak with respect to National Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Week. Because of the efforts of my colleagues, Senator Collins, Senator Torricelli, and myself, this Senate passed a bipartisan resolution a last week to commemorate, during the week of October 24 to 30, National Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Week.  I think it is appropriate to recognize this problem that is taking place throughout this country and also recognize what we are trying to do to alleviate this great problem.  As a preliminary point, let me commend my colleague, Senator Collins, for her great efforts in this regard. She has been a true leader in this issue. She has been someone who has fought the good fight with respect to this problem. She has participated legislatively. I was very pleased and honored a few weeks ago to have her join me in Providence, RI, for a hearing on this issue. I look forward to joining her in a few weeks in Maine so we can examine the experience in her home State.  I also want to commend my colleague, Senator Torricelli, who also is very active as a leader in this effort. Indeed, Senator Torricelli and I have introduced legislation, the Children's Lead SAFE Act of 1999, which is critically important to the future of our children in the United States.  This importance has been underscored and highlighted by two recent reports--one earlier this year in January of 1999 by the General Accounting Office, and another report that has been released recently under the auspices of the Alliance To End Childhood Lead Poisoning and the National Center for Lead-Safe Housing.  Both of these reports underscore the need for additional efforts to eliminate childhood exposure to lead and also to provide additional support for screening and treatment of children who are exposed to environmental lead.  Regrettably, there are too many children in this country who are exposed to lead, typically through old lead paint that may be in their home. It is particularly critical and crucial to children who are at a very young age, under the age of 6, because their body is much more likely to absorb this environmental hazard, and also because those are exactly the times in which brain nervous systems are developing, where cognitive skills are being developed. We know lead is the most pernicious enemy of cognitive development in children.  In the United States, too many children are poisoned through this constant exposure to low-levels of lead in their atmosphere. This exposure leads to reduced IQ, problems with attention span, hyperactivity, impaired growth, reading and learning disabilities, hearing loss, and a range of other effects.  Lead poisoning is entirely avoidable, if we have the knowledge and the resources and the effort to prevent young children from being exposed to lead.  In January of this year, as I indicated, the General Accounting Office highlighted the problems in the Federal health care system with respect to lead screening and followup services for children.  We have policies that require all Medicaid children to be screened for lead. Sadly, we have not achieved that level of 100 percent screening. We want to reach that goal. Then after screening all of the children in the United States who may be vulnerable to lead poisoning, we want to ensure these children have access to followup care. Identifying poisoned children is only the first step and is only effective when coupled with proper follow-up care.  Most recently, we received information about that follow-up care from a report, the title of which is: ``Another Link in the Chain: State Policies and Practices for Case Management and Environmental Investigation for Lead-Poisoned Children.'' As I indicated, this report was sponsored by the Alliance To End Childhood Lead Poisoning and the National Center for Lead-Safe Housing.  This report presents a State-by-State analysis of data which suggests, first, there have been some innovative steps taken by the States, but unfortunately there are disappointing gaps in the screening and treatment of children who are exposed to lead throughout the United States.  There is also a great range among the States in their response to this problem of childhood lead poisoning. In my own State of Rhode Island, we have taken some very aggressive steps. Last week, we dedicated a lead center in Providence, RI, which provides comprehensive services for lead-poisoned children, including parent education, medical followup for children who have been exposed, and transitional housing. Many times the source of the pollution is in the home of these children, and because of their low income, there is no place for them to go unless there is this transitional housing. This is an innovative step forward. I am very pleased and proud to say it has taken place in my home State.  If you look across the Nation, you find much less progress. Nearly half of the States have no standards for case management and, thus, the quality of care lead poisoned children receive is often not consistent with public health recommendations. There is no real way to ensure these children are getting the type of care they need because there are no case management policies. Only 35 States have implemented policies that address when an environmental investigation should be performed to determine the source of a child's lead poisoning. There are many States where there is no way to determine where the source of the pollution is coming from that is harming the child.  In addition, the report points out that despite the availability of Medicaid reimbursement for environmental investigation and case management, more than half the States have not taken advantage of this Medicaid reimbursement. In addition, despite the emphasis we have in Medicaid on screening children, only one-third of the States could report on how many of their lead poisoned children were enrolled in Medicaid, suggesting that screening data are not being coordinated, and there really is not comprehensive, coherent screening policy in all too many States.  Senator Torricelli and I have proposed legislation that would address these deficiencies. The legislation will improve the management information systems so States know how many children are screened and how many children have been exposed. We also encourage them to integrate all the different agencies and institutions and programs that serve children so we canhave a comprehensive approach. This would include involving the WIC program in the screening, early Head Start, maternal and child health care block grant programs, so we have a comprehensive approach to identifying, treating, following up and educating with respect to lead exposure.  We are committed to doing that. We are committed to ensuring that every child in this country, particularly those children who are beneficiaries of the Medicaid system, have this kind of screening and followup.  Unfortunately, we have found too many States that are not following through on their obligations. Of the 38 States that have enrolled Medicaid children to managed care plans, only 24 reported that their State's contract with the managed care organization contained any language about lead screening or treatment services. So, many States are leaving it up to the managed care company or merely leaving it up to chance whether or not there are good protocols to follow up on lead exposure.  In addition to that, more than 40 percent of States reported that no funding is available to help pay for even a portion of the hazard control necessary to make a home lead safe for a lead-poisoned child. There are not the resources to help these families cope with the reality of homes that are literally poisoning and harming their children. That is one reason why I joined my colleague, Senator Torricelli, to address this problem with respect to the Children's Lead SAFE Act of 1999. We would like to see clear and consistent standards for screening and treatment to ensure that no child falls through the cracks. We would to help communities, parents and physicians take advantage of every opportunity they have to detect and treat lead poisoning.  This bill is just one element in a comprehensive, coherent approach to eliminate this preventable disease that afflicts too many children in this country today.  I was pleased that during the appropriations process, the Senate supported the President's request for full funding of the lead hazard control grants program--indeed, particularly pleased when the conferees agreed with the Senate and maintained this funding. It is absolutely critical. We will continue to press forward in terms of screening and treatment, in terms of reducing lead hazards in the homes of children, and in terms of education, so there is no place in this country that fails to recognize the gravity of this situation where children are poisoned by exposure to lead.  Indeed, that is why we are here today. This week is National Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Week. We hope by reserving 1 week a year to emphasize the challenges we face, to emphasize the steps which must be taken in the future, we can galvanize additional support so there is no child in this country who is poisoned by lead, whose development--physical, mental, social development--is harmed by such exposure.  At the heart of this effort is the work of many people, but, once again, I thank my colleague and friend, Senator Susan Collins, who has taken it upon herself to charge forward to make this hope of a lead-safe environment for all our children a reality. I am pleased to be with her sponsoring this resolution, sponsoring this week of commemoration and also, in the days ahead, working to ensure that all the children are as free as we can make them from the harm and the danger of lead exposure.  I ask unanimous consent that the Presidential message recognizing National Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Week and the executive summary of ``Another Link in the Chain,'' be printed in the Record, following my statement.  There being no objection, the materials were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                              The White House,                                     Washington, October 20, 1999.       Warm greetings to everyone observing National Childhood      Lead Poisoning Prevention Week.       As America's children begin their exciting journey into the      21st century, one of the greatest gifts we can give them is a      healthy start. Sadly, however, many children face needless      obstacles to healthy development in their own homes. Among      the most devastating of these obstacles is lead poisoning.      Today nearly 5 percent of children between the ages of 1 and      5 suffer from this condition. While any child can be      susceptible to lead poisoning and its effects, low-income      children are at a significantly higher risk, since most      children are poisoned by lead-based paint and lead-     contaminated dust and soil that are found in older,      dilapidated housing. For African-American children living in      these conditions, the rate of those who suffer from lead      poisoning is a staggering 22 percent.       The effects of lead poisoning can be serious and      irrevocable. Even low levels of exposure to lead can hinder      children's ability to learn and thrive, reducing their IQ and      attention span and contributing to learning disabilities,      hearing loss, impaired growth, and many other developmental      difficulties. My Administration, through the Department of      Housing and Urban Development and the Environmental      Protection Agency, has taken important steps to eliminate the      threat of lead poisoning. We have provided funding for such      efforts as removing lead-based paint from housing built prior      to 1978, when such paint was outlawed. We have also promoted      increased blood testing of young children to determine the      levels of lead in their blood.       However, when our children's well-being is at stake, we      must do more. I commend the concerned citizens and      organizations participating in this year's observance for      raising awareness of the dangers of lead poisoning and for      teaching families and communities how to prevent it. I urge      all Americans to take this occasion to learn more about lead      poisoning and to take part in local, state, and national      efforts to create a healthier environment for our children.       Best wishes for a successful week.     Bill Clinton.                                  ____                      Chapter 1--Executive Summary       The first line of defense in protecting children from lead      poisoning is primary prevention, which means controlling lead      hazards before children are ever exposed to lead. However,      the broad distribution of lead in the U.S. housing stock has      made achieving primary prevention for all children an elusive      goal. As a result, secondary prevention strategies continue      to play a vital role in protecting children from lead      poisoning. Secondary prevention entails identifying the lead-     poisoned child, providing medical care and case management,      identifying the source of the child's lead exposure      (environmental investigation), and then ensuring that any      lead hazards identified are controlled to prevent the child's      further exposure to lead.       Over the past few years, there has been considerable public      attention to and controversy surrounding policies for      screening young children for lead poisoning. There has also      been considerable discussion about primary prevention and      housing-based approaches to primary prevention, as a      consequence of enactment of Title X and federal funding for      the HUD Lead Hazard Control Grants program. In contrast,      there has been little discussion of what actually happens      once a lead-poisoned child is identified. The Alliance To End      Childhood Lead Poisoning and the National Center for Lead-     Safe Housing agreed that it was time to reexamine the      response to lead-poisoned children nationwide. We decided      that characterizing the case management and environmental      investigation services now being provided in each state would      be a useful first step. We hope this report's documentation      of state policies will help sharpen discussion and decision-     making at many levels. This report is timely for at least      four reasons.       First, this report provides the information needed to      ensure that case management and environmental investigation      systems are ``in good working order'' to handle the increased      caseloads that can be expected from expanded lead screening      of high-risk children. Recent reports from the General      Accounting Office (GAO) have focused the spotlight on the      failure of federal health programs to screen high-risk      children for lead poisoning. GAO documented that just 19% of      Medicaid-enrolled children aged 1 through 5 are being      screened as required by law, and that the majority of      children needing case management and environmental      investigation are enrolled in Medicaid. As a consequence,      considerable attention is being paid now to improving lead      screening rates among Medicaid children. In addition, many      states are developing CDC-recommended lead screening plans to      identify and target the highest-risk children for lead      screening.       Second, this report raises a number of policy and program      issues that should be considered as states seek to ensure      that lead-poisoned children enrolled in Medicaid managed care      plans are provided with appropriate follow-up care. Many      states are still developing or fine-tuning their mechanisms      for overseeing and coordinating care with Medicaid managed      care plans, as well as state Children's Health Insurance      Programs.       Third, this report can help to inform a number of pending      policy decisions. The Health Care financing Administration      has been receiving criticism from many quarters for its      policy prohibiting Medicaid reimbursement for analysis of the      environmental samples needed for an adequate environmental      investigation to identify the lead hazards in a poisoned      child's home. In addition, the Centers for Disease Control      and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Childhood Lead      Poisoning Prevention is currently reviewing the evidence base      for case management services. Finally, U.S. Senators Robert      Torricelli (D-NJ) and Jack Reed (D-RI) and U.S.      Representative Robert Menendez (D-NJ) are introducing federal      legislation to address these issues in Congress.       Fourth, the sharp decline in the number of children with      elevated blood lead levels documented by NHANES III, Phase 2      offers opportunities never before available for using      screening and follow-up measures to advance prevention. For      the first time, the caseload of lead-poisoned children in      jurisdictions historically overwhelmed by the number lead-     poisoned children has become ``manageable.'' We have a      responsibility to respond promptly and humanely to children      with elevated blood lead levels as well as the opportunity to      use these interventions to advance prevention. Childhood lead      poisoning is entirely preventable. But achieving this goal      requires us to sharpen our tools and redouble prevention      efforts, rather than being complacent or uncritically flowing      ``established procedures'' by rote.                          scope of the survey       The scope of this survey and report is limited to      describing and evaluating the quality of self-reported state      policies and practices for environmental investigation and      case management. This report therefore could not assess state      primary prevention initiatives, lead screening policies and      performance, or even medical care provided to lead-poisoned      children. The most effective state programs are those that      succeed at primary prevention. Once a child is exposed to      lead, the overall effectiveness of the response must be      judged by performance in all three areas of secondary      prevention--and a single weak link in the chain of secondary      prevention activities can undermine the effectiveness of the      entire response. Having exemplary environmental investigation      and case management services is useless if the state fails to      screen children at risk for lead poisoning to identify those      with elevated blood lead levels. Similarly, providing good      environmental investigation and case management services is      pointless if these activities do not trigger action to      control identified lead hazards.       It is also important to be clear about what is meant by      each key term. ``Environmental investigation'' means the      examination of a child's living environment, usually the      home, to determine the source or sources of lead exposure for      a child with an elevated blood lead level. For the purposes      of this report, ``case management'' means coordination,      provision, and oversight of the services to the family      necessary to ensure that lead-poisoned children achieve      reductions in blood lead levels. In addition, case management      includes coordination, but not provision and oversight, of      the clinical or environmental care.                    survey methodology and responses       To gather the information about current policies and      practices for case management and environmental      investigation, an initial survey and a supplementary survey      were sent to directors of state lead poisoning prevention      programs. In states where these programs do not exist, we      identified knowledgeable respondents by contacting      surveillance grantees of the Centers for Disease Control and      Prevention (CDC) or other program staff responsible for lead      services (often a division of the state health department).      Ultimately, we received responses from all 50 states and the      District of Columbia. We also received responses from 15      local lead programs, which allowed us to better characterize      several important dimensions of current practice of state      programs.        key findings and recommendations on initiating services     State blood lead reporting systems       Central reporting of elevated blood lead levels is critical      to ensuring timely follow-up care for lead-poisoned children.      Although nearly all (47) states have a reporting system for      blood lead levels, the utility of the systems for timely      referral of children needing follow-up services varies      considerably. In addition, the lack of uniform national      recommendations for reporting blood lead levels has created a      burden on private laboratories and others that must report      this information to many different states in a variety of      formats, and has made it difficult to assess and compare      blood lead data across states.       CDC should establish national standards for blood lead      reporting to ensure standardization of blood lead data and      enable timely follow-up for lead-poisoned children.       States with blood lead reporting systems should evaluate      the effectiveness of their systems in triggering prompt      identification and follow-up of lead-poisoned children and      address any identified deficiencies.       States without a central reporting system for blood lead      levels should establish one as soon as possible.     Blood lead levels at which services are provided       CDC's 1997 guidance recommends that both case management      and environmental investigation be provided at blood lead      levels of 20 g/dL or persistent levels of 15-19      g/dL. Encouragingly, most states are providing      services to children at or even below the blood lead      thresholds recommended by CDC. For environmental      investigation, 20 states perform environmental investigation      only at blood lead levels at or above 20 g/dL (not      persistent levels above 15 g/dL) and 2 states use a      trigger of 25 g/dL. Since environmental      investigation permits the identification and subsequent      control of lead hazards, early hazard identification by      providing environmental investigation at lower blood lead      levels is a positive preventive measure.       Some states are able to vary the scope of case management      services provided by blood lead level, providing less      intensive services at lower blood lead levels in order to      intervene before blood lead levels rise. Thus, it is not      surprising that many states report offering case management      at lower blood lead levels than recommended by CDC. Six      states offer case management at precisely the level      recommended by CDC, and 28 states offer the service at lower      levels (single levels above 15 g/dL or 10      g/dL). Fourteen states provide case management only      at blood lead levels of 20 g/dL, but not persistent      levels between 15 and 19 g/dL as recommended by CDC.       At a minimum, states should provide case management and      environmental investigation to children at the levels      recommended by CDC, and, resources permitting, preventive      services and environmental investigation to as many children      as possible with blood lead elevations at or above 10      g/dL.   key findings and recommendations on setting standards for services     Case management standards       The lack of national standards for case management of lead-     poisoned children has created variation in approach across      the country, and made achieving reimbursement from Medicaid      and other insurers more difficult. At present, only 29 state      programs indicated they had written standards for case      management. However, a consensus document Case Management for      Childhood Lead Poisoning, developed by the National Center      for Lead-Safe Housing, describing professional standards for      case management for lead-poisoned children already serves as      a guide for some state and local programs. Other      complementary documents exist or are under development.       Any case management protocol or standard must include      certain elements to ensure quality care. Our survey found      that states performed well in some areas, but needed      improvement in others. For example, although most states (43)      provide home visits as part of case management, many programs      make only a single home visit, which is unlikely to be      sufficient for ensuring that steps are taken to improve the      health status of the child. In addition, almost one-third      (29%) of programs fail to inquire about a lead-poisoned      child's WIC status, an important oversight given the      importance of good nutrition for lead-poisoned children.      Because they are an essential part of the solution, families      should be systematically involved in all aspects of the case      management process. Yet, our survey found that more than one-     third of state programs (37%) fail to include families in the      planning process and only one state program indicated that it      routinely refers families to parent support groups in the      community. The indefinite continuation of cases is also a      sign of a weak case management, yet 14 states reported that      they had no criteria for when to close a case.       Case management standards must also describe the specific      interventions to improve the health status of the child that      should be provided by case managers. Nearly all states      provide some type of educational intervention, including      education focused on lead and lead exposure risks, lead-     specific cleaning practices, and nutritional counseling. Two-     thirds of state programs (67%) provide assistance with      referrals to other necessary services and 80% provide follow-     up of identified problems. Six state programs indicate that      they now refer young children routinely to Early      Intervention programs for identification and treatment of      possible developmental problems. Surprisingly, 10 states      provide specialized cleaning services to reduce immediate      lead dust hazards in homes as part of their case      management interventions. However, due to funding      considerations, most of these states are not able to make      cleaning available except in homes in designated target      areas and under special circumstances.       All states should have in place a protocol that identifies      minimum standards for initiation, performance, and tracking      of case management services for lead-poisoned children,      including standards for data collection and outcome      measurements and for professional staffing and oversight.       CDC or its Advisory Committee on Lead Poisoning Prevention      should endorse a set of national standards for case      management for lead-poisoned children, beginning with a      definition of the term case management. The consensus      standards developed by the National Center for Lead-Safe      Housing (Case Management for Childhood Lead Poisoning) offer      a thorough, current, and complete set of expert standards for      quick review and endorsement.       Once national standards are in place, state protocols      should be reviewed for consistency. In the interim, states      should utilize written protocols specifying the services to      be provided along with performance standards and record-     keeping criteria.       Case management standards should include a minimum of two      case management visits to the home of a lead-poisoned child.       State case management protocols should include standards      for assessment, specifically including assessment of WIC      status.       State programs should evaluate the extent to which families      are being involved in case management and make necessary      program modifications to ensure that families are fully      involved in planning, implementation, and evaluation efforts.       States should examine their referral practices to ensure      that parents of lead-poisoned children are routinely referred      to available resources, including community-based parent      support groups, where they exist, in order to connect      families with another source of support and assistance.       All states should have case closure criteria that encompass      reduction in a child's blood lead level and control of      environmental lead hazards and procedures for administrative      closure when needed.       States that routinely follow children until 6 years of age      should evaluate whether such a lengthy follow-up benefits the      child and family.       Case management standards should specify recommended      interventions, including: basic educational interventions;      referrals to Early Intervention services for developmental      assessment, referral services for WIC, housing (emergency and      long-term Solutions), health care, and transportation, as      needed; follow-up of identified problems as needed; and,      follow-up to ensure that families receive needed services.     Environmental investigation standards       State programs vary widely as to what activities constitute      an environmental investigation to determine the source of      lead exposure. Only 35 states have written protocols for      environmental investigation. Where written protocols do      exist, the scope of services and the kinds of data      collected vary extensively. For example, some programs      rely almost exclusively on XRF analysis to test the lead      content of paint, and interpret a positive reading for the      presence of lead-based paint as source identification.      Other programs focus on current pathways of exposure by      taking dust wipe and paint chip samples, assessing paint      condition, and in some cases evaluating exposures from      bare soil and drinking water. And, still other programs      operate on a case-by-case basis.       Just 35 states had minimum requirements in place for those      who perform environmental investigations for lead-poisoned      children; most frequently they required state-certified risk      assessors or lead inspectors. Training in the certified      disciplines of risk assessor and lead inspector provides a      core foundation of knowledge as well as credentials that may      be important in any legal proceedings. At the same time,      additional training beyond these certified disciplines is      needed, because the scope of the environmental investigation      of a lead-poisoned child is much more comprehensive than a      standard residential lead inspection, and somewhat broader      than a risk assessment.       The responses to our survey do not make it possible to      determine the extent to which states are performing (or      requiring to be performed) clearance testing after work has      done to respond to lead hazards identified in the home of a      lead-poisoned child. Follow-up visits are essential to ensure      that corrective measures were taken and lead safety      precautions followed. Because lead-contaminated dust can be      invisible to the naked eye, clearance dust tests are critical      to ensure the effectiveness and safety of the corrective      measures in the vast majority of situations. Post-activity      dust tests should be taken after completion of any paint      repair or other projects that could generate lead-dust      contamination.       Many program staff expressed frustration that environmental      investigations frequently do not result in any corrective      action. The ultimate measure of the success of an      environmental investigation is the action that results to      control lead hazards to reduce the child's continued lead      exposure. At the extreme, conducting a full environmental      investigation is irrelevant if no measures to reduce lead      exposure occur as a consequence.       States should have a written protocol identifying the      components of an environmental investigation for a lead-     poisoned child. Appropriate flexibility and customization      based on specific case factors and local sources are      legitimate and important elements.       The protocol for environmental investigation should include      routine collection of data on important pathways of exposure      (particularly interior dust lead) and documentation of poor      paint condition. The XRF analyzer should never be relied upon      as the only tool for environmental investigation. Chapter 16      of HUD's Guidelines for the Evaluation and Control of Lead-     Based Paint Hazards in Housing provides the most      comprehensive and current guidance for environmental      investigations.       State programs should begin using the more protective dust      lead standards being proposed by EPA and HUD: no higher than      50 g/square foot for floors and 250 g/     square foot for window sills.       Environmental investigations need to generate      ``actionable'' data to ensure that all lead      hazards identified are controlled--the ultimate measure of      effectiveness. In most states, improved systems are needed      to document and track corrective actions to control lead      hazards to help ensure that environmental investigations      actually result in health benefits to children.       Health department program staff performing an environmental      investigation for a lead-poisoned child should be trained and      certified as lead professionals. This will serve to increase      professionalism in the field as well as give the results of      the investigation greater standing if challenged in court.       Individuals conducting environmental investigations need      additional training to assess sources of lead exposure beyond      the scope of the traditional EPA/HUD risk assessment.       When state or local programs or managed care organizations      contract environmental investigations out to certified lead      evaluators, it is important that they be charged with      conducting a comprehensive evaluation of potential exposure      sources as described in Chapter 16 of HUD's Guidelines for      the Evaluation and Control of Lead-Based Paint Hazards in      Housing.       State programs need to make clearance dust tests a routine      check to confirm that lead dust hazards are not left behind      after corrective measures are taken in the home of a lead-     poisoned child.     Lead hazard control: Legal authority and resources       Although this survey was not able to quantify the extent to      which state and local programs succeed in controlling hazards      identified in home of a lead-poisoned child, many programs      indicated that this is a major problem. Twenty-eight states,      more than 54%, do not have legal authority to order      remediation of homes with identified lead hazards. More than      40% of all states (22 state programs) indicate that no      funding is available in their state to help property owners      pay for even a portion of the necessary lead hazard control.      No state reported sufficient funds for lead hazard control.      The lack of legal authority to order remediation coupled with      the lack of resources to fund abatement and lead hazard      control is a major stumbling block for lead poisoning      prevention and treatment progress nationally.       States should consider the model legislative language      reflecting the principles and recommended lead-safety      standards of the National Task Force of Lead-Based Paint      Hazard Reduction and Financing developed by the National      Conference of State Legislatures.         key findings and recommendations on financing services       For both case management and environmental investigation,      adequate funding for services is a central challenge to      providing timely and quality services. Most programs have      patched together funding from federal, state, and local      sources as best they can. For case management, 23 states      reported relying primarily on federal funds, 12 states rely      primarily on state funds, and 4 states on Medicaid. Six      states reported a combination of sources. Even in states with      Medicaid reimbursement, Medicaid provides only part of the      support for case management. For environmental investigation,      CDC grant funds are the most common source of funds for      environmental investigation, with 22 states reporting      reliance on this funding source; some use CDC funds      exclusively. Medicaid reimbursement is the next most common      source of funding for environmental investigation, with 20      states receiving at least some reimbursement for services      provided for Medicaid-enrolled children. State funds      provide support in 17 states and local or county funds in      15 states. Other sources fill in the gaps.       However, it appears that financing is not the strongest      area of state case management and environmental investigation      programs. Many state program staffs are not aware of how      their programs actually receive funds for case management and      environmental investigation services, and others seemed to be      confused about the concept of ``reimbursement'' for services.      At least 6 states provided different answers to the GAO than      they provided to us on the question of state Medicaid policy      for reimbursement of environmental investigations. GAO      surveyed EPSDT agencies while we surveyed program staff      responsible for lead-related services, but both should be      expected to be able to answer this question accurately.       Twenty states currently seek and receive Medicaid      reimbursement for case management, and 22 states report      Medicaid reimbursement for environmental investigation,      (although apparently slightly fewer are actually collecting      Medicaid dollars at this time). States using state (or local)      funds for environmental investigation or case management      without receiving Medicaid reimbursement are effectively      forgoing the federal Medicaid match for state spending. By      all rights, Medicaid should pay the costs of these medically      necessary treatment services for enrolled children. In      addition, by securing Medicaid reimbursement, states may be      able to shift the state's share of costs to the Medicaid      budget, rather than using the limited funds designated for      lead poisoning prevention or other public health functions.      Similarly, states that use CDC lead poisoning prevention      grant funds for environmental investigation without securing      Medicaid reimbursement should consider the opportunity costs.      Since CDC grant funds are finite and scarce, the decision not      to seek Medicaid reimbursement means forgoing other possible      uses, such as initiatives targeted to primary prevention.       The amounts reimbursed by Medicaid for both services vary      dramatically from state to state, ranging from $38 to $490      for environmental investigation and from $25 for one      educational visit to a maximum of $1,610 for 8 months of      follow-up for case management. Although the set of services      provided varies to some extent state-by-state, the actual      cost of providing the services is unlikely to vary so widely.      Ideally, reimbursement should reflect the actual costs of      service delivery. State and local programs cannot      successfully bill Medicaid or managed care for services      provided unless they can document the actual cost of      providing those services.       States following HUD Guidance for investigating the home of      a lead-poisoned child are likely to need to conduct a number      of specific laboratory tests, possibly including interior      dust wipes, paint chips, soil, and drinking water. Yet a      vital source of funding for environmental investigation has      recently been restricted. In September 1998, HCFA     erected a barrier to quality care when it ``clarified'' its      policy on reimbursement for environmental investigation in      its update to the State Medicaid Manual. HCFA's written      policy now inappropriately prohibits reimbursement for the      environmental sampling and analysis (such as measuring lead      in dust, soil, and water) that is needed to investigate the      source of lead exposure in a poisoned child's home--and makes      it impossible to achieve the essential purpose of      environmental investigation. In effect, the new language      limits coverage only to XRF analysis to determine the lead      content of paint, which usually does not confirm the      immediate exposure hazard or reveal what control action is      needed to reduce exposure.       Several states reported arbitrary limits on State Medicaid      reimbursement for environmental investigation services, such      as limiting payment to one investigation per child per      lifetime. It appears that such limits on environmental      investigation are illegal, since the federal EPSDT statute      entitles Medicaid children to all services medically      necessary to respond to a condition identified during an      EPSDT screen.       Only one-third of states could report how many or what      percentage of their cases were even enrolled in Medicaid.      States must be able to document the number of Medicaid-     enrolled children receiving services in order to receive or      make informed decisions about reimbursement.       Thirty-eight states reported the enrollment of at least      some Medicaid children into managed care plans, but only 24      of these reported that their state's contract(s) with managed      care organizations (MCOs) contained any language about lead      screening or treatment services. Most reported that the      language dealt only with lead screening or generic EPSDT      screening requirements, missing an opportunity to describe      clear duties for health care providers for lead screening and      follow-up care.       State Medicaid agencies that have not yet established      mechanisms for Medicaid reimbursement for case management and      environmental investigation should do so immediately.       Health departments providing case management and      environmental investigation should contact the Medicaid      agency to ensure that reimbursement is available to public      sector service providers, customized for the specific      situation.       CDC should require its CLPP grantees to pursue Medicaid      reimbursement of case management and environmental      investigation as a condition of funding.       HCFA should revise its guidance to permit Medicaid      reimbursement for the costs of the laboratory samples      necessary to determine the source of lead exposure in the      home of a lead-poisoned child.       Medicaid should fund emergency services to reduce lead      hazards for children with EBL, including lead dust removal      and interim measures to immediately reduce hazards in the      child's home. If the child's home can not be made safe,      Medicaid should reimburse the cost of emergency relocation.       State programs should determine and document the actual      costs of providing case management and environmental      investigation services.       State lead programs should negotiate adequate reimbursement      rates with the State Medicaid agency, based on documentation      of the costs of providing services.       Based on current costs of service delivery, state and local      programs should ensure that their budgets and funding      requests seek the resources necessary to adequately manage      their caseloads.       States should consider billing private insurance providers      for services provided to children enrolled in such plans.       HCFA should disallow, and states should discontinue the use      of, arbitrary limits on State Medicaid reimbursement for      environmental investigation services unless they are shown      to have a medical basis.       State programs should establish the administrative means      necessary to track the insurance status (especially Medicaid      enrollment) of lead-poisoned children receiving case      management and environmental investigation services.       CDC should require its CLPP and Surveillance grantees to      pursue collection of data on the insurance status (especially      Medicaid enrollment) of the children receiving case      management and environmental investigation services.       State Medicaid contracts with MCOs should contain clear      language describing the specific duties of the MCOs, making      clear whether they are expected to deliver services, make      referrals, or provide reimbursement to other agencies for      services provided. States should address lead screening,      diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up services explicitly,      rather than relying on general language referencing EPSDT.      States should familiarize themselves with and utilize the      lead purchasing specifications for Medicaid management care      contracts that have been developed by the Center for Health      Policy and Research at the George Washington University      (available at ``www.gwumc.edu/chpr''). Where such language      has already been incorporated into contracts, it should be      enforced.       Where case management and environmental investigation are      provided by public sector providers and Medicaid children are      enrolled in capitated managed care plans, states should      consider financing case management and environmental      investigation through a ``carve-out'' to ensure that      providers are reimbursed for their costs of providing      services.  key findings and recommendations on tracking and evaluating services       Very few programs are tracking outcomes of children      identified as lead poisoned. Most states count the number of      home visits or completed environmental investigations, but      very few monitor the outcomes for children and the corrective      measures taken in those properties found to have poisoned a      child. For example, eight states did not know how many lead-     poisoned children needing follow-up care had been identified      in 1997 and 23 states did not know how many of their lead-     poisoned children had actually received services.       Only 15 states reported providing oversight to ensure that      all children identified as lead-poisoned receive appropriate      follow-up care, including case management and environmental      investigation services. Such oversight would be particularly      useful in the 24 states that rely on providers outside the      health department to provide case management services. Only      13 states indicated that they collected and tabulated data on      the identified source(s) of lead exposure from environmental      investigations.       Tracking case management and environmental investigation      activities is not enough in itself. The ultimate measure of      effectiveness is reducing the child's lead exposure and blood      lead level. Case management and environmental investigation      programs should be thoroughly evaluated to identify programs      that are effective, as well as to identify problems that      require additional staff training, technical assistance, or      other attention. In particular, this survey suggests that      staff in many states could benefit from training in key      areas, such as program evaluation and Medicaid and insurance      reimbursement.       States should establish the administrative capacity at      either the state or local level to track delivery of case      management and environmental investigation services to lead-     poisoned children, to track outcomes of interest for      individual children, and to ensure that appropriate services      are provided to lead-poisoned children.       CDC should require its CLPP grantee to report on case      management service delivery outcome measures in their      required reports. Such reporting would help build capacity      for tracking and begin to document the effectiveness of      program follow-up efforts.       States should establish, collect, and report outcome      measures for case management.       All states should collect and aggregate data on lead      sources, including the proximate cause(s) of lead exposure      identified through environmental investigation, and the lead      hazard control actions taken, along with relevant information      allowing characterization of the lead hazards (e.g., age and      condition of housing, renter or owner-occupied, source and      pathway of exposure, etc.)       CDC requires its grantees to provide data through its      STELLAR database, but its data fields have proven to be      limiting, especially for non-paint sources, and many grantees      report their dissatisfaction with STELLAR. CDC should      consider moving to an alternative software package with      greater flexibility and easily available support. Until CDC      revises its requirements, states should use standard office      database software to keep these records.       CDC should undertake or fund formal evaluations of state      case management and environmental investigation programs.      Programs should be given the tools and opportunity to meet      goals and improve performance. However, if state or local      programs are not able to achieve basic standards of      performance in follow-up of lead-poisoned children, federal      funding should be terminated.       CDC should sponsor a system of peer evaluation for state      and local lead programs. A pear evaluation program would      allow state program staff to learn from and share with one      another, reinforcing the replication of innovative and      effective practices.
