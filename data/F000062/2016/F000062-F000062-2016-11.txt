 President, today I wish to pay tribute to a true leader in every sense of the word. James R. Clapper, Jr., has had a defining impact on the U.S. Intelligence Community over his past half-century of service. As of today, he has served 2,190 days as the Director of National Intelligence, DNI, which makes him the longest serving DNI, surpassing the combined time of all the Directors who served before him. Director Clapper has dedicated his life to the field of intelligence, and his contributions to the Nation are significant.  Jim Clapper began his distinguished career as a rifleman in the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve, before becoming a commissioned officer in the U.S. Air Force in 1963. For 31 years, he served this Nation in various intelligence capacities, commanding signals intelligence operations both inside the United States and overseas. From 1991-1995, he served as the Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, retiring with the rank of lieutenant general. After 6 years in the private sector, he took over the reins of the National Imagery and Mapping Agency in 2001 and spearheaded its transformation into today's National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency.  In 2007, President George W. Bush nominated General Clapper to serve as the Department of Defense's chief intelligence officer as the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, where he served in both the Bush and Obama administrations. President Obama nominated Jim Clapper to serve as the Director of National Intelligence in 2010, only the fourth person to serve in that position since its creation in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004.  As the chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, I was initially concerned that General Clapper's military background would be inappropriate to lead a mostly civilian intelligence enterprise. He made clear his intent to lead objectively and in the best interest of intelligence, and he did. He brought important stability to this position. During the next 6 years, he and I talked frequently and discussed many topics of critical importance to this Nation. We also discussed changes he sought to implement to improve the operations of the intelligence community. These changes had, and will continue to have, a positive and lasting impact on the intelligence community.  During his tenure as DNI, Director Clapper focused relentlessly on intelligence integration, with a definitive focus on mission. He made important changes in how the Office of the Director of National Intelligence operated, including creating National Intelligence Managers, who oversaw the integration efforts across the intelligence community for specific mission areas. He put in place a planning, programming, budgeting, and evaluation system that set priorities, managed resources, and evaluated effectiveness of each taxpayer dollar being spent. He also began the ambitious goal of creating a common information technology infrastructure, known as the Intelligence Community Information Technology Enterprise, IC ITE, that will dramatically serve to improve intelligence integration. In addition, Director Clapper brought increased transparency to the intelligence community so that the public can have greater confidence in our intelligence capabilities and their appropriate use. His accomplishments are too many to enumerate here, but suffice it to say that his positive legacy within the intelligence community will continue for years to come.  Part of Director Clapper's strength as the Director of National Intelligence has been his deep understanding of this Nation's intelligence activities and his extensive network of colleagues with whom he worked across the intelligence enterprise to help serve the users of intelligence, be they policymakers, warfighters, law enforcement, or national security officials. His commitment to advancing women and minorities in the field of intelligence is particularly noteworthy. He selected the first woman to lead a major intelligence agency, naming Betty Sapp to be Director of the National Reconnaissance Office. He also named Tricia Long to be Director of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and recruited Stephanie O'Sullivan to be Principal Deputy Director for National Intelligence as his partner in creating and instituting change in the intelligence community.  While Jim Clapper portrays a somewhat gruff exterior, his concern for his employees and quiet sensitivities are well known to the countless staff who have received hand-written notes from him extolling exemplary work, congratulations on births and weddings, or heartfelt condolences for the loss of a loved one.  Today I want to congratulate him on his remarkable career and offer my gratitude for his decades of commitment and sacrifices to this Nation. I also thank his wife, Susan, who herself was an NSA employee, for her unfailing support over their 51-year marriage that allowed for the successes that Jim has achieved. The Nation owes this patriot a debt of gratitude.                          ____________________
