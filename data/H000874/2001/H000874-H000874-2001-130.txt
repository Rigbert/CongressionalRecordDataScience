Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for her amendment, and I thank her for her comments and her hard work on this committee and on so many other areas. She has touched on a critically important issue to our country.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the gentlewoman's amendment to provide half a billion dollars in emergency spending on biodiesel, ethanol and biomass research and development.  Mr. Chairman, since 1999, the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center, which is located in my district, has been conducting a pilot project using biodiesel. At BARC they use 80 percent diesel and 20 percent soybean oil mix. Their test results found that using biodiesel reduces carbon dioxide emissions 16 percent; particulate matter, which is a major component of smog, 22 percent; and sulfur emissions, 20 percent.  Equally important to the environmental benefits of these fuels is the fact that their use, as has been so well articulated by the gentlewoman from Ohio, lessens our dependence on foreign oil and opens up new markets for our farmers. So, from every perspective, this is a very positive direction for our country to move, and I thank the gentlewoman for her leadership.
