Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Speaker, there is one issue that really has not come up in this debate, and that is the immunity that is given in this bill to the people who are interrogating the enemy combatants.  We need to pass this bill so that interrogations can start up again because without the immunity, anybody who is hired by the United States Government to try to find out whom they are planning on blowing up next would be subject to a lawsuit that would be filed by some attorney that would claim that he was representing the public interest.  This is a protection bill for the interrogators. It is something that is needed, and that is another reason why it ought to pass.  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I will not take up any more time speaking about why I oppose this bill. I spoke at length during the House debate, and nothing has changed over the past 48 hours to make me believe that undermining our history, values and constitutional commitment to human rights, civil rights, the rule of law, due process and judicial review is the right thing to do.  Instead, I would like to submit for the Record the views of others in the face of this monumental mistake this Congress is making in submitting to the demands of an imperial White House.  I ask unanimous consent to submit into the Record the following materials:  1. Resolution Condemning Torture by the Conference of Major Superiors of Men;  2. A September 22, 2006 letter from human rights organizations to the U.S. Senate regarding the Military Commissions Act of 2006;  3. September 28, 2006 New York Times editorial, ``Rushing Off a Cliff;'' and  4. ``Questions for the Interrogators,'' Commentary by Fareed Zakaria, September 25, 2006, Newsweek                     Resolution Condemning Torture       CMSM condemns torture in all its forms regardless of      putative justification, and encourages support and help for      victims of torture throughout the world, but especially in      areas under the control of the United States Government.       Rationale: Jesus' death and resurrection revealed the      infinite value of each human being in God's eyes. [Cf. Mt      5:44-48; 10:29-31] Torture is a denial of that value. The      Catechism of the Catholic Church condemns torture as      ``contrary to respect for the person and for human dignity,''      and Gaudium et Spes of the Second Vatican Council [#27]      characterizes as criminal ``all violations of the integrity      of the human person, such as mutilation, physical and mental      torture, undue psychological pressures,'' including them in a      list that also contains ``all offenses against life itself,      such as murder, genocide, abortion, euthanasia and willful      suicide.''       Resolution: Given the universal condemnation of torture in      both International Law and religious documents, the      Conference of Major Superiors of Men resolves:       To condemn unequivocally any use of torture by agents of      any government for any reason;       To encourage its constituencies to use their resources of      education, preaching and advocacy to eliminate use of torture      as contrary to both natural law and human dignity, and in      fundamental opposition to God's salvific love for humanity:       To join with others to work in advocacy for the abolition      of torture, and to offer help and support to victims of      torture.       The Justice and Peace office will be responsible for      implementation.       Additional Facts/Related Circumstances: Background: ``The      torturer has become like the pirate and slave trader before      him hostis humani generis, an enemy of all mankind.'' So      proclaimed the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in      1980 [Filartiga v. Pena-Irala, 630 F.2d 876 (2nd Cir.(N.Y.)      Jun 30, 1980)]. In his 1958 Chicago address to the Radio and      Television News Directors Association, Edward R. Murrow said,      ``Not every story has two sides.''       The United Nations Convention against Torture and Other      Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment [1984]      defines torture as follows:       For the purposes of this Convention, the term ``torture''      means any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether      physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person      for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person      information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a      third person has committed or is suspected of having      committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person,      or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when      such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation      of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official      or other person acting in an official capacity. It does not      include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or      incidental to lawful sanctions. [A listing of other      international documents that condemn torture is available at      www.apt.ch/un/Torture%20Definition.doc.]       Recent actions brought to light about the involvement of      the U.S. military and other branches of the government in the      application of torture to prisoners demand a faith-based      response. The USCCB has spoken as follows on the issue:       The United States has a long history of leadership and      strong support for human rights around the world.      Ratifications of the Convention on Civil and Political Rights      and the Convention Against Torture embody our nation's      commitment to establishing standards of conduct and      prohibiting torture and other acts of inhumane treatment of      persons in U.S. custody. Tragically, our nation's record has      been marred by reported instances of abusive treatment of      enemy combatants held in military prisons in Iraq,      Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. [The complete document      is available at www.usccb.org/sdwp/international/senateletterretorture100405.pdf.]       The CMSM Executive Committee issued a statement in May of      2004 that included the following:       The Executive Committee of the Conference of Major      Superiors of Men is greatly disturbed by the revelations of      torture and abuse by U.S. military personnel. We have      consistently called for U.S. troops to abide by international      standards and laws that govern the treatment of detainees and      have questioned the lack of access that international      monitoring organizations such as the Red Cross, the Red      Crescent, Amnesty International have had at detention centers      in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Guantanamo Bay. Reports by      independent organizations and military personnel, combined      with the photographs and the admission by Administration      officials of the abuses indicate that the U.S. military      personnel and others contracted by the U.S. to work in the      detention centers must be monitored to protect the rights and      dignity of detainees.       As people of faith and as leaders of the Catholic      congregations of the nearly 23,000 brothers and priests in      the United States we believe that we must address this issue.      Each human being is created with God-given dignity and each      life is precious. This dignity must always be upheld and      protected but especially so when an individual is being      detained and his or her rights are already limited. They      deserved to be treated with dignity and protected from      violence and humiliation. As Christians we are deeply      troubled that much of the humiliation and abuse violates the      beliefs and practices of Islam. As U.S. citizens we are      ashamed that those who represent our nation are perpetrating      these abuses. We believe that as a nation we stand for the      protection of human rights and uphold the dignity of all      peoples regardless of their ethnic or religious background      and we hold our national and military leaders responsible for      the conditions that made these abuses not only possible, but      who refused to acknowledge them even after they knew of the      abuses.       George Hunsinger of the National Religious Campaign against      Torture adapted these words from Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.,      delivered at Riverside Church in New York in 1967:       A time comes when silence is betrayal. [People] do not      easily assume the task of opposing their government's policy,      especially in time of war. We must speak with all the      humility that is appropriate to our limited vision, but we      must speak. For we are deeply in need of a new way beyond the      darkness so close around us. We are called upon to speak for      the weak, for the voiceless, for the victims of our nation,      for those it calls ``enemy,'' for no document from human      hands can make these humans any less our brothers and      sisters.

Michael McNulty, SJ, Justice and Peace      Director.                                  ____                                               September 22, 2006.     Hon. John Warner,     Hon. John McCain,     Hon. Lindsey Graham,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Warner, McCain and Graham: We write to      express our grave concerns over the reported agreement      reached with the White House on the text of the Military      Commissions Act of 2006.       While the agreement rejects the Administration's proposal      to define and narrow the scope of US obligations under Common      Article Three of the Geneva Conventions, its language      concerning the War Crimes Act contains potentially dangerous      ambiguities. These ambiguities create serious risks for      American servicemembers as well as detainees in US custody.      We believe that a good faith interpretation of U.S. law,      including the Detainee Treatment Act, and U.S. international      obligations make it absolutely clear that practices such as      waterboarding, cold cell, prolonged standing, sleep      deprivation, threats and assaults on prisoners are illegal.      These and similar abusive techniques manifestly cause serious      mental and physical suffering and constitute grave breaches      of Common Article 3. Nonetheless, for several years there      have been persistent reports that such techniques have been      used on detainees. Moreover, troubling legal justifications      for them have been devised and provided to U.S.      interrogators. Some of those spurious legal justifications,      such as the Bybee Memorandum, have now been abandoned; but      there are continuing reports that     other legal justifications have been provided for conduct we      consider to be indisputably illegal under both U.S. and      international law.       Against this background of repeated legal contortions used      to justify and permit torture and abuse--some abandoned, some      apparently still in effect--it is absolutely essential that      the Congress be clear that these kinds of abusive      interrogation techniques are illegal and covered by the War      Crimes Act. We urge you to leave no shred of doubt on these      crucial issues by naming specific techniques which amount to      per se violations of the War Crimes Act or, at a minimum,      creating a legislative record that these techniques are      prohibited.       We also oppose the provisions in the bill that strip      individuals who are detained by the United States of the      ability to challenge the factual and legal basis of their      detention. Habeas corpus is necessary to avoid wrongful      deprivations of liberty and to ensure that executive      detentions are not grounded in torture or other abuse.      Likewise, we are deeply concerned about the provisions that      permit the use of evidence obtained through coercion.       This letter is not intended to offer a comprehensive      catalogue of the provisions in the proposed compromise      legislation which are of great concern. We appreciate the      efforts you have made to insure that abusive interrogations      cannot take place and to provide fair judicial procedures for      detainees. However, we do not believe that the proposed      compromise can be said to have satisfied those important      goals and feel strongly that these issues must be resolved.

Democrats betray their principles to      avoid last-minute attack ads. Our democracy is the big loser.       Republicans say Congress must act right now to create      procedures for charging and trying terrorists--because the      men accused of plotting the 9/11 attacks are available for      trial. That's pure propaganda. Those men could have been      tried and convicted long ago, but President Bush chose not      to. He held them in illegal detention, had them questioned in      ways that will make real trials very hard, and invented a      transparently illegal system of kangaroo courts to convict      them.       It was only after the Supreme Court issued the inevitable      ruling striking down Mr. Bush's shadow penal system that he      adopted his tone of urgency. It serves a cynical goal:      Republican strategists think they can win this fall, not by      passing a good law but by forcing Democrats to vote against a      bad one so they could be made to look soft on terrorism.       Last week, the White House and three Republican senators      announced a terrible deal on this legislation that gave Mr.      Bush most of what he wanted, including a blanket waiver for      crimes Americans may have committed in the service of his      antiterrorism policies. Then Vice President Dick Cheney and      his willing lawmakers rewrote the rest of the measure so that      it would give Mr. Bush the power to jail pretty much anyone      he wants for as long as he wants without charging them, to      unilaterally reinterpret the Geneva Conventions, to authorize      what normal people consider torture, and to deny justice to      hundreds of men captured in error.       These are some of the bill's biggest flaws:       Enemy Combatants: A dangerously broad definition of      ``illegal enemy combatant'' in the bill could subject legal      residents of the United States, as well as foreign citizens      living in their own countries, to summary arrest and      indefinite detention with no hope of appeal. The president      could give the power to apply this label to anyone he wanted.       The Geneva Conventions: 'The bill would repudiate a half-     century of international precedent by allowing Mr. Bush to      decide on his own what abusive interrogation methods he      considered permissible. And his decision could stay secret--     there's no requirement that this list be published.       Habeas Corpus: Detainees in U.S. military prisons would      lose the basic right to challenge their imprisonment. These      cases do not clog the courts, nor coddle terrorists. They      simply give wrongly imprisoned people a chance to prove their      innocence.       Judicial Review: The courts would have no power to review      any aspect of this new system, except verdicts by military      tribunals. The bill would limit appeals and bar legal actions      based on the Geneva Conventions, directly or indirectly. All      Mr. Bush would have to do to lock anyone up forever is to      declare him an illegal combatant and not have a trial.       Coerced Evidence: Coerced evidence would be permissible if      a judge considered it reliable--already a contradiction in      terms--and relevant. Coercion is defined in a way that      exempts anything done before the passage of the 2005 Detainee      Treatment Act, and anything else Mr. Bush chooses.       Secret Evidence: American standards of justice prohibit      evidence and testimony that is kept secret from the      defendant, whether the accused is a corporate executive or a      mass murderer. But the bill as redrafted by Mr. Cheney seems      to weaken protections against such evidence.       Offenses: The definition of torture is unacceptably narrow,      a virtual reprise of the deeply cynical memos the      administration produced after 9/11. Rape and sexual assault      are defined in a retrograde way that covers only forced or      coerced activity, and not other forms of nonconsensual sex.      The bill would effectively eliminate the idea of rape as      torture.       There is not enough time to fix these bills, especially      since the few Republicans who call themselves moderates have      been whipped into line, and the Democratic leadership in the      Senate seems to have misplaced its spine. If there was ever a      moment for a filibuster, this was it.       We don't blame the Democrats for being frightened. The      Republicans have made it clear that they'll use any      opportunity to brand anyone who votes against this bill as a      terrorist enabler. But Americans of the future won't remember      the pragmatic arguments for caving in to the administration.       They'll know that in 2006, Congress passed a tyrannical law      that will be ranked with the low points in American      democracy, our generation's version of the Alien and Sedition      Acts.                                  ____                    [From Newsweek, Sept. 25, 2006]                    Questions for the Interrogators                          (By Fareed Zakaria]       A fierce debate over military tribunals has erupted in      Washington. This is great news. The American constitutional      system is finally working. The idea that the war on terror      should be fought unilaterally by the executive branch--a      theory the Bush administration promulgated for its entire      first term--has died. The secret prisons have come out of the      dark. Guantanamo will have to be closed or transformed.       The president and the legislative branch are negotiating a      new system to determine the guilt or innocence of terrorism      suspects, and it will have to pass muster with the courts. It      is heartening as well that some of the key senators      challenging the president's position are senior Republicans.      Principle is triumphing over partisanship. Let's hope the      debate will end with the United States' embracing a position      that will allow America to reclaim the moral high ground.       The administration's policy has undergone a sea change. The      executive branch has abandoned the idea that ``enemy      combatants''--that is, anyone so defined by the White House      or Defense Department--may be locked up indefinitely without      ever being charged, that secret prisons can be maintained,      that congressional input or oversight is unnecessary and that      international laws and treaties are irrelevant. The Geneva      Conventions, in particular, were dismissed during the      administration's first term by the then White House counsel      Alberto Gonzales for their ``quaint'' protections of      prisoners and ``obsolete'' limitations on interrogations.      Donald Rumsfeld publicly announced that the Conventions no      longer applied. The Bush administration's basic legal      argument, formulated by officials like the Justice      Department's John Yoo, was that this was a new kind of war,      that the executive branch needed complete freedom and      flexibility, with no checks or balances.       ``There has been a paradigm shift on this whole issue,' a      senior administration official told me last week. ``The whole      legal framework that underpinned the administration's      approach in the first term is gone. John Yoo's arguments are      simply no longer applicable. You may disagree with where we      draw the lines, but we're now using concepts, principles and      approaches that are familiar, within the American legal      tradition and that of other civilized nations.''       The administration was forced to do much of this by the      Supreme Court's recent Hamdan decision and by the bold      opposition of senators like John McCain and Lindsey Graham.      But several officials, wishing to remain anonymous because of      the sensitivity of the matter, said Secretary of State      Condoleezza Rice and national security adviser Stephen Hadley      had been urging movement in this direction for some time.      ``We concluded that this whole structure of prisoners,      interrogations, trials and tribunals had to be placed on a      sustainable basis,'' said one official. ``That meant Congress      had to be involved and the president had to explain the      programs and procedures publicly.''       The crucial issue, on which former Secretary of State Colin      Powell and other distinguished military figures have stood up      to Bush, is the treatment of prisoners under the Geneva      Conventions. Powell explained to me his deep concerns about      safeguarding American troops if ``we start monkeying around      with the common understanding of the Conventions.'' The      administration claims that it merely wants to provide      specific guidelines,     but the real aim appears to be to let CIA employees engage in      ``rough'' interrogations without fear of legal sanctions.       Powell and the senators argue that the guidelines are      better left as they are--with a kind of calculated ambiguity      that deters U.S. interrogators from testing the limits.      ``Clarifying' our treaty obligations will be seen as      `withdrawing' from them,'' warns Senator Graham, a former      staff judge advocate in the Air National Guard. He's right.      No other nation has sought to narrow the Geneva Conventions'      scope by ``clarifying'' them. Does the United States want to      be the first? Why not retain the status quo and then consult      with other countries that are also grappling with terror      suspects and arrive at a genuinely ``common'' clarification      of the Conventions? If we ``clarify'' the Conventions to      allow, say, waterboarding and other ``rough'' procedures,      what happens to a CIA operative who is captured in a foreign      country? Can that country ``clarify'' the Conventions and      torture him? If it does, would the United States have any      basis to condemn it and take action under international law?       Powell made another argument to me. ``Part of the war on      terror is an ideological and political struggle,'' he said.      ``Our moral posture is one of our best weapons. We're not      doing so well on the public-diplomacy front. This would be      the wrong signal to send the world.'' The administration      seems blind to this political reality. After Guantanamo, Abu      Ghraib, Haditha and more, America desperately needs a symbol      that showcases its basic decency. Quibbling with the Geneva      Conventions is the wrong signal, by the wrong administration,      at the wrong time.
