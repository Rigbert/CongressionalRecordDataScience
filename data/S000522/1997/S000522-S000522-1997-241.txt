Mr. Speaker, at the end of the last Congress, I introduced a resolution on the difficult subject of property claims arising from Fascist- and Communist-era confiscations in Central and Eastern Europe. As with the previous resolution, I am joined by my colleagues from the Helsinki Commission in introducing this resolution. Mr. Porter, Mr. Wolf, Mr. Salmon, Mr. Christensen, Mr. Hoyer, Mr. Markey, and Mr. Cardin have agreed to be original cosponsors of this resolution.  This resolution stemmed from a hearing I convened in July with Under Secretary ofCommerce Stuart Eizenstat and Chairwoman of the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission Delissa Ridgway. In compelling testimony presented to the Helsinki Commission, these two individuals outlined the maze of programs and procedures which govern property claims in Central and Eastern Europe today. Chairwoman Ridgway's Commission is primarily concerned with adjudicating agreements on behalf of American claimants in those instances where agreements between the United States and foreign governments have already been reached. Under Secretary Eizenstat has sought to engage these governments in a dialog about these issues, to foster a greater acknowledgment of past wrongs, and to discern the ways in which the process of making compensation or restitution can be further advanced. I commend both of these people for the strong leadership they have shown in their work.  Mr. Speaker, the procedures that exist for compensation or restitution differ from country to country, often requiring claimants to travel a road so encumbered with conditions and qualifications that it must be a miracle for anyone to have any property returned. And that, of course, is only in those countries which have actually adopted restitution or compensation laws--many countries in this region have not even taken that step. I am particularly anxious to ensure that the survivors of Nazi persecution--people who, in many instances, were unable to receive compensation made available to their counterparts in the West or in Israel--receive the belated compensation that may enable them to live their remaining days in dignity. Moreover, I am deeply troubled that several countries in this region have adopted compensation or restitution laws that discriminate on the basis of citizenship or residency, a move that clearly and unfairly discriminates against American claimants.  I hope other Members of Congress will join me in signaling the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and, in particular, calling for the urgent return of property formerly belonging to Jewish communities as a means of redressing the especially compelling problems of aging and often destitute survivors of the Holocaust. In addition, this resolution calls for countries to remove from their books restrictions which require claimants seeking compensation or restitution to have the citizenship of, or residency in, the country from which they seek compensation or restitution.  Mr. Speaker, I would ask that the text of the resolution be printed in the Record at this point.                             H. Con. Res.--       Whereas Fascist and Communist dictatorships have caused      immeasurable human suffering and loss, degrading not only      every conceivable human right, but the human spirit itself;       Whereas the villainy of communism was dedicated, in      particular, to the organized and systematic destruction of      private property ownership;       Whereas the wrongful and illegal confiscation of property      perpetrated by Fascist and Communist regimes was often      specifically designed to victimize people because of their      religion, national or social origin, or expressed opposition      to the regimes which repressed them;       Whereas Fascists and Communists often obtained possession      of properties confiscated from the victims of the systems      they actively supported;       Whereas Jewish individuals and communities were often twice      victimized, first by the Nazis and their collaborators and      then by the subsequent Communist regimes;       Whereas churches, synagogues, mosques, and other religious      properties were also destroyed or confiscated as a means of      breaking the spiritual devotion and allegiance of religious      adherents;       Whereas Fascists, Nazis, and Communists have used foreign      financial institutions to launder and hold wrongfully and      illegally confiscated property and convert it to their own      personal use;       Whereas some foreign financial institutions violated their      fiduciary duty to their customers by converting to their own      use financial assets belonging to Holocaust victims while      denying heirs access to these assets;       Whereas refugees from communism, in addition to being      wrongly stripped of their private property, were often forced      to relinquish their citizenship in order to protect      themselves and their families from reprisals by the      Communists who ruled their countries;       Whereas the participating states of the Organization for      Security and Cooperation in Europe have agreed to give full      recognition and protection to all types of property,      including private property, as well as the right to prompt,      just, and effective compensation in the event private      property is taken for public use;       Whereas the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, as      well as the Caucasus and Central Asia, have entered a post-     Communist period of transition and democratic development,      and many countries have begun the difficult and wrenching      process of trying to right the past wrongs of previous      totalitarian regimes;       Whereas restrictions which require those whose properties      have been wrongly plundered by Nazi or Communist regimes to      reside in or have the citizenship of the country from which      they now seek restitution or compensation are arbitrary and      discriminatory in violation of international law; and       Whereas the rule of law and democratic norms require that      the activity of governments and their administrative agencies      be exercised in accordance with the laws passed by their      parliaments or legislatures and such laws themselves must be      consistent with international human rights standards: Now,      therefore, be it       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate      concurring, That the Congress--       (1) welcomes the efforts of many post-Communist countries      to address the complex and difficult question of the status      of plundered properties;       (2) urges countries which have not already done so to      return plundered properties to their rightful owners or, as      an alternative, pay compensation, in accordance with      principles of justice and in a manner that is just,      transparent, and fair;       (3) calls for the urgent return of property formerly      belonging to Jewish communities as a means of redressing the      particularly compelling problems of aging and destitute      survivors of the Holocaust;       (4) calls on the Czech Republic, Latvia, Lithuania,      Romania, Slovakia and any other country with restrictions      which require those whose properties have been wrongly      plundered by Nazi or Communist regimes to reside in or have      the citizenship of the country from which they now seek      restitution or compensation to remove such restrictions from      their restitution or compensation laws;       (5) calls upon foreign financial institutions, and the      states having legal authority over their operation, that      possess wrongfully and illegally property confiscated from      Holocaust victims, from residents of former Warsaw Pact      states who were forbidden by Communist law from obtaining      restitution of such property, and from states that were      occupied by Nazi, Fascist, or Communist forces, to assist and      to cooperate fully with efforts to restore this property to      its rightful owners; and       (6) urges post-Communist countries to pass and effectively      implement laws that provide for restitution of, or      compensation for, plundered property.                          ____________________
