Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 81) expressing the sense of Congress regarding the two-year anniversary of the human rights crackdown in Cuba.  The Clerk read as follows:                            H. Con. Res. 81       Whereas in March 2003, Cuban dictator Fidel Castro arrested      more than 75 journalists, labor union organizers, civic      leaders, librarians, and human rights activists as political      prisoners;       Whereas the Cuban regime, after summary trials which were      denounced by the international community, sentenced these      innocent men and women to a total of more than 1,000 years in      prison for trying to exercise their civil and political      rights, many of whom are anticipated to die in prison before      their sentence is completed;       Whereas the Charter of the United Nations reaffirms a      commitment to fundamental human rights and to the dignity and      worth of all people;       Whereas the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which      establishes global human rights standards, asserts that all      human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights,      and that no one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest or      detention;       Whereas these arrests and convictions were an atrocious      attempt by the Cuban regime to crush the citizens' movements      for a free and democratic Cuba;       Whereas Fidel Castro has tentatively released a limited      number of prisoners from jail but these political activists      are subject to arrest and imprisonment at any time pursuant      to ``extra penal licenses'';       Whereas in 2004, the Cuban regime continued its suppression      of democracy and repression of human rights activists,      imprisoning a significant number of political dissidents      during the year on such charges as disrespect for authority,      public disorder, disobedience, and resisting arrest;       Whereas in April 2004, the United Nations Commission on      Human Rights adopted a resolution deploring the sentencing of      ``political dissidents and journalists'' in 2003 and calling      for a visit to Cuba by a Personal Representative of the High      Commissioner for Human Rights which was later denied by the      Cuban regime;       Whereas Fidel Castro continues to hold hundreds of      political prisoners in his jail cells;       Whereas Amnesty International has recognized all      journalists and activists who were arrested in the crackdown      in March 2003 as prisoners of conscience;       Whereas the Cuban regime engages in torture and other      cruel, inhumane, and degrading treatment and punishment      against political prisoners to force them into submission,      including intense beatings, extended periods of solitary      confinement, and denial of nutritional and medical attention,      according to the Department of State's Country Report on      Human Rights 2004;       Whereas religious freedom in Cuba is severely      circumscribed, and clergy and lay people suffer sustained      persecution by the Cuban State Security apparatus;       Whereas the Cuban regime denies the people of Cuba equal      protection under the law, disallows them recourse for      remedying violations of human rights and civil liberties, and      instead enforces a judicial system which infringes upon      fundamental rights; and       Whereas the United States Congress has stood, consistently,      on the side of the Cuban people and supported their right to      be free: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate      concurring),  That Congress--       (1) condemns in the strongest possible terms the arrest of      more than 75 journalists, labor union organizers, civic      leaders, librarians, and human rights activists as political      prisoners in March 2003 and the Cuban regime's continuing      repressive crackdown against the brave internal opposition      and the independent press;       (2) expresses its profound admiration and firm solidarity      with the internal opposition and independent press of Cuba;       (3) demands that the Cuban regime immediately release all      political prisoners, legalize all political parties, labor      unions, and the press, and hold free and fair elections;       (4) declares the acts of the Cuban regime, including its      widespread and systematic violation of human rights, to be in      violation of the Charter of the United Nations and the      Universal Declaration of Human Rights;       (5) declares that the rule of law should replace the rule      of force so that the fundamental and inalienable rights of      every individual in Cuba are protected;       (6) calls for the European Union, as well as other      countries and international organizations, to continue to      pressure the Cuban regime to improve its human rights record;      and       (7) calls for United Nations member countries to vote      against the Cuban regime's membership in the United Nations      Commission on Human Rights and the passage of a resolution at      the 61st session of the United Nations Commission on Human      Rights that holds the Cuban regime accountable for its gross      violations of human rights and civil liberties.
