  The Thune amendment would strengthen the bill and beef up the triggers that precede the legalization program.  The Thune amendment would ensure that current law regarding double-layer fencing is implemented.  Over the years, administration after administration--and not just Democrat or just Republican but both--has failed to enforce the laws on the books. The American people don't want more laws that will simply be ignored, they want the laws on the books to be enforced. This amendment offered by Senator Thune would ensure that the border is more secure before any legalization program is carried out.  In a new CNN poll released just today, 36 percent of those polled said they favored a path to citizenship for people who have come to this country undocumented. But 62 percent of those polled said it is more important to increase border security to reduce or eliminate the number of immigrants coming into the country without permission from our government. So if we stand with the American people, and if we want the border secured, we will vote for the Thune amendment.  It is this simple: When issues come up in my town meetings in my State of Iowa and people are asking what is going on with immigration, and we sit down and try to explain to the people how this bill is moving along or what it might include, invariably there are a lot of people in the audience who say we don't need more legislation, we need to have the laws on the books enforced. I think this is backed up by this poll we have heard about from CNN today.  In addition to that, I think it very much clarifies that people want the laws on the books enforced. But, more importantly, they expect people who take an oath to uphold the Constitution and the laws would actually carry out the laws they are elected to carry out. So I hope my colleagues will vote for the Thune amendment.  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.
