 President, let me state we will have more time, obviously, this afternoon to debate the class size amendment. I appreciate the comments from the chair of the HELP Committee in this regard.  I agree with him. Professional development is extremely critical. That is why my amendment to separate the professional development funds from class size funds is extremely important. We want our schools to have professional development but not at the expense of reducing class size, which we know works. That makes sure Federal tax dollars are spent wisely at the local level--and which is a local decision, I say to the Senator from Arkansas, who spoke earlier.  If a school district doesn't want to participate, they certainly do not have to do so. But for the many schools out there, for 2 million students who have benefited, let's not take it away now. Let's make sure they are in a class size in K-3 that allows them to learn math, science, basic reading, and they are able to succeed in the future.
