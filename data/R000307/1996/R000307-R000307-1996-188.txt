Chairman, I want to inform Members that the House will go into session tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock in order to expedite consideration of the farm bill, and to accommodate Members there will be no 1-minutes.  Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise.  The motion was agreed to.  Accordingly the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. LaHood) having assumed the chair, Mr. Young of Florida, Chairman of the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 2854) to modify the operation of certain agricultural programs, had come to no resolution thereon.                          ____________________
