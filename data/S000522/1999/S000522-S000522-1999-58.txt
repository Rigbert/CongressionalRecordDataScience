Just let me point out to my colleagues, and I think they realize this, that the appropriators certainly have an advantage in that they are bringing to the floor must-pass bills. The authorizers almost by definition are disadvantaged because an administration that may not like this provision or that will just saywe will wait for the money to arrive, because it has to arrive to begin the new fiscal year, from the appropriators.  So the honest negotiation that we hope would take place between House, Senate, and the executive branch is largely truncated and precluded precisely because the money in some form, usually less because of the inability or the lack of wanting to deal with us in good faith.  So the gentleman from New York (Mr. Gilman) has led I think a very, very fine effort as chairman of our full committee, but we are disadvantaged, because, again, it is hard to work out the policy language, when they get their money anyway at the end of the day.  That has not been the case with arrearages. We have insisted on very strong, very tight, 15 pages of conditions on the United Nations, 15 single-spaced pages that the Hall amendment would vacate. It makes our bargaining position vis-a-vis the Executive Branch very much disadvantaged, and we want strong reform with regard to the U.N., not weak.
