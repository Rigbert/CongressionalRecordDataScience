 President, I rise today to introduce legislation to change the way unaccompanied immigrant children are treated while in the custody of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). The Unaccompanied Alien Child Protection Act of 2000 would ensure that the federal government addresses the special needs of thousands of unaccompanied alien children who enter the U.S. It would ensure that these children have a fair opportunity to obtain humanitarian relief when eligible.  Central throughout this legislation are two concepts:  (1) The United States government has a special responsibility to protect unaccompanied children in its custody; and  (2) In all proceedings and actions, the government must have as its paramount priority the protection of the best interests of the child.  The Unaccompanied Alien Child Protection Act of 2000 would ensure that children who are apprehended by the INS are treated humanely and appropriately by transferring jurisdiction over the welfare of unaccompanied minors from the INS Detention and Deportation division to a newly created Office of Children Services within the INS.  This legislation would also centralize responsibility for the care and custody of unaccompanied children in a new Office of Children's Services. By doing so, the legislation would resolve the conflict of interest inherent in the current system--that is, the INS retains custody of children and is charged with their care while, at the same time, it seeks their deportation.  Under this bill, the Office of Children's Services would be required to establish standards for the custody, release, and detention of children, ensuring that children are housed in appropriate shelters or foster care rather than juvenile jails. In 1999, the INS held some 2,000 children in juvenile jails even though they had never committed a crime. Equally as important, the bill would require the Office to establish clear guidelines and uniformity for detention alternatives such as shelter care, foster care, and other child custody arrangements.  The bill would strengthen options for the permanent protection of alien children in the United States, including providing asylum or adjustment of status to those who qualify.  Finally, the Unaccompanied Alien Child Protection Act would provide unaccompanied minors with access to legal counsel, who would ensure that the children appear at all immigration proceedings and assist them as the INS and immigration court considers their cases. The bill would also provide access to a guardian ad litem to ensure that they are properly placed in a safe environment. The guardian ad litem would also make sure that the child's attorney is, in fact, operating in his or her best interest.  Let me turn for a moment to the issue of access to counsel. Children, even more than adults, have immense difficulty tackling the complexities of the asylum system without the assistance of counsel. Despite this reality, most children in INS detention are unrepresented. Without legal representation, children are at risk of being returned to their home countries where they may face further human rights abuses.  I am aware of two cases that demonstrate the compelling need for counsel on behalf of these children. The first case involves two 17-year-old boys from China. Li and Wang were apprehended on an island near Guam and have been in INS custody for 16 months. During their detention on Guam, the two boys testified in federal court against the smugglers who brought them to Guam. In their testimony, they described being beaten by the smugglers even before leaving China, and stated that others were beaten during the trip to Guam. In the spring of 2000, the two boys were brought to a corrections facility in Los Angeles and are currently being held in the INS section of that facility. This is where the similarity in their cases end.  While both of the boys would face danger from the smugglers if they returned to China because of their testimony, only one was granted asylum. Li applied for asylum and was denied. He was not represented by counsel at his hearing. Despite the fact that the INS trial attorney mentioned that Li had testified in federal court against the smugglers, the judge did not include this information in her decision on the claim. Luckily for Li, an attorney overheard the hearing, and after speaking with Li, agreed to appeal his asylum claim. Li is still being held in a Los Angeles corrections facility. The story is different for Wang. Wang had an attorney and won his asylum hearing. But INS is appealing the decision so Wang still sits in a Los Angeles corrections facility, too.  These cases demonstrate the pressing need of legal representation for children. Li may have won his asylum claim if he had been represented by counsel and if the evidence regarding his testimony in federal court had been incorporated into his asylum claim. Instead, a 17-year-old boy unfamiliar with our immigration system and our language was forced to navigate the tricky court system alone.  According to Human Rights Watch, children detained by the INS, whether in secure detention or less restrictive settings, often have great difficulty obtaining information about their legal rights. On a visit to the Berks facility in 1998, Human Rights Watch staff found that none of the children they interviewed had received information about their rights or available legal services from either the INS or the facility's staff. Neither could local INS or facility staff identify how these children might receive this information.  In one way or another, we have been affected by the six-year-old shipwreck survivor from Cuba, Elian Gonzalez. His tragic story brought to light the plight of numerous other youngsters who find their way to the United States, unaccompanied by an adult and, in many cases, traumatized by the experiences provoking their flight.  Unaccompanied alien children are among the most vulnerable of the immigrant population; many have entered the country under traumatic circumstances. They are unable to protect themselves adequately from danger. Because of their youth and the fact that they are alone, they are often subject to abuse or exploitation.  Because of their age and inexperience, unaccompanied alien children are not able to articulate their fears, their views, or testify to their needs as accurately as adults can. Despite these facts, U.S. immigration laws and policies have been developed and implemented without careful attention to their effect on children, particularly on unaccompanied alien children.  Each year, the INS detains more than 5,000 children nationwide. They are apprehended for not having proper documentation at the ports-of-entry for entering the United States. Their detention may last for months--and sometimes for years--as they undergo complex immigration proceedings.  Under current immigration law, these children are forced to struggle through a system designed primarily for adults, even though they lack the capacity to understand nuanced legal principles and procedures. Children who may very well be eligible for relief are often vulnerable to being deported back to the very abuses they fled before they are able to make their case before the INS or an immigration judge.  Under current law, the INS is responsible for the apprehension, detention, care, placement, legal protection, and deportation of unaccompanied children. I believe that these are conflicting responsibilities that undercut the best interests of the child. Too often, the INS has fallen short in fulfilling the protection side of the these responsibilities.  The INS uses a variety of facilities to house children. Some are held in children's shelters in which children are offered some of the services they need but still may experience prolonged detention, lack of access to counsel, and other troubling conditions.  The INS relies on juvenile correctional facilities to house many children, even in the absence of any criminal wrongdoing. Today, one out of every three children in INS custody is detained in secure, jail-like facilities. These facilities are highly inappropriate, particularly for children who have already experienced trauma in their homelands.  There is currently no provision of federal law providing guidance for the placement of unaccompanied alienchildren. In 1987, the Flores v. Reno settlement agreement on behalf of minors in INS detention established the nationwide policy for the detention, release, and treatment of children in the custody of INS. The Flores agreement requires that the INS treat minors with dignity, respect, and special concern for their particular vulnerability. It also requires the INS to place each detained minor in the least restrictive setting appropriate to the child's age and special needs.  In response to Flores, the INS issued regulations that permitted its officers to detain children in secure facilities only in limited circumstances. The INS officers were required to provide written notice to the child of the reasons for such placement. More importantly, the regulations required the INS to segregate immigration detainees from juvenile criminal offenders.  Although INS officials have contended that these children are placed in these facilities largely because they are charged with other offenses, the INS statistics do not bear out this claim. In fiscal year 1999, only 19 percent of the children placed in secure detention were chargeable or adjudicated as delinquents.  According to non-governmental organizations (NGOs) such as Human Rights Watch and the Women's Commission on Refugee Women and Children, the INS regularly violates these regulations. The NGOs contend that too often children are placed in jail-like facilities for seemingly arbitrary reasons, seldom notified of the reasons why, and forced to share rooms and have extensive contact with convicted juvenile offenders.  I was also astonished to learn that many of these children, some as young as four and five years old, are placed behind multiple layers of locked doors, surrounded by walls and barbed wire. They are strip searched, patted down, placed in solitary confinement for punishment, forced to wear prison uniforms and shackles, and are forbidden to keep personal objects. Often they have no one to speak with because of the language barrier.  The Unaccompanied Alien Child Protection Act of 2000 would ensure that the particular needs of the thousands of unaccompanied alien children who enter INS custody each year are met and that these children have a fair opportunity to obtain immigration relief when eligible.  In 1999, the INS held approximately 4,600 children under the age of 18 in its custody. Some of these children fled human rights abuses or armed conflict in their home countries, some were victims of child abuse or had otherwise lost the support and protection of their families, some came to the United States to join family members, and some came to escape economic deprivation.  Many of these children came from troubled countries around the world, including the Peoples Republic of China, Honduras, Afghanistan, Somalia, Sierra Leone, Colombia, Guatemala, Cuba, former Yugoslavia, and others. They range in age from toddlers to teenagers. Some traveled to the United States alone, while others were accompanied by unrelated adults.  Sadly, a significant number are victims of smuggling or trafficking rings. In one recent instance, Phanupong Khaisri, a two-year-old Thai child, was brought to the U.S. by two individuals falsely claiming to be his parents, but who were actually part of a major alien trafficking ring. The INS was prepared to deport the child back to Thailand. It was not until Members of Congress and the local Thai community had intervened, however, that the INS decided to allow the child to remain in the U.S. until the agency could provide proper medical attention and determine what course of action would be in his best interest. Now his case is before a federal district court judge who will determine whether he should be eligible to apply for asylum.  The Unaccompanied Alien Child Protection Act aims to prevent situations like this from recurring by centralizing the care and custody of unaccompanied children into a new Office of Children's Services within the INS, but outside the jurisdiction of the District Directors. By doing so, the Act resolves the conflict of interest inherent in the current system--that is, the INS retains custody of children and is charged with their care while, at the same time, it seeks their deportation.  I would like to take a moment to share with you a few other examples of how the federal government has fallen short in the manner in which we handle vulnerable unaccompanied minors. One would think that our country would treat unaccompanied minors with the sensitivity and care their situations demands. Unfortunately, in too many instances, that has not been the case. Too often, these children are often treated like adults and, under the worst circumstances, like criminals.  Xaio Ling, a young girl from China who spoke no English, was detained by the INS at the Berks County Juvenile Detention Center. The INS placed her among children guilty of violent crimes, including rape and murder. Xaio was never guilty of any crime, and yet she slept in a small concrete cell, was subjected to humiliating strip searches, and forced to wear handcuffs. She was forbidden to keep any of her clothes or possessions and, under the policies of the Berks Center, Xaio was not allowed to laugh.  Imagine the fear this child had: thrust into a system she did not understand, given no legal aid, placed in jail that housed juveniles with serious criminal convictions, including murder, car jacking, rape, and drug trafficking. She did not speak English and was unable to speak to any staff who knew her language, and she had to submit to strip searches. It is hard to believe that our country would have allowed this innocent child to be treated in such a horrible manner.  Situations like that of the young Chinese girl make a compelling case for a change in the way our nation treats unaccompanied alien children. Under the legislation I have introduced today, this youngster would never have been placed in a detention center with criminal offenders. Rather, she would have immediately been placed in shelter care, foster care, or a home more appropriate for her situation. She would have been provided an attorney for her immigration proceedings and a social worker would have been appointed as guardian ad litem to ensure that the child's needs were being met. Sadly, this young girl was given none of these options. Neither was a 16-year-old boy from Colombia.  This youngster fled Colombia to escape a life of violence on the streets of Bogota, where FARC guerrillas attempted to recruit him and the F-2 branch of the Colombian government harassed him in its attempt to get rid of street children. Fearing for his life, he fled Colombia for Venezuela where he lived without shelter or sufficient food. In search of a safer life, he sneaked into the machine room of a cargo ship bound for the United States. He was lucky to survive; many other stowaways were thrown overboard when discovered by the ship's crew.  The boy remained on the ship from November 1998 until March 1999, when he arrived in Philadelphia. He was soon turned over to the INS and placed into the same detention center the young Chinese girl was held in. He, too, was kept with criminal offenders. He did not understand English, which created a myriad of problems because he was unable to understand what was expected of him in the detention center. He was held in an inappropriately punitive environment for six months.  I have one last story to share with you today. Placed on a boat bound for the United States by her very own parents, a 15-year-old girl fled China's rigid family planning laws. Under these laws she was denied citizenship, education, and medical care. She came to this country alone and desperate. And what did our immigration system do when they found her? They held her in a juvenile jail in Portland, Oregon. She was held for eight months and was detained for an additional four months after being granted political asylum. At her asylum hearing, the young girl could not wipe away the tears from her face because her hands were chained to her waist. According to her lawyer, ``her only crime was that her parents had put her on a boat so she could get a better life over here.''  For years children's rights and human rights organizations have implored Congress to improve the way our immigration system handles unaccompanied minors--just like the ones whose stories I have just told. I believe my bill would do just that.  We cannot continue to allow children, who come to our country, oftentraumatized and guilty of no crime, to be held in jails and treated like criminals. We cannot continue to allow children, scared and helpless, to be thrown into a system they do not understand without sufficient legal aid and a guardian to look after their best interests. We must adhere to the principles of our justice system. What kind of message do we send when we deprive children who come to our country seeking refuge of their basic rights and protections?  As a nation that holds our democratic ideals and constitutional rights paramount, how then can we continue to avert our attention from repeated violations of some of the most basic human rights against children who have no voice in the immigration system? We should be outraged that children who come to the U.S. alone, many against their will, are subjected to such inhumane, excessive conditions.  I am proud to have the support of the United States Catholic Conference and the Women's Commission on Refugee Women and Children, with whom I have worked closely to develop this legislation.  Although we are nearing the end of the session, I want to highlight this issue now so that we can begin to think about the importance of protecting the rights of children in immigration custody and work towards passing this legislation in the next Congress.                                 ______                                       By
