President, I know Members are eager for us to vote on Senator Lautenberg's amendment, which I believe is the pending amendment. I hope to conclude the debate on that shortly and move to table his amendment. Senator Stevens is in the Chamber and would like to lay down a couple of amendments. I will delay the debate on the Lautenberg amendment until after Senator Stevens.  I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside so Senator Stevens may offer his amendment.
