Chairman, I yield myself 15 seconds.  Mr. Chairman, this bill does not take away a cause of action that any member of a class has. All of the class action suits that the gentleman from Texas has talked about could still be filed and litigated, but litigated fairly.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Cox).
