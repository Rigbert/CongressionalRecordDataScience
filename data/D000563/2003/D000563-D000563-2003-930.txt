I thank him for coming to the floor, even though we disagree on this issue. This deliberative body doesn't deliberate much. There is not much debate on the floor of the Senate and that is sad. I thank him for coming to the floor and for engaging me in questions. I think he will find, almost without exception, I always yield for questions because I happen to believe that is what this is about. It is a deliberative body. We should express our points of view. Let our colleagues and those following debate decide who is right and who is wrong. I thank him for asking those questions.  I think what he has said is he has a difference of opinion from my point of view on the disclosure of documents. That is an honest difference. I think what I have said is in the past there has been disclosure, lines have been drawn, but in this case the White House said no disclosure when it comes to Miguel Estrada's documents, and that is an important issue before us.  Second, he has asked for a bill of particulars: Give us the specific questions that you didn't like when it came to Miguel Estrada's responses. I have given him several. That is not an exclusive or exhaustive list. I think other members of the Judiciary Committee could come up with more.  If the Senator is suggesting we should resubmit the questions and see if he takes the test a second time whether he can pass it, maybe that would move us down the road a little closer to a final vote on this individual.  I want to add here it is unusual for there to be a filibuster on a nominee to such an important bench, but it is not unprecedented. I don't know if my colleague was in the Senate when the Richard Paez nomination came before us. But the fact is, he would not have been confirmed had it not been for a cloture vote that had to be filed. Paez, who waited patiently for over 4 years before the Senate Judiciary Committee, finally had to have a cloture vote in which he prevailed to become a Federal judge.  The Republicans, then in a position to launch a filibuster, did it on a Hispanic nominee not that long ago, in March of 2000. We know when it came to Richard Paez, the standard used by many Republican Senators was we will filibuster him. It took a cloture vote to stop the filibuster. I don't know if the Senator was in the Senate at that time. I think he was. I do not know how he voted. But the fact is some Members felt strongly enough about the Paez nomination that they went ahead and initiated this kind of filibuster.                              The Economy  Mr. President, I would like to move on to another issue if I can. It is one I think bears some attention by the Senate and those following the deliberation. We are now in the third week of debating Miguel Estrada. It is an important issue.  Today, I noticed when President Bush spoke to the Latino Coalition in the Executive Office Building, the first issue he raised was not Miguel Estrada but it was an important issue--and I am sure he did that for emphasis--but when it came to the issues raised by the President of the United States to the Latino Coalition in the Executive Office Building, the first issue he raised was the state of the economy. It is interesting to me that though the President raised this issue, we can't raise this issue on the floor of the Senate.  Yesterday, the minority leader, Tom Daschle, made a unanimous consent request which I am going to repeat in a few moments that we move from this debate to a debate on the state of the economy--and I think for good reason.  As you look across America, you think people will realize our economy is in a sad state. This is a recession which has gone on entirely too long. My friends on the Republican side say this is a Clinton recession. I am afraid the statute of limitations has run on that particular complaint.  At this point in time, 2.5 million jobs have been lost since President Bush took office. He is going to have to take ownership for this recession.  There are many factors which led to this recession. There is no doubt the economy heated up prior to his coming into office, and there was going to be a correction. There is no doubt as well that terrorism and 9/11 took its toll on the economy, and continue to, I might add.  There is also no doubt that the economic policy pursued by the Bush tax cut 2 years ago failed. It didn't work. We continue to lose jobs by the cut in interest rates to try to get the economy moving forward again. Frankly, we are in a terrible situation. We understand our economy needs a boost. Consumer confidence in America is at a 10-year low. It was reported yesterday that the Consumer Confidence Index plummeted from 4.6 to the revised 7.8, this the lowest reading since October of 1993.  Unemployment is on the rise. Since January 2000, the number of unemployed increased by nearly 40 percent with nearly 8.3 million Americans out of work, and 2.3 million private sector jobs lost.  Contrast that with the Clinton administration where 22 million jobs were created. In the Bush administration of 2 years and a few months, 10 percent of those jobs have been lost--a 2.3 million increase in the creation of jobs. What we have in the Bush administration is the elimination of jobs which were previously created by the Clinton administration.  Unemployment spells are lengthening because companies are not hiring. It isn't a problem of losing a job today and finding another one next month. The average number of weeks individuals spend unsuccessfully seeking work increased by a month over the past year. Approximately 20 percent of all the unemployed have been looking for work for more than 6 months. Wage growth is now stagnant. The shortage of jobs has slowed--I might add, as has the increase in the cost of health insurance, another issue which this administration summarily ignores.  Today, President Bush spoke to the Latino Coalition about small businesses and what we need to do to help small businesses. Instead of a tax plan that will help small businesses, let me suggest as follows. What the Bush tax plan offers to the wealthiest individuals in America is a three-layered cake. What the Bush tax plan offers to small business is crumbs; things that, frankly, are not controversial in terms of expensing. But the vast majority of the tax cut the President is pushing will not stimulate today's economy, but it will burrow us deep into a deficit which, frankly, is not fair. The fact is they are giving tax breaks to the wealthy people.  The President failed to mention what I would suggest would be the top one or two complaints of small businesses in America today. You pick them. Open the phone books and call a small business person and ask, What is your problem today? They will say the economy is not strong. People aren't buying. What about your expenses in business? What kind of problems do you face? I guarantee you the answer will be the cost of health insurance. And not a word, not one word from the Bush administration about how to deal with that.  I introduced a bill to give a tax credit to small businesses which would allow them to provide health insurance for their employees. It doesn't answer the problem. But at least it is sensitive to trying to help small employers employ their people as well as the owners of the business dealing with health insurance protection. That, to me, is a reasonable approach, and something that would help small businesses, which is summarily ignored by the Bush administration.  The track record we have now for job creation is the worst in 58 years. In order for the Bush administration to tie the Eisenhower administration for the worst job creation record ever, President Bush would have to create 96,000 jobs a month starting today to the end of his term. He is not going to get that done, I am afraid. I hope I am wrong. I hope the economy turns around.  But isn't it interesting, with the economy in a basket struggling to survive, that we can't even engage in a debate on the floor of the Senate about what steps we can take to get this economy back on track. I don't have to tell you about the crisis most States are facing when it comes to their budgets. Illinois will have about a $5 billion deficit which the Governor is going to have to wrestle with under extraordinary circumstances. He will have to cut spending, I am sure. There are some who will say he should raise taxes. Whatever he does will not help us move out after a recession. In fact, it puts a damper on economic growth at a time when we should be putting stimulus. So that situation is out there as well.  I might also add that the situation when it comes to homeland security is also a damper on the economy. So many business people across America are worried about their vulnerabilities when it comes to the economy. They hope this government, starting in Washington, will provide a helping hand. But it hasn't happened, because this administration has been strong on rhetoric and press conferences, but weak when it comes to providing the money so that State and local resources can be increased and enhanced.  Who are you going to call if there is a threat of terrorism in the community? Are you going to ask for a telephone number for 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue to try to get through to President Bush or Vice President Chaney? Not likely. You are likely to call 9-1-1 and a local policeman or firefighter is going to be the voice at the other end of the call. If they are not trained, if they are not equipped, frankly, homeland security is a farce.  We know what is going on in the Middle East today. Troops numbering 180,000 have been sent by our government--military personnel and support personnel--in preparation for the invasion of Iraq. It is clear that America is preparing to attack. But we know from the homeland security side that America is not prepared to defend. We are not prepared to defend the hometown families and neighborhoods and communities across America. This administration has not come up with the resources we need to make that happen.  At this point, I would like to introduce into the Record--it probably has been done before, but it certainly bears repeating--a letter sent to President Bush by my friend and colleague, and ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Appropriations, SenatorRobert C. Byrd of West Virginia. The letter is dated February 23, 2003. The reason I want to enter it at this point is that Senator Byrd goes through chapter and verse of the take by Democrats in Congress and Congress in general to persuade the Bush administration to put more money into homeland security. He spells out in graphic detail how this White House has stopped our efforts every step of the way. It is a sad reality that as we face terrorists at home we are not providing the resources that are necessary to the local first responders.  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                      U.S. Senate,                                  Committee on Appropriations,                                Washington, DC, February 25, 2003.     Hon. George W. Bush,     Office of the President, The White House,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. President: In your remarks to the National      Governors Association on February 24, 2003, you claimed that      Congress was to blame for a reduction in homeland security      funding in Fiscal Year 2003. Such a claim is wrong, and I      urge you to correct it.       If enacted, the Administration's Fiscal Year 2003 request      for first responders, for instance, would have eliminated      funding for the Justice Department's Office of Domestic      Preparedness; it would have eliminated funding for the      Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) hiring      initiative; it would have discarded the Edward Byrne Memorial      and the Local Law Enforcement Assistance Block grant      programs; and it would have provided absolutely no support      for the Assistance to Firefighters grant program.       A lack of Administration commitment to first responders is      just the beginning of the empty rhetoric coming from the      White House on homeland security funding.       Since September 11, 2001, you have signed, with great      fanfare, legislation to authorize improvements in airport,      seaport, and border security. Yet, your Administration has      opposed efforts to fund those bills. On December 10, 2002,      you announced a plan for state and local governments to      vaccinate 10 million first responders for a potential      smallpox attack. But your Administration has passed the      responsibility of paying for these vaccines to the state and      local governments.       Last August, you rejected $2.5 billion that Congress, in an      overwhelming bipartisan fashion, approved for homeland      security efforts. Congress had designated those funds as      emergency priorities in the Fiscal Year 2002 Supplemental      Appropriations bill. This package include funds to begin to      meet the billions of dollars of outstanding applications from      18,000 fire departments for equipment and training. The      legislation also included grant funding to make police and      fire equipment interoperable--a critical weakness in response      efforts on September 11, 2001. The homeland security package      contained critical funding for port security, for security      enhancements at small and medium airports, and for federal      law enforcement counterterrorism efforts. The legislation      included funding to strengthen security at nuclear plants      and laboratories and to protect the nation's food and      water supply.       Instead of embracing this package and agreeing with      Congress on its urgency, you called it wasteful. It only took      your signature to address these vulnerabilities, but you      refused and called the funding wasteful.       I must note that the Senate Appropriations Committee      approved that funding unanimously. In fact, the Committee      last July approved each of the 13 appropriations bills on a      unanimous, bipartisan basis. But your Administration objected      again and again to these bills despite the overwhelming needs      facing the nation.       This past January, during Senate consideration of the      Fiscal Year 2003 Omnibus Appropriations bill, I offered two      amendments, both aimed at increasing investments in homeland      security initiatives from coast to coast. The amendments      focused on funding authorization bills that you signed with      great fanfare. But again the Administration said the funds      were unnecessary and urged the Senate to reject these      amendments. The political strong-arm tactics worked, and the      amendments were rejected to partisan votes (roll call votes      #002 and #003).       Last spring, the Senate Appropriations Committee held five      days of hearings to examine homeland security priorities. The      Administration was represented by six Cabinet secretaries,      the Attorney General, and the Director of the Federal      Emergency Management Agency. They argued the case for      homeland security funding plan. However, every local      government representative and every representative of fire,      police, and emergency response agencies testified that the      Administration's funding plan was seriously flawed. They      testified that doing away with the funding programs which      have proved so valuable was shortsighted and irresponsible.       In your remarks to the governors, you characterized the      Congress's decision to use existing and effective programs to      deliver funding to our first responders as micromanagement.      Congress chose to fully fund your $3.5 billion first      responder request through existing, effective channels rather      than launch a new, untested program. This was a responsible      decision.       In the Fiscal Year 2003 appropriations legislation,      Congress chose to be responsible by listening to the men and      women on the front lines of homeland security. We heard their      needs and answered their calls for help. But, time and time      again, the Administration has turned its back to the nation's      first responders. Enough is enough.       I appreciate your desire to protect the nation from      terrorist attack, but the job cannot be accomplished with      continued political grandstanding. The country needs an      Administration that takes an honest approach to homeland      security instead of continually making empty promises to the      nation's police, fire, and emergency medical teams. The      American people want to know that if there is an attack close      to their homes, their local doctors and nurses have the      training to treat the injured. They want to know that their      local firemen have the ability and equipment to handle a      chemical or biological attack. They want to know that their      local police officers are trained in identifying and      responding to the variety of terrorist attacks that we now      could face.       The enemy is not Congress, Mr. President. The enemy is the      terrorist who stands ready to exploit the nation's many      security gaps. Especially now, when the terror alert is high      and war is looming at our doorstep, we must be acutely aware      of the sharply increased threat of attack here at home.      Instead of pointing fingers and assigning blame, I implore      you to expedite the release of the homeland security funds in      the Fiscal Year 2003 appropriations legislation and the funds      that still are unobligated from the Fiscal Year 2002      appropriations bills. The fact that these dollars, approved      by Congress in December 2001, sit idle is beyond      comprehension. I also hope that you consider expanding the      investment in homeland security in the upcoming supplemental      bill. As a nation, we know where our vulnerabilities lie, and      we can be sure that the terrorists do, as well. We should      take every step possible to protect the American people and      to provide critical funding for homeland security      initiatives.       As we move forward, I urge you to work with Congress in a      bipartisan fashion to provide homeland security funding will      make a significant investment in the protection of the      American people.           Sincerely yours,                                                   Robert C. Byrd.
