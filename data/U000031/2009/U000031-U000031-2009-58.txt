These outstanding women were on a mission all season long, and this was a team of firsts--last season they were the first in school history to win a regional championship, and in 2009, they completed the mission and cemented their legacy as the first state champions in women's athletics at Niles High School.  Winning a state title is something that will last forever. It is a truly remarkable accomplishment that few teams in southwest Michigan ever experience, and it is a legacy that will live with the 2009 Lady Vikings forever. While the Vikings were led by the best pitcher in the State of Michigan, Jenna Ignowski, they were a team that worked hard to improve every part of their game. These Lady Vikings improved their defense throughout the season and there were no easy outs up and down the Viking lineup.  It is an honor to pay tribute to the entire Lady Vikings team and head coach Gary Collins.  On behalf of all of the residents of southwest Michigan, congratulations again to the Lady Vikings, Coach Collins and the entire Niles community--you are an inspiration to us all.  It is Viking Pride at its finest. Go vikings?                          ____________________
