Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member for yielding me this time, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, the Republican budget before us fails the American people. It ignores the very real problems of working families. It will force deeper and deeper cuts to nearly every domestic program that supports our citizens and our way of life.  This Republican budget fails to create jobs. It shortchanges education. It robs Social Security. It cheats seniors out of secure, affordable health benefits at a time in their lives when they need it most. It fails to provide adequate health benefits for the wounded and disabled veterans who have fought so hard to protect our freedom.  This budget is without compassion. In my estimation, this budget is cruel and inhumane. It fails to meet the basic human needs of our citizens. It would slash nearly every domestic program in order to cut the taxes of a few wealthy Americans.  Mr. Chairman, this budget would dig our economy into a deeper, ever-expanding hole that our children and our children's children will have to work long and hard to pay for. This is not fair, it is not right, and it is not just.  As a Nation and as a people, we could do much better. We should be using our wealth to benefit the whole Nation, all of our citizens, all of the people, not just a few.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
