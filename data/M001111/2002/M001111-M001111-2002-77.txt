 President, as chairman of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, I rise to express my regret that the subcommittee will soon be losing one of the most treasured members of its staff. Wally Burnett, our minority clerk, will be moving on to other opportunities at the end of this week. I know that I speak for all members of the subcommittee in wishing him well and thanking him for his fine service.  Wally Burnett brought a wealth of experience to the subcommittee staff given his prior experience as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Budget and Programs at the Department of Transportation during the administration of President George H. Bush. More importantly, Wally brought to his position a strong sense of fairness, decency, and a desire to do the right thing. This trait could be seen across all of the Transportation bills that Chairman Stevens and Chairman Shelby ushered through the Senate.  While Wally always demonstrated a strong sense of duty to the entire Nation, Wally never forgot that he is an Alaskan. And while Wally could not always be depended upon to wear a jacket to subcommittee and full committee meetings, he could be depended upon to provide his most expert views in an informed and balanced manner. I will always be grateful for the many courtesies that Wally demonstrated toward me, whether I was serving as a junior minority member of the subcommittee or as subcommittee chairman.  As Wally leaves his position in the Senate, I wish him the best of luck in his new endeavor. I also express my hope that his tirelessly patient wife, Kristin, and his children, Tucker and Mattern, will finally see more of him.                          ____________________
