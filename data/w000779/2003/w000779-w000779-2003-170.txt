President, I want to be very brief. In fact, we are going to get an agreement with the Senator from New Mexico to work out the process for considering nuclear subsidies.  I just want to make sure Senators are clear with respect to what the subsidy is all about. The Senator from New Mexico, the distinguished chairman of the committee, said wind is going to get vast amounts of subsidies. I wanted to point out to the chairman that if wind farms produce power, they get a tax credit for the energy they produce. But wind farms do not get any subsidy to build a facility.  What is unique about the $16 billion exposure for taxpayers is only one energy source, under this legislation, gets a subsidy to build a facility. That has troubled the National Taxpayers Union. That is why they have been a strong supporter of the Wyden-Sununu amendment. This is not going to be about whether you are pro-nuclear or anti-nuclear. This is about whether Senators want to put at risk the taxpayers of the country for the prospect that the Congressional Budget Office has said has a 50-percent or higher failure with respect to constructing these facilities.  We will have more to say about the bipartisan Wyden-Sununu amendment before long, but I wrap up this part of the discussion by simply saying, again, I hope Senators will look at what the Congressional Budget Office and the Congressional Research Service have had to say about that. Those are reports that lay out, in a frank and objective way, what the risk is for taxpayers. I hope Senators will review it carefully.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
