 President, we have had this debate many times. What is new is that the filibuster is being used to defeat judicial nominations for the first time in history. Cloture has been used occasionally for the purpose of advancing a nomination, not for defeating it. We do have two nominees who were found unanimously well qualified by the ABA and they are, in effect, being denied an up-or-down vote. If that is what is different, then that is what is producing alarm on our side of the aisle. Of course, we have had that debate many times. Tonight is probably not the time to have it again.
