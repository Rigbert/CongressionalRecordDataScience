 Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman from Arizona [Mr. Kolbe] and the gentleman from Maryland [Mr. Hoyer]. Indentured child labor is one of the ugliest forms of slavery that exists in this world. This Congress should stand up for those children. We should not be importing products made by indentured child labor, and I thank both parties for their support.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Vermont [Mr. Sanders].  The amendment was agreed to.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. Are there further amendments to the bill?  If not, the Clerk will read the last two lines.  The Clerk read as follows:       This Act may be cited as the ``Treasury, Postal Service,      and General Government Appropriations Act, 1998''.
