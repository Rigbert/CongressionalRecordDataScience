 The purpose of the Father of the Year Awards is to honor fathers who have remained a positive role model for their children while also making a positive difference in their community.  Ramon Alvarez is one of those fathers. He is married to his wife Araceli and together they have three children. He is also President of Alvarez Lincoln-Mercury and Alvarez Jaguar, and throughout his successful career, Ramon has made a strong commitment to local and civic activities.  I am proud to call Ramon a fellow community member and American. And today, I add my voice to the many who will be congratulating him on this well-deserved recognition.                          ____________________
