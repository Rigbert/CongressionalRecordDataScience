 President, I think three times during the debate on this bill I have been trying to make the point that bringing this bill to the floor usurped the consideration of the Senate Finance Committee of two provisions that are in the bill and another provision that ought to be in the bill that is not in the bill. My amendment today deals with striking sections 502 and 503. It is another way of my saying, as I tried to in an amendment 2 days ago on this legislation, to the Finance Committee, that people writing this legislation ought to keep their hands off subject matter that comes within the jurisdiction of the Senate Finance Committee. If people are writing a piece of legislation that comes out of Health, Education, Labor, they ought to find sources of revenue out of programs within their own jurisdiction to fund bills that they think up, rather than robbing another committee. That is basically what has happened.  I am opposed to both provisions on jurisdictional grounds because they are within the control of the Finance Committee, not the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. But I also want to make it very clear it is not just jurisdictional, I also have concerns about what it does to policy, dealing with customs on the one hand and Medicare on the other hand. I want to review each of these in turn.  Section 502 of the bill extends the customs user fees from the year 2003 to 2011. This generates $7 billion over 8 years of the total revenue that it takes to fund this piece of legislation.  When Congress authorized these customs user fees, the avowed purpose was to underwrite the costs of customs commercial operations. But today in this bill, the fees are not being used for customs. They are being used to offset the cost of the Patients' Bill of Rights to the tune of $7 billion. I think this is unacceptable and violates the comity that one committee ought to have towards the other.  It also is unacceptable because when you have constituents who pay customs user fees for the purpose of having an efficient and effective operation of the Customs Service, so you can enter this country in an expeditious way, for those fees not to be used for what they were intended--for expedited entry to the country, to police illegal entry to the country, to police illegal drugs coming into the country, generally to make the customs agency's personnel more efficient and better able to do their job so the United States can be a sovereign nation protecting its borders the way it should--if these fees are extended, and I want to emphasize the word ``if,'' they should be extended in a thoughtful way, not as some budget trick to make the costs of this bill fit within the confines of the Federal budget.  I am not the only one who thinks so. I have received numerous letters from companies, from associations that are very concerned about this--Liz Claiborne, Inc., the National Association of Foreign Trade Zones, the Joint Industry Group, the National Retail Federation, the American Electronics Association, and also a memo from the U.S. Customs Service. They are all raising concerns because these are folks who pay this customs user fee, a fee that is meant to pay for bringing things into the country. They believe since the Customs Service is so outdated, so slow moving, not working in an expeditious way, this revenue ought to be used for the improvements in the customs operation that were anticipated when these fees were put in place. I ask unanimous consent these letters and memos be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                           Liz Claiborne Inc.,                                  North Bergen, NJ, June 20, 2001.     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Grassley. We write in opposition to a      provision in the Patients' Bill of Rights (S. 1052) that      would extend the merchandise processing fee, or ``mpf,'' for      eight additional years. This is a trade-related measure, a      user fee levied against importers like ourselves, that has no      place in this legislation. We ask you to support efforts to      delete the provision entirely.       First by way of background, the merchandise processing fee      is an ad valorem fee levied against each import transaction,      or ``entry.'' When it was passed 15 years ago, it was done so      with the avowed purpose of underwriting the costs of      commercial operations at the US Customs Service. In fact,      however, it has never been used for that purpose. Instead,      proceeds have been diverted to the general fund and act as a      revenue source to balance the costs of other governmental      programs. As of FY2001, the trade community has paid nearly      $7.2 billion for merchandise processing, an amount far      exceeding Customs' commercial operations budget.       In truth, the fee is really a tax on US imports and, from      the beginning, we have objected strongly. It has been illegal      under GATT and then World Trade Organization (WTO) rules,      although the federal government has indulged in the fiction      that it is a ``user fee.'' Now, under the terms of S. 1052,      all pretense has been dropped and it is being offered as an      offset to the costs of the Patients' Bill of Rights.       The fee is indeed due for renewal by 2003 and it is the      trade communities' intention to seek its termination. While,      before, the nation was experiencing a serious deficit, the      reasons for its passage have since disappeared. Now, it is      simply a tax on American citizens who buy imported products,      whose price is inflated by the mpf. It is unconscionable to      continue to tax Americans in this manner and we intend to      seek repeal in the appropriate committee jurisdiction.       In the meantime, however, we ask that you assist us in      removing the mpf funding from the Patients' Bill of Rights.      The merchandise processing fee has no place in this debate.      The fee will not be viewed on the merits in these      proceedings, but is instead being used--cynically--as a      ``pay-for'' a totally unrelated program.           Sincerely,                                                  Frank Kelly,                               Vice President, International Trade     Compliance and Government Affairs.                                  ____                                              National Association                                       of Foreign-Trade Zones,                                    Washington, DC, June 15, 2001.     Hon. Charles Grassley,     Hart Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Grassley. The National Association of Foreign-     Trade Zones (NAFTZ) has learned that S. 872, Sec. 602 the      ``Bipartisan Patient Protection Act'' provides for the      extension of the Merchandise Processing Fee (MPF) through      2011. Congress established the fee to offset the cost of the      commercial operations of the U.S. Customs Service. Not only      does the proposed legislation continue the practice of      allocating the MPF to the general fund of the U.S. Treasury      with no relationship to the purpose of the fee, it completely      eliminates the relationship of the fee to the Customs      Service. We have serious reservations as to whether this is      permissible through the General Agreement on Tariffs and      Trade, and the World Trade Organization.       The NAFTZ is not opposed to the imposition of a fee for      services rendered. We do believe, however, that any such fee      must correlate to a discernible cost associated with the      service provided. We are concerned that at a time when      Congress is struggling to find the necessary funding to cover      the cost of the modernization of the Service, that funds      already designated by Congress for that purpose are being      diverted.       Since the purpose of the MPF, as established by Congress,      is to fund the commercial operations of the U.S. Customs      Service, we are strongly opposed to any extension of the MPF      without designating the revenue to that intended purpose and      we respectfully request that you drop the merchandise      processing fee extension from S. 872.       Thank you for your attention and consideration of our      views. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact      me.           Sincerely,                                                Randy P. Campbell,     Executive Director.                                  ____                                         Joint Industry Group,                                    June 20, 2001, Washington, DC.     Hon. John McCain,     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McCain. The Joint Industry Group (JIG)      expresses its opposition to a provision in the Bipartisan      Patient Protection Act (S. 1052) that would automatically      extend the U.S. Customs user fee from 2003 to 2011 (Sec.      502). This 8-year extension would remove any near-term      opportunity to debate whether the fee should be continued or     whether an extension could be earmarked specifically for      modernizing U.S. Customs operations.       JIG is a coalition of more than 160 companies, trade      associations, professionals and businesses actively involved      in international trade. We both examine and reflect the      concerns of the business community relative to current and      proposed international trade-related policies, actions,      legislation, and regulations. We undertake to improve      policies and procedures through dialogue with government      agencies and the Congress. The Joint Industry Group      represents over $350 billion in trade.       JIG members account for millions of dollars paid yearly in      merchandise processing fees (MPF). Every year, Customs      collects over $1 billion from companies importing goods into      the United States. Additionally, companies are burdened by      administrative costs associated with the fee, since Customs      imposes complex reporting and accounting requirements on      companies in the course of collecting fee payments. All this      is occurring at a time when tariffs on products are declining      and approaching zero.       If the Customs Service is to continue collecting this user      fee it MUST directly fund improvements to Customs processing,      specifically the Automated Commercial Environment (ACE) and      other U.S. Customs initiatives that are greatly needed to      improve the trade process. Improving Customs' ability to      handle trade will become more critical as the amount of      commerce entering the United States is expected to continue      its double-digit rate of growth. While Section 502 of S. 1052      does not earmark user fees for health care purposes, it does      use the fee as de facto justification for the revenue      neutrality of the bill. JIG is greatly concerned that this      approach will prevent user fees from being applied to the      commercial operations of the U.S. Customs Service for which      they are intended.       Use of the fee to offset the revenue impact of S. 1052      could also increase potential for a WTO dispute. In the late      1980's, a GATT panel found that the user fee was GATT-illegal      because it was being collected in amounts exceeding the cost      of Customs processing. While the U.S. addressed that problem      by placing certain caps on the fee, it was clear from the      panel finding that linkage of the fee to the cost of Customs      commercial operations is of seminal importance to the      question of GATT legality. If our trading partners believe      Customs user fees are being used to fund health-care related      goals, another GATT challenge is virtually certain to surface      in the WTO.       For the reasons cited above, JIG would have no choice but      to support such a challenge. It is clear that the proposed      action in S. 1052 violates the WTO provisions to which the      United States is a signatory.       We therefore urge that the user fee extender be removed      from S. 1052. We need the opportunity to debate the merits of      this fee when it comes up for renewal in 2003. If you have      any questions about our views on this issue or wish to      discuss the matter further, please contact Alan Atkinson at      (202) 466-5490. Thank you for your consideration.           Sincerely,                                                    Ronald Schoof,     Chairman, Joint Industry Group.                                  ____                                       National Retail Federation,                                                Liberty Place,                                    Washington, DC, June 25, 2001.     Hon. Chuck Grassley,     Ranking Member, U.S. Senate Committee on Finance, Dirksen          Bldg., Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Grassley. The National Retail Federation (NRF)      was surprised to learn that section 502 of the Bipartisan      Patient Protection Act (S. 1052) contains an eight-year      extension of the Customs Merchandise Processing Fee (MPF).      The MPF is an administrative fee leveled on imports into the      United States, through which U.S. retailers and other      importers pay hundreds of millions of dollars every year.       NRF and the U.S. retail industry object most strongly to      inclusion of this provision and, for the following reasons,      we urge that the provision is stricken from the bill.       The Senate Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over      the MPF and other customs issues, was not consulted about      this provision in S. 1052 and, has had no opportunity to      consider the merits of extending the fee as currently      structured.       The MPF was created to offset the administrative costs of      the U.S. Customs Services' commercial operations, and any      attempt to use it for other purposes, as this bill would do,      is against the rules of the World Trade Organization.       The Finance and Ways and Means Committees have been working      for some time with Customs and the importing community on      renewing the MPF in a way that would ensure it be used for      its proper and intended function--for commercial operations,      including customs modernization funding.       It is unacceptable that extension of the MPF has been      slipped into a health bill without the approval of the      Committee of jurisdiction or the knowledge of those in the      private sector that will be most directly affected as a      result. At the same time, we are struggling to provide      Customs Service with sufficient funds for a new computer      system to allow Customs to modernize its operations and      protect our nation's borders. If this provision in S. 1052 is      allowed to stay, it will be impossible for the Senate Finance      Committee to restructure the MPF program in the way it was      intended--to finance the costs of Customs' operations.      Accordingly, we ask for your help in insisting on the removal      of this provision when S. 1052 comes to the full Senate for      consideration.       The National Retail Federation (NRF) is the world's largest      retail trade association with membership that comprises all      retail formats and channels of distribution including      department, specialty, discount, catalog, Internet and      independent stores. NRF members represent an industry that      encompasses more than 1.4 million U.S. retail establishments,      employs more than 20 million people--about 1 in 5 American      workers--and registered 2000 sales of $3.1 trillion. NRF's      international members operate stores in more than 50 nations.      In its role as the retail industry's umbrella group, NRF also      represents 32 national and 50 state associations in the U.S.      as well as 36 international associations representing      retailers abroad.           Sincerely,                                                    Steve Pfister,     Senior Vice President, Government Relations.                                  ____                                                          AeA,                                    Washington, DC, June 25, 2001.     Hon. Chuck Grassley,     Hart Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Grassley. AeA, the nation's largest high-tech      trade association, is opposed to the provision (section 502)      in the Bipartisan Patient Protection Act (S. 1052) that would      extend the application of the U.S. Customs user fee from      September 30, 2003, to September 30, 2011.       The U.S. importing community currently has full expectation      that this import tax will expire as scheduled in 2003. As the      leading U.S. importing sector, the U.S. high-tech sector      would be particularly impacted by such a tax increase. Our      member companies already pay tens of millions of dollars      annually in customs user fees. In addition, there are      additional administrative costs associated with the fee,      since customs authorities impose complex reporting and      accounting requirements on importers in the course of      collecting the user fee payments. An unexpected, eight-year      extension of the user fee, with its associated administrative      costs, would be an unwelcome and unnecessary additional cost      burden on our industry.       While section 502 of S. 1052 does not earmark user fees for      health care purposes, it does use the fee as de facto      justification for the revenue neutrality of the bill. We      believe this provision introduces the potential that the U.S.      Customs user fee will again be found contrary to U.S.      international obligations under the WTO. In the late 1980's,      a GATT panel found that the user fee was GATT-illegal because      it was being collected in amounts exceeding the cost of      customs services rendered. While the United States addressed      that problem by placing certain caps on the fee, it was clear      from the panel finding that linkage of the fee to the cost of      customs commercial operations is of seminal importance to the      question of GATT legality. If our trading partners believe      customs user fees are being used to achieve health-care      related goals, another GATT challenge could well surface in      the WTO.       For the reasons stated, AeA urges you to remove the customs      user fee extender from S. 1052. This Patient Protection Act      is an inappropriate forum for any consideration of extending      the custom user fee. If you have any questions about our      views on this issue or wish to discuss the matter further,      please contact me at 202-682-4423.           Sincerely,                                                      Tim Bennett,     AeA Senior Vice President International.                                  ____ [From the Executive Office of the President, Office of Management and                          Budget, June 21, 2001]                   Statement of Administration Policy    (This statement has been coordinated by OMB with the concerned                                agencies.)       S. 1052--Bipartisan Patient Protection Act. (Sens. McCain      (R) AZ, Kennedy (D) MA, Edwards (D) NC) The President      strongly supports passage of a patients' bill of rights this      year and has been working with members of both parties since      the first week of the Administration to forge a compromise.      Congress has been divided on this issue for far too long at      the expense of patients and their families. The President      strongly urges Congress to pass a strong patients' bill of      rights this year that provides meaningful protections for      patients, not a windfall for trial lawyers or a threat to      Americans' ability to obtain and afford quality health care.      On February 7, 2001, the President transmitted to Congress      his principles for a bipartisan patients' bill of rights and      urged Congress to move quickly on this important issue.       The President's principles called for passage of a      patients' bill of rights that ensures all Americans enjoy      strong patient protections, including: access to emergency      room and specialty care; direct access to obstetricians,      gynecologists, and pediatricians; access to needed      prescription drugs and approved clinical trials; access to      health plan information; a prohibition of ``gag clauses'';      consumer choice provisions; and continuity of care      protections. The President also recognizes, however, that      many States have passed strong patient protection laws      already, some of which have been in force for over a decade.      To the extent possible, a Federal patients' bill of rights      should give deference to these effective State laws.       The President's principles emphasized the importance of      providing patients who have     been denied medical care with the right to a fair, prompt,      and independent medical review, which will ensure that      disputes are resolved quickly and inexpensively and that      patients receive the quality care they deserve.       The President stated that only after this independent      review decision is rendered should we resort to the costlier,      time-consuming remedy of litigation in Federal courts to      ensure that health plans are held liable for wrongful      decisions.       The President's principles also reminded Congress of the      necessity of avoiding unnecessary and frivolous lawsuits,      which will only serve to drive up costs and leave more      individuals without insurance coverage. S. 1052 will      significantly increase health insurance premiums and the      number of uninsured. According to the Congressional Budget      Office, health insurance premiums under S. 1052 as originally      drafted would increase by over 4 percent. If the effects of      litigation risk on the practice of medicine and of the      reduced ability of health plans to negotiate lower rates were      included, CBO's estimated cost impact could be much higher,      by 4-5 percent or more. This is in addition to the estimated      10-12 percent premium increases employers are already facing      in 2001. Further, leading economists have predicted that      employers drop coverage for appropriately 500,000 individuals      when health care premiums increase by 1 percent. According to      these estimates, S. 1052 could cause at least 4-6 million      Americans to lose health coverage provided by their      employers.       The President is encouraged by efforts in the Senate, like      those of Senators Frist, Breaux, and Jeffords, to develop a      common sense compromise that forges a middle ground on this      issue and meets the President's principles.       While the President strongly supports a comprehensive and      enforceable patients' bill of rights and has been working      with members of both parties to enact legislation this year,      he believes that S. 1052 would encourage costly and      unnecessary litigation that would seriously jeopardize the      ability of many Americans to afford health care coverage.       The President objects to the liability provisions of S.      1052. The President will veto the bill unless significant      changes are made to address his major concerns. In      particular, the serious flaws in S. 1052 include:       --S. 1052 circumvents the independent medical review      process in favor of litigation. The President believes that      patients should be given care first--litigation should be the      last resort. Patients should exhaust the medical review      process first, allowing doctors, not trial lawyers, to make      decisions about medical care.       --S. 1052 jeopardizes health care coverage for workers and      their families by failing to avoid costly litigation. S. 1052      overturns more than 25 years of Federal law that provides      uniformity and certainty for employers who voluntarily offer      health care benefits for millions of Americans across the      country. The liability provisions of S. 1052 would, for the      first time, expose employers and unions to at least 50      different, inconsistent State-law standards. The result will      inevitably be that employers and unions will be forced to pay      for different benefits from State to State, even within a      particular State, based on varying precedents set in State      courts and leading to inconsistent standards of care for      patients. Further, S. 1052 imposes no limitations on State      court damages, and it is not clear whether existing State-law      caps would apply to the broad, new causes of action in State      courts that S. 1052 creates.       S. 1052 also would allow causes of action in Federal court      for a violation of any duty under the plan, creating open-     ended and unpredictable lawsuits against employers for      administrative errors. These new federal claims do not have      any limitations on the amount of noneconomic damages,      creating virtually unrestrained damage awards that are      limited only by an excessive $5 million cap on punitive      damages.       Moreover, S. 1052 would subject employers and unions to      frequent litigation in State and Federal court under a vague      ``direct participation'' standard, which would require      employers and unions to defend themselves in court in      virtually every case against allegations that they ``directly      participated'' in a denial of benefits decision. Because such      determinations are inherently fact-specific, any such      allegation will force a costly and time-consuming court      process and result in varying State interpretations of      ``direct participation,'' forcing employers to adhere to      different standards in every State.       --S. 1052 fails to provide a fair and comprehensive remedy      to all patients. The President believes the new Federal law      should establish a comprehensive set of rights and remedies      for patients. S. 1052 instead encourages costly litigation by      providing no effective limitations on frivolous class action      suits and allows trial lawyers to go on fishing expeditions      to seek remedies under other Federal statutes.       --S. 1052 subjects physicians and all health care      professionals to greater liability risk. S. 1052 would expand      liability for physicians and all health care professionals in      State courts well beyond traditional medical malpractice by      permitting new, undefined causes of action in State courts      for denials of medical benefits. This expanded litigation      against physicians and all health professionals will create      an opportunity to circumvent State medical malpractice caps      that may not apply to these new causes of action.       --Extraneous User Fee Provision. The Administration objects      to inclusion in S. 1052 to an extraneous revenue-raising      provision (section 502), which extends for multiple years      Customs charges on transportation, passengers, and      merchandise arriving in the country.                         Pay-As-You-Go Scoring       S. 1052 would affect direct spending; therefore, it is      subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus      Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's preliminary scoring      estimate of the bill is under development.                                  ____                                         U.S. Customs Service,                                    Washington, DC, June 20, 2001.     Memorandum for James F. Sloan, Acting Under Secretary        (Enforcement).     From: Acting Commissioner     Subject: Pay-go Offset for the Patient Bill of Rights       Congress will soon consider passage of the Patient Bill of      Rights. The Customs Service offers no opinion of the      legislation. However, we have concerns with the bill's      potential impact on future Customs appropriations. Section      502 of the bill would extend our collection of COBRA fees      from 2003 to 2011, but would use the revenue to offset the      cost of implementing this new legislation. Although we      support extending the collection of COBRA fees, any scoring      of the COBRA extension which would limit, in any way, the      ability to fund or offset Customs activities would likely      cause a critical funding shortfall for the Customs Service.       Section 502 of the bill states: Section 13031(j)(3) of the      Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (19      U.S.C. 58c(j)(3)) is amended by striking ``2003 and inserting      2011, except that the fees may not be charged under      paragraphs (9) and (10) of such subsection after March 31,      2006''.       The COBRA fees collected by Customs are used both to      reimburse Customs appropriation for certain costs, such as      overtime compensation, and to offset a portion of the Customs      Service Salaries and Expenses Appropriation (S). As an      example, our FY 2001 collections will offset approximately $1      billion or almost 50 percent of Customs appropriation this      year. Authorizing a COBRA extension to offset costs for      something other than the Customs Service could negatively      impact our available funding. Additionally, the Merchandise      Processing Fee authorized in the COBRA is a fee that is paid      by importers for the processing of merchandise by the Customs      Service. Directing the funds collected from this fee for      something other than Customs operations could pose GATT      interpretation issues.       While Customs supports the extension of the COBRA fees, we      also acknowledge that changes are warranted with the manner      in which we collect those fees. We intend to review this      issue in the near term.
