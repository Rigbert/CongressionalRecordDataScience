 President, the amendment that the Senator from [[Page S7771]] Georgia [Senator Nunn], and I have proposed would create a narrow exception to the Posse Comitatus Act in order to permit the use of the military to assist law enforcement in emergency situations involving chemical and biological weapons.  Before describing the amendment in detail, let me briefly review the origins of the Posse Comitatus Act and the existing exceptions to it.  The term ``posse comitatus'' means literally the ``power of the county.''  Its roots trace back to English common law, where the sheriff, obligated to defend the county against any of the king's enemies, was empowered to summon every person above 15 years old for this purpose.  The first Congress provided similar power to Federal marshals in 1789--authorizing the marshals to command all necessary assistance in the execution of their duty.  Three years later, Congress explicitly authorized marshals to use the militia in assisting their posse.  In the first half of the nineteenth century, the practice of using both the militia and regular military to assist law enforcement became commonplace--  Although whenever military personnel were called into service as a part of a posse, they were subordinated to civilian authority.  Following the Civil War, Federal troops were often used extensively in the South, as well as to quell labor unrest in the North.  Dissatisfaction with this practice led to pressure from Congress for explicit restrictions on the use of the military in law enforcement operations.  The result was the Posse Comitatus Act, enacted in 1878.  The Act is brief and straightforward:       Whoever, except in cases and under circumstances expressly      authorized by the constitution or act of Congress, willfully      uses any part of the army or the air force as a Posse      Comitatus or otherwise to execute the laws shall be fined not      more than $250,000 or imprisoned not more than two years, or      both.  Over the past century, Congress has enacted numerous exceptions to this general principle.  Many of these exceptions are for emergency circumstances, or where the need for use of the military is obvious.  For example, the law permits use of the military: to suppress insurrections; to protect foreign officials and official guests; to enforce the neutrality laws and customs laws; and to assist in investigations of murderers of Members of Congress or the Cabinet.  Congress has also provided some less compelling exceptions to the Posse Comitatus Act.  For instance, the President is empowered to use the military: to protect certain Federal parks and timber on Federal lands in Florida; to assist States in enforcing quarantines and health laws; and to remove any unlawful inclosures on public lands.  Most relevant to our present inquiry is an exception which permits the use of the military to assist law enforcement in countering the illegal possession or use of nuclear materials.  This provision, enacted in 1982, gives the military broad authority to assist in the enforcement of the law. The provision explicitly provides that the armed forces may be used to arrest persons and conduct searches and seizures.  The military has unique expertise concerning nuclear materials, which in my view justifies an exception.  Should this Nation ever be faced with terrorists armed with nuclear materials--of whatever grade--I believe the Department of Justice and FBI should be able to draw on this expertise.  I hold a similar view of the President's request for analogous authority with regard to chemical and biological weapons.  The military's expertise with chemical and biological weapons give it special knowledge which would be impractical and expensive to duplicate in civilian law enforcement.  The provision we have introduced is not--is not--the proposal sent to us by the administration.  Both Senator Nunn and I believed that, as drafted, the administration bill would have presented many practical problems.  Instead, we have drafted a new version which does the following:                      Description of the amendment       It permits the use of the military to assist law      enforcement to respond to emergency situations involving      biological or chemical weapons.       This assistance can only be provided if certain conditions      are met: (1) civilian expertise is not readily available; (2)      defense department assistance is needed; and      (3) enforcement of the law would be seriously impaired if      the Department of Defense assistance were not provided.  Finally, the amendment requires the Attorney General and the Secretary of Defense to joint issue regulations concerning the types of assistance that may be provided.  The provision permits the regulations to authorize arrest or search and seizure only in instances for the immediate protection of human life.  We share the concern of many of our colleagues about using the military to enforce the law.  And we do not want the military to have carte blanche to arrest suspects or engage in search or seizure.  But once called in to assist law enforcement, we do not want to create the ludicrous circumstance where a soldier called in to assist law enforcement stands immobile where his safety--or the safety of others--is at risk.  Mr. President, the issue comes down to this: Do we want to authorize the limited use of the military to combat chemical and biological weapons terrorism, or do we want to spend scarce resources to duplicate this capability in law enforcement?  Mr. President, I am under the impression that our distinguished Republican colleague is likely to accept this amendment. I hope that is the case.
