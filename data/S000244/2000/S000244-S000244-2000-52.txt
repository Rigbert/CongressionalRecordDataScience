Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2572) to direct the Administrator of NASA to design and present an award to the Apollo astronauts.  The Clerk read as follows:                               H.R. 2572       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Apollo Exploration Award Act      of 1999''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) On July 20, 1969, Neil A. Armstrong and Edwin E.      ``Buzz'' Aldrin Jr., became the first humans to set foot on      another celestial body, during the Apollo 11 mission,      accompanied in lunar orbit by Michael Collins.       (2) Between 1969 and 1972, ten other Americans courageously      completed the first human exploration of the lunar surface,      accompanied by five command module pilots:       (A) Apollo 12--Charles J. ``Pete'' Conrad Jr., Alan L.      Bean, and Richard F. Gordon Jr.       (B) Apollo 14--Alan B. Shepard Jr., Edgar D. Mitchell, and      Stuart A. Roosa.       (C) Apollo 15--David R. Scott, James B. Irwin, and Alfred      M. Worden.       (D) Apollo 16--John W. Young, Charles M. Duke Jr., and      Thomas K. Mattingly II.       (E) Apollo 17--Eugene A. Cernan, Ronald E. Evans, and      Harrison H. Schmitt.       (3) In April 1970, James A. Lovell Jr., John L. Swigert      Jr., and Fred W. Haise Jr., valiantly made a safe return from      the Moon on the Apollo 13 mission, after their command module      was disabled by an explosion.       (4) The enormous successes of the Apollo lunar landing      missions were only possible due to the pioneering work of the      previous Apollo missions, which performed critical testing of      the spacecraft and methods, and conducted the first human      travel to the Moon:       (A) Apollo 7--Walter M. Schirra Jr., Donn F. Eisele, and R.      Walter Cunningham.       (B) Apollo 8--Frank Borman, James A. Lovell Jr., and      William A. Anders.       (C) Apollo 9--James A. McDivitt, David R. Scott, and      Russell L. Schweickart.       (D) Apollo 10--Thomas P. Stafford, John W. Young, and      Eugene A. Cernan.       (5) In January 1967, astronauts Virgil I. Grissom, Edward      H. White, and Roger B. Chaffee lost their lives in a tragic      fire in the command module while testing the spacecraft which      would have carried them on the first manned Apollo mission.       (6) Since the time of the Apollo program, the program's      astronauts have promoted space exploration and human endeavor      by sharing their experiences with the American people and the      world, stimulating the imagination and the belief that any      goal can be achieved.       (7) Sadly, astronauts John L. Swigert Jr., Donn F. Eisele,      Ronald E. Evans, James B. Irwin, Stuart A. Roosa, Alan B.      Shepard Jr., and Charles J. ``Pete'' Conrad Jr., have died      since completing their missions.     SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.       It is the sense of Congress that the American people should      provide a fitting and tangible tribute to each of the      astronauts of the Apollo program, to recognize and      commemorate their bravery, substantial scientific and      technical accomplishments, and unique contributions to      American and world history.
