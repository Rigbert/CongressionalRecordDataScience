 President, I appreciate that. I know the majority leader's thinking at the moment is that Monday would be a workday. We have a lot of work to do if we plan to finish up this session, certainly before Thanksgiving, if not sooner, which I think would be the preference of most of the Members. I think it is his current intention, which I am sure he will address in the next few days, that the Monday before Veterans Day, which falls on a Tuesday, would be a workday.
