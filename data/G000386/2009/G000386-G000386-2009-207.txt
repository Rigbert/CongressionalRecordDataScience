 1294, I would like to raise a concern I have with a provision related to the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995, CAA. As the author of the Congressional Accountability Act, I have long believed that Congress needs to practice what it preaches by applying certain laws Congress passes to the legislative branch. The CAA did this by incorporating a number of laws including the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. Senator Murkowski, the distinguished ranking member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on the Legislative Branch, is here and I would like to ask about the provision in the bill related to the CAA.  I am concerned that the provision striking a section of the CAA related to the compliance date for OSHA violations may go further than necessary. As the author of the CAA, this provision was included to ensure that OSHA violations that are found in legislative branch buildings are remedied in a timely fashion. I understand that some concerns have arisen regarding the requirement that compliance occur by the next fiscal year, which prompted this revision, is that correct?
