 But the Wall Street Journal told a much different story. It highlighted tactics used by the big oil companies to block alternative fuel. The obstacles included contracts restricting the purchase by the station owners of alternative fuel. They also required the installation of completely separate pumps, sometimes far away from the main canopy, and in many cases station owners are prohibited from advertising the product or even posting the price of that fuel, E85. British Petroleum goes so far as to prohibit station owners from placing signs that include E85 on gasoline dispensers, perimeter signs, or light poles. These tactics don't sound consistent with a company--meaning British Petroleum--with a marketing slogan ``beyond petroleum.''  The big oil companies on many occasions cited ``customer confusion'' as the rationale for their policies or that they don't want to ``deceive their customers'' about the product. I happen to believe that it has more to do with limiting the availability of a product that they don't control and the sale of alternative fuels much more than it is customer deception.  After I read the Wall Street Journal article, which is so contrary to what I remember them telling me 1 year, 13 months before, I wrote letters to the CEOs who testified. Their picture is here. I pointed out the contradictions in their testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the allegations that were made in the Wall Street Journal.  I wish to refer to these letters so my colleagues will know what I asked them based on this article.  I have a letter to Mr. Rex Tillerson of ExxonMobil. I am not going to read the whole letter, but I am going to read what I am after here:       In fact, Exxon Mobil's standard contract bars Exxon      stations from buying fuel from anybody but Exxon--a fact you      chose not to disclose to our committee. It also appears that      even in cases where exceptions are made, Exxon requires those      station owners to install entirely separate dispensers. . . .  I refer to a letter I sent to Mr. Robert Malone, chairman of British Petroleum:       The Wall Street Journal article indicated that BP prohibits      branded stations from including E-85 on gasoline dispensers,      perimeter signs or light poles. Another obstacle employed by      your company is the prohibition of using pay-at-the-pump      credit card machines for E-85 purchases. . . .  That seems to be very contrary to what they told us, that they were allowing the sale of E85 at their stations.  Mr. James J. Mulva, ConocoPhillips:       The Wall Street Journal article indicated that Conoco      Phillips does not allow E-85 sales on primary islands under      the canopy. This policy directly contradicts the statement to      which you associated yourself during the March 2006 hearings.  And lastly, Mr. David J. O'Reilly, Chevron:        . . . Chevron's agreement with franchisees discourages      selling E-85 under the main canopy and includes policies that      are claimed to prevent franchisees from deceiving customers      as to the source of the product. The Wall Street Journal      article indicated that Chevron recommends that E-85 pumps be      outside the canopy and that Chevron prohibits branded      stations from including E85 on signs listing fuel prices.  I ask unanimous consent that these letters to ExxonMobil, British Petroleum, ConocoPhillips, and Chevron be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                                      Washington, DC, May 3, 2007.     Mr. Rex Tillerson,     Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Exxon Mobil          Corporation, Irving, Texas.       Dear Mr. Tillerson: For many years, I've been supporting      and promoting ethanol and biodiesel fuels as a way to reduce      our dependence on foreign and traditional energy sources, and      increase our national security and rural economies. Our      nation is now consuming five billion gallons of ethanol      annually, and is estimated to produce as much as eleven      billion gallons annually by 2009.       In an effort to further reduce America's oil dependence,      it's imperative that higher ethanol blends be available to      consumers. While our domestic auto manufacturers are leading      the effort to expand the flex-fuel vehicle market, more must      be done to expand the fuel's availability. Of the 170,000      stations nationwide, only 1,100 currently offer E-85. This      represents less than one percent of fuel stations.       As you may recall, on March 14, 2006, you testified under      oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee. At the hearing, I      asked if you would commit to allow independent owners of      branded stations to sell E-85 or B-20, and if you would allow      those station owners to purchase the alternative fuel from      any outlet. For your benefit, I've enclosed a copy of the      hearing transcript.       In your response to me, you stated that Exxon Mobil has      denied no request from any dealers who sought permission to      sell unbranded E-85. In addition, you stated that every      request to sell the fuel under the canopy has been granted.      Your testimony before the committee clearly stated that Exxon      Mobil was perfectly willing to allow the sale of alternative      fuels at Exxon Mobil stations. However, a recent Wall Street      Journal article, which I've enclosed, detailed many of the      obstacles your company and other major integrated oil      companies apparently use to effectively prohibit or strongly      discourage the sale of alternative fuels.       In fact, Exxon Mobil's standard contract bars Exxon      stations from buying fuel from anybody but Exxon--a fact you      chose not to disclose to the committee. It also appears that      even in cases where exceptions are made, Exxon requires those      station owners to install entirely separate dispensers, for      the purpose of ``minimizing customer confusion,'' according      to an Exxon spokeswoman. It seems this policy has much more      to do with limiting the availability of alternative fuels      than customer confusion.       I would appreciate hearing your explanation as to why you      led me, the Judiciary Committee and the American people to      believe that Exxon Mobil supports making E-85 available to      your customers, yet your company is described by the Wall      Street Journal as a key obstacle to expanding the      availability of alternative fuels. I would appreciate knowing      exactly what Exxon Mobil is doing to grow the E-85 market,      and why you believe your tactics aren't simply obstacles, as      claimed by the Wall Street Journal.       I look forward to receiving your response not later than      May 25, 2007.           Sincerely,                                              Charles E. Grassley,     U.S. Senate.                                  ____                                                  U.S. Senate,                                      Washington, DC, May 3, 2007.     Mr. Robert A. Malone,     Chairman and President, British Petroleum America, Inc.,          Houston, Texas.       Dear Mr. Malone: For many years, I've been supporting and      promoting ethanol and biodiesel fuels as a way to reduce our      dependence on foreign and traditional energy sources, and      increase our national security and rural economies. Our      nation is now consuming five billion gallons of ethanol      annually, and is estimated to produce as much as eleven      billion gallons annually by 2009.

Of the 170,000      stations nationwide, only 1,100 currently offer E-85. This      represents less than one percent of fuel stations.       On March 14, 2006, Mr. Ross Pillari, former Chairman of BP      America, testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary      Committee. At the hearing, I asked Mr. Pillari if BP would      commit to allow independent owners of branded stations to      sell E-85 or B-20, and if BP would allow those station owners      to purchase the alternative fuel from any outlet. For your      benefit, I've enclosed a copy of the hearing transcript.       In his response to me, Mr. Pillari stated that British      Petroleum was already allowing independently owned stations      to freely deploy E-85. His testimony before the committee      clearly stated that British Petroleum was perfectly willing      to allow the sale of alternative fuels at BP stations.      However, a recent Wall Street Journal article, which I've      enclosed, detailed many of the obstacles your company and      other major integrated oil companies apparently use to      effectively prohibit or strongly discourage the sale of      alternative fuels.

Another obstacle employed by      your company is the prohibition on using pay-at-the-pump      credit card machines for E-85 purchases. It seems these      policies are in place simply to limit the availability and      sale of alternative fuels, rather than prevent customer      confusion.       I would appreciate hearing your explanation as to why Mr.      Pillari led me, the Judiciary Committee and the American      people to believe that British Petroleum supports making E-85      available to your customers, yet your company is described by      the Wall Street Journal as a key obstacle to expanding the      availability of alternative fuels. I would appreciate knowing      exactly what BP     is doing to grow the E-85 market, and why you believe your      tactics aren't simply obstacles, as claimed by the Wall      Street Journal.       I look forward to receiving your response not later than      May 25, 2007.           Sincerely,                                              Charles E. Grassley,     United States Senator.                                  ____                                                  U.S. Senate,                                      Washington, DC, May 3, 2007.     Mr. James J. Mulva,     Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Conoco Phillips          Company, Houston, Texas.       Dear Mr. Mulva: For many years, I've been supporting and      promoting ethanol and biodiesel fuels as a way to reduce our      dependence on foreign and traditional energy sources, and      increase our national security and rural economies.

For your benefit, I've enclosed a copy of the      hearing transcript.       In your response to me, you simply associated yourself with      the statements made by the other witnesses. That association      led me to believe that Conoco Phillips was already allowing      independently owned stations to freely deploy E-85 under the      canopy. Your testimony before the committee clearly indicated      that Conoco Phillips was perfectly willing to allow the sale      of alternative fuels at branded stations.

Mr. David J. O'Reilly,     Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corporation,          San Ramon, CA.       Dear Mr. O'Reilly: For many years, I've been supporting and      promoting ethanol and biodiesel fuels as a way to reduce our      dependence on foreign and traditional energy sources, and      increase our national security and rural economies.

Your testimony before the      committee clearly stated that Chevron was perfectly willing      to allow the sale of alternative fuels at Chevron stations.      You proudly stated that Chevron is one of the largest sellers      of ethanol.
