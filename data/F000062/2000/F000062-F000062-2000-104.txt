 President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota for his spirited comments and also for his support of having two Capitol Police officers at each entry. I want him to know, as the ranking member on the Legislative Branch Appropriations Subcommittee, I am fully supportive of that request. I believe the chairman, Senator Bennett, is as well.  Because he approached me with a big smile and I very much like it when the Senator from Texas smiles rather than frowns, I ask unanimous consent to amend my unanimous consent agreement to permit him to speak for 4 minutes and that I retain my right to the floor.
