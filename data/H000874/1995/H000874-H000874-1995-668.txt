Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, in November there were 435 contracts made in each of our districts, and we came here to represent as best we can the aspirations and the hopes of our constituents.  I would hope that as we proceed, that we together work to merit and properly explain this institution so that we can merit the respect of the American public.  I want to tell my new friends on both sides of the aisle who have come here that we spend a lot of time in this institution denigrating this institution. We have 435 campaigns that spend millions of dollars, and on both sides of the aisle we tell the American public how bad this institution is.  That is a disservice. It is a disservice to this institution, and it is a disservice to our democracy. It is no wonder that the American public has come to believe that this institution is not as good as I believe it to be, having served here for 14 years, and is peopled by individuals of integrity, patriotism, and commitment to the common good.  We have differences. But few of my colleagues on either side of the aisle I believe do not have their constituents' best interests at heart and want to serve the best interests of their country.  I say that in the context that many of these laws do in fact apply to the Congress. What they do not do, as has [[Page H102]] been observed, is give the redress that is given in the private sector.  That has been done for some very legitimate reasons in terms of the separate but equal status of this body with the executive department which is called upon in other instances to enforce these statutes. And determination has been made that it would be inappropriate to subject one coequal body to regulation by another coequal body. In fact, this very legislation, which is bipartisan in nature, addresses that concern and sets up an Office of Compliance within the Congress.  So as we in a bipartisan fashion pass this piece of legislation, which some believe will show how onerous are the protections we have extended to employees, and some of us believe how appropriate it is to extend to our own employees the protections for their safety, for their health, and for nondiscrimination that we have extended to employees throughout this country.                              {time}  0130  So I join my friend, the gentleman from Connecticut [Mr. Shays]. I regret, frankly, that my friend, the gentleman from New Hampshire, Mr. Swett, is not here.  I congratulate all those, the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Goodling], the gentleman from Indiana [Mr. Hamilton], and others who have been involved in bringing to fruition this very difficult piece of legislation.  I want to reiterate the remarks of the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. Frank]. Speaker Foley, knowing full well that this was a difficult piece of legislation, nevertheless said, ``We are going to bring it to the floor. I want to see this legislation passed.'' In August we did and it was passed. Unfortunately, it did not pass into law, but fortunately for us, in a bipartisan fashion we can act tonight to do what is right.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
