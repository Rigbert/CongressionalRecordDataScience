Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to the community are exceptional. Corona and Norco have been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Yolanda Carillo is one of these individuals. On January 19, 2013, Yolanda will be honored as the ``Citizen of the Year'' at the Greater Corona Valley Chamber of Commerce Installation and Awards Gala.  Yolanda holds a dual Masters of Science degree in Organizational Leadership and Community Psychology, and a Bachelor of Science degree in Human Services. She previously taught at a four year college institution and is a proud holder of a Child Development Program Administrator Certificate. Currently, Yolanda serves as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Corona-Norco Family YMCA, a post she has held since 1997. She is a highly motivated community builder and hardworking professional with proven administrative and organizational abilities. Yolanda is an effective leader with a natural ability to organize the efforts and goodwill of others. She is an enthusiastic team builder who enjoys the challenge of researching and analyzing to find viable solutions to improve the lives of our children, families and communities.  Yolanda's vision has grown from one YMCA site with 12 employees to today's YMCA of nine program sites with more than 85 employees. At the same time, she has assisted children who live in poverty by securing grantsworth millions of dollars from foundations, corporations, city, county, state and federal governments to establish programs for disadvantaged preschool, elementary, middle and high school students. Yolanda has also partnered with school districts, city, county and state Departments of Education as well as colleges, businesses and corporate sponsors to help underprivileged youth. The Corona-Norco Family YMCA under Yolanda's leadership has continued the successful partnership with the Calvert Foundation in sponsoring the Annual Ira D. ``Cal'' Calvert Distinguished Service Awards Dinner honoring exceptional community volunteers.  In addition to the YMCA, Yolanda is a member of many other community organizations and serves on multiple boards whose programs help children in our area. She is the City of Corona Planning Commissioner and Woman's Improvement Club Treasurer, and serves on the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce Board of Directors, Riverside Community College District Child Development Department Advisory Board, Riverside-Corona Navy League Council Board, United Neighbors Involving Today's Youth (UNITY) Board and Corona Police Community Partnership Association Board. She is a member of the Corona Rotary Club and is the immediate past State Board Chair of the California Child Development Administrators Association.  In light of all Yolanda has done for Corona and Norco, the Greater Corona Valley Chamber of Commerce named Yolanda their Citizen of the Year. Yolanda's tireless passion for community service has contributed immensely to the betterment of the Inland Empire and especially our community's children. She has been the heart and soul of many community organizations and events and I am proud to call her a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for her service and salute her as she receives this prestigious award.                          ____________________
