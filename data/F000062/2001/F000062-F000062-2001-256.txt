 This is a very soft cap, indeed.  So the current language in the bill does not represent a real compromise, it does little to stop wealthy debtors from protecting their assets through bankruptcy and living the rest of their lives in luxury, while leaving their creditors with nothing.  Bankruptcy is a federal matter. In fact, our Constitution explicitly gives Congress the right to establish ``uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies throughout the United States.''  So this Congress is constitutionally authorized, even obligated, to see that bankruptcy laws are fair and uniform throughout our Nation.  We must ensure that bankruptcy is a refuge of last resort for those truly in need of a fresh start, not just another financial planning tool to help felons and deadbeats protect their assets from creditors.  This bill rightly encourages responsibility for those who enter bankruptcy, so that those who can pay their debts, do pay their debts.  But we must encourage responsibility across the board, not just for those who cannot afford a god accountant or don't happen to live in Texas, Florida, Iowa, South Dakota or Kansas.  I urge my colleagues to support his amendment. I thank my distinguished colleague, Senator Kohl, for working so diligently on this amendment.                               Exhibit 1                                                 October 30, 2000.     Re the Bankruptcy Reform Act Conference Report (H.R. 2415).       Dear Senators: We are professors of bankruptcy and      commercial law. We have been following the bankruptcy reform      process with keen interest. The 91 undersigned professors      come from every region of the country and from all major      political parties. We are not a partisan, organized group,      and we have no agenda. Our exclusive interest is to seek the      enactment of a fair and just bankruptcy law, with appropriate      regard given to the interests of debtors and creditors alike.      Many of us have written before to express our concerns about      the bankruptcy legislation, and we write again as yet another      version of the bill comes before you. This bill is deeply      flawed, and we hope the Senate will not act on it in the      closing minutes of this session.       In a letter to you dated September 7, 1999, 82 professors      of bankruptcy law from across the country expressed their      grave concerns about some of the provisions of S. 625,      particularly the effects of the bill on women and children.      We wrote again on November 2, 1999, to reiterate our      concerns. We write yet again to bring the same message: the      problems with the bankruptcy bill have not been resolved,      particularly those provisions that adversely affect women and      children.       Notwithstanding the unsupported claims of the bill's      proponents, H.R. 2415 does not help women and children.      Thirty-one organizations devoted exclusively to promoting the      best interests of women and children continue to oppose the      pending bankruptcy bill. The concerns expressed in our      earlier letters showing how S. 625 would hurt women and      children have not been resolved. Indeed, they have not even      been addressed.       First, one of the biggest problems the bill presents for      women and children was stated in the September 7, 1999,      letter: ``Women and children as creditors will have to      compete with powerful creditors to collect their claims after      bankruptcy.'' This increased competition for women and      children will come from many quarters: from powerful credit      card issuers, whose credit card claims increasingly will be      excepted from discharge and remain legal obligations of the      debtor after bankruptcy; from large retailers, who will have      an easier time obtaining reaffirmations of debt that legally      could be discharged; and from creditors claiming they hold      security, even when the alleged collateral is virtually      worthless. None of the changes made to S. 625 and none being      proposed in H.R. 2415 addresses these problems. The truth      remains: if H.R. 2415 is enacted in its current form, women      and children will face increased competition in collecting      their alimony and support claims after the bankruptcy case is      over. We have pointed out this difficulty repeatedly, but no      change has been made in the bill to address it.       Second, it is a distraction to argue--as do advocates of      the bill--that the bill will ``help'' women and children and      that it will ``make child support and alimony payments the      top priority--no exceptions.'' As the law professors pointed      out in the September 7, 1999, letter: ``Giving `first      priority' to domestic support obligations does not address      the problem.'' Granting ``first priority'' to alimony and      support claims is not the magic solution the consumer credit      industry claims because ``priority'' is relevant only for      distributions made to creditors in the bankruptcy case      itself. Such distributions are made in only a negligible      percentage of cases. More than 95 percent of bankruptcy cases      make NO distributions to any creditors because there are no      assets to distribute.     Granting women and children a first priority for bankruptcy      distributions permits them to stand first in line to collect      nothing.       Women's hard-fought battle is over reaching the ex-     husband's income after bankruptcy. Under current law, child      support and alimony share a protected post-bankruptcy      position with only two other recurrent collectors of debt--     taxes and student loans. The credit industry asks that credit      card debt and other consumer credit share that position,      thereby elbowing aside the women trying to collect on their      own behalf. The credit industry carefully avoids discussing      the increased post-bankruptcy competition facing women if      H.R. 2415 becomes law. As a matter of public policy, this      country should not elevate credit card debt to the preferred      position of taxes and child support. Once again, we have      pointed out this problem repeatedly, and nothing has been      changed in the pending legislation to address it.       In addition to the concerns raised on behalf of the      thousands of women who are struggling now to collect alimony      and child support after their ex-husband's bankruptcies, we      also express our concerns on behalf of the more than half a      million women heads of household who will file for bankruptcy      this year alone. As the heads of the economically most      vulnerable families, they have a special stake in the pending      legislation. Women heads of households are now the largest      demographic group in bankruptcy, and according to the credit      industry's own data, they are the poorest. The provisions in      this bill, particularly the many provisions that apply      without regard to income, will fall hardest on them. Under      this bill, a single mother with dependent children who is      hopelessly insolvent and whose income is far below the      national median income would have her bankruptcy case      dismissed if she does not present copies of income tax      returns for the past three years--even if those returns are      in the possession of her ex-husband. A single mother who      hoped to work through a chapter 13 payment plan would be      forced to pay every penny of the entire debt owed on almost      worthless items of collateral, such as used furniture or      children's clothes, even if it meant that successful      completion of a repayment plan was impossible.       Finally, when the Senate passed S. 625, we were hopeful      that the final bankruptcy legislation would include a      meaningful homestead provision to address flagrant abuse in      the bankruptcy system. Instead, the conference report      retreats from the concept underlying the Senate-passed      homestead amendment. ``The homestead provision in the      conference report will allow wealthy debtors to hide assets      from their creditors.'' Current bankruptcy law yields to      state law to determine what property shall remain exempt      from creditor attachment and levy. Homestead exemptions      are highly variable by state, and six states (Florida,      Iowa, Kansas, South Dakota, Texas, Oklahoma) have      literally unlimited exemptions while twenty-two states      have exemptions of $10,000 or less. The variation among      states leads to two problems--basic inequality and      strategic bankruptcy planning. The only solution is a      dollar cap on the homestead exemption. Although variation      among states would remain, the most outrageous abuses--     those in the multi-million dollar category--would be      eliminated.       The homestead provision in the conference report does      little to address the problem. The legislation only requires      a debtor to wait two years after the purchase of the      homestead before filing a bankruptcy case. Well-counseled      debtors will have no problem timing their bankruptcies or      tying-up the courts in litigation to skirt the intent of this      provision. The proposed change will remind debtors to buy      their property early, but it will not deny anyone with      substantial assets a chance to protect property from their      creditors. Furthermore, debtors who are long-time residents      of states like Texas and Florida will continue to enjoy a      homestead exemption that can shield literally millions of      dollars in value.       These facts are unassailable: H.R. 2415 forces women to      compete with sophisticated creditors to collect alimony and      child support after bankruptcy. H.R. 2415 makes it harder for      women to declare bankruptcy when they are in financial      trouble. H.R. 2415 fails to close the glaring homestead      loophole and permits wealthy debtors to hide assets from      their creditors. We implore you to look beyond the distorted      ``facts'' peddled by the credit industry. Please do not pass      a bill that will hurt vulnerable Americans, including women      and children.       Thank you for your consideration.       [Signed by 91 law professors.]
