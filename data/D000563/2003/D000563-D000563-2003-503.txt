I did not have a chance to speak to Senator McConnell, but I did speak to Senator Frist, who was here earlier and made that same offer. I said to him, instead of bringing this bill to the floor, take it or leave it, with no committee hearings and no effort to try to work out our differences, wouldn't it be better for us to sit down at some point and try to engage all the elements that are necessary for success if we are going to deal with this true crisis in America?  He is open. I hope, if opportunity presents itself, we have that chance. I think we need to bring to the table, not only the legal profession but also the medical profession and the insurance companies. If you do not have all three of them at the table, as I will make clear in my statement, you are not going to get to the root cause of the problem.  The answer from the other side is strictly to limit for malpractice victims the amount they can recover in court. I am going to show in charts I will present that that has not worked. Caps really do not guarantee that malpractice premiums come down, for a variety of very complicated reasons.  I hope we can do that. I hope on a bipartisan basis we can stop this high-noon standoff and reach a point where we have real conversation and dialog.
