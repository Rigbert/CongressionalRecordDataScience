In fact, we not only could, we should. We should accept that responsibility. We do have this Government which has three coequal branches. If the executive branch and Secretary Thompson refuses to use the authority he has under the law, frankly, I think we should ban the sale of this product in the U.S.  As the Senator knows, we have been tied up for 3 weeks because Miguel Estrada refuses to disclose legal writings he has made. Even Republican Senators have suggested that he should.  We have waited for Republicans to understand that with more information, we can put this behind us and move on to other important business--not just questions about health and safety, but questions about the economy of this Nation, issues on which we ought to be debating and acting.  In closing, I am just going to ask Secretary Thompson again to take this very seriously. I hope we don't have to read about more athletes and other unsuspecting individuals and children who lose their lives as a result of these dangerous products. I say to any citizens following this debate, please think twice before you use a product containing ephedra. There are too manycases of death and serious health consequences for people who thought they were taking an innocent little pill that can be sold over the counter at a convenience store. In fact, many have turned out to be lethal doses that have killed or caused a great deal of harm.  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.
