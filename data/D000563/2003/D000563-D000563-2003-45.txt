Understanding that deadline faces us, with the approval of the chairman of the subcommittee--I hope to have his attention before I make this request--if I might ask the Senator from Missouri, would it be acceptable for me to divide the time between now and 4:30 so that I would use 15 minutes and then yield to Senator Dayton for 15 minutes, who also has an amendment to offer? That way, we would reach the 4:30 deadline by dividing the time equally. If that meets with the approval of the chairman of the subcommittee, I would like to make a unanimous consent request along those lines.
