Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Bonior) for yielding me this time.  Mr. Chairman, last week the Members of our body voted to send a message to the Bush administration that oil and water do not mix. The House voted overwhelmingly to stop offshore drilling off the coast of Florida by a vote of 247 to 164. Seventy Republicans joined 177 Democrats in a rebuke to the White House drilling policy. Nonetheless, Vice President Cheney claims that drilling can be conducted without environmental damage. Where does the administration stop in its single-minded desire to appease the oil and gas special interests? How many times do we have to send this message before the administration gets it?  The Bonior-Stupak-Kaptur amendment is a message: hands-off the Great Lakes. The President and Vice President need to understand that the people of the Great Lakes region do not want drilling. In my State, our Republican Governor is opposed to drilling in the Great Lakes. So are both our Republican Senators and our congressional delegation.  Lake Erie, Ohio's lake, is the shallowest of the Great Lakes and thus the most vulnerable to the administration's scheme. The Lake Erie shoreline, including the area in my congressional district, is a delicate ecosystem. Congressman Dingell and I are working on ways to protect it for generations into the future. To expose that fragile ecosystem to oil and gas drilling makes no sense. It is reckless policy. It is irresponsible. Our freshwater ecosystem is a powerful, competitive advantage for our economy and a priceless national and international resource that belongs to all the people, not to any special interest.  For hundreds of years, even before the Northwest Territory was open, the Great Lakes have defined an entire region of our continent and the world. In the region, we see the Great Lakes as precious jewels. The administration sees another drilling platform. Please support the Bonior-Stupak-Kaptur amendment. Oil and water do not mix.               [From the Anna Arbor News, June 19, 2001]                  Cheney: Drilling Could Cause No Harm protesters charge slant drills under lakes won't reduce oil dependence               (By Karessa E. Weir, News Staff Reporter)       GENOA TOWNSHIP.--In his first visit to Michigan since      taking office, Vice President Dick Cheney said drilling under      the Great Lakes can be done without environmental damage.       As environmentalists protested outside Lake Pointe Manor      banquet hall where he was speaking, Cheney said he supports      searching for new sources of fuel. Possibly, he said, that      could include the controversial plan to slant drill under the      lakes.       ``The technology in my judgment is extraordinarily good,''      Cheney said.       ``I'd also like to remind everybody that we have a serious      problem in our dependence on foreign (oil) sources.''       He added that to meet the country's electricity needs,      between 1,300 and 1,900 new generators would have to be built      for coal, gas and nuclear energy.       ``Those are the three options for the foreseeable future,''      he said. ``The attractive features of coal are that we've got      a lot of it . . . and it's cheap.''       Cheney was at the banquet hall south of Howell attending a      $1,000-a-plate fund-raiser for Brighton Republican Mike      Rogers.       Outside, Dan Farough, program director for the Sierra Club      and one of about 25 protesters, said continuing to put more      federal money into coal-burning endeavors will hurt Michigan      and the country without lowering reliance on imported oil.       ``Michigan's lakes already are under an advisory for      mercury. Where does he think the mercury comes from? It comes      from the emissions of those dirty coal-fire plants,'' Farough      said. ``He is pushing drilling in Alaska and in the Great      Lakes but even if we kept all of what we could get, it would      only lower our imports by 2 percent.''       Cheney, flanked by Rogers and Lt. Gov. Dick Posthumus,      spent the day in Michigan, first touring General Motors      Corp.'s Vehicle Emission Lab in Warren and then attending the      fund-raiser.       Cheney also spoke to about 500 people who paid $25 each to      attend a rally at the banquet hall, where he touted the      passage of the ``largest tax cut in a generation'' and      efforts to reform Social Security and create a global missile      defense system.       ``We will not accept that the U.S. is undefended from      ballistic missiles,'' Cheney said.       Inside, the reception to Cheney was warmer.       ``He's doing great,'' said Millie Geisert of Howell. ``He's      bringing integrity and morality back to our country.''       In Warren, Cheney climbed into a fuel-cell vehicle and      munched on popcorn produced by the excess energy of a hybrid      truck. He said he was impressed by what he saw at the GM      facility.       ``I am . . . optimistic. With American technology and      ingenuity there's no question we can solve any problems down      the road,'' Cheney said.       The tour came a week after GM announced a 25-year      collaboration with General Hydrogen Corp., a pioneer in fuel-     cell technology. GM hopes the partnership will accelerate the      development of fuel-cell vehicles, which create electricity      directly from a reaction between hydrogen and oxygen. The      vehicles emit only water vapor from their tailpipes.       Rick Wagoner, GM's president and CEO, applauded the Bush      administration's energy plan.       ``We believe the plan makes sense and believe the auto      industry can help implement it,'' Wagoner said.       Rogers, who defeated state Sen. Dianne Byrum, D-Onondaga,      by 110 votes in November, garnered more than $350,000 for his      campaign through the Cheney visit. He faces his first re-     election bid in 2002.       The Associated Press contributed to this report.
