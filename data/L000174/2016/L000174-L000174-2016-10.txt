President, I have visited Egypt many times, and I have voted for billions of dollars in U.S. assistance for Egypt to support economic and security programs in that country. I have recognized positive developments in Egypt when they occur, such as the recent decision by the government to undertake economic reforms, including by reducing some subsidies.  I also recognize the security challenges Egypt faces from instability and violence in Libya and in the Sinai. The U.S. has an interest in helping Egypt confront these challenges by addressing the underlying causes in a manner that is consistent with international law.  Today I want to speak briefly about the Egyptian Parliament's recent passage of a restrictive new law on nongovernmental organizations, NGOs, that would effectively cripple Egypt's civil society for years to come. Rather than sign this legislation, I hope President Sisi calls for a new version to be drafted in cooperation with independent NGOs. If President Sisi does sign this law, it will be yet another step in the wrong direction by a government that professes to be making progress on civil and human rights when the facts indicate otherwise.Such a development would be further evidence of the need to strengthen existing democratic and human rights conditions on U.S. aid for Egypt.  According to information I have received, the law passed by parliament on November 29 would place all NGOs in Egypt, both local and foreign, under the supervision and control of a committee that would be dominated by representatives of the Defense, Interior, and Justice Ministries, as well as the General Intelligence Service, the country's top spy agency. Among other things, the law would criminalize work that harms ``national security, national unity, public morals or public order'' but leaves those terms undefined, allowing the authorities to bring such charges against any group they choose. Anyone convicted of violating the law would face sentences of up to 5 years in prison and a fine of up to $56,000.  The proposed law comes at a time when independent voices in Egypt are facing an existential crisis. Instead of passing a new NGO law that would allow both domestic and international groups to operate without burdensome restrictions, the Egyptian authorities have escalated their crackdown on independent NGOs, particularly against groups that focus on human rights, the rule of law, and democratic norms.  Over the past year, a court has frozen the assets of human rights groups and the personal assets of human rights defenders. At least 15 NGO founders, leaders, or staff--many from prominent groups--have been banned from leaving the country. An investigation into the foreign funding of dozens of local NGOs could result in criminal charges carrying sentences of up to 25 years in prison. This pattern of harassment and arrests is not a new phenomenon. It has been happening for years, and, contrary to representations of Egyptian officials, it is getting worse.  I urge the Egyptian authorities to adhere to their constitution, and the pledges they have made in international fora such as the United Nations Human Rights Council, by guaranteeing freedom of expression and association. I urge President Sisi to reject this draconian legislation.  I also want to reiterate what I said in this chamber on September 27, 2016, when I spoke about Aya Hijazi, a young Egyptian American social worker currently being detained in Egypt.  Ms. Hijazi, along with her Egyptian husband and five employees of their NGO Belady, has been accused of salacious crimes--accusations that the government has yet to corroborate with credible evidence in a court of law. Ms. Hijazi has been jailed and denied due process since May 21, 2014. She and the other defendants should be released immediately or provided a fair, public trial so they can defend themselves.                          ____________________
