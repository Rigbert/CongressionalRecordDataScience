 502, 531, 532, 533, 535, 536, 537, 538, 539, and all nominations placed on the Secretary's desk in the Air Force, Army and Navy.  I further ask unanimous consent that the nominations be confirmed en bloc, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table en bloc, that any statements relating to the nominations appear at the appropriate place in the Record, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and that the Senate then return to legislative session.
