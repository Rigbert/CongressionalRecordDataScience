President, I rise as a strong supporter and cosponsor of this amendment, which will guarantee that adult education--including adult literacy--programs receive adequate funding under the Workforce Development Act. Unfortunately, over 50 percent of adults in the United States are functionally illiterate, roughly 44 million Americans. Illiteracy costs the U.S. economy about $225 billion a year in lost productivity. As we improve our worker training programs, we must provide adequate funding to combat adult illiteracy.  In my home State, many dedicated Vermonters are working hard to help adults overcome illiteracy and enjoy a more productive and enjoyable life. For instance, my sister, Mary Leahy, has devoted herself to helping adults with reading and writing problems at Central Vermont Adult Basic Education in Barre, VT. Mary, along with many other Vermonters, know the deep satisfaction of helping another adult unlock his or her potential.  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. It is one of the best ways to help our work force and improve the quality of life of millions of adults.
