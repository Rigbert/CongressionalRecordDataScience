Actually the vacancy rate is lower than the unemployment rate in the country. It probably wouldn't be any, had it not been for the fact that 60 of President Clinton's nominees were blocked because 1 or more Republican Senators opposed them--1 or more. So they never got a vote. And had they gotten a vote, there would be no vacancy at all.
