 President, like most Members of this body, I am rarely at a loss for words, but I think we have just had an opportunity to hear one of the most important speeches in the history of the Senate about our beginnings, about our traditions, about what is unique about this institution which makes it different from any other legislative body in the world. I have heard many people discuss that over the years but never anyone so cogently point out why the uniqueness of this institution is so important to our country as the senior Senator from Connecticut has done it today. So while we have a huge number of Senators on the floor, I am going to strongly recommend that those who were not here have an opportunity to take a look at his remarks because I think they are an enormously significant and important contribution to this institution and to its future.  On a personal basis, I want to say to my good friend from Connecticut how much I am going to miss him--his wonderful personality, his ability to talk to anybody--a uniquely effective individual.  So we bid adieu to the senior Senator from Connecticut and hope our paths will cross again in the future.  I yield the floor.
