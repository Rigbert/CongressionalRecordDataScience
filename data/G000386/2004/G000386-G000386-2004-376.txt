 President, I wish to correct the record with respect to some comments made by my friend and colleague, Senator Harkin.  Senator Harkin said that the managers' package was non-germaneamendments. All of the amendments were tax relief measures that were requested by Members on both sides of the aisle.  The bill before us is a tax relief bill. It deals with a tax incentive designed to help our exporters. This bill deals with tax relief for domestic manufacturers and international tax reform.  The sum and substance of this bill is about tax relief. The managers' package is about bipartisan tax relief. It is germane to this bill.  The amendment of my friend from Iowa is a labor law matter. It is not in the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee.
