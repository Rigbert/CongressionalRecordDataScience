 KYL. Absolutely.  Mr. McCONNELL. I certainly share the views of Senator McCain that letting these cuts stand is not likely. On the other hand, the President of the United States said he would veto any measure seeking to reverse these cuts. So we have a Hobson's choice: Either the cuts will occur in which case seniors will be devastated or they will not occur, as the Senator from Arizona has pointed out, and the deficit will balloon further.  Mr. McCAIN. Did the majority leader happen to notice that the AARP has now endorsed this bill? It has endorsed a bill that will cut people, 300,000 of them in my State, from their Medicare Advantage Program, that would cut $15 billion from nursing homes, that would cut $8 billion from hospices, and that AARP, which, by the way, I understand gets some $60-some million out of this deal--I say to the senior citizens in my State: Take your AARP membership card, cut it in half, and send it back to AARP because they have betrayed you.
