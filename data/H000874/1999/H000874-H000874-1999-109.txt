Chairman, this ought not to be a partisan issue. This is an issue we fought a Cold War over. We did not fight it, luckily, for the most part, with bullets. We fought it with a commitment to our ideals of freedom and individual liberty. Not collective liberty, individual. No citizen, no matter how wrong they might be, is precluded from coming to the courts and saying, everybody may disagree with me, but I think I am right.  Mr. Chairman, I hope that, on this issue, my colleagues summon up the wisdom and the courage to say we ought not to do this because it is inconsistent with what we believe about our country, what has made our country different.  Do not tell the residents of the District of Columbia that they have a grievance, but only if they get the largess of some private donor will they be able to seek constitutional relief. Do not do that to them, not because they are the District of Columbia under the Constitution as a State or a District that we have authority over, but because there are 500,000 Americans, just as I am an American, just as my colleagues are Americans, 260 million of us, not D.C. Americans, Maryland Americans, Oklahoma Americans, but Americans, protected by the best document man ever forged, the Constitution of the United States, that holds these truths to be self-evident, that all men and women are created equal, each one of us, endowed, not by the D.C. subcommittee, not by the House of Representatives, endowed by God with certain inalienable rights. Among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That is what they seek. Do not preclude it.  Admit mistake in this area. Support this amendment.
