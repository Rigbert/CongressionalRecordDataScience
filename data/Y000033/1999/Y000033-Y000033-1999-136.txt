Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of the Aviation Reform and Investment Act of the 21st Century.  We need to invest in our aviation infrastructure. More people are flying than ever before. The Aviation Trust Fund continues to accumulate unspent revenue. We have a responsibility, no, an obligation, to return and invest those tax dollars of the aviation American system. If it is the will of Congress not to make the investment, then we should stop collecting those taxes.  In 1998, the Aviation Trust Fund collected $6 billion of taxpayer money but Congress only invested $5.9 billion of it in aviation. As a result, our constituents continue to face delays and frustrations.  If we continue the current budgetary gimmickry, the cash balance in the trust fund will grow from $12 billion in 1999 to $91 billion by the year 2009. Again, if Congress will not spend these dedicated tax dollars, then we have to reduce taxes and fees collected from aviation users.  Without the investment, the FAA will continue to experience system outages. That means air traffic control will lose sight of a plane on radar. The FAA says there can be as many as 5,800 flights in the air over the U.S. at any one time. As the number of those flights in the air increase, congestion will grow. Without further investment, the safety of air travel will degrade.  Is this bill going to cut funding from other programs? No. Air 21 recaptures unspent aviation taxes that increases aviation spending by $14 billion over 4 years.
