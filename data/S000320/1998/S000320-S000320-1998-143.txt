 President, I would like to take this opportunity to thank Chairman Stevens, Senator Bond, Senator Domenici and their staffs for their efforts on behalf of the citizens of Alabama. Over the last several months, Alabama has suffered greatly as a result of multiple natural disasters. As the state was addressing the flooding in its Southern regions, a series of violent tornados devastated portions of Northern Alabama. These terrible events resulted in loss of life and extensive property and infrastructure damage. In many cases, whole communities were destroyed. While communities have banded together to begin the process of rebuilding their lives, the need for assistance is obvious to anyone who has viewed the destruction firsthand.  I appreciate the efforts of the Senator from Missouri as the Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on VA/HUD and Independent Agencies to increase the funding provided by the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program. Although there has been extensive promotion of buyouts and relocation, it is my understanding that only 3 million dollars is available to the State of Alabama through hazard mitigation funding for this purpose. These funds are dramatically insufficient to meet the current needs and demands of the communities hit by these disasters. It is my understanding that the State of Alabama will be eligible for the CDBG funds included in this bill to respond to the flood and tornado disasters. Is it the Chairman's understanding that this funding could be used by the State for buyouts?
