Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, let me just say in closing that, again, we urge our colleaguesto vote for this bill. For those who are anxious to catch their planes to go home, let me say that the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Skeen), the chairman and I, did not select this period in which to debate our bill. We were given this time.  We feel that it is an important bill. We apologize to the Members who missed their 4 o'clock flights. It was not our choice to go up before the Committee on Rules this afternoon. I can say this, and the gentleman cannot. We ask for the Members' support of our bill.
