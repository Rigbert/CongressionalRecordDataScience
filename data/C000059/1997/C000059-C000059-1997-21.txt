Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of this legislation. My fellow Californian and my close and good friend, the gentleman from California, Mr. Jerry Lewis, should be commended for crafting a very responsible bill which will help us lead to cleaner air in the future. Among its other strengths, it protects veterans, improves housing programs, and ensures a cleaner environment.  I want to highlight a particularly important provision of the bill, as we have been discussing. As we know, the President has thrown his support behind EPA's proposed air quality standards for particulate matter and ozone. Whether Members support these standards or oppose them, one thing we should all agree on is that we need to do more research if we are to guarantee adequate protection for our children and the elderly.  As the chairman of the subcommittee that authorizes EPA's Office of Research and Development, I introduced a bill which passed through Congress and through our committee on a bipartisan basis unanimously to provide research money above the administration's request.  In three hearings we held on the matter, the scientific experts all concluded that the science was inadequate at this time. They said we needed additional funding to get at the very basic questions about the health effects of ozone, and particularly small particulates at the 2.5-micron-and-below size.  I am pleased that the gentleman from San Bernardino worked closely with me to provide the funds in this bill, and it is further evidence of his dedication to a cleaner environment. I congratulate the gentleman and thank him for his work.
