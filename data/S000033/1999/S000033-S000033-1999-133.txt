 Speaker, if the gentleman would yield further, I would comment that those banks that he is referring to I presume are not losing money, they are making money and they are making money the right way, by reinvesting in their communities.  I think, not to wander away from the subject at hand, there is a real concern throughout this country about the loss of decent paying jobs and the fact that big money interests are much more interested in investing in China or Mexico to help companies make a quick buck exploiting cheap labor in those countries rather than reinvesting in the United States, rather than reinvesting in our community.  What CRA is about, which is so essential and so right, it says reinvest in our communities, create new jobs in our communities, start small businesses in our communities, give people affordable housing in our communities. And you know what, banks? You can make money doing that. You do not have to just help people invest in China.  So I think the gentleman and I are in agreement, the CRA is a success story. And I hope very much that no one in Congress wants to come forward to dismantle it or to weaken it. And if they do, I hope that the President will do the right thing and inform them that any legislation which weakens CRA will be vetoed.
