 President, the Senate just passed the legislative tools needed to repeal and replace ObamaCare. This is a critical step forward--the first step toward bringing relief from this failed law. The resolution now goes to the House. They will take it up soon. The next step will then be the legislation to finally repeal ObamaCare and move us toward smarter health policies.  The repeal legislation will include a stable transition period as we work toward patient-centered health care. We plan to take on the replace challenge in manageable pieces with step-by-step reforms. We can begin to make important progress within that repeal legislation, and we will continue to work with the incoming administration and the House in developing what comes next.  There are other steps we can take as well, including important administrative steps like confirming Tom Price as Secretary of Health and Human Services and Seema Verma as CMS Administrator. They can start stabilizing the health insurance markets that ObamaCare has thrown into turmoil, and they can start bringing relief to the American people. There is a lot they can do.  There is lot we can do. We may not be responsible for ObamaCare and the harm it has done to so many, but we have been clear about our commitment to bringing relief from it. From skyrocketing premiums and deductibles to dwindling options on the exchanges, too many families don't know how they will continue to endure the consequences associated with ObamaCare. These families have called for a helping hand. They have called for Congress to listen to their concerns, and they have called for us to finally build a bridge away from ObamaCare and toward health policies that put them first. We just took a decisive step toward that goal last night.  Repealing and replacing ObamaCare is a big challenge. It isn't going to be easy. Nonetheless, we are committed to fulfilling our promise to the American people--and we will.                          ____________________
