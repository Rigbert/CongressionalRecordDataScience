Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to one of the first health outreach programs in the State of Maryland to deal with immunizing children. The Well Child Outreach Program in St. Mary's County is a partnership between private practitioners and the St. Mary's County Health Department that was created to reduce the fragmented care of children in southern Maryland. In addition to providing medical care to uninsured and underinsured children, the program coordinates with the Department of Social Services, St. Mary's County public schools, WIC and Head Start in order to immunize as many children as possible throughout the county.  In its 9 years in existence, child immunization rates have improved, 98 percent of children entering county schools have complied with the entry physicals and 90 percent of the clients have kept their appointments. The State of Maryland supports State and local health departments throughout the State that follow the well child outreach model. I applaud the St. Mary's County Health Department and the physicians who began the Well Child Outreach Program.                          ____________________
