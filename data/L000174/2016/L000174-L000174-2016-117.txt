President, I want to congratulate Nora Jacobson, a documentary film maker from Norwich, VT, who recently was awarded the 2016 Herb Lockwood Prize in the Arts.  Herb Lockwood, originally from upstate New York, moved to Vermont in 1982 where he became widely respected for the extraordinary breadth and depth of his artistic talents. He was a painter, writer, woodworker, sculptor, cartoonist, and a master guitar player who inspired people of all ages, and his untimely death from a workplace accident in 1987 at the age of 27 led his friends and fans to publish his music and writings and led to his brother Todd to create the prize that bears Herb's name.  Each year, the prize is awarded to a Vermonter whose work demonstrates a high level of artistic achievement, coupled with originality, innovation, and imagination; whose creativity, drive and philosophy serve as inspiration to other artists; and who has had a beneficent influence on the Vermont community. The prize includes a cash award of $10,000. The Burlington City Arts Foundation administers the prize through the generosity of private donors.  I commend Todd Lockwood for honoring his brother's life in this way and am very pleased that Nora Jacobson is this year's prize winner. Nora grew up on a hilltop farm in Norwich, and with the exception of a few years away, she has spent her life in Vermont. She has produced a number of documentary films, some of which took as long as a decade to shoot and edit, like ``Delivered Vacant,'' about gentrification in Hoboken, NJ, and ``Freedom and Unity: The Vermont Movie,'' a unique portrayal of memorable periods and individuals in Vermont's 225-year history. The film is the product of the collaboration of dozens of film makers, conceived and directed by Nora, and it was shown in town halls and other locations around the state.  Throughout her career as an independent film maker, Nora Jacobson has demonstrated the same passionate devotion to film and recognition of the importance the arts have for Vermont communities that people so admired in Herb Lockwood. She is a well-deserving recipient of this year's Herb Lockwood Prize.                          ____________________
