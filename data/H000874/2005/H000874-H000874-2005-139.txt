 Regarding Wednesday's schedule, which I know has become somewhat complicated, first of all, it is my understanding that the majority has some meetings on that morning. In addition, as you know, and you mentioned the resolution that we are going to consider on Rosa Parks, Rosa Parks' funeral in Detroit is on Wednesday. Obviously, therefore, many, many Members will want to be attending that funeral, I am sure, on both sides perhaps. And we are wondering whether or not we can structure Wednesday's schedule to accommodate attendance at the funeral so that Members will not miss votes. It is my understanding that the funeral is at 11 o'clock.  I might yield to the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, who was very, very close to Mrs. Parks, to perhaps give us a thought on the time frame in which Members could be back from the funeral.
