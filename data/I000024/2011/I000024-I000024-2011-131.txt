President, let me, first of all, speak in response to what the Senator from Texas talked about. This is very significant. I happen to be maybe one of the few who voted against the last three extensions that were requested--these 1-week extensions. That is no way to run government. I understand that.  But this one is different, and I rejoiced when I saw we had an opportunity to pass a 1-week extension that would do three things: No. 1, substantial cuts--not these just imaginary things we have been talking about--No. 2, continue the funding for what we must do in Israel for the end of this fiscal year; but, most importantly--and I say this as the second ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee--this would be a huge help to our military so there would be certainty, they would know what we are going to be doing between now and the end of this fiscal year. That absolutely has to be done.  It is unimaginable to me that in the middle of what I call two, maybe three conflicts right now that we are not lining up and making sure we have the funding that is necessary for what is going on in Afghanistan and other places where we have our troops in harm's way. It is something that is inexcusable, and I just cannot believe there is going to be a veto.  In spite of the veto threat, this is our opportunity to have time to be fiscally responsible, and I hope we are.                          ____________________
