President, first, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter in opposition to the Inhofe amendment from the American Coalition for Ethanol, the American Farm Bureau Association, the National Association of Wheat Growers, the National Association of Corn Growers, National Farmers Union, National Sorghum Producers, and the Renewable Fuels Association.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                    June 20, 2007.     Majority Leader Harry Reid,     U.S. Senate.     Chairman Jeff Bingaman,     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources,     U.S. Senate.     Minority Leader Mitch McConnell,     U.S. Senate.     Ranking Member Pete Domenici,     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources,     U.S. Senate.       Dear Senators: As the Senate continues to debate the energy      bill, H.R. 6, we urge all Senators to vote against the      amendment offered by Senators James Inhofe (R-Okla.), Richard      Burr (R-N.C.) and Elizabeth Dole (R-N.C.) when it is brought      up for a vote. We strongly oppose this amendment as it would      effectively gut the RFS and thwart the growth of the domestic      ethanol industry.       Senators Inhofe, Burr and Dole are proposing an amendment      to the energy bill that would put in place a stocks-to-use      mechanism that would suppress crop prices and be detrimental      to the American farmer and domestic renewable fuels. Stocks-     to-use has limited value as an indicator of demand and      expected price. It is an oversimplified way to look at      supply/demand and pricing and does not often provide an      accurate picture of how markets would be impacted. For      example, in 2003/04 the stocks-to-use ratio was one of the      lowest in the last 20 years at 9.4 percent, but prices      remained at $2.50 for a season average. Most long-run      economic models (U.S. Department of Agriculture and Food and      Agriculture Policy Research Institute, and others) project      stocks-to-use ratio slightly under 10 percent for next      several years, with prices in the $3.00-3.50 range.      Additionally, many economists have stopped using the stocks-     to-use ratio in their econometric models as a tool to      forecast price because of its obvious limitations. As corn      usage are likely to increase substantially to 13, 14, or even      15 billion bushels in the future, a 10 percent stocks-to-use      ratio could very well equate to carry-out of 1.3, 1.4, or 1.5      billion bushels. So while the stocks-to-use ratio might seem      low in these cases, actual carry-out levels would be right in      line with the 12-year average (95/96 to 06/07) of 1.38      billion bushels.       According to a recent analysis from the University of      Illinois, ``the stocks-to-use ratio is generally used as a      ``short cut'' approximation for summarizing annual supply and      demand conditions. However, very different supply and demand      conditions in individual years can lead to similar ratios of      stocks-to-use, but very different prices. The most obvious      example is the contrast between a year of very small      production that results in a low stocks-to-use ratio, but      also requires very high prices to force a reduction in      consumption and a large crop year that results in a high      level of consumption, a low stocks-to-use ratio, but low      prices.''       Without the strong domestic market corn farmers won't have      the incentive to plant as many acres and take the risk that      large production will drive down corn prices. An arbitrary      stocks-to-use ratio trigger that restricts corn use for      ethanol would likely diminish overall demand and put downward      pressure on the price for corn. This would serve as a      disincentive to farmers and discourage them from planting      more corn at a time when more corn is what the feed and fuel      industries need. The food and feed industries have assumed      that farmers will continue to produce record crops regardless      of prices and profitability. If production declines, or even      grows more slowly, stocks could also fall, eventually driving      prices higher. In the long-term, America's farm sector is      better off maintaining a strong and growing domestic demand      base and adding value markets.       The corn industry will continue to strive to satisfy a      variety of important demands and maximize the utility of its      product. Seed technology developments, increasing      agricultural efficiency, innovation in biofuels production      processes and other breakthroughs will ensure that growers      will continue to meet the world's need for food, feed, fuel      and other uses.       Efforts to undermine the continued growth of the U.S.      ethanol industry should not be tolerated. A careful look at      the facts reveals that American farmers have met, can and      will continue to meet our domestic and international      commitments for food and feed while still making a      significant and growing contribution to lessening our      dependence on imported oil with homegrown, American- made      renewable fuels. We strongly urge you to oppose the Inhofe/     Burr/Dole amendment.           Sincerely,     American Coalition for Ethanol.     American Farm Bureau Federation.     National Association of Wheat Growers.     National Corn Growers Association.     National Farmers Union.     National Sorghum Producers.     Renewable Fuels Association.
