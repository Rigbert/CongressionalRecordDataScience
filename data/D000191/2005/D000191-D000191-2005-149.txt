Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. At long last no more, well, one extension, only so we can properly celebrate the adoption of this legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I want to join with the gentleman from Alaska (Chairman Young). I first want to thank the gentleman and other leaders on the Republican side for their extraordinary fairness in this process and recognizing that transportation, transportation efficiency is not a partisan issue; it serves all Americans. It serves all business in blue States, red States, Democratic, Republican, Independent.  We are here today gathered to make an extraordinary investment in the future of our country. I do not think there is anything this Congress could do more definitively to put people back to work, to stimulate our economy, to increase our efficiency, our competitiveness, both nationally and internationally than this legislation.  And the wonderful thing, at this time in our Nation's history, about this legislation is we are not borrowing the money to do it. We are spending taxes paid by all Americans at the gas pump: individuals, passenger car drivers, and commercial drivers and businesses.  And we are going to take that money, and we are going to invest it in ways that benefit this Nation for decades to come. We are going to help mitigate congestion, and congestion is at the top of my list, because the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar) should have been here to join in this effort, but he is stuck in traffic. And hopefully by the time we finish spending the money in TEA-LU, the gentleman and other Americans will be able to get to work more readily in the future, in addition to benefiting business and other aspects of our country.  Mr. Speaker, particularly I want to thank the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar) for his mentorship, his leadership on our side, his friendship, his advocacy, his knowledge, his history. I learned a lot during this bill. It was an extraordinary process for me. And he has been wonderful and helpful.  The gentleman also came to my State to recognize that my State has an extraordinary problem that transcends the boundaries of our State, something I started campaigning for a couple of years ago, to recognize that Interstate 5 is the lifeline of the western United States, joining the fifth largest economy in the world, California, to Oregon and Washington, two foreign nations, Mexico and Canada, serving the busiest port in the Nation, and a number of other very busy ports, the third busiest truck route in America.  Oregon has an extraordinary problem on Interstate 5, through an accident of history, having built our interstate before other States. Our bridges are virtually reaching simultaneous failure because we used an old 1950s and pre-1950s technology, where States who built the interstate later, California and others, used a very different technology, and they do not have the bridge problems we have.  My State has raised fees and licenses and bonded a tremendous amount of money to deal with this problem, but we are still short. And this bill will go a long way toward filling that gap and completing Interstate 5 so you will not have trucks detouring up over the Cascade Mountains, down the far side and back onto I-5.  But that is probably one of the many issues this bill will deal with. Other projects of national significance, something pioneered by the chairman of this committee and the House, which the Senate only tagged onto in the end, is going to make tremendous investments in the Alameda Corridor, other critical areas in California that are suffering from huge growth, and congestion all across the Nation.  We will be making very significant investments with major projects there, and then down the Missouri River Bridge all the way to the east coast and some of the problems dealing with freight movement across New York Harbor from New Jersey into New York. This is not everything we needed, but it is a tremendous and meaningful down payment.  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank again all who joined in this effort. I want to join the chairman in thanking the Republican staff. He has done an able job of that. I would like to name a few folks on our side, and there have been a lot of sleepless nights.  First and foremost, my staff: Kathie Dedrick, who yesterday was her birthday, probably one she will never forget. She got all 24 hours out of it, because she did not sleep. So that is, I guess, one way to approach that.  I want to thank the Highway Subcommittee staff, Ken House, Art Chan, Stephanie Manning, Eric VanSchyndle, Jennifer Esposito, Jackie Schmitz, Homer Carlisle.  I particularly want to thank David Heysfeld, who brings almost as much history and knowledge to these issues as the ranking member and sometimes remembers some details that the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar) has forgotten.  Ward McCarragher, Kathie Zern, Jen Walsh, Dara Schlieker, an administrative assistant without whom we never would have got through to people and coordinated things.  I want to thank some folks downtown, actually, at the Federal Highway Administration, Susan Binder, Rosi Crighton, because they spent an incredible amount of time analyzing what it was we were doing, because there are times when you start moving pieces around in this formula, we are not quite sure where it is all headed and who is going to be impacted.  Sometimes at 3 or 4 in the morning, they were doing analysis that was critical to the committee completing this bill in a fair way.  So I want to thank the chairman. I want to thank the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Petri) and his staff. He has just been wonderful to me as chairman. I am proud to serve under him as ranking member.                              {time}  1030  I want to thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Thomas) because he and I may disagree over a number of things, but we found common cause here in investing in the future of this country. And he played an absolutely critical role in negotiating with the Senate, which is one of the most confounding processes, I do not know if you can even call it a process, that I have ever dealt with. I do not know that it is that organized.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
