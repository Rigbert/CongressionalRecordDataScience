Having served on the Armed Services Committee for quite some time and having watched this, what is kind of worrisome to me is that when we started out the F-22 program, the fifth generation fighter program, at that time they were talking about 750. Then the numbers started coming down and approached, I guess, 243. The Air Force officials have repeatedly stated that no fewer than that would be sufficient with a moderate level of risk.  My concern has been the same concern I have when we are talking about ground capability, when we see countries such as China and Russia passing us up in areas. I will not bring up the NLOS cannon right now. But there are many places where our prospective enemies have better equipment than we do. We do know China has their J-12s; and Russia, I believe they are calling theirs the T-50s. We do know those are fifth-generation fighters. It is very disturbing to me that we would consider stopping at this point when this is not going to be adequate to get us out of the medium-risk category.  So I certainly support the effort to maintain those seven. Quite frankly, when Senator Chambliss offered the amendment to expand it by seven, I was thinking we should really be shooting for more, and I think he agreed with that. However, apparently with the exports out there and with the additional seven that were put in, in the committee, that would be enough to keep the line open. So I strongly support the effort to keep those numbers where they are.  I yield the floor.
