Speaker, today I am Introducing the ``Federal Judgeship and Administrative Efficiency Act of 2005.'' I urge the House to pass the legislation expeditiously.  The purpose of this bill is to provide the President with the necessary authority to appoint needed circuit and district court judges and to increase the number of authorized bankruptcy judgeships.  A further purpose is to make changes in the structure of the court of appeals system, which are required to modernize, streamline, and improve the administration of justice for nearly one in five Americans.  Mr. Speaker, the last comprehensive judgeship bill that was passed by Congress was enacted in 1990. Since that time, the volume of cases handled by the judiciary has increased substantially.  The Federal Judgeship and Administrative Efficiency Act authorizes the creation of 68 new judgeships--12 at the circuit court level and 56 at the district courts. In addition, the bill contains authority to create 24 new permanent or temporary bankruptcy judgeships.  These new judgeships will benefit districts across America. When confirmed, these new judges will be in a position to help address a growing backlog of cases that threatens to clog our courts and imposes substantial human and economic costs on our citizens.  A judiciary that fails in its basic obligation to dispense justice in a timely, fair, and dispassionate manner compromises its own credibility. A court that is too far removed from those whose disputes it is responsible for adjudicating impose severe costs on those who must appear before it. The bill before us speaks to these concerns by providing for the realignment of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and the establishment of a new Twelfth Circuit Court of Appeals.  The Ninth has become so big--in geographic size, in workload, in number of active and senior judges--that it can no longer appropriately discharge its civic functions on behalf of the American people.  Consider: The Ninth has 47 judges, a figure that approaches twice the number of total judges of the next largest circuit. The Ninth represents 56 million people, or roughly one-fifth of our Nation's population. This is 25 million more people than the second largest circuit. The Ninth encompasses nearly 40 percent of the geographic area of the United States.  The Ninth Circuit also has the most number of appeals filed and the highest percentage increase in appeals filed over the past 4 years. It is the circuit-wide leader in the number of appeals still pending and ranks a close second in the longest median time until disposition.  Given these and other problems created by the mammoth breadth and size of the Ninth, I believe the responsible action is to modernize and streamline the structure of the Courts of Appeals.  Briefly, H.R. 4093 creates a new Ninth that will feature California, Guam, Hawaii, and the Northern Mariana Islands. The new Twelfth will consist of the States of Alaska, Arizona, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington.  Importantly in this regard, H.R. 4093 authorizes the President to appoint five new judges to permanent Ninth Circuit seats along with two other judges who will fill temporary seats. My bill provides that the official duty station for these newly authorized judges will be in California.  These additions are consistent with requests made by the Judicial Conference and will ensure that future caseload demands on the new Ninth will more closely mirror its judgeship resources. California is not being singled out or punished by this legislation. Quite the contrary, the district and circuit courts that affect the rights of the citizens of California are being provided with their proportionate share of resources and being liberated to become more productive.  Mr. Speaker, bigger does not always mean better. The constant expansion of the size of a court without also adopting commensurate reforms will, most assuredly, not result in improving the performance of the judiciary.  The allocation of judicial resources must be made with an eye toward achieving structural coherence within each circuit.  H.R. 4093 accomplishes that purpose and I urge its adoption.                          ____________________
