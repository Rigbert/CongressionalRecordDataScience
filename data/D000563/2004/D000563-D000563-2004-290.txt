The American exemplar inspired many to shed the yoke of communism and move toward democracy. In an era where we have emerged as a superpower, the world looks to us for leadership, inspiration, and our values. When we curtail individual rights, other nations follow suit and democracy and human rights suffer.  I have sent a letter to the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah. I have asked Senator Hatch to reschedule a hearing for Mr. William Haynes whose nomination is currently on the calendar. Mr. Haynes, now more than ever, must answer these important questions about the role he played as general counsel at the Pentagon. If he had nothing to do with this policy, he can make that eminently clear, but if he did have something to do with it, I think we need the answers to these questions before we, in good conscience, are asked to vote to support his nomination to the second highest court in America.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
