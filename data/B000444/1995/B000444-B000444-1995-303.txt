 President, everything my friend from Montana said up to a moment ago was basically correct when he said how are the donor States going to feel having another way to spend more money? No more money can be spent for this amendment, No. 1. No. 2, we are a donor State. We are for it. No. 3, the idea that somehow there are other ways to spend the money meaning that we are going to be taking money from one State and spending it another State is not accurate. I do not think he meant to say that. He may have left that impression.
