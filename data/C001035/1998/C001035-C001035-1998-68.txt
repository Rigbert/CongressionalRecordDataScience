President, for the information of all Senators, when the Senate reconvenes tomorrow at 9:30 a.m., there will be a period of morning business until 10:30 a.m. Following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of S. 1415, the tobacco legislation, with several amendments still pending. It is hoped that short time agreements can be reached on these amendments so that remaining amendments to this important bill may be offered and debated.  As a reminder to all Members, a cloture motion was filed by the minority leader to the tobacco committee substitute. Under rule XXII, Senators have until 1 p.m. on Friday to file first-degree amendments to the modified tobacco committee substitute. The leader has announced there will be no rollcall votes during Friday's session. Therefore, the cloture vote and any votes ordered with respect to the tobacco bill during tomorrow's session will be postponed to occur at a later date.  As always, Members will be notified of the voting schedule next week as soon as it becomes available.                          ____________________
