 Congress has not kept that promise on that unfunded mandate. Today, we are providing a little over 17 percent of the costs of special education, and that percentage has gone down over the last 3 years. The result is higher and higher property taxes for the middle-class and working families of our country.  This amendment is very simple. It rescinds the 2001 personal income tax reduction that was given to people with at least $1 million in income--the wealthiest three-tenths of 1 percent of the population--and puts the $44 billion raised over 5 years into special education.  Madam President, 99.7 percent of Americans would see no increase in their Federal taxes from this amendment. But it would lower property taxes for millions of middle-class and working families, improve the quality of education and, most importantly, keep the promise made to school districts all over this country.
