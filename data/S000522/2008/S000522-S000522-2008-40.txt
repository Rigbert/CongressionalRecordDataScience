Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Res. 1230, which conveys a very clear and unmistakable condemnation of the violence we have seen in Zimbabwe following the elections in that country. I strongly support the resolution's call for a peaceful solution to the grave crisis there today.  If anyone had a doubt about the regime of Robert Mugabe before thismost recent wave of government-inspired violence, surely this thug has dispelled it now.  Mugabe has clamped down on the press and has thwarted the assembly of the opposition, detaining his opposition figures on numerous occasions. We have heard gut-wrenching testimony and seen gruesome pictures of the intimidation, the violence and the torture of those who disagree with this dictator.  And there are credible reports that some 36 people have been murdered by those loyal to Mugabe.  The opposition candidate, Morgan Tsvangirai, was courageous to return to his country, but we have all held our breath as Mugabe's forces have detained him several times.  No one feels safe in Zimbabwe today, Madam Speaker. Even United States diplomats attempting to monitor the regime's abuses have been harassed, their access to public places restricted.  Mugabe has even stooped to the pilfering of food aid and has halted international relief operations.  With a run-off election scheduled for June 27, we need to send a message, a good, strong, bipartisan message, that we in the United States and the world expect fair, peaceful balloting. The will of the people must be heard.  I ask the support of my colleagues for this resolution and pledge my support for the people of Zimbabwe in these very difficult times.  I reserve the balance of my time.
