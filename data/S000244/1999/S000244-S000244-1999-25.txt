Speaker, my good friend from Texas (Mr. Doggett) has a very short memory. He tells the House and the American people to give us a Democratic majority and we will show them what we can do. Mr. Speaker, I remember the last time there was a Democratic majority and the Speaker from Texas, and the House passed no appropriations bills at all by the 30th of September, and all 13 appropriation bills ended up being put in one huge massive and continuing resolution that the President of the United States, Ronald Reagan, plunked on that desk there, stack after stack after stack, and said no way will I ever sign one of those continuing resolutions again.  Now that is what happened the last time there was a Democratic majority, and I hope that we never have that happen again under either a Republican or Democratic majority.                          ____________________
