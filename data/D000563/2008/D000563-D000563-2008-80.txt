President, today I am introducing the Great Lakes Conservation Education Act.  From orbit in space, the Great Lakes are the most recognizable feature of the North American landscape. And no wonder. The Great Lakes are the largest single source of fresh surface water in the world. They hold 90 percent of America's fresh surface water. They hold 20 percent of the world's fresh surface water.  Forty-two million people call the Great Lakes basin home and rely on it for clean, safe water.  What is not evident from space, though, is the trash and other debris that litter the shorelines of the Great Lakes. Debris, in fact, is one of the most pervasive pollution problems affecting America's waterways. Debris detracts from the beauty of our Nation's coasts, threatens freshwater life, poses public health and safety concerns, and interferes with commercial and recreational boats and ships.  Over the weekend, I participated in the Adopt-a-Beach clean-up on Lake Michigan. We started at Montrose Beach, stopped at both North Ave. and the 12th Street Beaches, and worked our way down to the 57th Street Beach. It was heartening to meet so many people who are committed to cleaning up the lake.  The Adopt-a-Beach program is one volunteer effort to clean up the beaches of the Great Lakes and increase public awareness of the seriousness of the litter problem. The program is run by the Alliance for the Great Lakes, a group dedicated to the conservation and restoration of this national treasure.  Adopt-a-Beach began in Illinois in 2002 and has quickly spread to neighboring states. It is a year-round program, but its chief event is a beach clean-up day each September, coordinated with the Ocean Conservancy's annual International Coastal Clean-up.  Citizens, organizations, and businesses are working together on efforts to restore the Great Lakes shorelines clean. We need to expand on these efforts and educate people throughout the Great Lakes about how they can help to cleanup and restore the lakes.  That is why I am introducing the Great Lakes Conservation Education Act. This bill would authorize a new program within the Department of Commerce to provide funding for non-governmental organizations, museums, school, consortiums, and others to support conservation education and outreach programs to restore the Great Lakes.  I am looking forward to working with my colleagues to make this program a reality. We have a long way to go to restore the lakes and this legislation will make it possible for organizations through out the Great Lakes to educate students, teachers, and the general public about the steps they can take to improve the lakes.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3622       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
