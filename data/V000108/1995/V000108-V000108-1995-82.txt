Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the past commanders and auxiliary presidents of the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 2151. On April 8, 1995, V.F.W. Post 2151 will hold a commemorative dinner at their Post in Gary, IN, to honor their past officers.  The past commanders of V.F.W. Post 2151 include: Harold James, Otha Williams, Dan L. Williams, Joe Dishmon, Bob Wilson, Jesse Rogers, Bill Woodard, William Rapier, Lee G. Coleman, and Virgil Fields.  The past auxiliary presidents for V.F.W. Post 2151 include: Bertha Harvey, Dorothy Jordan, Bessie Jones, Prestine Fontleroy, Ada Williams, Jennie Young, Mary Clay, Elouise Woodard, Jessie M. Shackelford, Doris Daniels, Mary Pendelton, Mattie Gault, Lula Marshall, Doris Daniels, Verlee Perry, and Vanessa Jenkins.  These former commanders and auxiliary presidents have been dedicated to preserving the memory of the service of the U.S. soldiers to defend our country in foreign wars. Because of the V.F.W.'s efforts in the preservation of the history of the United States and foreign affairs policy, our citizens can learn from past experience in hopes for a better world.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other colleagues to join me in commemorating these honorable men and women of V.F.W. Post 2151 for their dedicated service to our great country.                          ____________________
