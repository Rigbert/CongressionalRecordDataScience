DeMINT. No, I won't. It reveals to you the true motives of the majority. If we look at this bill and this eventual health care bill--if we ever have time to see it before they try to pass it--we are beginning to see a real glimpse, a true picture of where this Democratic majority is going.  Finally, this bill increases funding for title X family planning services, of which Planned Parenthood is the largest recipient. Planned Parenthood is the Nation's largest provider of abortions. Increasingly, they are what we call directed abortions. When people come to Planned Parenthood and look for advice on family planning, they are more often than not encouraged and pushed toward abortion.  All around this bill, you see what is going on. It is a major change in policy--not to make abortion available but to make Americans pay for it and to promote it.  I, along with 34 of my colleagues in the Senate, signed and sent a letter to the majority leader regarding the troubling anti-life policies in this omnibus bill. Collectively, we vowed to speak out to protect the longstanding Federal funding limitations on abortion--a belief that has enjoyed broad bipartisan support for many years.  For this reason, as well as a number of other values issues that are irresponsibly addressed in this legislation, I support Senator McCain to raise a point of order against the omnibus under rule XXVIII of the Standing Rules of the Senate. I urge my colleagues to do the same.  I remind my colleagues that a vote against the McCain point of order is a vote to force American taxpayers to promote and pay for abortions. It is plain and simple. I am sure there will be a lot of smoke and mirrors after my talk that will try to convince you that is not true. But it is in the legislation and it will happen. We need to stop it.  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.
