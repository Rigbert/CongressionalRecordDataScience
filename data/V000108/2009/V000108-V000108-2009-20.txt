The parishioners, along with Parish Priest, Father Marko Matic, and Parish President, Mr. Dennis Svilar, will be celebrating this very momentous occasion on Sunday, November 8, 2009. Festivities will begin with Divine Liturgy, followed by a banquet and program featuring Mr. Nicholas Chabraja as the guest speaker. This special event will take place at Saint Elijah Hall in Merrillville, Indiana.  Saint Sava Serbian Orthodox Church, which was founded in Gary, Indiana, and is now located in Merrillville is one of the Midwest's oldest parishes. The tradition of Saint Sava's is well-known throughout Northwest Indiana because of the continued efforts of the clergy and parishioners over the past 95 years to perpetuate the Serbian Orthodox faith and traditions. In 1914, the founders proclaimed the mission of their new church before the Secretary of State in Indianapolis, Indiana. Their mission is as follows: ``The purpose of this parish is to preach the Word of God (the Lord Jesus) and take spiritual care of its members; to spread goodness, justice, brotherly love, and respect among its members.''  Named for Saint Sava, the first Archbishop of the Serbian church, Saint Sava's first formal church-school congregation was organized in 1914, followed by the first church in 1915. From there, the parishioners built the first church and school on 20th Avenue and Connecticut Street in Gary. Through difficult economic times, the parishioners at Saint Sava continued with their mission, and after the Great Depression, the parish built an even larger church, school, and parish hall on 13th Avenue and Connecticut in Gary in order to accommodate their rapidly growing membership. This building remained until a devastating fire consumed it in February of 1978, causing Saint Sava's to quickly relocate to a newly constructed chapel in a parish hall they had built years earlier. This hall, located in Hobart, Indiana, had been utilized as a place for summer meetings and family picnics.  From 1978 until 1991, Saint Sava's Liturgy continued to be performed in the Hobart chapel. However, it was during this time that longtime parish priest, Very Reverend Father Jovan Todorovich, and the church boardbegan to assemble ideas for the construction of a new church. With Father Todorovich's leadership and committed efforts, as well as the vast efforts of many parishioners, the people of Saint Sava were able to move into their current place of worship. In May of 1991, the parish celebrated a ``new beginning'' when a brand new building was constructed. This magnificent building opened in Merrillville, where relics which survived the fire were blessed and installed into the new church. Today, Saint Sava's members continue to gather there to worship and to celebrate, as well as to continue with the mission of their founding members.  Madam Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring and congratulating Saint Sava Serbian Orthodox Church on their 95th anniversary. Throughout many hardships and trials, the members of Saint Sava have dedicated themselves to providing a spiritual and guiding light through the protection of the Serbian Orthodox faith and traditions for all of Northwest Indiana. Their constant dedication and commitment is worthy of the highest commendation.                          ____________________
