 President, today, Senator Lugar and I are introducing the Naval Vessel Transfer Act of 2008, a bill to permit the transfer of certain U.S. Navy vessels to particular foreign countries. All of the proposed ship transfer authorizations have been requested by the U.S. Navy, with the approval of the Office of Management and Budget.  Pursuant to section 824(b) of the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1994, as amended, 10 U.S.C. 7307(a), a naval vessel that is in excess of 3,000 tons or that is less than 20 years of age may not be disposed of to another nation unless the disposition of that vessel is approved by law enacted after August 5, 1974. The bill we introduce today would provide that required approval for six transfers: a guided missile frigate for Pakistan; two minehunter coastal ships for Greece; an oiler for Chile; and two amphibious tank landing ships for Peru. These would all be grant transfers under section 516 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2321j). If any Member of this body has questions or concerns regarding one or more of the proposed ship transfers, please let us know.  The bill also contains provisions that are traditionally included in ship transfer bills, relating to transfer costs and repair and refurbishment of the ships, and exempting the value of a vessel transferred on a grant basis from the aggregate value of excess defense articles in a given fiscal year.  The authority provided by this bill would expire 2 years after the date of enactment of the bill.  Finally, the Department of Defense has provided the following information on this bill:       These proposed transfers would improve the United States'      political and military relationships with close allies. They      would support strategic engagement goals and regional      security cooperation objectives. Active use of former naval      vessels by coalition forces in support of regional priorities      is more advantageous than retaining vessels in the Navy's      inactive fleet and disposing of them by scrapping or another      method.       The United States would incur no costs in transferring      these naval vessels. The recipients would be responsible for      all costs associated with the transfers, including      maintenance, repairs, training, and fleet turnover costs.       This act does not alter the effect of the Toxic Substances      Control Act, or any other law, with regard to their      applicability to the transfer of ships by the U.S. to foreign      countries for military or humanitarian use. The laws and      regulations that apply today would apply in the same manner      if this section were enacted.  The Secretary of the Navy, the Honorable Donald C. Winter, has added: ``Expeditious enactment of the proposal is in the best interests of the Navy's Maritime Strategy as it will allow us to strengthen the capabilities of partner nations.''  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3052       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Naval Vessel Transfer Act of      2008''.     SEC. 2. TRANSFER OF NAVAL VESSELS TO CERTAIN FOREIGN                    RECIPIENTS.       (a) Transfers by Grant.--The President is authorized to      transfer vessels to foreign recipients on a grant basis under      section 516 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C.      2321j), as follows:       (1) Pakistan.--To the Government of Pakistan, the OLIVER      HAZARD PERRY class guided missile frigate MCINERNEY (FFG-8).

(b) Grants Not Counted in Annual Total of Transferred      Excess Defense Articles.--The value of a vessel transferred      to a recipient on a grant basis pursuant to authority      provided by subsection (a) shall not be counted against the      aggregate value of excess defense articles transferred in any      fiscal year under section 516 of the Foreign Assistance Act      of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2321j).       (c) Costs of Transfers.--Any expense incurred by the United      States in connection with a transfer authorized by this      section     shall be charged to the recipient (notwithstanding section      516(e) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C.      2321j(e))).       (d) Repair and Refurbishment in United States Shipyards.--     To the maximum extent practicable, the President shall      require, as a condition of the transfer of a vessel under      this section, that the recipient to which the vessel is      transferred have such repair or refurbishment of the vessel      as is needed, before the vessel joins the naval forces of the      recipient, performed at a shipyard located in the United      States, including a United States Navy shipyard.       (e) Expiration of Authority.--The authority to transfer a      vessel under this section shall expire at the end of the 2-     year period beginning on the date of the enactment of this      Act.                                 ______                                       By
