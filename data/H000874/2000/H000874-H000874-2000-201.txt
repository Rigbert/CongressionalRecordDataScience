Chairman. I did not intend to speak, but I went to Suitland High School, so I went to high school 5 minutes from this Census facility.  I have been around for a long time, and graduated from high school over 40 years ago. Those buildings were in need of repair at the time I graduated from high school in 1957. They were built, of course, during the war as temporary facilities.  I appreciate the gentleman's making a comment on that for the quality of life of our Federal employees who work there, and I appreciate very much the chairman yielding me the time to make that comment, and his focus on that issue.
