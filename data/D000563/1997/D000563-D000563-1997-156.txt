President, this amendment has been reviewed by both sides. Senator Thurmond, as chairman of the committee, and Senator Levin, as the ranking minority member, have accepted this amendment. It relates to the issue of burdensharing. It is an amendment which would not withdraw any troops, but would ask that our allies assume greater responsibility in helping to defray the expenses of the American troops which have been positioned overseas.  The amendment, I think, accurately reflects the postcold-war environment and the budget challenges which we face.  I yield back the balance of my time.
