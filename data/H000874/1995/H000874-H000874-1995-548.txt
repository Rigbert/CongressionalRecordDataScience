Chairman, the current welfare system is at odds with the care values Americans share: work, opportunity, family, and responsibility.  Too many people who hate being on welfare are trying to escape it--with too little success.  It is time for a fundamental change.  Instead of strengthening families and instilling personal responsibility, the system penalizes two parent families, and lets too many absent parents who owe child support off the hook.  Our society can not--and should not--afford a social welfare system without obligations.  It is long past time to ``end welfare as we know it.''  We need to move beyond political rhetoric, and offer a simple compact that provides people more opportunity in return for more responsibility.  I have a few commonsense criteria which any welfare plan must meet to get my vote.  It must require all able-bodied recipients to work for their benefits.  It must require teenage mothers to live at home or other supervised setting.  It must create a child support enforcement system with teeth so that deadbeat parents support their children.  It must establish a time limit so that welfare benefits are only a temporary means of support.  It must be tough on those who have defrauded the system--but not on innocent children.  And it must give States flexibility to shape their welfare system to their needs, while upholding the important national objectives I have just listed.  The Republican bill fails to meet these criteria.  The Republican bill is weak on work.  It only requires 4 percent participation in fiscal year 1996, far below the current rate established under the 1988 Family Support Act.  It is outrageous that any new work requirement would fall below current law.  The Republican bill denies benefits to children of mothers under 18.  We must make parents--all parents--responsible for taking care of their own children.  But denying children support is not the best way to do that.  Instead, teenagers should be required to demonstrate responsibility by living at home and staying in school in order to receive assistance.  The Republican bill is tougher on children than it is on the deadbeat dads who leave them behind.  The Republicans waited until the last moment to put child support enforcement provisions in their bill--and then removed the teeth that can bring in more than $2.5 billion (over 10 years) for kids.  Instead of attacking deadbeats, the Republican bill attacks children.  It eliminates the guarantee that every child in this country has at least one good meal a day.  Despite rhetoric to the contrary, the Republican bill cuts spending for child nutrition programs $7 billion below the [[Page H3364]] funding that would be provided by current law.  Instead, kids' food money will be used for tax cuts for the rich.  Funding for the Women, Infants and Children Program is also reduced--and provisions requiring competitive bidding on baby formula have been removed.  That decision alone will take $1 billion of food out of the mouths of children each year, and put the money in the pockets of big business.  This simply defies common sense.  No one in America could possibly argue that this is reform.  At a time when the need for foster care, group homes, and adoption is likely to rise dramatically, the Republican welfare plan would cut Federal support for foster care and adoption by $4 billion over 5 years.  We can do better.  We must do better.  This week, Democrats will offer Nathan Deal's bill as a substitute, which reinforces the family values all Americans share.  It gives people access to the skills they need, and expects work in return.  It does not wage war on America's children.  Most importantly, it is a common-sense approach, which gives back the dignity that comes with work, personal responsibility, and independence.                              {time}  1730
