Keith Yoder of Kalamazoo, Michigan for his 32 years of distinguished public service with the Social Security Administration.  Keith began his career with Social Security in July 1975 as a Claims Authorizer in Philadelphia, PA. While it would take 25 years for Keith to make his way to our corner of Southwest Michigan, he continued to develop an impressive professional track record throughout Indiana and Michigan.  Over the past 7 years, Keith has managed the Social Security field office in Kalamazoo, from which he and his staff have faithfully served the residents of Allegan, Kalamazoo and St. Joseph counties. During an age in which government bureaucracy has too often become synonymous with the impersonal and lethargic, Keith and, under direction, his team have always been a reliable, informative and affable resource for my constituents and staff. His support of shelter-based and follow-up assistance to the Hurricane Katrina evacuees who made their way to my district in 2005 serves as a testament to both the good will and dedication that characterize his career.  Once again, I would like to personally congratulate and thank Keith Yoder for his many years of public service to the citizens of this great country. Southwest Michigan is truly a better place because of his contributions.                          ____________________
