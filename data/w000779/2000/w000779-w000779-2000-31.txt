President, I wish to take a moment to pay tribute to Jim Hurd, the founding CEO of Planar Systems, who passed away this summer after a year-long battle with leukemia. Jim was a pioneering technical and business leader in the U.S. flat panel industry, and led Planar Systems of Beaverton, Oregon to become one of the largest flat panel display companies in the U.S. and Europe. Jim was actively involved at the national level in helping to shape federal policy on flat panel displays, and worked on the national flat panel initiative and in the formation of consortia to address critical issues for the flat panel display industry.  Mr. Hurd was a leader in Oregon's business community, serving as the Chair of the Oregon Council of the American Electronics Association. During his term in 1992, he helped develop the Oregon technical benchmark annual survey and conference. He was also active in supporting technical education efforts in Oregon, and was a member of the Board of Trustees of the Oregon Graduate Institute. For services to the industry and community, the American Electronics Association awarded Jim Oregon's technology executive of the year award in 1993.  A native of the Pacific Northeast, Jim was born in 1948 in Spokane, and grew up in Kennewick, Washington. He received his bachelors's degree in physics from Lewis & Clark College in Portland in 1970, where he met his wife Alice. Jim joined Tektronics Corporation soon after graduation. In 1983, Jim left Tektronics to co-found Planar Systems with Chris King and John Laney. Today, Planer employs over 850 people in the United States. Jim also lent his wisdom to help other start-up companies achieve success by serving on the Board of the Oregon Resource and Technology Development Fund, a state-sponsored venture capital fund.  Jim had a rare ability to balance his successful professional life with an active private life that included mountain climbing, running, bicycling, tennis, scuba diving and a love for auto racing. He was a wonderful husband to Alice and a terrific father to his sons, Owen and Peter.  Mr. Hurd will be missed by all of us who knew him.                          ____________________
