 President, I rise to introduce the Senior Reserve Officers' Training Corps Eligibility Reform Act of 2001. I believe this bill will shore up the military's ability to recruit and retain qualified junior officers. This legislation will reform our college level Reserve Officer Training Corps Units by expanding eligibility for those programs.  This bill contains two primary provisions which will alter the way in which ROTC determines eligibility. First, it will allow active duty enlisted personnel, who have been selected for an officer commissioning program, to participate in ROTC training. These enlisted personnel are already on college campuses and are attached administratively to an ROTC unit. Their tuition is paid by their respective service and they earn their regular active duty pay while earning their degree. However, these enlisted personnel do not normally begin their formal officer training until after earning their degree when they attend their respective service's officer candidate school. On average, our military's officer candidate schools are three months long. This legislation would permit these personnel to complete their officer training at the ROTC unit which serves the college or university they are attending. This would be a more equitable use of an officer candidate's time and would decrease the time and cost associated with training. Additionally, it will free up positions at officer training schools and significantly increase their ability to cope with fluctuations in the number of officer recruits.  Second, this legislation increases the maximum age for participation in ROTC scholarship programs from 27 to 35. In other words, if a cadet or midshipman can complete their degree and earn their commission, by the maximum legal commissioning age of 35, they should be able to earn a scholarship which will pay for that education. This provision will allow the services to use scholarship money to cover the entire commissioning envelope. Our military recruiters will be able to provide financial incentives to an older yet valuable age group. I have been told that officer trainees in the 27 to 35 age group are more mature and focused and are less likely to try to back out of their service commitment.  This legislation is one small initiative in our effort to rebuild the morale and readiness of our armed forces. Whether they be infantry commanders, pilots, submariners, intelligence analysts or information technology specialists, our junior officer ranks are depleted across the spectrum. In conjunction with the service academies and officer candidate schools, the ROTC scholarship program has been the backbone of our military's ability to train and commission high quality junior officers. My proposal today would merely expand this established program to include regular active duty personnel and an older and more seasoned citizenry. Overall, I believe that this bill will help the military to commission more junior officers, especially those with valuable prior enlisted service. I urge my colleagues to support it.                                 ______                                       By
