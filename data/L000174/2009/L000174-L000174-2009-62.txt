President, I wish to respond to some of the things the distinguished Senator from Alabama has said. To call this the first filibuster of a judicial matter this year is not totally accurate. We have people who are confirmed unanimously after being blocked for month after month by the Republican side, who then says: But we didn't filibuster.
