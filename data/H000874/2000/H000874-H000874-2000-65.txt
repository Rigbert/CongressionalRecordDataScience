 The contributions made by HBCUs to the African American community, to our country, and to our culture cannot be overstated.  As President Clinton noted in proclaiming the week of September 17 as HBCU Week, ``Generations of African American educators, physicians, lawyers, scientists, and other professionals found at HBCUs the knowledge, experience and encouragement they needed to reach their full potential.''  The alumni rolls of HBCUs are very long. They include two very distinguished, extraordinary Americans, Martin Luther King, Jr., and Booker T. Washington. In addition, they include a number of my colleagues who will be joining me today.  Today, Madam Speaker, Historically Black Colleges and Universities comprise about three percent of all colleges and universities. However, they confer nearly 30 percent of all bachelor's degrees awarded each year to African Americans.  HBCUs, Historically Black Colleges, also confer the majority of bachelor's degrees and advance degrees awarded to black students in the physical sciences, mathematics, computer sciences, engineering, and education. More than half of all African American professionals, including 70 percent of African American dentists and physicians, graduated from Historically Black institutions.  The real story, Madam Speaker, that underlies these figures is the story of hope and opportunity. We cannot, we should not, we must not run from our history no matter how painful, no matter how disgraceful.  Before the Supreme Court's landmark decision in Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, African Americans were routinely and wrongly excluded from institutions of higher learning. It did not matter how smart they were. It did not matter how much talent or potential they had. The only thing, tragically, that mattered was the color of their skin.  But out of that rank injustice, that indefensible racism, was born a fortitude and a determination to rise above, to overcome, to overcome through education. Thus, the first black college, which is now known as Cheyney University in Cheyney, Pennsylvania, was founded in 1837.  To appreciate the magnitude of this, remember that Cheyney was created a full 28 years before the ratification of the 13th amendment established to train free blacks to become school teachers.  Today Cheyney is one of the 105 HBCUs that continue to serve with great pride as an avenue for African Americans to attend college and indeed for other Americans to attend college, as well.  Four of those Historically Black Colleges are located in the State of Maryland, including Bowie State University in my own district, which was founded in 1865. Bowie State University is the oldest Historically Black University in Maryland. The others, Madam Speaker, are Morgan State, Coppin State, both in Baltimore, and the University of Maryland Eastern Shore.  Shortly, I will be joined by my colleague, the gentleman from Maryland(Mr. Cummings), a graduate of Morgan State, who will join me in this special order.  I want to make specific note of the four presidents of those distinguished institutions: Dr. Calvin Burnett, president of Coppin State College; Dr. Earl Richardson, with whom I had the privilege of being today, president of Morgan State University; and Dr. Dolores Spikes, president of the University of Maryland Eastern Shore.  Our newest president is the president of Bowie State University, which I just mentioned, Dr. Calvin Lowe.  Madam Speaker, let me say, as a current member of the Board of Regents of the University of Maryland systems, as someone acutely interested in education and the needs of our youth, I see the manifest vision and the determination of HBCUs practically every day. I see it in the faces of the young people in my district who know that they will have the opportunity to develop their skills and talent, whether they choose Bowie State University, the University of Maryland College Park, or any other school. I see it in the faces of young professionals who have attended an HBCU and who are now working hard to build their careers and contribute to our society. And I see it in the faces of those here tonight who appreciate the unique role and history of Historically Black Colleges and Universities and who understand the importance of their continued vibrancy.                              {time}  1945  In the past 20 years, at least 10 Historically Black Colleges and Universities have closed. Others, Madam Speaker, face financial hardship. We have in my opinion in this House a duty to help them, and not just with dollars, though dollars are very important. The bottom line, adequate funding, will continue to be important. But we must also recognize, Madam Speaker, that our strength as a Nation lies not just in the quality of the University of Maryland at College Park or any of the other great universities but in the excellence of another great university, Bowie State, Morgan, Coppin, the University of Maryland Eastern Shore, and the institutions from which so many of our distinguished colleagues have graduated. We must realize that while we celebrate the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, we also must take joy in the accomplishments and excellence of North Carolina A  Historically Black Colleges have strengthened our country and enriched our culture beyond measure. They have nurtured and fostered the talents of millions. And while they can take great pride in their glorious past, it is incumbent on all of us to ensure that they enjoy an even brighter future.  Madam Speaker, I had the opportunity of meeting with Dr. Richardson, as I said, and many other presidents of Historically Black Colleges. They brought up some critical issues with which this Congress must deal. I am sure that my colleagues will join me in doing so to ensure the continued vibrancy and success of these extraordinary institutions.  Madam Speaker, I am now privileged to yield to my good friend, distinguished colleague and graduate of Howard University. I said Morgan, but Howard, University. He is on the board of regents at Morgan State University, the distinguished gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cummings).
