President, I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer, the Senator from Kansas.  An editorial this morning in the New York Times is entitled: ``Why Does Donald Trump Lie About Voting Fraud?'' This is the editorial of which I speak. That is a question that many of us who have been fighting for the right to vote have been asking for decades. In a bipartisan fashion, this Congress reauthorized the Voting Rights Act 10 years ago. During the course of many, many, many Senate and House Judiciary Committee hearings, we fought against the false narrative that in-person voting fraud was at all common in our country. The evidence clearly and irrefutably shows that it is not, but, of course, the evidence does not stop those who are determined to make it harder for Americans to cast their votes.  Right after five Justices on the Supreme Court gutted the core protection of the bipartisan Voting Rights Act, several States led by Republican majorities enacted voting restrictions that made it harder for many Americans to vote.  It is most troubling that our President-elect has decided to make an unfounded charge of widespread voting fraud. I can imagine that he is disappointed in the fact that he got 2.5 million less votes than his opponent and did not win the support of a majority of Americans who voted last month. We should all hope that when our next President is presented with unfavorable realities, he will not resort to spreading information that has no basis in fact. That cannot and should never be the standard of American leadership.  In an article published in the Valley News of West Lebanon, NH, and reprinted this morning in VTDigger, researchers at Dartmouth explored President-Elect Trump's allegation of widespread voting fraud, and they found nothing to support his claim, noting ``voter fraud concerns fomented and espoused by the Trump campaign are not grounded in any observable features of the 2016 Presidential election.'' Many other analyses have also made this crystal clear.  In a report to Congress, the Government Accountability Office concluded that ``no apparent cases of in-person voter impersonation [were] charged by DOJ's Criminal Division or by U.S. Attorney's offices anywhere in the United States from 2004 through July 3, 2014.'' That is the reality. The President-elect should not continue to peddle lies about voter fraud.  I say that because this year we have seen a dangerous uptick in what some call ``fake news.'' These articles have no basis of reality or factual evidence, but they are broadly circulated because they affirm a particular ideology or because they are a proven way to make a quick buck by drawing the attention of unsuspecting online readers. Fake news stories get attention and clicks. We saw what happened when a man walks into a pizza place in the District of Columbia where children often congregate and fires a rifle because of one of these fake news stories he had read.  Some consider this despicable propaganda to be harmless, but it is certainly not without its victims. We know that the spread of lies through fake news can have real-world consequences, even for the public's faith in the Republic itself. There is no doubt that this is the way Russia sees it.  In conclusion, it should not be too much to ask our elected officials to operate on facts and reality. We will have many debates over policy in the years to come, as we should, but Americans deserve leaders who refuse to peddle in lies for political gain.  I call on leaders from both sides of the political aisle to no longer defend the indefensible.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the New York Times editorial be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, Dec. 5, 2016]              Why Does Donald Trump Lie About Voter Fraud?                        (By the Editorial Board)       The long-running Republican war against the right to vote      has now gone national at the instigation of President-elect      Donald Trump, who has promoted the lie that millions of      illegal votes were cast in the presidential election.       There is not a scintilla of evidence for this claim, and      Mr. Trump's own lawyers have admitted as much, stating in a      court filing opposing a recount in Michigan that ``all      available evidence suggests that the 2016 general election      was not tainted by fraud or mistake.''       Yet one after the next, leading Republicans are spreading      this slander of American democracy, smoothing the way to      restrict voting rights across the country.       On Sunday, Vice President-elect Mike Pence told ABC's      George Stephanopoulos that it was Mr. Trump's ``right to      express his opinion as president-elect.'' When pushed to      admit that the illegal-voting claim was not true, Mr. Pence      shifted the burden of proof away from Mr. Trump, even though      Mr. Trump has accused millions of Americans of committing a      crime. ``Look,'' Mr. Pence said, ``I don't know that that's a      false statement, George, and neither do you.''       Paul Ryan, speaker of the House, told CBS's ``60 Minutes,''      ``I have no knowledge of such things,'' before defending Mr.      Trump's claims as ``giving voice to a lot of people who have      felt that they were voiceless.'' (As recently as October, Mr.      Ryan's spokeswoman noted that ``our democracy relies on      confidence in election results'' and that Mr. Ryan was      ``fully confident the states will carry out this election      with integrity.'')       Reince Priebus, currently the chairman of the Republican      National Committee and Mr. Trump's pick for chief of staff,      told CBS's John Dickerson that ``no one really knows'' if      millions of people voted illegally. ``It's possible.'' It's      equally true that no one really knows for sure that Reince      Priebus wasn't snatched away and replaced with a doppelgonger      hatched by aliens--it's possible, isn't it?       This is how voter suppression efforts start. First come the      unverified tales of fraud; then come the urgent calls to      tighten voter registration rules and increase ``ballot      security,'' which translate into laws that disenfranchise      tens or hundreds of thousands of qualified voters.       That's already happened in Wisconsin and North Carolina, in      Ohio and Texas, where Republican lawmakers pushed through      bills requiring voter IDs or proof of citizenship;      eliminating early-voting days and same-day registration; and      imposing other measures. Virtually all these laws aimed at      making voting harder for citizens who happen to be members of      groups that tend to support Democrats.       While federal courts have struck down some of these laws,      more keep popping up. In Michigan, lawmakers are pushing to      fast-track a voter-ID requirement even though there was no      evidence of voter impersonation there. In New Hampshire, the      incoming governor, Chris Sununu, wants to do away with same-     day registration, also despite the lack of any evidence that      it resulted in fraud.       Reality is beside the point. Dallas Woodhouse, the      executive director of the North Carolina Republican Party,      recently told The New Republic, ``Whether there's widespread      voter fraud or not, the people believe there is.'' It doesn't      seem to matter to G.O.P. leaders that election officials      around the country of both parties have confirmed that there      was no fraud on Election Day. What matters to them, as      strategists have long known, is that Republicans do better      when fewer people vote.       Under a Trump administration, anti-voter efforts could      become national in scope--through congressional legislation,      a hostile Justice Department or a Supreme Court nominee with      little regard for voting rights.       Undermining the integrity of the electoral process and      making it harder to vote is threatening to all Americans,      regardless of party. The cynical Republicans now in power      figure that all they have to do is fool the public long      enough to win the next election. It's outrageous, but it's      hard to see why they would stop when lying has gotten them      this far.
