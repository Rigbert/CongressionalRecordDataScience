Leader, is the unemployment compensation extension. As the gentleman knows by the efforts that the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cardin) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Rangel) have been making, this is of great concern to us.  Does the leader have any expectation that the unemployment compensation extension will be on the floor next week?  Mr. DeLAY. If the gentleman will yield further, I want to make sure that the gentleman is referring to the program that was created as a result of the economic impact of 9/11. The Federal unemployment insurance program that existed for decades is still around, and people need to understand is still around and working well. So it seems to me that if the gentleman and Members of this body are actually interested in a broad expansion of the unemployment insurance program, I would hope that those Members would work with the chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means and move it through regular order so that every Member of this body ultimately could have some impact on that piece of legislation, that very important legislation.
