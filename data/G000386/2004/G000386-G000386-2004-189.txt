 President, I want to assure Senator Lincoln that I will continue to work with her to make sure adequate incentives for LFG are included in any final package from the upcoming House-Senate conference. Her concerns are my concerns as well. She has stated them well and I will devote my best efforts to resolving them as we move forward on discussions and deliberations with the House of Representatives.                             car provision
