 President, in Kentucky's oldest town sits a beautiful and historic building on the top of a hill. Beaumont Inn, with its name taken from the French for ``beautiful mount,'' is my State's oldest Southern country inn. The Harrodsburg establishment is a beacon of hospitality with a distinguished history, and I would like to take a moment to mark the centennial anniversary of this treasured Kentucky landmark.  When the main building of today's Beaumont Inn was constructed around 1845, no one could have perceived the incredible future in store, but then again, the location had already had a notable history. An original wooden structure on the site was believed to be the childhood home of John Marshall Harlan, future Kentucky attorney general and Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.  For many years afterward, the site served as a series of schools for women, including the Greenville Institute, the Daughters College, and finally as Beaumont College until 1916. The next year, the grounds were purchased by an alumna of the Daughters College, Annie Bell Goddard, and her husband Glave. In 1919, the Goddards opened the new 31-room Beaumont Inn, and the same family has proudly operated this wonderful Kentucky establishment ever since.  Throughout the next century, Glave and Annie Bell's descendants have welcomed countless guests to the inn, preserving this historic building, its picturesque scenery, and the tradition ofSouthern hospitality. Beaumont Inn grew, both in physical size and in prestige, even earning inclusion onto the National Register of Historic Places. Some of the new buildings include the Greystone House, Bell Cottage, and Goddard Hall, which honors Beaumont's founder. Not only is the inn a charming destination, but it is also a museum filled with interesting artifacts of Kentucky and American history. Today, the inn is operated by the fourth and fifth generation of the Goddard family, Chuck and Helen Dedman and their son, Dixon.  It is beyond question that quality cuisine is a vital aspect of all Southern hospitality. As a pinnacle of a traditional Bluegrass experience, Beaumont Inn sets a high bar. Visitors are drawn to its main dining room by the famous ``yellow-legged'' fried chicken and 2-year-old Kentucky-cured country ham. The inn's cornmeal batter cakes are a breakfast favorite. In recognition of its culinary excellence, Beaumont Inn has earned some of the highest accolades in this field, including the America's Class Award from the James Beard Foundation. Visitors can also enjoy a Kentucky bourbon at the Owl's Nest lounge or at the Old Owl Tavern, named one of the best bourbon bars in America. As Kentucky leads the Nation in a bourbon revival, the inn has also become an official stop of the Kentucky Bourbon Trail. These amenities reaffirm the strong bonds between this historic institution and one of the Commonwealth's signature industries. In fact, the New York Times published an article about the storied history of Kentucky Owl Bourbon, recently revived by the Dedman family.  I look forward to my next visit to Beaumont Inn, and I would like to thank the Dedman family for their tireless efforts to preserve this Kentucky treasure. Their stewardship of this historic site and long-term vision helps connect our Commonwealth's past to its bright future. As Beaumont Inn celebrates 100 years of excellence, I would like to extend my best wishes to the Dedmans, the staff, and all who enjoy this beloved institution.                          ____________________
