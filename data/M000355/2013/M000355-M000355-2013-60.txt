 He was the first Republican to be elected to the Senate from Mississippi since Reconstruction. A few years ago he was named by Time magazine as one of the 10 most effective Members of the Senate, and they called him ``the quiet persuader.''  For those of you who have recently arrived at the Senate, if you have not had any dealings with Senator Cochran yet, you will find that indeed he is the quiet persuader. In fact, it may be the secret to his success.  He has had an extraordinarily accomplished career here in the Senate, and I wanted to take a few moments to congratulate him, not only on his service to his State and the Nation but to our institution.
