President, I want to take a moment to recognize the achievements and contributions of a remarkable advocate and a celebrated leader in my home State of Vermont.  Later this month, Polly Nichol will retire from her position as director of housing of the Vermont Housing and Conservation Board. For more than 35 years, Polly's career in affordable housing and community development has stood as the gold standard of excellence to those in her field. Her effective leadership across Vermont has inspired countless new collaborations, new housing opportunities for our most vulnerable, and the preservation of historic structures that make up Vermont's unique character. It is not an exaggeration to say that the quality of life for many in the Green Mountains is greater as a result of Polly Nichol's legacy.  Polly joined the Vermont Housing and Conservation Board in 1988 as its first director of housing. There, she became known for establishing creative partnerships to bring together developers, preservationists, and advocates alike. This work was grounded in her prior experience at the local community action agency, where she led the establishment of two neighborhood reinvestment groups in nearby Barre and Randolph. These groups are now part of NeighborWorks America, a program I have long supported for its investments in rural communities across the country.  Polly's career in advocacy and leadership has been vast and multifaceted. In Vermont, the challenge of securing safe, affordable housing is far too familiar for many. Overcoming this challenge requires a strong network of advocates and experts ready and willingto collaborate. During her tenure at the Vermont Housing and Conservation Board, Polly has channeled the organization's mission to improve the capacity of surrounding nonprofits dedicated to housing and conservation. Today Vermont's landscape of nonprofit developers and preservationists is uniquely integrated, much thanks to Polly's early efforts to instill value in the belief that building homes includes building community.  Polly's vision has also had a direct impact on thousands of Vermonters in nearly every corner of the state. Her leadership has contributed to the success of the Vermont Housing and Conservation Board as it has invested in and developed more than 12,000 homes and apartments. More than 1,300 homes with much-needed services and supports have also been developed for our most vulnerable friends and neighbors. Throughout, the organization has also enabled more than 1,000 individuals to become homeowners, further enabling them to become integrated within their local communities.  Polly's leadership and advocacy may also be witnessed in the other voluntary roles she has held throughout the last four decades. She is an active member of the city of Montpelier's Housing Task Force, the Vermont Affordable Housing Coalition, and is well known for her role as a founding board member of the Vermont Community Loan Fund. Her reach also extends to other important causes, including a most recent appointment to serve as the vice president of the board of Vermont Works for Women, an organization that supports disadvantaged women and those who pursue nontraditional careers.  We have also been fortunate to have Polly as a delegate to our region and national affordable housing communities, including the New England Housing Network and the Housing Assistance Council. In 1994, Polly received the Skip Jason Community Service Award from the Housing Assistance Council after being nominated by a host of Vermonters. As a leading national advocate for rural housing policy in the country, this award recognizes those whose efforts have improved the housing conditions of the rural poor in their communities and whose work ``in the trenches'' often goes unrecognized in their communities. Since then Polly's leadership, has continued, as she has served as both president and chair of the board of the Housing Assistance Council.  Polly has been well known to friends and colleagues as much for her gentle humor as her uncompromising dedication to preserve the unique beauty and quality of life found at home in Vermont. Her work will leave a lasting impression on those of us who have been fortunate enough to learn from and work alongside her. As she transitions to retirement, I do hope she finds opportunity to revel in her accomplishments both near and far.                          ____________________
