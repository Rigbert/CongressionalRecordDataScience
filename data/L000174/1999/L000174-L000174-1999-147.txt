President, I am pleased to introduce today with Senator Hatch a bill to give United States law enforcement agencies important tools to help them combat international crime. The ``Denying Safe Haven to International and War Criminals Act of 1999'' contains a number of provisions that I have long supported.  Unfortunately, crime and terrorism directed at Americans and American interests abroad are part of our modern reality. Furthermore, organized criminal activity does not recognize national boundaries. With improvements in technology, criminals now can move about the world with ease. They can transfer funds with the push of a button, or use computers and credit card numbers to steal from American citizens and businesses from any spot on the globe. They can strike at Americans here and abroad. They can commit crimes abroad and flee quickly to another jurisdiction or country. The playing field keeps changing, and we need to change with it.  This bill would help make needed modifications in our laws, not with sweeping changes but with thoughtful provisions carefully targeted at specific problems faced by law enforcement. We cannot stop international crime without international cooperation, and this bill gives additional tools to investigators and prosecutors to promote such cooperation, while narrowing the room for maneuver that international criminals and terrorists now enjoy.  I initially introduced title I, section 4 of this bill, regarding fugitive disentitlement, on April 30, 1998, in the ``Money Laundering Enforcement and Combating Drugs in Prisons Act of 1998,'' S. 2011, with Senators Daschle, Kohl, Feinstein and Cleland. Again, on July 14, 1998, I introduced with Senator Biden, on behalf of the Administration, the ``International Crime Control Act of 1998,'' S. 2303, which contains most of the provisions set forth in this bill. Virtually all of the provisions in the bill were also included inanother major anti-crime bill, the ``Safe Schools, Safe Streets, and Secure Borders Act of 1998,'' S. 2484, that I introduced on September 16, 1998, along with Senators Daschle, Biden, Moseley-Braun, Kennedy, Kerry, Lautenberg, Mikulski, Bingaman, Reid, Murray, Dorgan, and Torricelli. In addition, Senator Hatch and I included title II, section 1 of this bill regarding streamlined procedures for MLAT requests in our ``International Crime and Anti-Terrorism Amendments of 1998'', S. 2536, which passed the Senate last October 15, 1998.  We have drawn from these more comprehensive bills a set of discrete improvements that enjoy bipartisan support so that important provisions may be enacted promptly. Each of these provisions has been a law enforcement priority.  Title I sets forth important proposals for combating international crime and denying safe havens to international criminals. In particular, section 1 would provide for extradition under certain circumstances for offenses not covered in a treaty or absent a treaty. Treaties negotiated many years ago specified the crimes for which extradition would be allowed. Developments in criminal activity, however, have outpaced the ability of countries to renegotiate treaties to include newly developing criminal activity. Under the bill, extradition would nevertheless proceed as if the crime were covered by a treaty for ``serious offenses,'' which are defined to include crimes of violence, drug crimes, bribery of public officials, obstruction of justice, money laundering, fraud or theft involving over $100,000, counterfeiting over $100,000, a conspiracy to commit any of these crimes, and sex crimes involving children. The section sets forth detailed procedures and safeguards for proceeding with extradition under these circumstances.  Section 2 contains technical and conforming amendments.  Section 3 would give the Attorney General authority to transfer a person in custody in the United States to a foreign country to stand trial where the Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of State, determines that such transfer would be consistent with the international obligations of the United States. The section also allows for the transfer of a person in state custody in the United States to a foreign country to stand trial after a similar determination by the Attorney General and the consent of the State authorities. Similarly, the Attorney General is authorized to request the temporary transfer of a person in custody in a foreign country to face prosecution in a federal or state proceeding.  Section 4 is designed to stop drug kingpins, terrorists and other international fugitives from using our courts to fight to keep the proceeds of the very crimes for which they are wanted. Criminals should not be able to use our courts at the same time they are evading our laws.  Section 5 would permit the transfer of prisoners to their home country to serve their sentences, on a case-by-case basis, where such transfer is provided by treaty. Under this section, the prisoner need not consent to the transfer.  Section 6 would provide a statutory basis for holding and transferring prisoners who are sent from one foreign country to another through United States airports, preventing them from claiming asylum while they are temporarily in the United States.  Title II of the bill is designed to promote global cooperation in the fight against international crime. Specifically, section 1 would permit United States courts involved in multi-district litigation to enforce mutual legal assistance treaties and other agreements to execute foreign requests for assistance in criminal matters in all districts involved in the litigation.  Section 2 outlines procedures for the temporary transfer of incarcerated witnesses. Specifically, the bill would permit the United States, as a matter of reciprocity, to send persons in custody in the United States to a foreign country and to receive foreign prisoners to testify in judicial proceedings, with the consent of the prisoner and, where applicable, the State holding the prisoner. A transfer may not create a platform for an application for asylum or other legal proceeding in the United States. Decisions of the Attorney General respecting such transfers are to be made in conjunction with the Secretary of State.  Title III of the bill is the ``Anti-Atrocity Alien Deportation Act,'' S. 1235, which I introduced on July 15, 1999, with Senator Kohl and is cosponsored by Senator Lieberman. This bill has also been introduced in the House with bipartisan support as H.R. 2642 and H.R. 3058. This title of the bill would amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to expand the grounds for inadmissibility and deportation to cover aliens who have engaged in acts of torture abroad. ``Torture'' is already defined in the Federal criminal code, 18 U.S.C. Sec.  2340, in a law passed as part of the implementing legislation for the ``Convention Against Torture.'' Under this Convention, the United States has an affirmative duty to prosecute torturers within its boundaries regardless of their respective nationalities. 18 U.S.C. Sec.  2340A (1994).  This legislation would also provide statutory authorization for OSI, which currently owes its existence to an Attorney General order, and would expand its jurisdiction to authorize investigations, prosecutions, and removal of any alien who participated in torture and genocide abroad--not just Nazis. The success of OSI in hunting Nazi war criminals demonstrates the effectiveness of centralized resources and expertise in these cases. OSI has worked, and it is time to update its mission. The knowledge of the people, politics and pathologies of particular regimes engaged in genocide and human rights abuses is often necessary for effective prosecutions of these cases and may best be accomplished by the concentrated efforts of a single office, rather than in piecemeal litigation around the country or in offices that have more diverse missions.  Unquestionably, the need to bring Nazi war criminals to justice remains a matter of great importance. Funds would not be diverted from the OSI's current mission. Additional resources are authorized in the bill for OSI's expanded duties.  These are important provisions that I have advocated for some time. They are helpful, solid law enforcement provisions. I thank my friend from Utah, Senator Hatch, for his help in making this bill a reality. Working together, we were able to craft a bipartisan bill that will accomplish what all of us want, to make America a safer and more secure place.  I ask that the attached sectional analysis of the bill be printed in the Record.  The summary follows:  Denying Safe Havens to International and War Criminals Act of 1999--                      Section by Section Analysis        title i--denying safe havens to international criminals    Section 1. Extradition for Offenses Not Covered by a List Treaty       This section allows the Attorney General to seek      extradition of a person for specified crimes not covered by a      treaty. Treaties negotiated many years ago specified the      crimes for which extradition would be allowed, and      developments in criminal activity have outpaced the ability      of countries to renegotiate treaties to include newly      developing criminal activity. Extradition would proceed as if      the crime were covered by treaty, and the section sets forth      detailed procedures and safeguards. Applicable crimes include      crimes of violence, drug crimes, obstruction of justice,      money laundering, fraud or theft involving over $100,000,      counterfeiting over $100,000, conspiracy to commit any of      these crimes, and sex crimes involving children.             Section 2. Technical and Conforming Amendments       This section amends related statutes to conform with      Section 1.  Section 3. Temporary Transfer of Persons in Custody for Prosecution       This section allows a temporary transfer of a person from      another country to the United States to stand trial where the      Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of State      determines that such transfer would be consistent with the      international obligations of the United States. The section      also allows for the transfer of a person in custody in the      United States to a foreign country to stand trial after a      similar determination by the Attorney General. Section 4. Prohibiting Fugitives From Benefiting From Fugitive Status       This section adds a new section 2466 (Fugitive      Disentitlement) to Title 28 to provide that a person cannot      stay outside the United States, avoiding extradition, and at      the same time participate as a party in a civil action over a      related civil forfeiture claim. The Supreme Court recently      decided that a previous judge-made rule to the same effect      required     a statutory basis. This section provides that basis.Section 5. Transfer of Foreign Person to Serve Sentences in Country of                                  Origin       This section permits transfer, on a case-by-case basis, of      prisoners to their home country where such transfer is      provided by treaty. Under this section the prisoner need not      consent to the transfer.  Section 6. Transit of Fugitives for Prosecution in Foreign Countries       This section would provide a statutory basis for holding      and transferring prisoners who are sent from one foreign      country to another through United States airports, at the      discretion of the Attorney General. The temporary presence in      the United States would not be the basis for a claim for      asylum.      title II--promoting global cooperation in the fight against                           international crime    Section 1. Streamlined Procedures for Execution of MLAT Requests       This section permits United States courts involved in      multi-district litigation to enforce mutual legal assistance      treaties and other agreements to execute foreign requests for      assistance in criminal matters in all districts involved in      the litigation or request.        Section 2. Temporary Transfer of Incarcerated Witnesses       This section permits the United States, as a matter of      reciprocity, to send persons in custody in the United States      to a foreign country and to receive foreign prisoners to      testify in judicial proceedings, with the consent of the      prisoner and, where applicable, the State holding the      prisoner. A transfer may not create a platform for an      application for asylum or other legal proceeding in the      United States. Decisions of the Attorney General respecting      such transfers are to be made in conjunction with the      Secretary of State.               title III--anti-atrocity alien deportation    Section 1. Inadmissibility and Removability of Aliens Who Have                     Committed Acts of Torture Abroad       Currently, the Immigration and Nationality Act provides      that (i) participants in Nazi persecutions during the time      period from March 23, 1933 to May 8, 1945, and (ii) aliens      who engaged in genocide, are inadmissible to the United      States and deportable. See 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1182(a)(3)(E)(i) and      Sec. 1227(a)(4)(D). The bill would amend these sections of      the Immigration and Nationality Act by expanding the grounds      for inadmissibility and deportation to cover aliens who have      engaged in acts of torture abroad. The United Nations'      ``Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or      Degrading Treatment or Punishment'' entered into force with      respect to the United States on November 20, 1994. This      Convention, and the implementing legislation, the Torture      Victims Protection Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 2340 et seq.,      includes the definition of ``torture'' incorporated in the      bill and imposed an affirmative duty on the United States to      prosecute torturers within its jurisdiction.    Section 2. Establishment of the Office of Special Investigations       Attorney General Civiletti established OSI in 1979 within      the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice,      consolidating within it all ``investigative and litigation      activities involving individuals, who prior to and during      World War II, under the supervision of or in association with      the Nazi government of Germany, its allies, and other      affiliated [sic] governments, are alleged to have ordered,      incited, assisted, or otherwise participated in the      persecution of any person because of race, religion, national      origin, or political opinion.'' (Attorney Gen. Order No. 851-     79). The OSI's mission continues to be limited by that      Attorney General Order.       This section would amend the Immigration and Nationality      Act, 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1103, by directing the Attorney General to      establish an Office of Special Investigations within the      Department of Justice with authorization to investigate,      remove, denaturalize, or prosecute any alien who has      participated in torture or genocide abroad. This would expand      OSI's current authorized mission. Additional funds are      authorized for these expanded duties to ensure that OSI      fulfills its continuing obligations regarding Nazi war      criminals.                                 ______                                       By
