Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to rise today to pay tribute to two young women who are extraordinarily ambitious and creative. Kami Grudzien and Kristina Cannon, of Coventry, RI, are two of the seven winners in the National Teen Business Plan Competition.  This competition, sponsored by the Income of Her Own organization, encourages teenagers to create their own businesses and develop their economic skills. Kami and Kristina produced an extremely ingenious idea which incorporated their vision, creativity, and compassion. Their plan is to start a company called World Cheerleading Dancers. This business will stage two competitions each year for young girls who want to develop dance and cheerleading moves into a choreographic routine. This competition will provide young women with the opportunity to simultaneously develop self-confidence and performance skills.  In addition to becoming entrepreneurs, Kami and Kristina also plan to make a positive contribution to the community with their enterprise. Five percent of the profits made by this venture will be donated to the Impossible Dream Foundation, which makes dreams come true for ailing and handicapped children.  Besides being seasoned performers and budding entrepreneurs, Kami and Kristina are also successful students at Coventry Middle School. Kristina is an accomplished student athlete in softball and volleyball, and Kami has received national recognition for an outstanding 500-word poem on the Holocaust.  These two young women are among our Nation's most promising leaders. Their example is a source of pride for all Rhode Islanders. I am truly inspired by individuals like Kami and Kristina, who pursue the American tradition of creativeness and ingenuity in business while having a positive impact on the community.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in saluting these two outstanding young women as they begin to plan to hold their first competition later this summer, and wish them continued success.                          ____________________
