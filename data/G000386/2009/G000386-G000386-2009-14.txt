 In the 10 years he and I have been leaders of the Finance Committee, most of the issues coming out of our committee have been very bipartisan. What he just talked about and what I am going to respond to is one of those issues.  I agree with Chairman Baucus that we should retroactively extend the expiring tax provisions as soon as possible after Congress reconvenes in 2010.  As chairman of the Finance Committee in 2005, I worked with then-Ranking Member Baucus, and we authored the biodiesel tax credit.  The biodiesel tax credit is a tax credit that is needed to be extended before the end of the year to prevent the U.S. biodiesel market from grinding to a halt on January 1, 2010. This tax credit differs from other tax provisions in that the price of biodiesel will be $1 higher on January 1, 2010, as a result of the tax credit not being extended before that date. That means people will simply buy petroleum diesel rather than biodiesel come January 1, 2010.  I point out that support in Congress for extending the biodiesel tax credit, I think, has been and still is robust, bipartisan, and bicameral, and that it has not been extended prior to January 1, 2010, due solely to issues unrelated to the merits of the biodiesel tax credit.  I want everybody to know that I agree with Chairman Baucus that the expiration of these tax provisions creates uncertainty and complexity in the tax law. I also agree that the taxpayers need notice that these tax provisions will be in place so they can plan their personal and business affairs to fully and efficiently use the intended tax incentives.  In addition, extending the tax provisions as early as possible in 2010, as we intend to do, will minimize the administrative problems created for the Internal Revenue Service.  I look forward to working with Chairman Baucus to retroactively extend these provisions as soon as possible when the Senate reconvenes in 2010.
