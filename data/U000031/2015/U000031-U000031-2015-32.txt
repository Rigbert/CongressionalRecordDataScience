 So, in essence, it would delay implementation of the bill indefinitely. And we believe that that would be a diversion, as the focus of this bill is to modernize our energy infrastructure and ensure access to affordable, reliable energy in a strong economy as fast as we can.  An economy based on reliable, affordable energy provides the means for the prosperity for future generations and the economic strength to respond and adapt to future challenges. It is particularly true when it comes to risks of climate change, whether natural or man-influenced.  The bill promotes technological innovation; the development of resilient, efficient energy infrastructure; and a strong economy to withstand climate events, regardless of the causes. Delaying the measures in this bill denies the public a direct path to a stronger, more resilient energy infrastructure and greater economic growth.  Because of those reasons, I would urge my colleagues to vote against my friend's amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
