 President, I rise today to pay tribute to PFC Brandon Chauncy Sturdy, the fourteenth Iowan to be killed in Iraq in brave service to our country. PFC Sturdy was a machine gunner in the 2nd Battalion of the 1st Marine Regiment in the 1st Marine Division. I offer my deepest sympathy to his parents, Shelly Rivera and David Sturdy and his fiance, Tricia Johnson.  PFC Sturdy was killed by the explosion of a homemade bomb in Iraq on Thursday, May 13 in the Al Anbar Province near Fallujah. I thank him for his patriotic duty to his country and am proud to honor the courage he boldly displayed as a Marine. PFC Sturdy was a 2003 graduate of Urbandale High School in Urbandale, IA. A statement released by Brandon's family describes him as ``the best of the best'' who ``set the bar high for us to reach for''. He was a top notch Marine who had already been awarded theNational Defense Medal and a Purple Heart. Brandon Sturdy died a hero fighting to preserve freedom. He was a brave patriot whose presence will be missed. I am proud of the model of service he provided to Iowans and I again offer my condolences to his family.                        Maj. William E. Burchett
