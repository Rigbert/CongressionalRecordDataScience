Res. 193       Whereas the United States and a broad international      coalition have been engaged in a Global War on Terrorism      since the terrorist attacks in Washington, D.C., New York,      and Pennsylvania that occurred on September 11, 2001;       Whereas the people and Governments of the United States and      the United Kingdom enjoy a deep and enduring friendship      undergirded by shared history, language, and values;       Whereas the United Kingdom has been a strong and steadfast      ally to the United States through two World Wars, the Cold      War, the Gulf War, and the Global War on Terrorism, including      the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq;       Whereas terrorists have planned and conducted attacks      around the world during the four years after the Global War      on Terrorism began in 2001, most notably the bombing of a      night club on the Indonesian island of Bali on October 12,      2002 that killed 202 people and injured an additional 209,      the bombings of two synagogues and the British Embassy in      Istanbul, Turkey in November 2003, in which 56 people were      killed and over 450 injured, and the bombing of the train      system in Madrid, Spain on March 11, 2004 that killed more      than 190 people and injured approximately 1,500;       Whereas on July 7, 2005, a series of four explosions struck      the London public transportation system during the morning      rush hour, killing at least 49 innocent civilians and      injuring approximately 700 others;       Whereas a previously unknown terrorist group claimed      responsibility for the attacks in the name of al Qaeda;       Whereas the terrorist attacks in London coincided with the      opening of the G-8 Summit in Gleneagles, Scotland, a Summit      committed to bringing help and hope to the poorest countries      of the world;       Whereas President Bush immediately condemned the terrorist      attacks and extended the ``heartfelt condolences'' of the      people of the United States to the people of the United      Kingdom;       Whereas Prime Minister Tony Blair vowed, on behalf of the      United Kingdom and the world leaders attending the G-8 Summit      in Gleneagles, Scotland, to remain steadfast and strong in      the fight against terrorism, stating, ``All of our countries      have suffered from the impact of terrorism. Those responsible      have no respect for human life. We are united in our resolve      to confront and defeat this terrorism that is not an attack      on one nation, but all nations and on civilized people      everywhere. . . . It's important . . . that those engaged in      terrorism realize that our determination to defend our values      and our way of life is greater than their determination to      cause death and destruction to innocent people in a desire to      impose extremism on the world'', and declared, ``We shall      prevail, and [the terrorists] shall not'';       Whereas the North Atlantic Council, the governing body of      the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, after meeting in an      extraordinary session, reaffirmed the determination of the      members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to combat      the scourge of terrorism and defend the values of freedom,      tolerance, and democracy using all available means;       Whereas world leaders attending the G-8 Summit in      Gleneagles, Scotland expressed condolences to the people of      the United Kingdom and issued a joint statement to ``condemn      utterly these barbaric attacks''; and       Whereas Prime Minister Tony Blair, speaking on behalf of      the world leaders attending the G-8 Summit in Gleneagles,      Scotland, declared, ``We are united in the resolve'' to      defeat terrorism, which is ``not an attack on one nation, but      on all nations'': Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That the Senate--       (1) expresses deepest sympathies and condolences to the      people of the United Kingdom and the victims and their      families for the heinous terrorist attacks that occurred in      London on July 7, 2005;       (2) condemns these barbaric and unwarranted attacks on the      innocent people of London;       (3) expresses strong and continued solidarity with the      people of the United Kingdom and pledges to remain shoulder-     to-shoulder with the people of the United Kingdom to bring      the terrorists responsible for these brutal attacks to      justice; and       (4) calls upon the international community to renew and      strengthen efforts to--       (A) defeat terrorists by dismantling terrorist networks and      exposing the violent and nihilistic ideology of terrorism;       (B) increase international cooperation to advance personal      and religious freedoms, ethnic and racial tolerance,      political liberty and pluralism, and economic prosperity; and       (C) combat the social injustice, oppression, poverty, and      extremism that breeds terrorism.
