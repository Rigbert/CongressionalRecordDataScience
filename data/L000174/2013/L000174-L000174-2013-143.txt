President, I would like to bring to the attention of the Senate a notable family whose work has made a unique and meaningful contribution to the Vermont newspaper community and to our State. The Lynn family runs several Vermont newspapers, reporting local news and serving general commerce in these communities.  In 1984, Angelo Lynn bought the Addison County Independent, marking the beginning of a family newspaper operation based out of Middlebury, VT. Today, Angelo's three daughters have joined a five-generation newspaper tradition, each taking on a different Vermont town newspaper. With Elsie running the Colchester Sun and the Essex Reporter, Polly running the Mountain Times in Killington, and Christy working side by side with her father overseeing the advertising sales team of the Addison County Independent, the Lynn family reports stories Vermonters depend on.  While some of the biggest newspapers struggle, local papers are thriving, and the Lynn family has embraced the opportunity to influence the future of the newspaper industry. Focusing on local government, events, schools, sports and businesses, the Addison County Independent is a vital piece of the community it serves. It is personal and caring, and it reflects what matters to the residents of the community.  I congratulate Angelo Lynn on the success of his family-run newspaper operation. Mr. Lynn, his daughters, and his brother Emerson have harnessed local newspapers to strengthen our Vermont communities. I have included the New York Times article ``Vermont Sisters with Roots in News Embrace Small-Town Papers'' that covers each Lynn family member's individual story. I ask that the text of this article, dated August 15, 2013, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:      Vermont Sisters With Roots in News Embrace Small-Town Papers                        (By Christine Haughney)       Middlebury, VT.--King Lear's three daughters had their      lands and loyalties to fight over. Jane Austen's Dashwood      sisters had the prospect of marriage to occupy them, and      Anton Chekhov's three sisters had local military officers to      brighten their days.       None of them ever contemplated a future as risky as      newspapers.       For a long time, neither did the Lynn sisters, even though      they are a fifth-generation newspaper family. Polly, Christy      and Elsie     Lynn left behind their father's dusty but cozy newsrooms for      college and careers.       Now they are back. Elsie, 26, moved home in 2010 after she      ran out of money while working and traveling through Asia.      She manages two of her father's weeklies in the Burlington      suburbs of Colchester and Essex.       Polly, 29, returned in 2011 from Denver, and has thrown      herself into running the weekly newspaper in Killington, the      popular ski town. Christy, 28, moved back in June after her      boyfriend finished graduate school in Vancouver. She helps      her father, Angelo, running the business side of Middlebury's      paper, The Addison County Independent.       It is conventional wisdom that newspapers are a fading      enterprise. Last month, the Tribune Company bought 19 local      television stations even as it sought to sell its portfolio      of papers, and twice in August, big-city papers changed      hands: The New York Times sold The Boston Globe and other      properties for $70 million, after paying $1.1 billion for The      Globe 20 years ago, and the Graham family said it would sell      The Washington Post after eight decades of ownership.       But instead of fleeing the newspaper business, the Lynn      sisters have embraced it, and not just because it is part of      their heritage.       ``I've grown up in the papers,'' said Elsie Lynn. ``But I      don't think that's the reason I'm in it. The future is      exciting for me. We have this chance and this opportunity to      be pioneers and change our career and change this industry.''       The papers the Lynn sisters help run have been surprisingly      profitable. They have not faced bankruptcy like newspapers of      the Tribune Company including The Los Angeles Times and      haven't cut coverage like The Times-Picayune of New Orleans.      In these parts of Vermont, where Internet connections are      less reliable and winter snowstorms can block roads for days,      readers often prefer print.       Mr. Lynn said that he had run his newspapers debt-free for      a decade. While his papers aren't making money yet from their      digital efforts, his newspaper and phone book businesses      generate about $4.5 million in gross revenue.       ``We can't afford not to make money,'' Mr. Lynn said as he      sat in his office here surrounded by photographs of his      daughters, the family dogs dozing loudly nearby. ``There's no      future losing money in any of these papers.''       It helps that Mr. Lynn has a long history in the business.      His great-grandfather, Charles Scott, bought The Iola      Register in Kansas in 1882. Mr. Lynn was raised upstairs from      the offices of another nearby Kansas paper called The      Humboldt Union. In 1984, Angelo Lynn bought The Addison      County Independent in Vermont and started building up his      chain of papers. Mr. Lynn's older brother, Emerson, owns two      papers with his wife, Suzanne, and Angelo as well as two      other Vermont papers.       Angelo Lynn speaks fondly of the newspaper life. He spends      his weekends hiking and skiing with his daughters and      weekdays churning out enterprising local journalism.       ``Once you become part of a community, you see the good      that a paper does,'' Mr. Lynn said. ``That's very      fulfilling.'' His daughters' newspaper futures were less      certain. When Elsie Lynn arrived at the newsroom of The      Colchester Sun and The Essex Reporter, she had never studied      journalism or held a journalism job. She wasn't convinced she      wanted to work with her father and uncle.       ``I've said, `Man, I don't know, Dad, if this is what I      want to do,' '' she said as she sat in her threadbare      newspaper office in a converted stable space on the outskirts      of Colchester. ``He said `No pressure.' ''       She settled in, typing up wedding announcements, but before      long her father asked her to review the papers' finances.      Elsie discovered they were owed $120,000 from advertisers. In      three months, she collected $90,000. She also saved her      father labor costs by absorbing multiple job titles. Elsie      said she often logged 13-hour days writing and editing      stories and promoting them on social media.       Polly Lynn was living in Colorado working for an      educational tour company with her partner, Jason Mikula, when      her father received an offer to buy The Mountain Times in      Killington. Mr. Lynn asked the couple, who were already      thinking of moving, to come to Vermont to run it. The couple      took over in September 2011 just as Hurricane Irene hit and      Killington was hit with some of the storm's worst flooding.      She produced the first editions from her father's dining room      table.       Since then, Polly said, she has kept a nonstop schedule of      publishing deadlines and has designed a hyper-local news app      for Killington. She spends evenings attending town planning      meetings and winters skiing with sources and advertisers.       There has already been a payoff. Polly and Mr. Mikula      increased the paper's revenue by 15 percent, or about      $100,000, by improving editorial content and strengthening      its advertising relationships, according to Mr. Lynn.       Mike Miller, a Killington business owner and former      selectman, said local businesses appreciated the couple's      forthright approach: when they made early mistakes on      advertisements, they admitted they were wrong, fixed them and      even offered to make more creative advertisements. They also      appreciate the couple's efforts to participate in the      community.       ``I'm just amazed at their energy,'' Mr. Miller said. ``If      there's something that there are going to be more than 10      people there, they cover it.''       In some ways, Christy Lynn had the toughest transition.      While her sisters work at papers an hour's drive from their      father, she works steps away from him. Her father focuses on      editorial content, and she oversees the advertising sales      team and comes up with new promotions.       She has accomplished some small coups. She realized that      the Waterfalls Day Spa in Middlebury was promoting itself on      social media but did not advertise much in the paper. So she      persuaded the owners to advertise more in both the paper and      online. Mr. Lynn said that advertising revenue grew 6 percent      in this year's first quarter under Christy's watch.       Gary Greene, a newspaper sales broker, said successful      community newspapers shared specific traits. Unlike larger      newspapers, local community papers have little debt and don't      depend heavily on classified advertising. They hire enough      employees to report on town meetings and sports events and      publish material people can't find elsewhere. They are in      county seats, where they receive legal notices and      advertisements from local businesses.       Mr. Greene, who sits on the boards of small newspaper      chains nationwide and sees their financial statements, says      those qualities are critical to profitability.       ``These papers have all made money through the downturn,''      Mr. Greene said. ``What other business categories are doing      15 to 20 percent margins? Most businesses would love to make      that kind of money.''       For now, newspaper analysts say these papers' futures      remain promising as long as they remain the sole information      source. Alan D. Mutter, a newspaper consultant who writes the      Reflections of a Newsosaur blog, said that there was still      value in information like school lunch menus and high school      sports scores.       ``Weeklies in healthy communities that do a good job      reporting on local news and serving local businesses are by      far the healthiest of publications,'' he said.       ``The Messenger has been in business for 150 years,'' said      Emerson Lynn, referring to one of his Vermont papers, The St.      Albans Messenger. ``Do I think Google is going to be in      existence for 150 years? Not a chance.''       It's unclear how long the Lynn sisters will work in      newspapers. While Mr. Lynn has made no succession plans, he      also doesn't want to sell. While some of the nation's largest      papers are being sold for a small fraction of their purchase      price, the market for smaller community papers is healthier.      Mr. Greene, the newspaper broker, said that this year his      company closed eight deals with 23 publications, nearly      double the sales volume in 2011 and 2012. And the resale      value of smaller newspapers--the deals worth less than $20      million--is higher than that of bigger papers and chains.       It also helps that the Lynn family seems committed to the      business. In March, Angelo and his wife, Lisa Gosselin,      invited his brood and their partners and dogs for dinner at      his home, a renovated camp building on Lake Dunmore. Dinner      conversation revolved around food, skiing and newspapers.      Polly warned her father to expect calls of complaint about a      forthcoming article.       None of them talked about how long they would remain in the      business. But long after they finished their dessert of      poached pears and blueberry pie, they lingered at the table      to chat. Before they left, Elsie remembered that The      Colchester Sun was sponsoring a cold-water dive into Lake      Champlain.       ``Who is going to jump in the lake with me?'' she asked.       There was a flurry of reporterlike questions: ``How cold is      the water? When is it?''       But one by one, they all agreed to take the plunge.                          ____________________
