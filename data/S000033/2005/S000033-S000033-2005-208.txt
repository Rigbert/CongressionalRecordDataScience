 Speaker, Burlington, Vermont, as I know from my years as Mayor, is one of America's most livable cities. One of the primary reasons for its preeminence and livability is the vibrant arts scene in Vermont's largest city and in the surrounding region. Be it music, dance, theater or film, Burlington is and has been alive with creativity. The same is true for writing of all sorts, so we celebrate a notable moment when much of this writing was showcased at the first Burlington Literary Festival. I extend my congratulations on the inaugural Burlington Literary Festival, to its sponsors Burlington City Arts, Burlington Magazine and the Fletcher Free Library, to festival organizer Susan Weiss, and to the many, many writers who participated.  In particular, I want to highlight that the Festival was dedicated to Katherine Paterson of Barre, Vermont. She is, with all due apologies to Grace Paley and the extraordinary writers who attended the conference, the most honored of all contemporary Vermont authors, with not one but two National Book Awards, not one but two Newberry Medals--and the Hans Christian Anderson Medal as well!  When she writes for children, she takes their intellectual, ethical and political capacities with high seriousness. Social issues, international dimensions, and, if I am correct, a revisiting of the Bread and Roses strike in her next book: this is not escapist literature, but instead writing which draws its young readers into the world they live in, even as they encounter the remarkable characters and circumstances that enliven the domain of fiction.  But Katherine Paterson knows that life asks more of us than writing, important as writing surely is. She established the ``Read to Live'' program to bring books, story-telling and other activities to Venezuelan communities which had been damaged and devastated by massive flooding. That program was so successful in giving children a sense of community and hope that it has been a model for programs in Indonesia for children left homeless by the tsunami, and is serving as a template for programs that will help the children or New Orleans and other cities destroyed by Hurricane Katrina.  We are proud to have Katherine Paterson living and working among us in Vermont, creating with the many other writers in attendance at the Burlington Literary Festival the imaginative fabric of American life. We wish her, and all, the very best as they continue to create in words both the America that is, and the America that can be.                          ____________________
