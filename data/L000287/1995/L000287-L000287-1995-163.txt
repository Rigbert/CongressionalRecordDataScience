Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing a bill to designate the road from Selma to Montgomery as a National Historic Trail. The road from Selma to Montgomery was the last symbolic leg in the journey to the Voting Rights Act of 1965.  Thirty years ago this month we tried to march from Selma to Montgomery to demonstrate for voting rights for all. As the nonviolent marchers crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, we were attacked by State troopers. I myself was beaten bloody. The country was outraged. Two days later, the marchers made a second attempt and turned back to avoid more bloodshed.  One week later, President Lyndon Johnson addressed the Nation and called for passage of the Voting Rights Act. He said:       I speak tonight for the dignity of man and the destiny of      democracy * * * at times, history and fate meet at a single      time in a single place to shape a turning point in man's      unending search for freedom. So it was at Lexington and      Concord. So it was a century ago in Appomattox. And so it was      last week in Selma, Alabama.  This weekend we go back to Selma for the 30th anniversary of the marches. We go back to remember what happened and to rededicate ourselves to the importance of voting rights.  We have come a long way. In 1965, there were 500 African-American elected officials in the country. There were fewer than 100 in the South. In 1995, more than 7,000 African-Americans hold elective office--nearly 5,000 of them in the South.  However, we still have a long way to travel on our journey. In the 1992 Presidential election, only 56 percent of the voting age population voted. In the 1994 midterm elections only 38 percent voted. This is a tragedy.  The designation of the route from Selma to Montgomery will educate and remind us of the right and responsibility to vote. It will also give important recognition to the men and women who dedicated their lives for voting rights for all Americans.  In 1990, Congress enacted the Selma to Montgomery National Trail Study Act and directed the National Park Service to study the trail. Their report is complete. It is time to make this important part of American history a national historic trail.  I urge all my colleagues to join me as cosponsors of this important bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.                          ____________________
