DORGAN. Let me make this one point. I asked Ambassador Bremer to explain whether it would be possible to securitize Iraq's future oil revenues to pay for Iraq's reconstruction. Ambassador Bremer's answer: You can't use Iraq oil because Iraq owes foreign debt.  I said: Who to?  He said: Russia, France, and Germany.  Following that hearing, I checked. In fact, Russia, France, and Germany are indeed owed money by Saddam Hussein's regime. But the biggest creditors of Saddam Hussein's regime are Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.  Wouldn't it be a perversity if, in fact, the American taxpayers are told that they have to pay taxes to ship $20 billion to Iraq to reconstruct Iraq--so Iraq can pump oil and send cash to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait in satisfaction of Saddam Hussein's debts?  You talk about a perversity of public policy. That is it.  My amendment is painfully simple. It says that the Iraqi Governing Council shall have a mechanism that would allow it to use Iraqi oil to reconstruct Iraq.  One final point. During the recent military campaign in Iraq, we did not target Iraq's infrastructure. We didn't bomb its roads, bridges, dams, or electric grid. Now, Iraq does need reconstruction, no question about that, but the reconstruction is necessary because of decades of neglect. It is not because of any action by our military. And the fact is that the Iraqi people have a tremendous resource to finance that reconstruction, which they could and should use.  So the President ought not be so quick to ask for $20 billion from the American taxpayers for reconstruction, when his Vice President, the Secretary of Defense, the Deputy Secretary of Defense, and all the rest of them said this year that the reconstruction of Iraq would be financed with Iraqi oil. Now we are told it cannot be done and won't be done. I say with this amendment that it can be done and should be done.
