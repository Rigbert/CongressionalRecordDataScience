 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4742, to amend title 35, United States Code, to allow the Director of the Patent and Trademark Office to waive statutory provisions governing patents and trademarks in certain emergencies.  The devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina in the gulf region affected the ability of applicants, patentees, trademark holders and other interested parties to do business with the PTO.  Following the disaster, the agency invoked as much administrative and statutory authority as it could to accommodate those affected. For example, the PTO created a toll-free hotline for victims to call with questions or problems; attempted to place calls to all registered practitioners in Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana; blocked outgoing mail to those living at relevant ZIP codes in the region; vacated all outstanding examiners' actions, to be remailed at a later time; and accorded ``special consideration'' to all reductions of patent term adjustments where the applicant delay was attributable to the hurricane.  Despite its best efforts to date, the PTO needs additional authority to provide individuals and businesses relief from certain statutory deadlines, especially those pertaining to the maintenance of granted patents and registered trademarks.  Pursuant to the bill, the PTO may waive statutory provisions governing the filing, processing, renewal and maintenance of patents, trademark registrations and applications to the extent the director deems necessary to protect the rights and privileges of applicants and other persons affected by certain emergencies or a major disaster.  Madam Speaker, this is a noncontroversial measure that will ensure that the PTO carries out its statutory mandates in a fair manner during emergency conditions.  I urge Members to support it.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
