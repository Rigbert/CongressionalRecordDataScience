The caseload per active judge has gone up since Republican Senators supported every one of President Bush's nominations to that court. According to the Administrative Office of U.S. Courts, the caseload per active judge has increased by one third since 2005, when the Senate confirmed President Bush's nomination of Thomas Griffith to fill the 11th seat on the DC Circuit. That is right--the DC Circuit's caseload has actually increased. By any objective measure, the work of the DC Circuit has grown, and the multiple vacancies should be filled, not preserved and extended for partisan purposes.
