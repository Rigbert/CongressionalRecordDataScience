 President, responding to the unanimous consent request the Senator from Alabama propounded, I reserve the right to object. We may have just reached the heart of the matter. While we hear day after day that our House Republican friends want to negotiate on the debt limit, the Senator from Alabama asked us now to specifically preclude ourselves from talking about that very subject. I respectfully suggest that perhaps the real problem here isn't that Democrats aren't talking to Republicans; it is that Republicans aren't even talking to each other.  I also would note that this modification the Senator from Alabama is asking would leave us in a shutdown facing hundreds of thousands of familieswho would wonder when their next paycheck would come while we do our work.  So I object to the Senator's request, and I renew my unanimous consent.
