 President, I ask unanimous consent that when the joint session is dissolved, the Senate stand adjourned under the provisions of H. Con. Res. 2 until 3 p.m., Thursday, January 20, 2005.  I further ask that following the prayer and the pledge, the morning hour be deemed to have expired, the Journal of the proceedings be approved to date, the Senate then proceed to a period of morning business with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.
