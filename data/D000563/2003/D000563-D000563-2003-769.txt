President, I rise today in opposition to the nomination of Jay Bybee for the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Mr. Bybee recently passed out of the Judiciary Committee by a vote of 12 to 6.  Mr. Bybee is a smart person and a talented attorney--there is no argument about that. But he is one of the most strident voices in the country in advocating states' rights over Federal rights.  For example--and I think members of the Senate here should take special note of this--he wrote a law review article arguing that the 17th amendment was a bad idea. The 17th amendment, of course, is the amendment that allowed for direct election of United States Senators.  Mr. Bybee believes that ratification of the 17th amendment has resulted in too much power for the Federal government, and too little for the States. Here is what he said in his law review article:       If we are genuinely interested in federalism as a check on      the excesses of the national government and therefore, as a      means of protecting individuals, we should consider repealing      the 17th Amendment.  I, for one, disagree.  On behalf of a conservative foundation, Mr. Bybee wrote a successful amicus brief in the 2000 case United States v. Morrison, in which the Supreme Court struck down part of the Violence Against Women Act. Mr. Bybee wrote that Congress had no power under either the Commerce Clause or the 14th amendment to pass crucial provisions of this law. I thought this was settled law 75 years ago. Mr. Bybee thinks it is time to revisit this notion.  In addition, I am troubled by Mr. Bybee's positions regarding gay rights. He has been very critical of the Supreme Court's 1996 decision, Romer v. Evans, that struck down a Colorado constitutional amendment that prohibited local governments from passing laws to protect gay people. He called such laws that protect gay people from discrimination ``preferences for homosexuals.''  In another gay rights case, he wrote a brief defending the Defense Department's policy of subjecting gay and lesbian defense contractors to heightened review before deciding whether to give them security clearances. He argued that this policy was not a violation of the Equal Protection Clause and argued that such reviews were justified, in part, because some gays and lesbians experienced ``emotional instability.''   I am also concerned that Mr. Bybee--as head of the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel--has been involved in shaping some of the most controversial policies of the Ashcroft Justice Department. For example, he may have been involved in the new interpretation of the second amendment.  He may have been involved in the TIPS program, in which people in the United States are encouraged to spy on their neighbors and coworkers and report any conduct they find to be ``unusual.''  He may have been involved in the decision to declare the al Qaeda and Taliban detainees at Guantanamo Bay as prisoners of war under the Geneva Convention.  I say ``may have been involved'' because he refused to tell us. In written responses to 20 different questions we posed to him, he gave the following answer:       As an attorney at the Department of Justice, I am obligated      to keep confidential the legal advice that I provide to      others in the executive branch. I cannot comment on whether      or not I have provided any such advice and, if so, the      substance of that advice.  Mr. Bybee is the most recent example of an appellate court nominee who has stonewalled the Senate Judiciary Committee. I do not believe that such conduct should be rewarded.  I oppose the nomination of Mr. Bybee to the Ninth Circuit.                          ____________________
