 Remember, we have passed a Senate budget here. We had 50 hours of debate, over 100 amendments were offered. We voted on all of them way into the wee hours, 5 or 6 o'clock in the morning, as everyone here will rightly remember. He is asking us to disregard all that action in the Senate, take up the House bill and have 50 hours more of debate, unlimited amendments, sitting here for weeks at a time again to go through all the amendments.  Madam President, that is a waste of taxpayer money and it is a waste of our time. We have done that work. It is time to go to conference.  Therefore, I object.
