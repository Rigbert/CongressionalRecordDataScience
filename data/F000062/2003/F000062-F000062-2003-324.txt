 President, I rise along with my distinguished colleague from Kentucky, Senator McConnell, to introduce the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003, which would establish a complete import ban on all products from Burma.  On May 30, Aung San Suu Kyi and at least 17 officials of the National League for Democracy, NLD, were detained after a clash in the town of Ye-u, after reportedly being attacked by members of the Union Solidarity Development Association, a paramilitary organization created by the ruling military junta, the State Peace and Development Council, SPDC.  Four people were killed and 50 injured in the attacks. Aung San Suu Kyi has been officially placed in ``protective custody'', but her whereabouts remain unconfirmed.  Still more disturbing are reports in today's Washington Post that Suu Kyi may have suffered a head wound and a broken arm in the attacks and is possibly being held at a military hospital near Rangoon. The military junta continues to insist that she is in good health and in a ``safe place'', yet they are unwilling to allow independent verification of Suu Kyi's condition.  One year ago the military junta freed Suu Kyi following 19 months of house arrest, while promising cooperation and dialogue toward political accommodation. Had I discussed Burma on the floor of the Senate back then, I would have sounded a note of cautious optimism, echoing Aung San Suu Kyi's own statement that ``it's a new dawn for the country''.  But as the events of May 30 have so tragically illustrated, the SPDC have broken every promise to work towards political dialogue and, in fact, have launched a new campaign of repression.  Given the military regime's utter contempt for the welfare and safety of its people and the repeated and ongoing human rights abuses against Aung San Suu Kyi and the members of the NLD, I now feel we have no choice but to strengthen the sanctions imposed in 1997.  The actions of the SPDC are simply outrageous and I join the State Department, the United Nations and the many voices from around the world in demanding that Suu Kyi and the others be released immediately, and to allow the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in Burma to conduct an independent investigation into the attack on Aung San Suu Kyi and her party.  Not content to stop with arresting the leadership of the NLD, the regime has tightened its crackdown on the pro-democracy movement, closing universities and shutting down at least six NLD offices. In addition, two NLD leaders have been arrested on charges of ``subversion''.  Let us recall, the NLD overwhelmingly won Burma's national elections in 1990. The NLD are Burma's rightful leaders, not the military junta which seized power in 1988, crushing a widespread popular uprising.  Such actions are only the tip of the iceberg of the regime's brutality. According to the Council on Foreign Relations Task Force report on Burma, which both the Senator from Kentucky, and I had the honor of serving on, gross human rights violations continue under the SPDC: over 1,300 political prisoners are still in jail; the practice of rape as a form of repression has been sanctioned by the Burmese military; the use of forced labor is widespread; trafficking in young boys and girls as sex slaves is rampant; the government engages in the production and distribution of opium and methamphetamine.  In addition, the report notes that because of SPDC mismanagement, the Burmese economy is in shambles, with poor rice harvests and, most recently, a February 2003 financial crisis sparked by government closure of private deposit companies.  In the face of such brutality it is imperative that the United States take strong and decisive action to express our disapproval of the SPDC and its tactics, and our support of those forces working for peace in Burma.  The United States must act. Although in general I do not support the use of trade embargoes as an effective instrument of foreign policy, in certain circumstances and when faced with certain conditions I believe they are necessary and proper and can, in fact, provide effective leverage.  Burma, I believe, is such a case and an import ban is a proper and much needed step to take.  Our legislation: imposes a complete ban on all imports from Burma until the President determines and certifies to Congress that Burma has made substantial and measurable progress on a number of democracy and human rights issues; allows the President to waive the import ban should he determine and notify Congress that it is in the national security interests of the United States to do so; allows the President to waive any provision of the bill found to be in violation of any international obligations of the U.S. pursuant to World Trade Organization dispute settlement procedures; freezes the assets of the Burmese regime in the United States; directs United States executive directors at international financial institutions to vote against loans to the Burma; expands the visa ban against the past and present leadership of the military junta; encourages the Secretary of State to highlight the abysmal record of the SPDC in the international community, and; authorizes the President to use all available resources to assist democracy activists in Burma.  Both business and labor are united in support of a ban. The American Apparel and Footwear Association, which represents apparel, footwear, and sewn products companies and their suppliers, has called for a ban.  President and CEO Kevin M. Burke stated, ``The government of Burma continues to abuse its citizens through force and intimidation, and refuses to respect the basic human rights of itspeople. AAFA believes this unacceptable behavior should be met with condemnation from not only the international public community, but from private industry as well.''  A number of stores, including Saks, Macy's, Bloomingdales, Ames, and The Gap have already voluntarily stopped importing or selling goods from Burma. The AFL-CIO and other labor groups also support a ban.  In addition, the international Labor Organization, for the first time in its history, called on all ILO members to impose sanctions on Burma.  Such diversity in support of this legislation speaks volumes about the brutality of the SPDC regime and its single-minded unwillingness to take even a modest step towards democracy and national reconciliation.  Currently, Burma exports approximately $400 million in goods per year to the United States. These exports are the regime's major source of foreign currency. Rest assured, the regime will take notice if this bill becomes law.  As events of the past few days have shown, all other avenues have been tried and failed. There is no other resource but to introduce this legislation, that would put pressure on the military junta to cease its violations of human rights and respect the free will of the Burmese people as expressed in the 1990 elections.  We must make a stand on the side of the people of Burma. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1182       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Burmese Freedom and      Democracy Act of 2003''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) The State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) has      failed to transfer power to the National League for Democracy      (NLD) whose parliamentarians won an overwhelming victory in      the 1990 elections in Burma.       (2) The SPDC has failed to enter into meaningful, political      dialogue with the NLD and ethnic minorities and has dismissed      the efforts of United Nations Special Envoy Razali bin Ismail      to further such dialogue.       (3) According to the State Department's ``Report to the      Congress Regarding Conditions in Burma and U.S. Policy Toward      Burma'' dated March 28, 2003, the SPDC has become ``more      confrontational'' in its exchanges with the NLD.       (4) On May 30, 2003, the SPDC, threatened by continued      support for the NLD throughout Burma, brutally attacked NLD      supporters, killed and injured scores of civilians, and      arrested democracy advocate Aung San Suu Kyi and other      activists.       (5) The SPDC continues egregious human rights violations      against Burmese citizens, uses rape as a weapon of      intimidation and torture against women, and forcibly      conscripts child-soldiers for the use in fighting indigenous      ethnic groups.       (6) The SPDC has demonstrably failed to cooperate with the      United States in stopping the flood of heroin and      methamphetamines being grown, refined, manufactured, and      transported in areas under the control of the SPDC serving to      flood the region and much of the world with these illicit      drugs.       (7) The SPDC provides safety, security, and engages in      business dealings with narcotics traffickers under indictment      by United States authorities, and other producers and      traffickers of narcotics.       (8) The International Labor Organization (ILO), for the      first time in its 82-year history, adopted in 2000, a      resolution recommending that governments, employers, and      workers organizations take appropriate measures to ensure      that their relations with the SPDC do not abet the      government-sponsored system of forced, compulsory, or slave      labor in Burma, and that other international bodies      reconsider any cooperation they may be engaged in with Burma      and, if appropriate, cease as soon as possible any activity      that could abet the practice of forced, compulsory, or slave      labor.       (9) The SPDC has integrated the Burmese military and its      surrogates into all facets of the economy effectively      destroying any free enterprise system.       (10) Investment in Burmese companies and purchases from      them serve to provide the SPDC with currency that is used to      finance its instruments of terror and repression against the      Burmese people.       (11) On April 15, 2003, the American Apparel and Footwear      Association expressed its ``strong support for a full and      immediate ban on U.S. textiles, apparel and footwear imports      from Burma'' and called upon the United States Government to      ``impose an outright ban on U.S. imports'' of these items      until Burma demonstrates respect for basic human and labor      rights of its citizens.       (12) The policy of the United States, as articulated by the      President on April 24, 2003, is to officially recognize the      NLD as the legitimate representative of the Burmese people as      determined by the 1990 election.

(3) Conditions described.--The conditions described in this      paragraph are the following:       (A) The SPDC has made substantial and measurable progress      to end violations of internationally recognized human rights      including rape, and the Secretary of State, after      consultation with the ILO Secretary General and relevant      nongovernmental organizations, reports to the appropriate      congressional committees that the SPDC no longer      systematically violates workers rights, including the use of      forced and child labor, and conscription of child-soldiers.       (B) The SPDC has made measurable and substantial progress      toward implementing a democratic government including--       (i) releasing all political prisoners;       (ii) allowing freedom of speech and the press;       (iii) allowing freedom of association;       (iv) permitting the peaceful exercise of religion; and       (v) bringing to a conclusion an agreement between the SPDC      and the democratic forces led by the NLD and Burma's ethnic      nationalities on the transfer of power to a civilian      government accountable to the Burmese people through      democratic elections under the rule of law.       (C) Pursuant to the terms of section 706 of the Foreign      Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003 (Public Law      107-228), Burma has not failed demonstrably to make      substantial efforts to adhere to its obligations under      international counternarcotics agreements and to take other      effective counternarcotics measures, including the arrest and      extradition of all individuals under indictment in the United      States for narcotics trafficking, and concrete and measurable      actions to stem the flow of illicit drug money into Burma's      banking system and economic enterprises and to stop the      manufacture and export of methamphetamines.

(b) Waiver Authorities.--       (1) In general.--The President may waive the prohibitions      described in this section for any or all products imported      from Burma to the United States if the President determines      and notifies the Committees on Appropriations and Foreign      Relations of the Senate and the Committees on Appropriations      and International Relations of the House of Representatives      that to do so is in the national security interest of the      United States.       (2) International obligations.--The President may waive any      provision of this Act found to be in violation of any      international obligations of the United States pursuant to      any final ruling relating to Burma under the dispute      settlement procedures of the World Trade Organization.       (c) Duration of Trade Ban.--The President may terminate the      restrictions contained in this Act upon the request of a      democratically elected government in Burma, provided that all      the conditions in subsection (a)(3) have been met.     SEC. 4. FREEZING ASSETS OF THE BURMESE REGIME IN THE UNITED                    STATES.

The Secretary of the      Treasury may take such action as may be necessary to secure      such assets or funds.     SEC. 5. LOANS AT INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.       The Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United      States executive director to each appropriate international      financial institution in which the United States      participates, to oppose, and vote against the extension by      such institution of any loan or financial or technical      assistance to Burma until such time as the conditions      described in section 3(a)(3) are met.
