Mr. Speaker, there are Kermit Gosnells all over American today inflicting not only violence, cruelty, and death on very young children but excruciating pain as well.  Many Americans, including some who self-identify as pro-choice, were shocked and dismayed by the Gosnell expose and trial. Perhaps the decades-long culture of denial and deceptive marketing has made it difficult to see and understand a disturbing reality. Even after 40 years of abortion-on-demand and over 55 million dead babies and millions of wounded mothers, many--until Gosnell--somehow construed abortion as victimless. That has changed. There are two victims, Mr. Speaker, in every abortion: the mother and her unborn child--three, if twins are involved.  The brutality of severing the spines of defenseless babies, euphemistically called ``snipping'' by Dr. Gosnell, has finally peeled away the benign facade of the billion-dollar abortion industry. Like Gosnell, abortionists all over America decapitate, dismember, and chemically poison babies to death each and every year. That's what they do.  Americans are connecting the dots and asking whether what Gosnell did is really any different than what all the other abortionists do. And the answer is, no, it's not different. A D&E abortion, which is described here as a common method after 14 months, is a gruesome, pain-filled act of violence that literally rips and tears to pieces the body parts of a child. And that's what they call ``choice.'' That is what they call safe and legal abortion.  Mr. Speaker, the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, authored by Congressman Trent Franks and cosponsored by several Congresswomen and -men, including me, is a modest but absolutely necessary attempt to at least protect some babies, that is to say, those who are 20 weeks old and pain-capable, from having to suffer and die a painful death from abortion.  On May 23, Chairman Trent Franks convened a hearing in the Judiciary Committee's Constitution and Civil Justice Subcommittee on his legislation. The bill, H.R. 1797, entitled the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, was approved by the subcommittee on June 4 and now moves to the full committee and, hopefully, soon to the full House.  The testimony of several witnesses, Mr. Speaker, I would respectfully submit is a must-read for anyone who cares about human rights, for anyonewho cares about women and children. One witness, Dr. Anthony Levatino, a former abortionist, testified that he performed approximately 1,200 abortions. Over 100 of them were second trimester abortions like this D&E procedure that is described here in this graph.  He said:       Imagine, if you can, you are a pro-choice obstetrician/     gynecologist like I once was. Your patient today is 24 weeks      pregnant. If you could see her baby, which is quite easy on      an ultrasound, she would be as long as your hand plus half      from the top of her head to the bottom of her rump, not      counting the legs. Your patient has been feeling her baby      kick for at least a month or more. But now she is asleep on      an operating table.  He continued:       With suction of the amniotic fluid, after that is      completed, you look for what he called a Sopher clamp. This      instrument is about 13 inches long and made of stainless      steel. At the business end are located jaws about 2\1/2\      inches long and about three-quarters of an initial inch.  This is what he is talking about right here.                              {time}  1200       This instrument is for grasping and crushing tissue. When      it gets hold of something, it does not let go.       A second trimester D&E abortion is a blind procedure. The      baby can be in any orientation, he goes on, or position      inside the uterus. Picture yourself reaching in with the      Sopher clamp and grasping anything that you can.       At 24 weeks' gestation, the uterus is thin and soft, so be      careful not to perforate or puncture the walls. Once you've      grasped something inside--this doctor, former abortionist,      goes on to say--squeeze on the clamp to set the jaws and pull      hard. Pull really hard. You feel something let go and out      pops a fully formed leg about six inches long. Reach in again      and grasp whatever you can, set the jaw, and pull really hard      once again and out pops an arm about the same length. Reach      in again and again with that clamp and tear out the spine,      the intestines, the heart, and the lungs.       The doctor goes on to say that, the toughest part of a D&E      abortion is extracting the baby's head. The head of a baby      that age is about the size of a large plum and is now free      floating inside of the uterine cavity. You can be pretty sure      you have hold of it if the Sopher clamp is spread as far as      your fingers will allow. You will know you have it right when      you crush down on the clamp and you see a white gelatinous      material coming through the cervix. That is the baby's      brains, this abortionist goes on to say. You can then extract      the skull in pieces.       Many times, he went on in his testimony before Trent      Franks' subcommittee, many times a little face will come out      and stare back at you. Congratulations; you have just      successfully performed a second trimester D&E abortion. You      just affirmed the right to choose. If you refuse to believe      that this procedure inflicts severe pain on that unborn      child, please think again. It does.  Another witness, Mr. Speaker, Ms. Jill Stanek, a registered nurse, spoke of appalling stories of abortion survivors and the pain--the pain--the excruciating pain that they suffer when they are being aborted.  She pointed out that when she testified before the committee back in 2001:       it was to tell of her experience as a registered nurse in      the labor and delivery department at Christ Hospital in Oak      Lawn, Illinois, where she discovered babies were being      aborted alive and shelved, put on a shelf to die in the      department's soiled utility closet.  Indeed, this nurse went on to say at the hearing:       I was traumatized and changed forever by my experience of      holding a little abortion survivor for 45 minutes until he      died--a 21- to 22-week-old baby who had been aborted because      he had Down syndrome.  Since then, other appalling stories of abortion survivors either being abandoned or killed have trickled out.  In 2005, a mother delivered a 23-week-old baby in a toilet at an EPOC clinic in Orlando, Florida, and was shocked to see this little guy move. Abortion staff not only refused to help, but turned away paramedics, who her friend had notified by calling 911. Angele, the woman, could do no more than helplessly sit on the floor rocking and singing to her baby for 11 minutes until that infant died.  In 2006, Sycloria Williams delivered her 23-week-old baby born on a recliner at a GYN diagnostic center in Hialeah, Florida. When he began breathing and moving, abortion clinic owner Belkis Gonzalez cut the umbilical cord and zipped him into a biohazard bag, still alive.  The Kermit Gosnell case provides further evidence that the lines between infanticide and legal feticide, both via abortion, have become blurred. This abortionist was convicted only last week--that's when she was talking, when she testified--of three counts of first degree murder.  And also last week, as she went on to say, in yet another revelation and photos from three former employees who alleged that abortionist Douglas Karpen in Houston, Texas, routinely kills babies after they are born by puncturing the soft spot at the top of the head, or impaling the stomach with a sharp instrument, twisting off the head, or puncturing the throat with his finger.  Mr. Speaker, if that's not child abuse in its most extreme form, I don't know what is.  It is easy to be horrified, she went on in her testimony to say, this nurse, by heart-wrenching stories such as these and to imagine the torture abortion survivors endure as they are being killed. But it is somehow not so easy for some to envision preborn babies the same age being tortured as they are killed by similar methods.  Today, premature babies are routinely given pain relief who are born at the same age as babies who are torn limb from limb or injected in the heart during abortions.  Even the World Health Organization goes so far as to recommend analgesia for premies getting simple heel pricks for a couple of drops of blood. Likewise, prenatal surgery is commonplace, and along with it, anesthesia for babies being operated on even in the middle of pregnancy. Meanwhile, babies of identical age are being torn apart by D&E abortions with no pain relief whatsoever. Again, they suffer, and they suffer horribly.  It must be that some people inexplicably think that the uterus provides a firewall against fetal pain, or that babies marked for abortion are somehow numb while their wanted counterparts aren't. They're not numb. They feel every single bit of killing, whether it's the Sopher clamp or any other instrument is being used to dismember or to decapitate.  She concludes by saying:       This thinking is better suited for the Middle Ages than for      modern medicine.  Mr. Speaker, today there is ample documentation that unborn children experience serious pain from at least the 20th week--and most likely even before that. When it comes to pain, all of us go through great lengths to mitigate its severity and its duration. None of us ever want to die a painful death. Unborn children deserve no less.  I yield to the prime sponsor of this very important legislation, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Franks), the chairman of the committee and, like I said, the author of the bill.
