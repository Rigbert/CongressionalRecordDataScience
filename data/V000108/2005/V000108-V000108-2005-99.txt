Speaker, it is my distinct pleasure to recognize and commend the members of the Gary, Indiana, branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). On Friday, May 13, 2005, the Gary NAACP will hold its 42nd Annual Life Membership Banquet and Scholarship Dinner at the St. Timothy Fellowship Hall in Gary, Indiana.  This annual event is a major fundraiser for the Gary branch of the NAACP. The funds generated through this activity, and others like it, go directly to the organization's needed programs and advocacy efforts. The featured speaker at this gala event will be Attorney Dennis Wayne Archer. Attorney Archer will be honored with the Roy Wilkins Award. Archer is the Immediate Past President of the American Bar Association. He is the first person of color to hold the position as president of the ABA. Attorney Archer is also the former Mayor of the City of Detroit.  Attorney Fred Work will be honored with the Benjamin Hooks Award. Attorney Work is a distinguished attorney who has provided legal services to many citizens, not only in the community of Gary, but also throughout the State of Indiana. Attorney Work was the first African-American Judge in Lake County. Work was also the first African-American to graduate from Vanderbilt Law School and the first African-America to be nominated by the Democratic Party for statewide office.  The Gary NAACP would also like to recognize the accomplishments of the West SideHigh School girls basketball team. The team's record is 24-4. The team's winning accomplishments include: the Gary Holiday Tournament, the Northwest Conference, the East Chicago Sectional, the Valparaiso Regional, and the Elkhart Semi-State finals. Those team players I would like to applaud are Michelle Hamblin, Isabell Rhenwrick (recipient of the 2004-2005 Patricia L. Roy Mental Attitude Award) Ashley Cheairs, Ashley Gates, Farren Congress, Candise Matthews, Shanee' Butler, Erica Simpson, Jaime Sherls, Lecreia Hudson, Loreal Brown, Jasmine Brown, Moenesha Headen, Sydney Pettigrew, Ashley Woods, Nicole Moore, Britney Peeples, and Britney Harris. I would also like to recognize Head Coach Rod Fisher and Assistant Coaches Darryl Brandford, Erza Alexander, and Arnetta Gates. Their leadership both on and off the basketball court is a valuable resource to the girls on the West Side girls basketball team.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in paying tribute to the new life members as well as the other members of the Gary NAACP for the efforts, activities, and leadership that these outstanding men and women have championed to improve the quality of life for all residents of Indiana's First Congressional District.                          ____________________
