Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is way off base, and I can tell my colleagues from my own family experience how far off base he is.  My mother died of Alzheimer's disease. For the last year and a half of her life, she did not know who I was, she did not know who my wife was, she did not know who my sister was, or who my kids were. And to insinuate that those of us who disagree with the gentleman's amendment are Luddites and insensitive is flat-out wrong.  Furthermore, my beloved wife, who I have been married to for almost 26 years, has had a spinal cord injury. She has no sensitivity below her waist. She is a wonderful woman. She has given me two wonderful children, and we have lived day by day and minute by minute with that kind of a condition; and she and I are both in favor of what the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Weldon) is trying to do because there is an ethical issue and there is a moral issue involved in this, which many people want to turn their backs on. But in my family we have to live with it every day and every minute, and we will until death do us part.  Now, the whole issue on this amendment, to get back to my initial remarks, is the policing of what is done with the cloned embryos that the Greenwood amendment allows. 99.99 percent of the people that do the experimentation on cloned embryos may do it in an entirely ethical manner. But all we need is one unethical person to implant a cloned embryo in utero and we have a cloned baby. And once that unethical person plants the cloned embryo in utero and it starts developing as a fetus, what does that gentleman's amendment do about it? Absolutely nothing. Are we going to throw somebody in jail for doing that? Are we going to throw the mother in jail for doing that? No way. The baby is going to be born, and we are going to have a cloned human being.  Again, Bill Clinton's bioethics panel said: ``The commission began its discussions fully recognizing that any effort in humans to transfer a somatic cell nucleus into an enucleated egg involves the creation of an embryo with the apparent potential to be implanted in utero and developed to term.''                              {time}  1615  Your substitute does not deal with this issue at all. That is why it is fatally flawed.  Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Weldon).
