Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 267) expressing the sense of the House of Representatives with regard to Shuttle Mission STS-93, commanded by Colonel Eileen Collins, the first female space shuttle commander.  The Clerk read as follows:                              H. Res. 267       Whereas Shuttle Mission STS-93 successfully deployed the      Chandra X-Ray Observatory;       Whereas the Chandra X-Ray Observatory will provide      scientists from around the world with a better understanding      of the structure and evolution of the universe;       Whereas Shuttle Mission STS-93 is the first mission in the      history of the United States space program to be commanded by      a woman;       Whereas women continue to be underrepresented in the      science, engineering, and technology fields;       Whereas the selection of Colonel Eileen Collins as the      first female space shuttle commander has raised the level of      awareness and appreciation of women's contributions in the      advancement of science; and       Whereas Colonel Eileen Collins' accomplishments in the      United States space program have made her a role model for      women pursuing an education and career in scientific fields:      Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That the House of Representatives--       (1) congratulates the crew of Shuttle Mission STS-93 and      honors Colonel Eileen Collins on being the first female      commander of a United States space shuttle;       (2) recognizes the important contribution Colonel Eileen      Collins has made to the United States space program and to      the advancement of women in science; and       (3) invites Colonel Eileen Collins and the crew of STS-93      to the United States Capitol to be honored and recognized by      the House of Representatives for their achievements.
