 President, we are about to vote on cloture on a very important maritime cargo security bill. This is a bill that will have a significant impact on the Nation's security, as it is implemented. A number of people have been working on the floor for the last several days to work our way through amendments. I think a lot of progress has been made, and I am very pleased with the number of improvements that have been made to this bill over the last several days.  When this bill is finally passed out of the Senate and conferenced with the House, which I hope will occur shortly, and signed by the President, we can all say that in a bipartisan way we have significantly made a difference in the lives of all Americans.  In a moment we will be voting on cloture. That means this bill is very close to the end. We have a few amendments we are going to be dealing with, but both the Republican leader and the Democratic leader have been clear they want this bill finished by early afternoon. That means if any of our colleagues on our side have an amendment they need to have discussed, they need to talk with us during this cloture vote or their amendment will not be considered. So I urge anybody on my side who has an amendment out there, an issue that needs to be dealt with, to talk with us during this coming cloture vote.  Mr. President, with that, I urge my colleagues on my side to vote for cloture and to move this very important piece of legislation forward.
