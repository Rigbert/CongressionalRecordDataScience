Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  I believe this is also a constructive amendment and would hope that the committee would approve it. It increases a wage priority. It strengthens the law to make voidable fraudulent transfers and excessive compensation and also provides better protection for employee health care benefits. All three of these I believe are very good ideas, and I would urge that the amendment be approved.
