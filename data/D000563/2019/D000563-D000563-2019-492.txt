President, every day, the American farmer works hard to keep the faith and survive unknowns--from changes in the marketplace or the unpredictability of the weather, to changes in public policy. We saw that in the 1980s with disruptions in our export markets, depressed prices, creeping debt, and high production costs. We see that same today. Just like then, Illinois farm families have a trusted person fighting to keep their operations strong and to help pave the way for a stronger future for farming--his name is Steve Scates.  I am here today to honor my friend Steve, who was recently named one of this year's Southern Illinois University Distinguished Alumni. He has more than earned this prestigious recognition.  A native of Shawneetown in southern Illinois, Steve has worked his entire life in agriculture, from production agriculture with his grandfather, who founded Pat Scates and Sons Farm, to developing public policy that supports our farmers. Ever since he earned his bachelor's degree from Southern Illinois University in 1959 in animal sciences, Steve has been actively involved in a wide range of professional agricultural organizations, including in several leadership posts, like chair of the Illinois Soybean Association board of directors.  President Bill Clinton recognized Steve's experience and hard work supporting the Illinois farming community by appointing him the State Executive Director for the Illinois offices of the USDA Farm Service Agency, where he served for 8 years and played a critical role in the implementation of the 1996 farm bill programs.  He went on to serve as chairperson of the Illinois Council for Food and Agricultural Research. During his time there, he received more awards than can be counted, including the Farm Bureau Eagle Award, the USDA Secretary's Award, and the SIU College of Agricultural Sciences 2008 Outstanding Alumni Award.  With all the awards and recognition, Steve's career has really been about helping people. While he is part of one of the largest farming operations in Illinois, he has always worked to look out for the interests of the smallest of farming operations to ensure they received a fair shake.  Although today they say that Steve has retired from farming, I know that he is still actively involved and serves as a senior partner at Pat Scates and Sons Farms and on the board of directors for Scates Gardens, Inc. Steve is never far from his partner and wife, Kappy, and his heart is always with his fabulous family.  Illinois agriculture is lucky to have a champion like Steve and his family still going strong in the farming community. America and Illinois need leaders like Steve now more than ever.                          ____________________
