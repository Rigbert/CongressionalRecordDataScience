 But I would like to clarify an important point regarding the authority of the judiciary to expend funds to conduct so-called gender and racial bias studies under HR 2076. Although the Judiciary requested a specific line item in the appropriations legislation for the coming fiscal year to support such studies, no such line item has been included in HR 2076. Furthermore, in the chairman's mark, approximately $700,000 was removed from the Crime Trust Fund from which the race-gender bias studies could be conducted. Am I correct that these actions indicate an intent on the part of the Appropriations Committee not to fund race-gender bias studies?
