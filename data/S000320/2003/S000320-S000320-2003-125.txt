 President, I would like to take this opportunity to ask the Chairman of the Finance Committee about the Committee's intent with respect to Section 333, the section entitled ``Denial of Deduction for Certain Fines, Penalties, and Other Amounts.'' As currently drafted, Section 333 eliminates tax deductions for amounts paid or incurred at the direction of a governmental entity in relation to the violation of any law or the investigation or inquiry into the potential violation of any law.  Although I appreciate the Chairman's intent, I am concerned that this provision is drafted too broadly and applies to fees and compliance expenses that are mandated by regulators and that depository institutions must pay. For example, banks and thrifts are subject to routine, as well as special, examinations as part of supervisory reviews by State regulators, the FDIC, the Office of Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve Board and the Office of Thrift Supervision.
