 President, I rise today to bring to the attention of my Senate colleagues the retirement of Charles Land, publisher of the Tuscaloosa News. After 40 years of service to the News, the city of Tuscaloosa, and the State of Alabama, Charlie has decided to turn over the job of publishing the Tuscaloosa News, and hopes to spend more time working in the community, golfing, fishing, and writing. I would like to take just a few moments, Mr. President, to recognize the outstanding professional and community leadership Charlie has provided over the years.  A native of Memphis, TN, Charlie Land grew up in Tuscaloosa, attended Tuscaloosa public schools and the University of Alabama, and served his country for 3 years in the U.S. Army. Charlie's newspaper career began in high school, where he covered sports for the school paper--an experience that helped prepare him for his first position at the Tuscaloosa News as a sportswriter. In 1966, he was named Alabama Sportswriter of the Year, and his success led to a series of promotions at the News.  In 1978, Charlie was named publisher of the Tuscaloosa News, and since then he has been a leader in the newspaper industry not only in Alabama, but throughout the southeast. He has served as president of the Alabama Press Association, a board member of the Southern Newspaper Publishers Association, president and board member of the Alabama Press Association Journalism Foundation and has won several State writing awards from the Associated Press and the Alabama Press Association.  In addition to this professional success, Charlie Land has been an outstanding civil leader, dedicating his time and energy to many worthy causes. He is currently the chairman of the President's Cabinet at the University of Alabama as well as a member of the National Steering Committee and chairman of the Journalism Department division for the University of Alabama Capital Campaign. In the past, Mr. Land has served as board member of Crimestoppers, president of the United Way of Tuscaloosa County, president of the Greater Tuscaloosa Chamber of Commerce, and a board member of the Society of Fine Arts.  Mr. President, Charlie Land's dedication to his community and his professional abilities are apparent, and I could mention the many, many awards and honors he has received in recognition of his work. But, as much as Charlie is a business and community leader, he is also a friend and advisor to many organizations and individuals in Tuscaloosa and the State of Alabama.  Recently, the Chamber of Commerce of West Alabama organized a tribute in honor of Charlie Land. The people who have worked with him over the years praised him for having done so much for Tuscaloosa. ``When Charlie is your friend, you need few others,'' one attendee said. Others commented on his extraordinary insight and great skills as a listener and advisor.   Charlie Land's insight, dedication, attitude, and abilities have made him an invaluable member not only of the Tuscaloosa News, but also of the greater Tuscaloosa community. His retirement may mark the end of a remarkable newspaper career, but the contributions he has made to the newspaper industry, the arts, and Tuscaloosa area business and development will be his legacy.  Mr. President, I would like to thank Charlie Land for many years of dedication and work on behalf of the people of Tuscaloosa and the State of Alabama. I know that the leadership and advice he provided the Tuscaloosa News will be missed, but I am confident that he will continue his involvement in community and civic activities. I thank him for his work, and wish him the best in his retirement.                          ____________________
