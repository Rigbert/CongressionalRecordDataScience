 President, I rise today to pay tribute to Mr. Jack Warner, a pillar of the Tuscaloosa business community and a man of deep passion both in his business and personal pursuits. The former Chairman and CEO of Gulf States Paper Corporation, I would like to recognize him for the work that he and his wife, Elizabeth, have contributed to Tuscaloosa in the form of time, expertise and money to many local causes.  The pragmatic approach that he has brought to his life combines old-fashioned common sense with a flexible philosophy. This philosophy has evolved over time, through two world wars, numerous labor strikes, and tough financial circumstances. Through it all, Jack Warner has remained steadfast in his beliefs and a pioneer from which others might draw inspiration. He has made tough business decisions throughout the years, and through it all kept Gulf States Paper privately owned, when so many other companies have gone public. His gritty determination has led to financial success, which has helped him to pursue his personal interests and also allowed him to give back to the Tuscaloosa community.  Jack Warner truly represents an era when a man presented his best effort to any obstacle in his path. As an officer in the Army's last horse-mounted unit, his cavalry unit was sent to India to pack supplies along the Burma trail during World War II. Once there, his unit was issued mules instead of horses, which would be enough to take the wind out of any proud soldier's sails. Jack Warner persevered however, and his regiment ended up making a significant contribution to the War effort when a traditional cavalry unit would have had little to offer. This story encapsulates the life of Jack Warner, demonstrating persistence through adversity, and a humble focus to get the job done right.  Jack Warner has made a tremendous impact on Tuscaloosa and the surrounding area. In fact, he has recently completed the redecoration of the University of Alabama President's Mansion at his own expense. Perhaps almost as importantly, Jack followed through with the renovation to the last small detail, going so far as to choose the drapery as well as replacing a smaller chandelier with an immense late 18th century Waterford crystal chandelier. Again, this typifies the man which has been so integral to the Tuscaloosa community, not only providing the money for the project, but following through and making sure everything turned out right. His commitment to Tuscaloosa and the State of Alabama is greatly appreciated.                          ____________________
