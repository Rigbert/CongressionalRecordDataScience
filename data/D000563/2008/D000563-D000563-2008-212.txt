To put that in layman's terms, for the last 4 years, we have frozen the increases of spending at the National Institutes of Health for medical research. Senator Grassley would say, let's continue freezing those increases in spending for medical research so we don't have to impose taxes on American businesses doing business overseas. I disagree with that. It is far better that those businesses pay those taxes than we cut back on medical research. I object.
