President, I want to make sure I understand the context. The bill we on the Democratic side support would not only have tax breaks for working Americans and for those who have been unemployed, to give them some assistance, it would also provide business incentives for depreciation, for example, and for capital investment. But the stimulus plan, the recovery plan we are supporting, also makes an expenditure for homeland security.  I would like to ask the majority leader if he has run into the same thing I have run into. My Republican Governor in my State has come to me and said that our State of Illinois needs $20 million for a statewide communications network for police and firefighters to deal with crises and emergencies. My State, as most States, is running short of revenue in this recession. He has asked for help from Washington.  Is it my understanding that the spending stimulus package the Democrats support would provide assistance for that kind of law enforcement, firefighting, and first response capability. Is that what we are asking for, which was denied us in this point of order that was raised on the floor?
