Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me.  Mr. Speaker, I have heard some interesting things. I guess we could call it election year hyperbole. Somehow this legislation, fast track, is going to be the salvation of our failing family farms. Can they hang on for 5 or 10 years until the next hypothetical trade agreements brought forward under fast track? I don't think so.  Guess what, the last two agreements that came forward under fast track screwed the farmers in America. They were promised the world, but when it came down to whether the banking sector or the aerospace sector or the computer sector got favorable treatment in those agreements, and something had to be traded off, what got traded off? Agriculture.  This is about a process that includes plausible deniability. That means there are a lot of people here who do not want to take responsibility for what is happening in America. They can say, you know, I had concerns about NAFTA. I knew there were problems with some parts of NAFTA. I knew there were problems with labor agreements, they were kind of weak, and we lost a lot of jobs there, and wages have gone down on both sides of the border. Yes, I had some real concerns about those environmental provisions. I really did not think they would clean up the border, which is one of the largest and fastest growing hazardous waste sites in the world. But I had to vote up or down, and I could not sacrifice 2 years of secret negotiations, and we will fix those things later.  That is what we hear every time an agreement comes forward under fast track. Are Members going to blow up three years of careful secret negotiations, just because they have a minor concern about their farmers or about the environment or about American workers? No. The herd here most times said, gee, I would have liked to do something, but I could not. Why could they not? Because they gave away that authority at the beginning.  Do not give away that authority ever again. Have Members not learned from our past mistakes? Can we not learn from a $200 billion a year trade deficit? Can we not learn from a race to the bottom in terms of wages and the environment?  If we cannot learn, then hopefully the election year shenanigans here, this will help family farms, it is not going to do a damned thing for family farms, and the Members know that.                Announcement by the Speaker pro tempore.
