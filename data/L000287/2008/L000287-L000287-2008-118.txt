Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of the GIVE Act and I thank my colleague Mrs. Maloney for her leadership on this issue. Volunteers in our National Service Corps are doing the hard work of building what I like to call the Beloved Community--a community at peace with itself based on justice and human dignity.  We all live in one house, the American house, and people are suffering. We need so many more Americans to volunteer, to share their talents, their time and their love. That is how we form the Beloved Community.  So many Americans are giving of themselves through Americorps/VISTA, Summer of Service, and our Senior Volunteer Corps. Many more want to give and volunteer, but they can't find the time. They are stuck at work trying to make ends meet. They sit in traffic. They are helping their kids with homework. Businesses and governments need to encourage and allow people to volunteer.  Young people have been behind all of the great social movements in this Nation. We must tap into the idealism and the talents of our young people, and the young at heart, who can build bridges and ease suffering.  Something is happening in America. In Atlanta, we are embracing the merger between the Points of Light Foundation and the ``Hands On'' Network. I want to mention their good work and their leadership in recruiting and training volunteers.  I look forward to working with my colleagues to find more ways, like competitive grants for nonprofits, to expand our volunteer infrastructure, to push our national service agenda forward.  The GIVE Act is a good bill. It has my support. I thank my colleagues.
