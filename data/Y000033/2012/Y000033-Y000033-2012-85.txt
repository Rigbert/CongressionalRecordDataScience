Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a great American and a great Alaskan. Barney Uhart, a devoted father and President Emeritus of Chugach Alaska Corporation, passed away on Saturday, September 8th after a lengthy battle with cancer.  Barney's career with Chugach Alaska Corporation began in 1993, and in 2000, he became President and CEO. During his tenure, the company grew phenomenally, rising in revenue from $19 million in 1993 to over $1 billion in 2009. He was not only a charismatic leader and hard worker, but a close friend to many who worked with him over the years. His hard work and total commitment helped provide real, tangible, and ongoing benefits to the Native Shareholders of Chugach as he strove tirelessly to help fulfill the promises of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. His contributions to making the SBA 8(a) program a resounding success, not only for Chugach, but for all Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and Native American Tribes, are truly outstanding, and we are all grateful to him for his achievements.  On July 6, 2012, Barney announced his retirement from Chugach to focus on his health and spend time with his family. The Board of Directors of Chugach Alaska Corporation appointed Barney ``President Emeritus'' in honor of his 19 years of service, dedication, and leadership.  Barney's career with Chugach began when he joined Chugach Development Corporation (CDC) as Operations Manager. With a background in Engineering and Business Administration, his project experience in managing Base Operation Services (BOS) contracts in extremely remote locations began 33 years ago when he went to work on his first BOS contract in 1979 on Wake Island.  Barney told of his Wake Island initiation by saying, ``I was living in Hawaii and one day I was helping a friend deliver office furniture to a place called Kentron International. I had no idea what they did, but it sounded like an exotic and exciting place to work where you would get to travel. The next day I put together a resume and slid it under the door. Then I had an interview, and after about 45 minutes, I thought the interview was over and I got up to leave when the manager said, `When can you leave?' The following Tuesday I was on a plane to Wake Island in the mid- Pacific and I still didn't know what Kentron International did.'' Clearly, Barney never shied away from a new opportunity.  Born in Fresno, California in 1952, Barney moved to Hawaii in 1970 after high school and his father's passing. During this time, the Vietnam War was still raging. Barney's brother had already done two tours in Vietnam, and he expected to be drafted at any time. Regardless, he enrolled in the University of Hawaii and played baseball. Barney then worked general construction until he decided it wasn't the area he wanted to pursue, and instead seized opportunity by the hand when he went to Wake on his first federal contract job.  In 1985 Barney spent a winter in Greenland on the Defense Early Warning (DEW) Line and was then offered a job as Superintendent of Administration for the DEW line, but declined because he didn't want to spend another year in the Arctic. As a result, he left to work for his first SBA 8(a) company in Hampton, Virginia where he helped grow the company in revenue from $200,000 to $6 million a year.  In early 1988, Barney was offered a job with an SBA 8(a) company in Louisville, Kentucky, and was promoted to Vice-President of Operations. He moved into the Company's new offices in Panama City, Florida. Later, he received a call from Mike Brown (Chugach's President and CEO from 1992 to 1999) who was working at that time for PMC, a subsidiary of Arctic Slope Regional Corporation.  Mr. Brown received Barney's name from someone who worked with him at Wake Island years before. Based on that recommendation, Mike wanted Barney to become the BOS contract Project Manager at Amchitka Island, on the Aleutian Chain. Not wanting to move to Amchitka Island, Barney declined the offer and went back to Florida. Five months later, Mr. Brown called him again and offered him a job as Manager of Special Projects in Anchorage.  Years later, Barney recalled with a laugh, ``This time the position was in Anchorage, so I accepted, and one of the first jobs as Manager of Special Projects in Anchorage was to go out to Amchitka Island and evaluate the contract. So he kinda suckered me in with that one.''  While at PMC, the team he worked with received a Coast Guard contract, the Wake Island contract, and the contract to run Midway Island. By then he was Vice-President of Operations for PMC, when Mr. Brown, who hadgone to work for Chugach, along with Dusty Kaser (Chugach's President and CEO from mid to late 1999), recruited him again. His early work with Chugach Development Corporation (CDC) took him to Valdez for six months, and then to King Salmon for a year, and then to Adak, Alaska.  Barney recently recalled, ``During that time, the Chugach management team started marketing the Wake Island contract and we took it away from PMC in 1996. So you can see that Wake has been in my blood for a while, then we received a contract for the Army Housing and Maintenance at Fort Richardson/Fort Wainwright in 1995.''  By 1996, Barney became the Ops Manager for CDC and would often travel to the contract locations and oversee the start-ups. When he left to oversee the start-up of Wake for CAC, he returned full circle to the site from where he started 16 years earlier.  Barney later explained, ``By then I had become the BOS Ops Manager for CAC working for Dusty Kaser and the team started getting more and more contracts. Then I was promoted to Vice-President of Ops for CAC, and when I came back from starting up MacDill in late 1999, I was offered the job as president of CAC.'' In May 2000, the Board of Directors of Chugach promoted Barney to the position of President/CEO and he served as both until 2009 when the position was split to select a qualified Chugach shareholder to lead as CEO.  Mr. Speaker, Chugach has become a shining example of an Alaskan Native Corporation that has succeeded and thrived, and one that has provided tremendous benefits to its Native Shareholders and employees. Barney deserves his full share of credit for this success.  There can be no clearer expression of the excellence that Barney, and Chugach, have achieved over the years, than the words of Barney himself. And so Mr. Speaker, I close with an additional quote from Barney Uhart, a leader, a friend, and a champion of doing the right thing, and of doing things right. He will be deeply missed and his memory will stay with us forever.  ``How have we gotten to where we are today? The reason is simple--the people. All the people associated with Chugach are responsible for this success. From the wisdom and direction of the Board of Directors; the patience of the shareholders; the vision and perseverance of management; and the dedication and drive of all the employees, this is what has allowed us to succeed.''  Mr. Speaker, May God bless and hold Barney Uhart and may He bless his family.                          ____________________
