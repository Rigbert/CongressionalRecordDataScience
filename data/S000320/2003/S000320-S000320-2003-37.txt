 President, I would like to respond to the Democratic leader.  First of all, we have gotten to where we are tonight on the Fair Credit Reporting Act coming out of the Banking Committee by working together in a bipartisan way. Senator Sarbanes and the Democrats on the committee have been involved in the formulation of this legislation as so many members of the Banking Committee have. That is why we are here today. That is why we believe we have put together a far-reaching, very complex piece of legislation. We are going to continue--assuming this bill passes and goes into conference--to work together because that is the only way we are going to pass this legislation. This legislation, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, would expire at the end of this year. We know we are working on a deadline. We are working on a good piece of legislation. We want to continue that.  I yield to the Senator from Maryland.
