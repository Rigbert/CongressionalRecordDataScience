Mr. Speaker, unfortunately the ironic phrase ``no good deed goes unpunished`` suits the case of Russian citizen Alexandr Nikitin. Most Russian officials will be the first to admit that the collapsed Soviet military-industrial complex left behind a deplorable environmental legacy which affects not only the Russian Federation but also Russia's neighbors. The best known example is Chernobyl, but environmental specialists could provide a much longer list of environmental ``hot spots.'' Regrettably, certain elements of the Russian military and security service seemdetermined to continue the Soviet practice of hiding the truth about environmental depredation.  Mr. Speaker, retired Russian naval officer Alexandr Nikitin has been charged with ``revealing state secrets''--and if convicted, could receive the death sentence--for his work with the Norwegian environmental organization ``Bellona'' in exposing both the Soviet and Russian Navy's nuclear waste dumping around the White Sea and Kola Peninsular in northeast Russia. Nikitin and his supporters claim that all the material he secured for Bellona's report, ``The Russian Northern Fleet: Sources of Radioactive Contamination,'' had already been published in open sources.  Originally charged in February 1996, he was held in detention until December 1996, when an international outcry was raised in his behalf. Still the investigation continues to drag on and on and on.  The problem, from the standpoint of the investigators and the security services, is that the Russian Federation has a constitution with provisions on civil liberties, which some in Russia take seriously, and there are now lawyers in Russia who actually know the law and defend their clients. At first, the investigators threatened to indict Nikitin on secret unpublished military instructions, but this was in conflict with Part 3, Art. 15 of the Constitution, ``no regulatory legal act affecting the rights, liberties or duties of the human being and citizen may apply unless it has been published officially for general knowledge.'' Now after six attempted indictments, investigators have produced an indictment that the claim will pass constitutional muster.  The prominent Ukrainian writer Nicholai Gogol wrote a fictional story about a legal case that dragged on for years in Tsarist Russia. Nikitin must identify with a character from that story.  Through efforts of concerned human rights and environmental activists, the international community has begun to focus attention on the Nikitin case. Amnesty International has declared him as Russia's only political prisoner since the fall of the Soviet Union. The Prime Ministers of Norway and Canada have raised Nikitin's case with Prime Minister Chernomyrdin, and President Clinton has called for ``just deliberations'' in the case. A couple of weeks ago, former Soviet President Gorbachev stated that ``there is nothing to [the Nikitin case], but that ``democratic Russia still can't let go of its affection for catching spies.''  Meanwhile, back on the streets of St. Petersburg, Alexandr Nikitin has been followed, believe it or not, by a group of ``men in black.'' The tires on his car have been slashed, and his door locks filed with glue. Recently, one of his lawyers was accosted by unidentified thugs and told to ``stay away from this.'' Another lawyer suggests, quite plausibly, that the security services realize their case is an embarrassment, and they want Nikitin to fear for his life and that of his family so that he will admit to the charges in exchange for amnesty.  Mr. Speaker, I believe sincerely that the American people and the Congress wish the Russian people well, and we wish to work together in areas such as the environment that will benefit both our peoples. But, the case of Alexandr Nikitin raises serious doubts about the Russian military and security services to find a reasonable balance between security and the public interest.  I recognize that the Russian Government and the people are working toward civilian control of the military and an established rule of law system. The resolution of the Nikitin case will be a significant indicator of progress in these areas.                          ____________________
