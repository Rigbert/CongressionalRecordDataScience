Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. Gerry L. Nannenga for his lifelong contributions to the labor movement. This is a very special pleasure, as I have known Gerry for the better part of two decades and have seen firsthand the efforts of his dynamic accomplishments on behalf of the community. On Thursday, July 31, 2003, the Indiana Regional Council of Carpenters and Millwrights will salute Gerry for his dedicated work, serving the union members in the State of Indiana as Executive Secretary-Treasurer. Fortunately, Gerry will have the opportunity to continue his distinguished career in the labor movement, as he is being promoted to serve the needs of working carpenters nationwide.  Gerry Nannenga has dedicated a substantial portion of his life to the betterment of union members and the community of Northwest Indiana, as well as the entire State of Indiana.  Gerry's distinguished career in the labor movement has made the community and the State of Indiana a better place in which to live and work. For more than 28 years, Gerry Nannenga has served as a member of Local 1005 of the Carpenters Union. Additionally, Gerry served as Business Manager of the Northwest Indiana District Council of Carpenters and Millwrights, as well as, past President of the Northwest Indiana Federation of Labor. Gerry has always devoted his career toward the expansion of labor ideals and fair standards for all working people.  While Gerry Nannenga has dedicated considerable time and energy to his work with the Indiana Regional Council of Carpenters and Millwrights, he has always made an extra effort to give back to the community. He has served on the Indiana State Building Trades Executive Board and the Lake Area United Way Executive Committee. Additionally, in 1998, Governor Frank O'Bannon appointed him to the Indiana Port Commission.  Although his work and community service put extraordinary demands on his time, Gerryhas never limited the time he gives to his most important interest, his family. He and his wife, Deborah, have three children: Staci, Christopher, and Samantha.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating Mr. Nannenga for his professional achievements and his many years of dedication to the betterment of our community. We in Northwest Indiana are truly thankful to have someone of Gerry's talents on our team. His work in the labor movement provided workers in Indiana opportunities they might not have otherwise had. Gerry Nannenga's leadership has and will continue to keep the region's labor force strong and help keep America working.                          ____________________
