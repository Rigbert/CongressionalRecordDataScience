Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Autism (sometimes called ``classical autism'') is the      most common condition in a group of developmental disorders      known as autism spectrum disorders.       (2) Autism spectrum disorders include autism as well as      Asperger syndrome, Retts syndrome, childhood disintegrative      disorder, and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise      specified (usually referred to as PDD-NOS), as well as other      related developmental disorders.       (3) Individuals with autism spectrum disorders have the      same rights as other individuals to exert control and choice      over their own lives, to live independently, and to      participate fully in, and contribute to, their communities      and society through full integration and inclusion in the      economic, political, social, cultural, and educational      mainstream of society. Individuals with autism spectrum      disorders have the right to a life with dignity and purpose.       (4) While there is no uniform prevalence or severity of      symptoms associated with autism spectrum disorders, the      National Institutes of Health has determined that autism      spectrum disorders are characterized by 3 distinctive      behaviors: impaired social interaction, problems with verbal      and nonverbal communication, and unusual, repetitive, or      severely limited activities and interests.       (5) Both children and adults with autism spectrum disorders      can show difficulties in verbal and nonverbal communication,      social interactions, and sensory processing. Individuals with      autism spectrum disorders exhibit different symptoms or      behaviors, which may range from mild to significant, and      require varying degrees of support from friends, families,      service providers, and communities.       (6) Individuals with autism spectrum disorders often need      assistance in the areas of comprehensive early intervention,      health, recreation, job training, employment, housing,      transportation, and early, primary, and secondary education.      With access to, and assistance with, these types of services      and supports, individuals with autism spectrum disorders can      live rich, full, and productive lives. Greater coordination      and streamlining within the service delivery system will      enable individuals with autism spectrum disorders and their      families to access assistance from all sectors throughout an      individual's lifespan.       (7) A 2007 report from the Centers for Disease Control and      Prevention found that the prevalence of autism spectrum      disorders is estimated to be 1 in 150 people in the United      States.       (8) The Harvard School of Public Health reported that the      cost of caring for and treating individuals with autism      spectrum disorders in the United States is more than      $35,000,000,000 annually (an estimated $3,200,000 over an      individual's lifetime).       (9) Although the overall incidence of autism is consistent      around the globe, researchers with the Journal of Paediatrics      and Child Health have found that males are 4 times more      likely to develop an autism spectrum disorder than females.      Autism spectrum disorders know no racial, ethnic, or social      boundaries, nor differences in family income, lifestyle, or      educational levels, and can affect any child.       (10) Individuals with autism spectrum disorders from low-     income, rural, and minority communities often face      significant obstacles to accurate diagnosis and necessary      specialized services, supports, and education.       (11) There is strong consensus within the research      community that intensive treatment as soon as possible      following diagnosis not only can reduce the cost of lifelong      care by two-thirds, but also yields the most positive life      outcomes for children with autism spectrum disorders.       (12) Individuals with autism spectrum disorders and their      families experience a wide range of medical issues. Few      common standards exist for the diagnosis and management of      many aspects of clinical care. Behavioral difficulties may be      attributed to the overarching disorder rather than to the      pain and discomfort of a medical condition, which may go      undetected and untreated. The health care and other      treatments available in different communities can vary      widely. Many families, lacking access to comprehensive and      coordinated health care, must fend for themselves to find the      best health care, treatments, and services in a complex      clinical world.       (13) Effective health care, treatment, and services for      individuals with autism spectrum disorders depends upon a      continuous exchange among researchers and caregivers.      Evidence-based and promising autism practices should move      quickly into communities, allowing individuals with autism      spectrum disorders and their families to benefit from the      newest research and enabling researchers to learn from the      life experiences of the people whom their work most directly      affects.       (14) There is a critical shortage of appropriately trained      personnel across numerous important disciplines who can      assess, diagnose, treat, and support children and adults with      autism spectrum disorders and their families. Practicing      professionals, as well as those in training to become      professionals, need the most up-to-date practices informed by      the most current research findings.       (15) The appropriate goals of the Nation regarding      individuals with autism spectrum disorder are the same as the      appropriate goals of the Nation regarding individuals with      disabilities in general, as established in the Americans with      Disabilities Act of 1990     (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.): to assure equality of opportunity,      full participation, independent living, and economic self-     sufficiency for such individuals.       (16) Finally, individuals with autism spectrum disorders      are often denied health care benefits solely because of their      diagnosis, even though proven, effective treatments for      autism spectrum disorders do exist.

Nothing in this Act shall be construed to modify the legal      rights of parents or legal guardians under Federal, State, or      local law regarding the care of their children.     SEC. 4.
