 President, I rise today to support the nomination of Judge Samuel Alito to be an Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.  Judge Alito's education, legal training, and judicial record have positioned him well to serve our Nation with honor and dignity on the Supreme Court. A graduate of Princeton and Yale, Judge Alito has more than 30 years of legal experience. Over the years, he has served as a judicial clerk, a prosecutor, an appellate lawyer before both the U.S. Court of Appeals and the U.S. Supreme Court. He has served as legal counsel to the U.S. Government and most recently as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third District. Judge Alito has a full breadth of experience in both criminal and civil cases as well as the trial and appeals phases of the judicial system.  I believe Judge Alito's record on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third District shows that he is a fair and impartial jurist. During his tenure on that court, it has been clear that he takes all legal theories and arguments into account when making decisions and issuing rulings. Judge Alito is well respected by his colleagues and has even received their praise for the manner and tone he takes in working through the facts to arrive at a decision. I do not recall anyone questioning his ability to do the job and in fact, he received a unanimous ``well-qualified'' rating from the American Bar Association, its highest rating.  While many have criticized Judge Alito's supposed judicial philosophy, I believe that his written decisions and statements as well as his appearance before the Judiciary Committee confirmed his ability to set personal views and ideology aside so as to not cloud his interpretation of the law. I commend Judge Alito for his poise and composure throughout one of the most arduous hearings in recent memory.
