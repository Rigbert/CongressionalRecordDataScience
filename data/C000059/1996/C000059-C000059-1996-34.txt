Chairman, I would like to thank Chairman Regula for allowing me the opportunity to offer this amendment.  My amendment would simply transfer $1 million from the Forest Service general administration account to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund. We are decreasing bureaucracy to bring money back to the local communities to help save endangered species.  The transferred money would be used to further the completion of habitat conservation plans and thus would serve two important purposes. It would provide lands as safe harbors for threatened and endangered species and bring us one step closer to creating multi-species preserves. It would also help protect American citizens from any negative effects of the Endangered Species Act by freeing them from various restrictions and fees. I would like to see acceptance of this amendment.
