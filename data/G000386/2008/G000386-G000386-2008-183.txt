 President, I would like to inform my colleagues that I have requested to be notified of any unanimous consent agreement before the Senate proceeds to the consideration of any legislation that amends the Immigration and Nationality Act. I intend to reserve my right to object to any such request unless legislation to reauthorize the E-verify program run by the Department of Homeland Security is included.  Last week, I introduced legislation to permanently extend the employment verification program, which was created in 1996. This program has been a valuable asset for more than 69,000 employers across the country that want to comply with our immigration laws. This program needs to be reauthorized this year. For that reason, I have asked the minority leader to consult me before any unanimous consent agreement on immigration legislation is considered.                          ____________________
