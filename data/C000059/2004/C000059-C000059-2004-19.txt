Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to close, and I want to again thank the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Napolitano) for her good work and her dedication on this legislation. She spent many hours and much of her time traveling through the State of California and throughout the western United States as we came to understand the issue of water.  There are very few subjects that bring out more emotion and passion than water, and certainly I have grown to understand the subject much better over the last number of years. I am looking forward to passing this bill today and moving ahead.
