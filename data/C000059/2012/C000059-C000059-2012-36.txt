Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to a good friend of mine, Arthur Hubert Webb. Hubert passed away Friday, May 25, 2012, at his home in Riverside, California. A resident of Riverside, California, for 78 years, he was a pillar of the community and will be deeply missed.  Hubert was born May 5, 1929, in Los Angeles, California, the son of Albert A. and Rebecca B. Webb. After graduating with honors in Civil Engineering from the University of Southern California, Hubert served honorably in the United States Army for two years. Hubert joined Albert A. Webb Associates in 1955 and served for 56 years, becoming President in 1984 and Chairman of the Board in 2000.  Hubert was an expert in water resources engineering, aiding clients such as Western Municipal Water District, Jurupa Community Services District, Crestline Lake Arrowhead Water Agency, City of Norco, and Edgemont Community Services District and shaping the dramatic growth of Southern California through his work. He was instrumental in designing 36,500 feet of pipeline and three pump stations to deliver water from the Riverside and Gage Canals to Western Municipal Water District's agricultural system. Hubert also served as the Chief Technical Advisor for the Riverside/Corona Feeder Project which stored water in wet years in the San Bernardino Valley ground water basins and delivered water during dry years to communities in Riverside County.  As a Professional Engineer in the State of California, he was active in the American Society of Civil Engineers, California Society of Professional Engineers, American Water Works Association, National Ground Water Association, California Water Environment Federation, Federal Water Environment Federation, and National Society of Professional Engineers. In 2008, Hubert was recognized as a Water Hero Award recipient for his donation of valuable and historical water resource documents from the library of Albert A. Webb Associates to the Water Resources Institute's archives.  Hubert was preceded in death by his wife Diane S. Webb. He is survived by his daughter Sandra Webb (Roger Prend); sons, Scott Webb and Steve Webb (Suzanne Anderson); sister Mary Webb (Gene Schaefer); 8 grandchildren; companion Diana Lingren, his nephew Matt and many other nieces and nephews.  On Thursday, June 7, a memorial service celebrating Hubert's extraordinary life will be held. Hubert will always be remembered for his incredible work ethic, generosity, contributions to the community and love of family. His dedication to his family, work, and community are a testament to a life lived well and a legacy that will continue. I extend my condolences to Hubert's family and friends; although Hubert may be gone, the light and goodness he brought to the world remain and will never be forgotten.                          ____________________
