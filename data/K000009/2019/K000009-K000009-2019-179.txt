Father Marty will be dearly remembered as a faithful Roman Catholic priest, a servant of God, who gave his unselfish and purposeful life to the people of Greater Toledo. Following the tribute is Father Donnelly's obituary.                Homily: Marty's Funeral Mass (Excerpts)        (Isaiah 61:1-11, Psalm 27, Acts 10:34-43, Luke 10:25-37)       A giant among us has left us. Reverend Marty Donnelly has      transitioned to the joy of eternal glory, but hurt in our      pain of loss.       First and understandably, we all offer special and      prayerful sympathy to those closest to Marty: Pat, his only      brother-in-law; his devoted nieces and nephews; his close      friend Tom Landgraff; and his beloved cousins, particularly      his second cousin Dorothy Taylor (I always found it awkward      to call her ``Buck''). Unquestionably, Buck warrants the deep      gratitude of all of us for her many, many years of      extraordinary, dedicated, and unselfish caretaking for Marty      right up to the end.       But what is the end? What is death? Here is my version of      another better-phrased story: freighter fully loaded leaving      a dock at Toledo Terminal on the Maumee River--dock workers      shout ``There she goes'' as the ship is seen as a speck      between the water of the bay and the sky--fully, loaded the      ship is observed by someone on Put-in-Bay who shouts ``Here      she comes''--the loaded ship is the same, the absence or      change is in the Toledo workers--and that is death.       Today we grieve the absence of Marty Donnelly. Yet we      believe that angels have already shouted ``Here he comes.''      Marty Donnelly knew that if life has the last word, then love      must overcome negativity and discord, forgiveness must      overcome bitterness, and generosity must overcome greed.       Marty had such faith. Yet, with great zest he appealingly      owned his own humanity and was clearly animated by a profound      prayer life, by the teachings of Vatican II and Pope Francis,      and by a continued embrace of Sacred Scripture.       Consider our first reading from Isaiah: the lowly hear good      news, the broken-hearted are healed; captives are set free;      prisoners are released; mourners are comforted and given      happiness, fancy attire, and called oaks of justice; ancient      ruins are rebuilt; ruined cities are restored; everlasting      joy will be with people who will be in a covenant with the      Lord.       In his meaningful and large life Marty understood this      mission. He remained, in his own words, ``terminally      hopeful.'' In that light he was one of 27 co-founders of the      Association of U.S. Catholic Priests during a retreat in      August 2011 and an active member of its local chapter's      Social Justice Subcommittee. The intended vision of that new      Association, now numbering some 1,200 nationally, is to be a      voice of priests for the complete teachings of Vatican II.       Fearless in his dedication to the social dimension of the      WHOLE Gospel, particularly as a very public voice in and for      our African American community. Impressive was his commitment      to that community AND to their youth. Noteworthy was his      vision in education in his many years at Central Catholic,      where he assembled an enormously gifted staff committed to      the Catholic social justice tradition. His education      vision continued in the Central City's Martin de Porres      Parish. With the generous support of his high school      classmate, he implemented a renovation of the Bancroft-     Detroit campus and created the Pacesetter Program which      provided some 100 Central City youth scholarships first to      Central Catholic and then to Xavier University. When St.      Ann School had to close, he and his classmate      imaginatively created a Charter School called The Peace      Academy to carry on Gospel-based values in a creative and      legal way.       You and I are here today to celebrate the powerful witness      that Marty himself gave us. Marty wanted us to be in a life-     giving movement that is about demonstrating God's goodness,      God's mercy and compassion, God's love--demonstrating those      to the larger societal movement. Marty realized that we could      do all sorts of pious things and still not actually follow      Jesus.       Marty uncompromisingly and generously lived as a Good      Samaritan. You, I, and our faith communities could profitably      do an honest reality check about our own efforts to dress      wounds, bring to an inn, offer care, and cover expenses for      those in our area who are somehow stripped, beaten, and left      half-dead.       We knew that Marty was not perfect . . . my goodness, his      fussing and fuming on a golf course was a spectacle. However,      he dared to dream big, out loud and in public. He intervened      with grand imagination. He emphasized Gospel-based action,      not self-reverential pieties. Marty invited us to move      doctrines and teachings to the level of actual experiences      and an authentically Christian lifestyle.       Although Marty creatively forged new paths of service in      Toledo and received many honors, he himself lived as a serf,      not a prince. He never constructed a clerical pedestal for      himself.       As Christ did, Marty pointed to the Kingdom of God already      in our midst. And he did this even as his brain functions      slowly worsened over the years. When his usually fine words      could not do so he did this by actions, to the end. To      observe Marty in any phase of his adult life was to know      God's Kingdom hiding in plain sight.       Wow!! What a remarkable friend and family man!! What an      authentic servant leader!! What a genuine man of God and of      the people!! If each of us would follow Jesus Christ the way      Marty did, our faith communities may actually be ``field      hospitals.''       Now, in our celebration of Eucharist we join together with      Christ in gratitude to our loving, gracious Father for the      beautiful gift of Paul Martin Donnelly. We thank God for who      he was to us, for what he was to us, and for how he was to      us. Then, fed by the Eucharist, we are missioned to go live      the Gospel in our own lives.       May our gracious God give eternal peace and joy to our      noble Good Samaritan we endearingly called Marty.       Amen                  Father P. Martin ``Marty'' Donnelly       Father P. Martin ``Marty'' Donnelly was sent by God on      August 16, 1938, which began a lifelong walk in service to      others. This journey touched many in the greater Northwest      Ohio community. Fr. Marty's journey of service ended when he      passed away January 27, 2019, surrounded by family and      friends. A life well done!       He was born the son of Leonard and Agnes Donnelly, who were      founding members of Most Blessed Sacrament Parish, where      Marty attended elementary school. Marty then attended Toledo      Central Catholic High School and was a member of ``the great      class of 1956''. Many of Marty's classmates renamed lifelong      friends and gathered regularly. After Central Catholic, Marty      followed his older brother Bob's path into the priesthood.       Marty attended St. Meinrad Seminary College and earned his      bachelor's degree in 1961. Subsequently, Marty attended      Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome and was ordained a      Roman Catholic priest in 1964. Fr. Marty also received a      Master in Education in 1973, from the University of Notre      Dame.       Once Fr. Marty entered the priesthood his life of service      accelerated with assignments at Norwalk St. Paul Parish and      High School from 1964-1968, and Lima Central Catholic from      1968-1973. It was in 1973, that Fr. Marty returned to his      alma mater, Toledo Central Catholic, as an Assistant      Principal. In 1976, he was named the seventh Principal and      later the first Pastor and President of Toledo Central      Catholic, a role he served until 1987. Fr. Marty became      Pastor at St. Ann and St. Theresa parishes in 1987, and      served as pastor of St. Martin de Porres from 1990 to 2005.      In 2005, he returned to his roots as Pastor of Most Blessed      Sacrament Parish until his retirement in 2011.       Through his years of faith filled service, Fr. Marty      mentored and supported youth from his schools, parishes and      neighborhoods, helping them to weave the fabric of their      communities. He will always be remembered for his dedication      to the poor and furthering social justice causes in the      community.       Fr. Marty was affiliated with many organizations including      Central City Ministries of Toledo, the Erase the Hate      Campaign, the Ohio Coalition against gun violence and the      Multi-Faith Council of Northwest Ohio. Through his advocacy      for these organizations and others, Fr. Marty touched the      lives of many.       Being a servant to others, he never sought or wanted      recognition for himself, however he earned many, including      Toledoan of the Year, receiving a Key to the City in 2005;      Central Catholic Golden Shamrock Award 2001; a Humanitarian      of the year award; Drum Major for Justice in 2005; the St.      Katherine Drexel award in 2006; a Voice for All People in      2007, and the Central City Ministry Service Award in 2011.       In addition to his passionate service to others Fr. Marty      was truly family centric, encompassing the Donnelly,      Hendricks and greater Quinn clans. Fr. Marty fully loved and      looked forward to the annual Quinn reunions where everyone      anticipated his creative costumes based upon the theme of the      family party.       Fr. Marty was preceded in death by his parents, Leonard and      Agnes Donnelly; brothers, Leonard ``Quinnie'', Most Reverend      Robert Donnelly, Auxiliary Bishop of Toledo and sister, Mary      Hendricks. Surviving are his brother-in-law, Patrick      Hendricks, nieces, Ann (Tim) Doran, Kay (William) Byrne;      nephews, Larry (Sharon) Hendricks, Jim (Julie) Hendricks,      Mike (Kaye) Hendricks and David (Betsi) Hendricks, 16 great      and 10 great great nieces and nephews.       The family would like to thank the staff at the Pro-Medica      Ebeid Hospice Residence for their care and comfort during Fr.      Marty's final journey.
