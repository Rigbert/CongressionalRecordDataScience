And what a joy it      still is to say those two words together. Minnesota's new      senator already is bringing even more distinction to the seat      that Hubert Humphrey held. She is another star who was      mentored by Fritz Mondale, and she is upholding that grand      DFL tradition.       When I was asked if I could be here with you, I was more      than glad to clear my calendar to do it. It is a special      honor and a great pleasure to be here with you in recognition      of the service, the historical significance, and the 80th      anniversary year of a friend, a former colleague, and an      American statesman.       In this room we know him as ``Fritz.'' Others call him      Walter. When he was a halfback in high school, they called      him ``Crazylegs Mondale'' for some reason. He has also gone      by Mr. Attorney General, Senator, Mr. Vice President, Mr.      Ambassador, and Dad. I think I like Crazylegs best. I can't      wait to ask him about how that happened.       The history of the era of his public service has not yet      taken full form for the ages, but even now Fritz Mondale      looms large as a model and as a catalyst, in his roles in the      Senate and as Vice President.       I have been asked to focus particularly on his time in the      Senate.       Walter Mondale is sometimes described as the paradigm      figure of the transition between two eras--the FDR Coalition      up to the War in Vietnam, and the social ferment that came      after the war. And perhaps this is so. But to me, who Fritz      Mondale is, and what he stands for, are just as important as      when he stood there. Deep echoes resonate throughout his      service of the first principles of our Republic. The issues      he led on then are as fresh as today's news, and as enduring      as our founding documents.       Issues like the concentration and abuse of power. Or social      and economic justice and the consolidation of wealth in the      pockets and portfolios of just a few. Or the role of      government in protecting the little guy when powerful market      forces run roughshod. Or the tension between freedom and      security. Or the challenge of achieving energy security. Or      the very roles of both the Senate and the Office of the Vice      President in the American system. Even the question of      whether a woman ever could credibly assume the highest      office in the land. Trace any of these issues back in      time, and you will find Fritz Mondale at earlier decision      points. For example, just imagine how loose from our      moorings we might be right now without the guideposts of      the FISA law, which resulted from the investigation that      he, Frank Church and others launched into earlier abuses      of the power of government to snoop into Americans' lives.       Here is something to which we all can attest. Fritz Mondale      is a good man whose decency elevated every institution in      which he served. Who he is has everything to do with what he      achieved.       Clarence once said that his brother's politics were, as he      put it, ``an extension of our father's preaching,'' and I can      see that. Their father, the farmer-turned-minister, felt and      saw the ravages of the Great Depression on the farms and the      communities of the heartland. And when Fritz entered      politics, he did it for the right reasons, to make life      better for the people.       In the Senate we mostly chalked Fritz's personality up to      clean air, clean living and Norwegian genes. He was and is      well liked on both sides of the aisle. Fritz's dad taught him      that your integrity is everything, and the lesson stuck. He      kept his word and everyone trusted him. He was always well      prepared. And he surrounded himself with good and competent      people. He had one of the best staffs on the Hill, and it's a      treat to see some of those staffers sprinkled around the room      today.       I've known Fritz a long while, but you still pick up some      new perspectives in preparing for an occasion like this. I      knew he was avid about hunting and fishing in the North      Woods, but I hadn't known his reputation for being such a      good ``bull cook.''       I looked it up. A bull cook is the fellow stuck with doing      the chores around camp, cutting fuel, cleaning up and      cooking. But when he rings the bell in the morning, everyone      has to get up. I think that after being in a place like the      Senate where no one is able to give orders that stick, Fritz      likes that sense of real power when he rings that bell.       One side of Fritz that the public did not see as readily as      we did in the Senate was his sense of humor--one of the best      I have ever known. In many a tense moment, his sense of humor      often defused the tension and restored the spirit of comity      that is so crucial in getting things done in the Senate.       I wish the American people had seen more of that side of      Fritz Mondale. Mike Berman told Fritz's biographer Finlay      Lewis that the staff was always urging Fritz to loosen up in      public. Mike said, ``I can't count the number of lit cigars I      have stuffed in my pocket over the years.''       He loved the Senate, and the Senate loved him back. He once      said that he ``found his sweet spot'' in the Senate. He was a      quick learner and craved learning new things. He said the      Senate ``was like mainlining human nature.'' And it's true.      You pick up any day's Congressional Record, and it's like      America's newspaper. Whatever is happening in     the country or the world on any given day is being talked      about and sometimes even acted on in the United States      Senate.       His first major legislative achievement was a 1966 law to      make automakers notify car owners of dangerous defects. He      went on to win another victory for consumers by stepping up      regulation of slaughterhouses that had been selling diseased      and putrid meat.       But he really came into his own in mastering the      legislative process with a key victory on his open housing      bill. Part of his success in winning a key cloture vote,      against great odds, was helped along by his earlier bonding      with a crusty earlier chairman of the Judiciary Committee,      James Eastland. I hasten to note that I haven't yet entered      into my crusty phase. Fritz knew the art of being able to      disagree without being disagreeable.       That was a heady and vibrant legislative era, and Fritz had      a hand in virtually every major piece of civil rights,      education and child care legislation that emerged from      Congress during that period.       To me, part of his Senate legacy that is the most      significant and timely--timely, even today--was his work on      and after the Senate's investigation--headed by Senator Frank      Church--into the abuses that led to the spying on the      American people by their own government. The FBI's COINTELPRO      operation, for instance, had spent more than two decades      searching in vain for communist influence in the NAACP, and      they had infiltrated domestic groups like organizations that      advocated for women's rights.       More than any other member of the special committee, Fritz      Mondale mastered the issues and dug into the research, which      spanned testimony from 800 witnesses and more than one      hundred thousand classified pages. The evidence added up, in      his words, to ``a road map to the destruction of American      democracy.'' Powerful government surveillance tools were      misused against the American people. There had been little      effective congressional oversight of these federal      investigative and intelligence agencies, and too little      judicial review.       Their work led to the creation of the Select Committee on      Intelligence, and later, to the Foreign Intelligence      Surveillance Act--the FISA law that only lately has entered      the public lexicon.       Then, as now, in the name of security, some were willing to      trade away the people's rights. Then, as now, some would have      the United States of America stoop to the level of our      enemies, giving them a victory over us that they could not      achieve on their own.       The parallels with today are clear and so are the lessons,      but Fritz freshened the bottom line for us in his address to      Senators not long after 9/11, as part of the Senate's leaders      lecture series. Even before Abu Ghraib, the disclosure of the      torture memos, the revelations about unlawful surveillance of      Americans, or White House political tampering with U.S.      Attorneys, this is what he said in September, 2002: ``There      is always the danger that our fears will overcome our faith      in the power of justice and accountability. Whenever we have      gone down that road, we have hurt the innocent and      embarrassed ourselves. Justice and accountability make us      better able to face our enemies. Justice strengthens us.''      Unquote, and amen.       Another of Fritz Mondale's most remarkable and lasting      achievements in the Senate was to engineer a change in the      Senate's rules, to curb the abuse of filibusters in thwarting      the will of clear majorities of the American people. The      difficulty in passing the civil rights laws of the 60s had      gradually convinced more and more Senators that the bar for      cutting off debate in the Senate was set too high.       That might not sound difficult, but changing the way the      Senate operates is something akin to trying to change the      weather.       As a freshman Senator, I had a front seat and a bit part in      Fritz's highly organized campaign to change the cloture rule.       He and Republican Senator James Pearson of Kansas launched      the effort to change cloture from two-thirds to three-fifths.      Fritz preceded and followed that launch by carefully laying      the groundwork, enlisting Senators one by one. When it      finally reached the Senate Floor, the debate itself was      protracted. Finlay Lewis set the scene well in describing      part of the debate. Quoting him, ``To an uninitiated or      casual visitor, the proceedings must have seemed arcane, even      bizarre. Here was the world's greatest deliberative body      solemnly voting to table the Lord's Prayer. At another point,      the Senate became polarized over a murky motion to table a      motion to reconsider a vote to table an appeal of a ruling      that a point of order was NOT in order against a motion to      table another point of order against a motion to bring to a      vote a motion to call up a resolution that would change the      rules. At least, that's what it sounded like.'' Unquote.       Late, late one night, at about this point in the debate,      Fritz and Majority Leader Mike Mansfield enlisted me, a young      whippersnapper, to play a role. They asked me to stay on the      floor one night around two in the morning to take the gavel      as the presiding officer. They expected that a lot of tight      rulings were coming up. But I felt the honor of the calling      drain away as Mansfield explained that they needed someone      big who was still awake to be in the chair for those rulings.      Sometimes a Senator is no more than a conscious body in the      right place at the right time.       The debate went on and on and on, and so did the      parliamentary and coalition-building by Fritz and by his      opponents. Relationships and Senate comity were being tested.      Before they reached the breaking point, Fritz rightly knew      when to strike a compromise, and he worked one out with      Russell Long.       He won the change in the cloture rule, and it is not an      exaggeration to point out that his efforts probably saved the      Senate as we know it, and he did it without changing the      Senate's fundamental character. As difficult as it still is      to get things done in the Senate, without the Mondale cloture      rule the Senate by now would be largely unmanageable.       It is saddening and frustrating today to see that even the      Mondale rule has been abused. Filibusters are used far more      often than they used to be. We had to have 72 cloture votes      last year, and with a razor thin majority like the current      Democratic majority in the Senate, that usually is an      insurmountable hurdle. As Fritz knows and as Fritz      practiced, the Senate's machinery is oiled by good will      and self restraint, and there is less and less of that      around.       Through his public service, Fritz Mondale invested himself      in the belief that our democracy offers civilizing power to      all of us together as a community, through our representative      government, to give each of us, and all of us, the      opportunity to thrive, to make justice real, and to make the      economy work for all and not just for some.       In a time when government is compiling more and more      information about every American, every American deserves to      know what their government is doing. Checks and balances and      the kind of oversight that Fritz Mondale believes in and      practiced makes government more accountable to the people. It      helps make our system work as the Framers intended.       This is the way he put it in that address in 2002: ``What a      paradise we would live in if trust were never abused. But our      Founders knew better. They built our system on this deep      insight into human nature. We are not perfect. We are, all of      us, mixtures of the good and base, lofty and lowly, selfless      and selfish. We are capable of sonatas, sonnets, and      cathedrals. But we are also capable of greed, paranoia, and a      dangerous thirst for power.'' Unquote. That insight of the      Framers, he concluded, accounts for our unique system of      checks and balances.       The Senate at its best can be the conscience of the nation.      I have seen that when it happens, and I marvel in the      fundamental soundness and wisdom of our system every time it      does. But we cannot afford to put any part of the mechanism      on automatic pilot. It takes constant work and vigilance to      keep our system working as it should for the betterment of      our society and its people. Keeping faith with these      fundamentals accounts for much of the legacy of Fritz      Mondale.       It is easy for politicians to appeal to our worst instincts      and to our selfishness. Political leaders serve best when      they appeal to the best in us, to lift our sights, summon our      will and raise us to a higher level.       This year we celebrate our good fortune of knowing and      benefiting from Fritz Mondale's ample service to the nation,      and there is much to celebrate. His is the generous and      optimistic spirit of the reformer, and of the patriot.       Thank you, Fritz. And Happy Birthday.                          ____________________
