Chairman, we are past the debate about balancing the budget. Fiscal responsibility has come to Washington, DC. But the question is whose priorities will we use in balancing the budget?  The Republican majority says that we should start out by, first, reducing taxes on the largest most profitable corporations in America, reducing taxes on the wealthy; that we should increase military spending, buy weapons that even the Pentagon does not want, like the B-2 bomber, at $1.5 billion per copy, a weapon that does not work, has no earthly purpose and the Pentagon does not even want.  Now, Mr. Chairman, if we start there then we have to do what they are doing. That means $10 billion out of student loans. The Republicans are going to cut $10 billion out of student loans. Members of that party got student loans like I did to get here. The Speaker of the House got student loans to get here.                              {time}  1900  Now we are going to pull up the ladder and say, ``Sorry, we do not have the money anymore.'' That is absurd. We have got to balance the budget with the right priorities.  Now, it is pathetic. We cannot even tax foreign corporations operating in America. American corporations operating overseas have to pay taxes, but no, the United States of America cannot levy a minimum tax against foreign corporations operating here. They take all their profits out and pay nothing in taxes to this country. That would raise $25 billion a year. That would offset the cuts in student loans and in the low-income housing tax credit program.  Mr. Chairman, we have heard a lot about running the government like a business. If we are running the government like a business, look at the subject before us at this moment, the natural resource policy of the United States of America. Mining royalties, no one else gives away their precious natural resources. No other country on earth, no other landowner, no government; just the United States Government at $2.50 an acre.  Mr. Chairman, we got $10,000 last year for a $20 billion gold mining claim, and we gave it away for $10,000 to a Canadian company that does not pay taxes in the United States. Is that running Government like a business? This bill would not fix that problem. This bill has a phony, sham mining royalty clause that would raise $14 million over 7 years. Hey, that is pretty stiff.  The Congressional Budget Office, and the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Kasich], a Republican, says that we could do $540 million without even drawing a breath, and we would still have plenty of mining activity in the western United States.  New loopholes for the poor and suffering oil and gas industry. You know, they have not been too profitable lately. Actually, they have been quite profitable, but they need new loopholes. Why? Because it is payoff time here. There was an election. There was an expensive election. There is going to be an election. That is going to be an expensive election. Do my colleagues know what? Those PACs, the banking PACs, the mining PACs, the oil and gas PACs, are dumping money into the new majority and they are getting their payoff right here today. The Republicans are talking about cutting welfare. Cut corporate welfare first.
