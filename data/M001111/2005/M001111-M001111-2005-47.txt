 President, to make our country strong again, we need to invest here at home, and that is why I oppose this budget. It is a bill that will cut $35 billion from America's priorities and burden our children with massive debt. Simply put, I think America can do better.  I will vote against this flawed budget, just as I did in the Budget Committee last week, because it starves our highest priorities. Not only that, this bill opens up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling, which will not solve our energy problems. And I have serious concerns about a House proposal--which could be added to the House version of this bill--to split the Ninth Circuit into two smaller circuits.  Mr. President, a budget is a statement of priorities. As I look at the challenges facing our country--and as I listen to people in my home State of Washington--it is clear that our top priority now must be making America strong again. To do that, we need to invest here at home.  Today, too many people don't feel secure.
