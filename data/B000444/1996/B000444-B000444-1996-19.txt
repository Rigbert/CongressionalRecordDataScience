 President, I submit a resolution designating October 18, 1996 as National Mammography Day.  Over the course of the past 3 years, I have submitted resolutions that designate a special day to encourage women to get mammograms as part of the early detection process in the fight against breast cancer. Historically this day has been designated as October 19, but because it falls on a Saturday this year, October 18 will be National Mammography Day.  In 1992 and 1993 a joint resolution was adopted by the Congress and signed into law by the President. And, last year, even though the House refused to take up commemoratives, this resolution was approved by the Senate. I feel that the Senate should again go on record to continue to educate and raise the consciousness about the importance of early detection and the value of mammography.  Mr. President, according to the American Cancer Society, national figures on breast cancer indicate that, in 1996 alone, 184,300 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer. Forty-four thousand three hundred women will succumb to this disease.  My home State of Delaware still ranks among the worst in breast cancer mortality among the 50 states, with an estimated 660 new breast cancer cases and over 160 breast cancer deaths for 1996.  Although a cure for breast cancer may be some time away, early detection and treatment are crucial to ensure survival. Studies have shown and experts agree, that mammography isone of the best methods to detect breast cancer in its early stages. Mammograms can reveal the presence of small cancers up to 2 years before regular clinical breast examinations or breast self-examinations [BSE], saving as many as a third more lives of those diagnosed with the disease.  With 50 percent of the breast cancer cases occurring in women over age 65, no women can be considered immune from the disease; in fact, at least 80 percent of the women who get breast cancer have no family history of the disease.  Mr. President, the resolution I am submitting today sets aside 1 day in the midst of National Breast Cancer Awareness Month to encourage women to receive or sign up for a mammogram, as well as to bring about greater awareness and understanding of one of the key components in fighting this disease.                          ____________________
