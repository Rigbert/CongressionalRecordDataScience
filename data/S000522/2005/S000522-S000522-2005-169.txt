Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, while H.R. 2601 funds the protection of foreign missions operations' account at the administration's request of $9.39 million, there are ongoing recurrent high expenses for the protection of foreign missions and officials, especially in New York, that make this amendment necessary. In addition, the Department of State agrees that the City of New York is owed $19.58 million in back payments for security work the city has done in relation to the United Nations.  This amendment authorizes the necessary funds to pay what we owe to New York for protection services already provided and covers projected costs in the next two fiscal years. The majority accepts and supports the amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
