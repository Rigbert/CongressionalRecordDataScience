Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I just want to remind people, this is an appropriations bill, and we can go through the process. I think the debate has been good. We have had some good presentations. It is just a matter of difference of opinion, and some day we will decide who is right, and when I become the correct one I hope you all recognize that.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
