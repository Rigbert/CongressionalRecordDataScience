Transportation control measures may be added to an      implementation plan subject to subparagraphs (B), (C), and      (D), on the same basis as if such measures were substitute      transportation control measures if such measures do not      increase emissions for which limitations have been      established in an implementation plan, and such measures meet      the requirements of clauses (ii), (iii), (iv), and (v) of      subparagraph (A).''.

Title V, after section 5102, insert the following:     SEC. 5103. FINDINGS.       The Congress finds the following:       (1) Research and development are critical to developing and      maintaining a transportation system that meets the goals of      safety, mobility, economic vitality, efficiency, equity, and      environmental protection.       (2) Federally sponsored surface transportation research and      development has produced many successes. The development of      rumble strips has increased safety; research on materials has      increased the lifespan of pavements, saving money and      reducing the disruption caused by construction; and      Geographic Information Systems have improved the management      and efficiency of transit fleets.       (3) Despite these important successes, the Federal surface      transportation research and development investment represents      less than one percent of overall government spending on      surface transportation.       (4) While Congress increased funding for overall      transportation programs by about 40 percent in the      Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, funding for      transportation research and development remained relatively      flat.       (5) The Federal investment in research and development      should be balanced between short-term applied and long-term      fundamental research and development. The investment should      also cover a wide range of research areas, including research      on materials and construction, research on operations,      research on transportation trends and human factors, and      research addressing the institutional barriers to deployment      of new technologies.       (6) Therefore, Congress finds that it is in the United      States interest to increase the Federal investment in      transportation research and development, and to conduct      research in critical research gaps, in order to ensure that      the transportation system meets the goals of safety,      mobility, economic vitality, efficiency, equity, and      environmental protection.       Title V, section 5201(b) of the bill in the matter proposed      to be inserted in section 502(a) of title 23, United States      Code, strike paragraphs (5) through (7) and insert the      following:       ``(5) Stakeholder input.--Federal surface transportation      research and development activities shall address the needs      of stakeholders. Stakeholders include States, metropolitan      planning organizations, local governments, the private      sector, researchers, research sponsors, and other affected      parties, including public interest groups.       ``(6) Competition and peer review.--Except as otherwise      provided in this Act, the Secretary shall award all grants,      contracts, and cooperative agreements for research and      development under this Act based on open competition and peer      review of proposals.       ``(7) Performance review and evaluation.--To the maximum      extent practicable, all surface transportation research and      development projects shall include a component of performance      measurement and evaluation. Performance measures shall be      established during the proposal stage of a research and      development project and shall, to the maximum extent      possible, be outcome-based. All evaluations shall be made      readily available to the public.''.
