Chairman, I might say to the gentleman, this is an important debate and relates to a rider, which has now been removed from the bill, on cement kilns. But the amendment that we are debating does not mention cement kilns. The amendment that we are debating says, ``The EPA shall have the authority to protect us against arsenic, benzene, dioxin, lead, and known carcinogens.''  Does the gentleman object to that premise?
