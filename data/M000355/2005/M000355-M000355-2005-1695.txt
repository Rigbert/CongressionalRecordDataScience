 President, the Senate will resume consideration of the bankruptcy bill. We made good progress on the bill today, disposing of two important amendments. There are three amendments currently pending to the bill. Under the previous order, we will have stacked rollcall votes early tomorrow morning in order to dispose of two of those amendments. Those votes are expected to begin shortly after 10:30 in the morning. We expect to be able to continue with additional amendments and votes throughout Wednesday's session of the Senate.                          ____________________[Page S1882]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                                PROGRAM  Mr. McCONNELL.
