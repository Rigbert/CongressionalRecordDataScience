 President, the Administration recently informed Congress of its arms sales package to Taiwan. Having long followed political developments both in Taiwan and the People's Republic of China, PRC, and having visited both sides of the Strait, I wanted to make a few brief comments.  First, weapon systems and military hardware aside, the political message transmitted to Taipei through the sales is that America's commitment to Taiwan remains steadfast and strong. This is an appropriate message delivered in a timely manner by the new Administration and with the encouragement and support of Congress.  Second, the package generally reflects a balanced approach to Taiwan's defensive needs, particularly on and under the sea. While the Arleigh Burke-class destroyers equipped with the Aegis radar system are not part of this year's sale, and would not be operational until 2010, the Administration has left open the option to pursue Aegis-equipped destroyers at a future date. Aegis is still on the table. America has bolstered Taiwan's defensive capabilities through Kidd-class destroyers, P-3 aircraft, submarines, and other weapons, and has deferred decisions on other sales, such as tanks and helicopters, pending a review of Taiwan's ground forces needs.  Finally, the PRC must understand that its continued buildup of short-range ballistic missiles opposite Taiwan and aggressive modernization of its military for offensive purposes will all but guarantee the future sale of Aegis-equipped destroyers, or other technologically advanced weapons system. If the Mainland is serious in wanting a peaceful resolution of differences with Taiwan, senior military and civilian leaders must accept America's obligations under the Taiwan Relations Act to provide ``defense articles and defense services in such quantity as may be necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-defense capability.''  Simply put, every Chinese offensive military action will have a Taiwan-U.S. defensive reaction. Beijing can make clear its intentions by immediately renouncing the option to use force against Taiwan, and by reducing its military deployments across the Strait.  I intend to continue to follow political and military developments not just in Taiwan and the PRC but throughout the region. I urge Beijing and Taipei to continue dialogue as the means of resolving their differences.                          ____________________
