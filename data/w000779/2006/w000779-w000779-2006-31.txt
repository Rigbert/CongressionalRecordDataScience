President, Mount Hood is a cherished wild place that is often photographed, visited and enjoyed by scores of Oregonians and many non-Oregonians as well. Today, I am introducing, along with my colleague Senator Smith, a new bipartisan Oregon Wilderness bill: the ``Lewis and Clark Mount Hood Wilderness Act of 2006.'' In tribute to the great river-dependent journey of Lewis and Clark, our legislation adds nine free-flowing stretches of rivers to the National Wild and Scenic River System. This reflects the Oregonian wish to protect but also actively experience our State's treasures.  This bill contains many elements of the bill I introduced two years ago while incorporating many of the provisions adopted in the House-passed version of Mount Hood Wilderness protections, HR 5025. My bill builds upon the House version by adding more wilderness, more wild and scenic rivers, and providing a recreation area to allow diverse recreational opportunities. It protects the lower elevation forests surrounding Mount Hood and the Columbia River Gorge as Lewis and Clark saw them. These forests embody the natural beauty of Oregon. They provide the clean water necessary for the survival of threatened steelhead, Coho and Chinook salmon. These forests provide critical habitat and diverse ecosystems for elk, deer, lynx and the majestic bald eagle. And these are the forests that provide unparalleled recreational opportunities for Oregonians and our visitors.  But the bill I introduce today differs from the bill I introduced two years ago because it responds to the many comments I heard in the ensuing years. I received thousands of comments on proposed Mount Hood legislation. Some comments came as a result of the general public meetings I held in Oregon. Many of the meetings lasted over 3 hours, and everyone who wanted to speak was given an opportunity to do so. Other comments came from the second Mount Hood Summit held at Timberline Lodge hosted by Representatives Walden and Blumenauer. I and my staff met with over 100 community groups and local governments, the members of the Oregon congressional delegation, the Governor, and the Bush administration. And still more comments came from letters and phone calls from Oregonians.  Overwhelmingly, these comments urged me to protect and build on Oregon's Wilderness system. This goal is as important today as it was in 1804, 1964 or 1984--if not more so. To succeed, we must provide the tools that help us create a planned future on Mount Hood. This bill does both.  The Mount Hood National Forest is the seventh most visited National Forest in the United States. In the 22 years that have elapsed since any new wilderness has been designated in the Mount Hood area, the population in local counties has increased significantly--25 percent in Multnomah County, 24 percent in Hood River County, and 28 percent in Clackamas County.  The predominant public use of this urban forest is non-mechanized activity like hiking, camping, and fishing. With increasing emphasis on wild scenery, unspoiled wildlife habitats, free flowing rivers, wilderness and the need for opportunities for diverse outdoor recreation sometimes it seems we are in jeopardy of ``loving our wild places to death.''  A few years ago, the Forest Service made a proposal to limit the number of people that could hike the south side of Mount Hood and the public outcry was enormous. Seems to me, rather than tell people that they are going to be restricted from using our public lands, part of the solution for the future of the Mountain lies in providing more opportunities for them to enjoy the Mountain's great places. We should ensure the Mount Hood National Forest can meet the increased use and demand for outdoor experiences--my bill will provide those opportunities.  Of the hundreds of people who attended the meetings I held throughout the State of Oregon, the vast majority spoke in favor of more wilderness. Additionally, I have received more than 2,500 written comments supporting additional wilderness for Mount Hood.  This is what I have heard: More Wilderness: First and foremost, I heard that Oregonians in astonishing numbers support protecting Mount Hood and the Columbia River Gorge with additional wilderness. A large number of Oregonians didn't think that enough wilderness areas had been included in the House proposal.  Mountain Biking: Some mountain bikers expressed concerns that their recreation opportunities not be unfairly curtailed.  Fire Protection and Forest Health: Some people were worried about forest health and those living in towns on the mountain and in the gorge were concerned about fire protection for their communities.  Developed Recreation: Some people were worried about maintaining a role for developed recreation, like skiing, on Mt. Hood.  This is what my bill does to address those concerns: More Wilderness: There are currently 189,200 acres of designated wilderness on the Mount Hood National Forest. The House legislationwould have added approximately 77,200 acres of new wilderness on the Mountain. The bill I am introducing today increases wilderness on Mount Hood by designating approximately 128,385 new acres of wilderness--incorporating all the areas the House bill included and building upon them.  This bill adds the areas surrounding the oldest Mt. Hood Wilderness--the mountain itself--which was designated in the original Wilderness Act of 1964. These additions include cathedral old growth forests, the historic Tilly Jane trail, lava beds that were created during the Mt. Hood eruptions, and much of the legendary route that Oregon's pioneers used when they were settling our great state. To the north and west of the mountain, I would add the viewshed of the Columbia Gorge to the current Mark O. Hatfield wilderness. These areas encompass the spectacular ridges framing the Gorge that we all marvel at from I-84 and include perhaps the greatest concentration of waterfalls in North America. To the southwest of the mountain I add lands to the current Salmon Huckleberry Wilderness to conserve their diverse wildlife and protect unique recreational areas like those around popular Mirror Lake. These lands include Alder Creek, the source of drinking water for the City of Sandy, which unanimously endorsed the draft proposal. Over to the east are proposed additions to the Badger Creek Wilderness. These areas provide a critical link between Westside forests and Eastside ecosystems. This area is known for beautiful fall color and the best deer and elk hunting in the entire Mount Hood National Forest. Among the areas we are protecting is the newly designated Richard L. Kohnstamm Memorial Area. It is dedicated in honor of Mr. Kohnstamm who restored the historic Timberline Lodge--built originally by the Works Progress Administration in 1937--to its former grandeur.  Wild and Scenic Rivers: My proposal seeks to protect over 81 miles of wild and scenic rivers on nine free flowing rivers. This includes some of the most pristine and beautiful rivers in Oregon. Among those proposed rivers are the picturesque waterfalls and glacial outwash of the East Fork of the Hood River, and the ancestral hunting and fishing grounds of Fish Creek. Over 17 miles of superb salmon and steelhead habitat on the Collowash River have also been proposed for protection. My bill again incorporates all the House proposed protections and builds upon them.  Mountain Biking: I believe that local riders raised some valid concerns, so I did two things. I have proposed Mount Hood National Recreation Area. It will offer greater, permanent environmental protections to those beautiful areas, while providing mountain bikers, and other recreational users, an opportunity to continue to recreate in these areas. Additionally, I made boundary adjustments to ensure all open mountain biking trails were not included in my proposed wilderness.  Fire Protection and Forest Health: I protect wilderness, where there are healthy, older trees that should never be harvested on Mount Hood or in the Gorge. Older, healthy stands are the most resistant to fire and disease. However, there is an enormous backlog of over-crowded, plantation, second-growth that should be thinned. My bill incorporates House provisions that would give the Forest Service a mandate to prepare an assessment for promoting forests resilient to fire, insects and disease. This also includes provisions to study and encourage the development of biomass in conjunction with forest health work. In addition, I added fire safe community zones so that the Secretary will construct a system of fire safe buffer zones around the communities of Cascade Locks and Government Camp.  Developed Recreation: In order to facilitate developed recreation opportunities I have adopted the House provisions establishing a ``fee-retention'' provision that will establish an account for the Mount Hood National Forest. In addition, in order to help address growth while ensuring access to recreational opportunities, I have adopted House provisions directing the Secretary and the State of Oregon to develop an integrated transportation plan for the Mount Hood region.  Local and Tribal Relationships: I have also incorporated the House provisions on local and tribal relationships emphasizing the rich history of the Mount Hood region and affirming the rights of Native peoples to access the mountains resources, as they have for generations.  The protection of these important Oregon places will depend on the hard work and dedication of all Oregonians and particularly that of my Oregon colleagues here in the Congress. I am especially pleased that Senator Smith has joined me in developing this bipartisan legislation and putting forth our proposal for wilderness. I am hopeful everyone will pull together: county Commissioners, environmentalists, entrepreneurs, chambers of commerce, state elected officials, the Governor, and the Oregon delegation here in the Capitol. I look forward to perfecting legislation together in the coming weeks, and seeing its swift adoption by Congress thereafter. Then the grandeur of Mount Hood and other Oregon treasures can be assured for future generations.  Soda Mountain Wilderness: In addition, I wish to offer my cosponsorship of legislation to be presented by Senator Smith, creating the Soda Mountain Wilderness and authorizing the voluntary cancellation of grazing leases in the Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument. This bill would establish a 23,000-acre Soda Mountain Wilderness in the backcountry of the Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument. In addition, it provides for the negotiated voluntary grazing permit lease buyout in the Monument. This proposed wilderness area lies at the intersection of the Siskiyou and Cascade mountain ranges, and the Oregon Desert, California chaparral, High Cascade and coastal Westside forests. It is truly where east meets west meets north meets south. This makes it a truly unique and biodiverse ecosystem and a key wildlife corridor--one that is used by ten rare, threatened or endangered species, including the northern spotted owl, Ashland thistle, and the Siskiyou fritillary. It is also home to populations of trout, elk, bobcats, black bears and falcons. The grazing buyout in this bill also provides a win-win situation. It provides a good deal for the ranchers--the negotiated agreement between the Bureau of Land Management grazing lessees and the conservationists includes an agreed-upon conservationist premium to be paid to the lessees. This premium enhances the compensation lessees receive from the federal government as part of the legislation. It also ensures this special place will be protected. I commend Senator Smith for introducing this legislation and am happy to join him in introducing this bill.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3854       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

Congress finds that--       (1) long before the arrival of Lewis and Clark, Native      Americans in the Oregon country lived amid the wild splendor      of the Cascade Mountains and the Columbia River, where the      waters teemed with fish, game roamed the forests, and fruits      and berries were abundant;       (2) the Native Americans arrived in this bountiful land      from Asia by way of the Bering Sea and inhabited the land in      and around Mount Hood and the Columbia Gorge;       (3) some of the tribes along the Columbia River were part      of the Chinook family;       (4) many of the people of the tribes--       (A) used canoes made from cedar logs;       (B) were expert fisherman;       (C) told fire legends about the mid-Columbia volcanic peaks      that featured warrior heroes, fair ladies, and numerous gods;      and       (D) Mount Hood as Wy'East, the warrior whose passionate      love caused the region to be transformed as he hurled      powerful volcanic fire in his quest for the love of the      gentle maiden Loo-wit, known today as Mount St. Helens;       (5) traveling down the Columbia River in 1805, the Lewis      and Clark Corps of Discovery expedition was awed by the      unspoiled scenic splendors of the Cascade Mountains and the      Columbia River Gorge cutting through the mountain rampart;       (6) on October 18, 1805, Clark recorded in his journal: ``I      ascended a high cliff, about 200 feet above the water, from      the top of which is a level plain, extending up the river and      off for a great extent. From this place I discovered a      mountain of immense height, covered with snow.'';       (7) following Lewis and Clark, settlers came to the Oregon      territory by way of the Oregon Trail, transforming more      accessible portions of the wild landscape into farms,      orchards, and small communities using the old growth forests;       (8) in 1845, Oregon Trail pioneers Samuel K. Barlow and      Joel Palmer and their parties opened the Barlow Trail across      Barlow Pass, high on the south slopes of Mount Hood, with      Palmer writing on October 11, 1845: ``I had never seen a      sight so nobly grand.'';       (9) even as the settlers transformed the wilderness, that      frontier land helped develop in the settlers the      characteristics of self-reliance, fortitude, hard work,      independence, and love of the land, which the people of      Oregon and the entire United States cherish to this day and      wish to inculcate in their children;       (10) the unprotected wilderness that remains in the Mount      Hood and Columbia River Gorge region provides easily      accessible outdoor recreation for the descendants of the      early settlers and more recent arrivals;       (11) Mount Hood is home to the historic Timberline Lodge,      which--       (A) is a National Historic Landmark;       (B) was built as a project by the Federal Works Progress      Administration in 1937; and       (C) was restored to its former grandeur by the dedication      and stewardship of Richard L. Kohnstamm;       (12) preserving wilderness assures the integrity of the      background and scenic views that enrich more developed forms      of recreational use, including downhill skiing and roadside      enjoyment of sweeping wilderness scenery;       (13) designation as wilderness provides the strongest      congressional protection of scientific, cultural,      educational, environmental, scenic, and recreational values      that contribute long-term quality of life and economic      benefits to the people of Oregon, visitors to Oregon, and      local communities in and around the Mount Hood National      Forest, including the wilderness-dependent wildlife, high      water quality, and resident and anadromous fish that thrive      in undisturbed ecosystems;       (14) the Mount Hood National Forest is the seventh most      visited National Forest in the United States;       (15) wilderness management is interrelated with and will      interface with the established activities and management of      adjacent land, particularly when the land is high-density      recreation land;       (16) Mount Hood National Forest is predominantly used by      the public for mechanized and non-mechanized activities, such      as hiking, camping, and fishing, which according to the Mount      Hood National Forest Management Plan, are projected to      increase dramatically over time;       (17) the Land and Resource Management Plan for Mount Hood      National Forest provides that ``the present capability to      supply recreational opportunities such as hiking on trails in      primitive and semi-primitive non-motorized areas is predicted      to fall short of satisfying demand'';       (18) according to the plan described in paragraph (17), the      Mount Hood National Forest--       (A) provides resources for nearly 2 times the current      demand for developed recreation such as skiing, power      boating, and sightseeing by car; but       (B) meets less than \2/3\ of the demand for back country      recreation;       (19) the Management Plan for Mount Hood National Forest      projects that by 2040, the Mount Hood National Forest will      only meet 16 percent of the demand for wilderness recreation,      while meeting more than 100 percent of the demand for      mechanized recreation;       (20) because the Mount Hood National Forest provides      drinking water for more than 16 communities and over 40      percent of Oregon residents, management of the Mount Hood      National Forest needs to take into consideration plans      developed by local watershed councils in managing the forest;      and       (21) the management of the Mount Hood National Forest      should address practical, site-specific situations in a      manner that supports wilderness and the general      environmental, economic, and community-related welfare of the      mountain.     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.       In this Act:       (1) Indian tribe.--The term ``Indian tribe'' has the      meaning given the term in section 4 of the Indian Self-     Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450b).
