After taking office, the Obama administration put a hold on the rule and is currently writing a new rule.  The administration's approach under the new rule has been anything but collaborative and inclusive, and many States feel they have been shut out of the process. When Chairman Rogers required advanced analysis on job impacts, his request was ignored.  The American people expect more openness and transparency from their government, and that is why this funding prohibition must remain in the base bill.  I strongly urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' and reject this amendment.  Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva).  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it.
