Speaker, as the Twenty-first century dawns, fire remains a serious threat to life and property, especially for the U.S. Capitol, House and Senate office buildings, the Library of Congress, and their occupants and visitors. Today, with the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Weldon), co-chair of the Congressional Fire Caucus, and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Andrews), I am introducing a bill intended to enhance fire protection of the United States Capitol complex and the safety of the thousands who work in or visit the complex every day.  No one can deny that the Architect of the Capitol, the official responsible for operation and maintenance of the complex, has taken steps to improve fire safety on Capitol Hill. However, recent reports warn that much work remains in order to make these buildings safe. A December 1998 report by the House Inspector General found the condition of House's fire-protection systems, such as alarms and sprinklers, to be ``deficient.'' A follow-up report just issued by the Inspector General warns that the AOC continues to take a ``haphazard approach'' to fire protection throughout the House complex.  A January 2000 complex-wide inspection by the Office of Compliance identified numerous violations of occupational safety and health standards made applicable to the Congress by the 1995 Congressional Accountability Act. The Compliance Office subsequently issued eight citations requiring corrective actions, including two requiring prompt implementation of a program of inspection, testing and maintenance for key fire-protection systems and equipment.  This Congress must take every reasonable step to make fire protection of the Capitol complex and its occupants a top priority. To assist the Architect in fulfilling his responsibilities in this area, and to enhance the status of fire-safety and protection efforts, out bill will create within the Architect's office the position of Director of fire Safety and Protection. Reporting directly to the Architect, The Director will coordinate and take charge of fire-protection activities and work to bring the Capitol complex into compliance with the applicable codes and standards established by the prestigious National Fire Protection Association. The work of the NFPA acknowledges the difficulties associated with protecting historic buildings like the Capitol from fire, and our bill provides the Architect the flexibility he needs to preserve the Capitol's historic character. The measure requires the Architect to report regularly to key House and Senate committees on his fire-safety and protection efforts.  Mr. Speaker, there are doubtless several reasons progress on fire protection of the Capitol complex has not been more rapid, but the simple reason is that the subject has not received sufficient attention. By creating a high-level official within the Architect's office to carry out all fire-safety duties, this bill will correct that problem, expedite progress, and make clear that Congress is serious about protecting the complex and its occupants from fire. I urge my colleagues to support this important measure.                          ____________________
