He was a great American and a brilliant federal judge.  Over the years, I had the honor of meeting Judge Keith a few times. He was always gracious and thoughtful.  Appointed by Presidents Johnson and Carter, Judge Keith worked for more than half a century to help our nation realize the dream of a more perfect union.  He spent every single day committed to helping our country respect the dignity, worth, and equality of every human being--whether it was their right to vote, education, housing, employment, or privacy.  Madam Speaker, today, my thoughts are with his family, friends, and community, who were kind enough to share this amazing man with a grateful nation.                          ____________________
