President, for clarity, I ask unanimous consent to bring to the floor the Dream and Promise Act for a vote in the Senate--a measure which would address the very issue that is before the Supreme Court today. I am making this on behalf of Senator Schumer, Senator Leahy, Senator Rosen, Senator Tim Kaine, Senator Menendez, and Senator Cardin.  As if in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 112, H.R. 6; further, that the bill be considered read a third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon table, with no intervening action or debate.
