 President, what can I say about Strom Thurmond?  I remember, back in 1981, the Senate Judiciary Committee had a new chairman--and a new ranking member, and there were more than a few folks looking forward to the fireworks.  There was a new conservative Republican administration and new Republican majority in the Senate. The Judiciary Committee seemed destined to be one of the main ideological battlegrounds over issues that divided us then and still divide us today.  There were more than a few Washington insiders who thought that Strom Thurmond the seasoned veteran conservative Republican chairman who first made his mark on the national political scene as an advocate of State's rights--and Joe Biden a northeastern Democrat still in his thirties whose interest in politics was sparked, in large measure, by the civil rights movement would never find an inch of common ground--not an inch.  But I knew that was not going to be the case. I had served with Strom for eight years by then . . .  I knew his personal strengths, and admired them greatly, regardless of our political differences, and I knew those strengths would guide us to consensus rather than gridlock.  I knew, with Strom, there would be comity--not enmity.  And I knew debate would be civil and constructive rather than divisive and filled with meaningless partisan rhetoric.  Strom, as usual, didn't let me down. In his six years as chairman--and for several years after that when we switched roles--he exceeded my expectations in every way.  There were many heated debates and contentious hearings, but we weathered them and we weathered the kinds of controversies which I've seen poison the well for other committees for years afterward.  But that kind of cooperation would not have happened if it weren't for Strom Thurmond's strength of character.  It would not have happened if he were not, first and foremost, a gentleman--unfailingly courteous, respectful, and always dignified.  Strom's word is his bond, and each of us, even the most partisan political opponents knows that, in the heat of debate, under extraordinary pressure, when the stakes are exceedingly high, Strom Thurmond will always, always keep his word.  There's an old Greek proverb that says: ``The old age of an eagle is better than the youth of a sparrow.''  Well, Strom Thurmond is an eagle among us.  He's been my neighbor in the Russell Building for many years now. Actually, he has most of the offices around me so I'd say he is more like the landlord.  He has more seniority in this chamber than any United States Senator has ever had, and more seniority than most Americans will ever dream of having. But longevity is not the measure of a man like Strom Thurmond.  Longevity is a very small part of why we come to this floor to pay tribute to him today--a tribute he richly deserves--not only for a long life, but for a grand life, an accomplished life.  I joke about it sometimes. About the time, for example, someone came up to him and challenged his strength and his tenacity and--right there--Strom took off his coat and started doing push ups.  He has lived long and he has lived well. He has served his country well. And, more than any other public figure, he has been a constant force in this nation for the better part of a century. Never stopping. Never giving up. Always fighting for his beliefs. Unequivocally. Unashamedly.  Whether it was his independent run for President 54 years ago, or serving the people of South Carolina as Superintendent for Education of Edgefield County, as a City and County Attorney, a state senator, a circuit court judge, Governor, or United States Senator--he has been truly, sincerely, honorably, one of America's most engaged, committed, and enduring public servants.  He was born back in 1902. It was not until a year later, that the Wright brothers flew the first powered flight. He was 6 when Henry Ford introduced the Model T.  He received his degree from Clemson one year after the Yankees signed Babe Ruth.  When Strom joined the army, Calvin Coolidge was elected President.  The Golden Gate Bridge was completed the year Strom was elected to the state senate.  Judging from that time-line, you might conclude that American legends tend to lead somewhat parallel lives.  There is no doubt that Strom Thurmond is an American legend.  He served only one term as a State senator, but in that one term most people don't realize he became an education Senator, raising teachers' pay and extending the school year.  Not to mention the fact that he sponsored South Carolina's first Rural Electrification Act.  Legend has it that when the U.S. declared war against Germany--Strom was a circuit court judge at the time--he literally took off his robes and volunteered for active duty that day.  He went on to earn five battle stars, eighteen decorations, medals, and awards--the Legion of Merit with Oak Leaf Cluster, a Purple Heart, a Bronze Star, the Belgian Order of the Crown and the French Croix de Guerre.  Then, in 1947, he was elected Governor of South Carolina. He added 60,000 new private sector jobs. Paved 4100 miles of farm-to-market roads, raised teachers' pay again, started a trade and technical education system and lowered property taxes. Not a bad record. But Strom was not done.  He was elected to this Chamber in 1954. I have been here for 30 years. I consider that to be quite a long time but Strom arrived 18 years earlier. But Strom came the hard way. He was a write-in candidate.  I believe he has the distinction of being the first person to be elected to a national office that way.  It wasn't long before he became an expert on the military and an advocate for a strong national defense. He's been on the Armed Services Committee since the Eisenhower Administration--1959.  He was a Democrat back then. We could use you again now, Senator.  But seriously, Strom held to his convictions about a strong military and, in 1964, said the Republican Party more closely represented his views, so he switched and, when he did, changed the future of South Carolina politics.  Strom and I may disagree on most issues, but, the fact is, it was Strom Thurmond who, one way or another, helped shape the debate on many of those issues for the better part of the last century.  A long life is the gift of a benevolent God, but a long life with a powerful and lasting impact is the treasure of a grateful Nation.  He has had that kind of impact, and we are grateful.  His achievements, his list of awards, the many schools and buildings named--for him too many to enumerate here--are only a small tribute to a man who has done in a hundred years more than most of us could accomplish in a thousand. And, the truth is, most of us wouldn't have the energy to even try.  The real beneficiaries of Strom Thurmond's legacy are the citizens of South Carolina.  Not since the days of John C. Calhoun has South Carolina enjoyed such memorable representation as it does today with Senator Thurmond and Senator Hollings.  From his own reflections and experiences, Calhoun wrote the famous Disquisition on Government. Some political scientists have said that essay is a key to modern American politics, a handbook for defending against the tyranny of the majority, and for building pragmatic coalitions.  In that work, Calhoun wanted to maintain the Constitutional rights of States, and the delicate relationship between federal and state powers.  Strom Thurmond wears the mantle of that heritage.  Some years back, Senator Thurmond was quoted as saying, ``The Constitution means today exactly what it meant in 1787 or it means nothing at all.''  Armed with that conviction all of his life, he's been an able advocate of State's rights--the balance of power between branches of Government--individual rights against Government prerogatives and usurpations--private enterprise--decentralized Government--and strict Constitutional interpretation.  He has not only been a successful politician who helped shape the last century, but a political philosopher with whom I do not always agree, but for whom I have the deepest respect.  Let me tell you one of my most memorable stories about Strom.  It was when we went down to the White House to try to convince President Reagan to sign a crime bill.  President Reagan was in the beginning of his second term. We sat in that Cabinet room. We were on one side of the table and William French Smith, Ed Meese, and someone else, I can't recall whom, were on the other side.  The President walked in and sat down between Strom and me. We told him why we thought he should sign the bill, why it was important for him to sign it.  At first, the President looked like he was thinking about it, and then, to the shock of everyone on the other side of the table, he began to look like he was being convinced--that he actually might sign it.--This is absolutely a true story.  Ed Meese stood up at that point. He looked at us and then he looked at the President and said. ``Mr. President, it's time to go.''  The President hesitated. He looked over at Strom and nodded as if he wanted to hear more. But Ed Meese said again, ``Mr. President, it's time to go.''  At that point, the President made a motion to get up, and Strom reached over and put his hand firmly on the President's arm. He grabbed it and pulled him back down and said, ``Mr. President, the one thing you got to know about Washington is that when you get as old as I am, you want to get things done, you have to compromise.''  There was Ronald Reagan, not that much younger than Strom, and there was Strom, smiling, making the President laugh. And there was Ed Meese not looking very happy as Strom talked the President into his position.  That's a remarkable ability, and it works for Strom because people always know where his heart is. They know what his objective is.  People know that he believes what he says and says what he believes and it's real and it is honest.  One more personal story that I will never forget. It was during a contentious hearing on a Supreme Court Justice and a difficult time in my career. Strom and I disagreed on the nominee.And I was being blasted in the press back in 1988.  I called a meeting of the entire committee and said that if the accusations relevant to me were getting in the way of the work of the committee, I would resign as Chairman.  But before I could get the last word out of my mouth, Strom stood up. ``That's ridiculous,'' he said. ``You stay as chairman. We all have confidence in you.''  I said, ``Don't you want me to explain?''  And Strom said, ``There's no need to explain. I know you.''  I will never forget what he said that day. ``There's no need to explain. We know you.''  I have told this story before, but to this day, I can't think of many other people who would, having a significant political advantage, not only not take it, but stand by me. That's the Strom Thurmond I know and will always admire.  I have been honored to work with him, privileged to serve with him, and proud to call him my friend. As I said earlier: A long life may well be the gift of a benevolent God, but a long life with an impact as powerful and lasting as his is the treasure of a grateful Nation.  Strom Thurmond is, without doubt, an American treasure.  The truth of the matter is that his longevity lies in his strength of character, his absolute honesty and integrity, his sense of fairness, his civility and dignity as a gentleman, and his commitment to public service.  None of these things are skills you learn. They are qualities that burn deep within leaders like Strom Thurmond. And people who know him well can sense them.  The measure of Strom Thurmond is not how long he has lived or how long he has served, but the good he has done, the record of success he has achieved, and the standard of leadership he has set.  The truth is that Strom's ongoing legacy is not about time, it is about extraordinary leadership and dedicated service to the people of South Carolina and the nation.  And for that we say, ``Thank you, Strom, and a hundred more.''                          ____________________
