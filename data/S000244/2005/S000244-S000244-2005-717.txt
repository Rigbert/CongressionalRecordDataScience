Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendments.  Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from Virginia's opposition to both mandatory minimum penalties and the death penalty is well-known and respected. I believe in this case he is wrong.  First of all, we do need to have a swift and effective death penalty in the case of violent offenders who murder children. There have been several scientifically balanced, statistical studies that consistently show that the death penalty is a deterrent; and I think that if it is just a little bit of a deterrent when we are dealing with our kids, that is enough to say that the amendment should be defeated.  Secondly, we have talked quite a bit about mandatory minimum penalties in the context of the previous amendment that was offered by the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Inglis). Let me say that if all mandatory minimum penalties contained in this bill for sexual abuse and exploitation of children are eliminated, it does allow judges to send out into society on probation people who have been convicted of sex offenses for or against children. When I think of anybody who does something like that, we should tell society and those who might be thinking of committing such a crime that if you do the crime, you are sure to do some time.  I kind of listened with interest and with respect to the argument of the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Inglis) on mandatory minimums in the previously debated amendment. He says that if judges do not comply with sentencing guidelines, then maybe what Congress should do is impeach them.  Impeachment is a severe penalty, and if you look at the 17 impeachments that the House of Representatives has voted on in its history, the only time where there has been an impeachment voted is when a Federal civilian official ends up conducting himself or herself in a manner that obstructs the functioning of government, whether it is the branch that that official serves in or the other two equal and separate branches.  Simply saying that if a judge makes a discretionary call to give a child sex offender probation even when the crime is terrible is an impeachable offense I do not think comports with the history of impeachment, because it is within the discretion of the court.  I am saying that, in this case, the discretion of the court should be eliminated and those who are convicted should go to jail, and that is why the mandatory minimums ought to stay in this bill.  Mr. Chairman, I urge the defeat of this amendment en bloc.  The Acting CHAIRMAN (Mr. Sweeney). The question is on the amendments offered by the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott).  The amendments were rejected.                 Amendment No. 13 Offered by Mr. Flake
