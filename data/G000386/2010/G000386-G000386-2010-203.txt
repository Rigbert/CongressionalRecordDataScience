 According to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, extension of several of these provisions go back even further, including the Tax Relief Extension Act of 1999, which again passed the Senate by unanimous consent but lost one vote on the conference report.  Blinded and dazed by the power of their now not-so-super majority, certain Democrats have in the last few weeks turned against the extenders. One Democrat said:       Our side isn't sure that the Republicans are real      interested in developing good policy and to move forward      together. Instead, they are more inclined to play rope-a-dope      again. My own view is, let's test them.  Another member of this large 59-vote majority exclaimed:       It looks more like a tax bill than a jobs bill to me. What      the Democratic Caucus is going to put on the floor is      something that's more focused on job creation than on tax      breaks.  The only explanation for this behavior is that certain Senators have decided that it serves a deeply partisan goal to slander what have been for several years bipartisan and popular tax provisions benefitting many different people.  Today's Washington Post article I quoted from earlier includes a statement from a Senate Democratic leadership aide saying:       No decisions have been made, but anyone expecting us      immediately to go back to a bill that includes tax extenders      will be sorely disappointed.  Having put their heads into the sand, this chamber's Democratic leaders seem intent on keeping them there. I appeal to all of you to vote against the Democratic Leadership's effort today to jam the Senate. A vote for the Senate Democratic Leadership's cloture motion is a vote to foreclose an opportunity to improve the bill. It also is a vote to forbid any corrections to mistakes in the bill. And there is a significant mistake in the Senate Democratic Leadership's bill. The bill as currently written would allow employers of illegal workers to benefit from the payroll tax holiday. We should correct that mistake with an amendment.  The Senate Democratic Leadership's posture prohibits this correction.  Either the Democratic leaders are playing partisan politics with tax extenders, or they don't understand the worth of the provisions to the economy, including job retention and creation. The biodiesel industry alone says 23,000 jobs are at risk due to the biodiesel tax credit being allowed to expire. Those workers are not fat cats.  And in case anyone thinks biodiesel is something only Iowans worry about, these green jobs are in 44 of the 50 states. There are 24 facilities in Texas. There are 15 facilities in Iowa. There are 6 facilities in Illinois and 6 in Missouri. There are 4 facilities in Washington. Ohio has 11 facilities. There are 5 facilities in Indiana. There are 3 facilities each in Mississippi and South Carolina. There are 7 facilities in Pennsylvania and 4 in Arkansas. New Jersey has 2 facilities.  There is one facility in North Dakota. Only 6 of the 50 States do not have some biodiesel production. They are Alaska, Delaware, Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Wyoming. The other 44 States have some biodiesel presence. I have an article from the Erie, PA, newspaper, describing the struggles of a local biodiesel plant.  So we need to turn away from talk of fat cats. We need to get back to work on the bipartisan package that was in the works until the Senate Democratic Leadership's dramatic change in direction. Many people who are not fat cats or a part of large corporations are counting on these provisions being extended, and they are counting on their elected representatives to work together, as we were doing, to get the job done.  I ask unanimous consent the article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:     Erie-Based Biodiesel Company Presses for Return of Tax Credit              Hero BX suffers without biodiesel incentive                            (By Jim Martin)       A major financial incentive to purchase biodiesel fuel      disappeared Jan. 1, and companies such as Erie-based Hero BX      are feeling the pain.       Hero, which can make up to 45 million gallons a year and      ranks as Pennsylvania's largest biodiesel company, ran full      steam for most of 2009.       But now, the loss of a $1-a-gallon tax credit for buyers      who blend biodiesel with petroleum-based fuels has softened      demand dramatically, said Mike Noble, Hero BX president.       The plant has operated only about 10 days since that credit      expired at the end of 2009, he said.       ``We are running today and tomorrow. Then we will be done      for a few days,'' he said Friday. ``It comes and goes, but      there is not a lot of demand.''       He's hoping the problem is temporary. So far this year,      however, efforts to reintroduce the tax credit, which makes      blodiesel prices more competitive, have fallen flat.       An extension of the credit was included in a draft of an      $85 billion Senate jobs bill.       However, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Democrat from      Nevada, announced he would trim the tax credit, along with      other provisions, to a more modest $15 billion.       Now, Reid and other Democrats in the Senate are under      pressure to restore the tax credit, not only from Republican      senators, but from Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, who has      called the credit, ``an important credit and support      mechanism'' for renewable fuels.       There seems to be general agreement in Washington that the      credit will eventually be extended. The question that remains      is, ``When?''       The timing matters a great deal to Hero BX, where Noble      said biofuel production supports 40 jobs directly and another      40 or so office jobs indirectly.       So far, none of those employees have been laid off, despite      a dramatically reduced production schedule.       ``Once we get them trained, it's a very technical job. I      really don't want to lay them off,'' Noble said, citing the      time and expense of training new employees.       Noble said Hero BX has received support from U.S. Sens.      Arlen Specter and Bob Casey, both Pennsylvania Democrats.       ``Senator Casey thinks we must quickly restore the      biodiesel tax credit to preserve jobs in Erie and promote      energy independence,'' Stephanie Zarecky, his press      secretary, said in a statement. ``Senate leadership has      announced their intention to bring an extension to the floor.      Senator Casey hopes that it will come to the floor soon and      receive bipartisan support.''       Kate Kelly, press secretary for Specter, said her boss has      been a champion for the industry as a co-sponsor of the      Biodiesel Tax Incentive Reform and Extension Act of 2009,      which would have extended the tax credit through 2014.       She said in a statement that ``Senator Specter's office has      been working closely with stakeholders on the matter and is      looking for an appropriate legislative vehicle through which      to reinstate the tax credit so that companies like Hero BX      can get back on their feet.''       Both Hero BX and Erie-based American Biodiesel Energy Inc.      can look forward to May 1, when a new state mandate takes      effect that will require a 2 percent blend of biodiesel in      all diesel sold for over-the-road use in Pennsylvania.       Noble said that mandate will be good for business but hopes      he doesn't have to wait that long to see some relief.       ``The longer it takes, the further we go in debt and the      harder it will be to get out of the hole,'' he said.
