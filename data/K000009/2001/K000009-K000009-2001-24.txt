Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, obviously I rise in very strong support of this bill and say it is truly an improvement over the original measure that passed the House 4 months ago. The conference committee actually did make it better. And while there are individual items with which we could each disagree, and those items will continue to be a focus for myself and other subcommittee members as we move ahead with other appropriations bills during this session, the product before us truly is worthy of our support.  Let me reciprocate to my very able colleague and fairly new chairman of our committee, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Bonilla) for successfully guiding us through the challenges surrounding his first bill as our subcommittee chair. And I think that the buoyant attitude of the members and the cooperative spirit in which they worked is due to the tone that he set on the subcommittee.  Mr. Speaker, I want to issue my own thanks to our subcommittee staff that worked so very hard, such long hours, and they are never covered by C-SPAN, and the American people do not get to see the depth of their dedication: Hank Moore and Martin Delgado, Maureen Holohan, Joanne Orndorff, Jim Richards, and our detailee, Leslie Barrack, as well as Roger Szemraj from our own office and Julie Little as well. They just did an outstanding job of representing the interests of this House in this conference.  I wanted to pay special thanks to Martha Foley, who is our lone minority staff member, who ably and successfully represented our side of the aisle in painstaking negotiations with the other body. I am just so pleased she is able to be with us here on the floor today. I hope that all of her relatives and friends are watching because she surely deserves the appreciation of the American people.  Mr. Speaker, we bring to you a conference report that is $860 million below the enacted level for the last fiscal year, but it is $1.8 billion over the administration's request and $1.4 billion over the original bill that passed the House.  Now, should anyone have concerns about these points of comparison, let me respectfully point out that our needs today are far different from those that were submitted with the President's budget earlier this year, and they are substantially different from those that our Nation faced prior to September 11.  As I pointed out earlier this year, we are touched in our country by agriculture many times each day. It might be in the food we eat, the fabrics we wear, the biofuels that are being produced or the medications or vitamins that are prescribed. We are touched each day by research, by education, by training, by our food and animal, plant and health inspection services and by marketing services.  This bill continues the essential points that nearly 80 percent of the spending in this bill is mandatory. When one combines all the food assistance programs and the farm price support programs, only about 20 percent of what we can really affect in the bill is discretionary. Over half is what is projected to be spent in this measure is for food programs. That includes Food Stamps, the Women, Infant and Children Food Program and the Child and Elderly Nutrition Programs.  Now, there are significant accomplishments in this conference bill. We have provided an increase of $211 million for the WIC program over the initial House bill. With recent economic difficulties and increasing unemployment, we have added funds that are available in the program, should we need them. In fact, we have established a $2 billion reserve for the Food Stamp Program to reflect these concerns, the largest reserve we have ever had in this program.  I might just mention, if you look at New York City and many of the service workers that worked in the World Trade Center who are contract workers and have no benefits, those families absolutely have the right to be fed, to have a good holiday season; and this program will help cushion the blows that this economy and the situation we are facing with regard to terrorism is having on American families.                              {time}  1745  So we provided the largest reserve we ever have in the history of this program.  We have provided $10 million in supplemental funding for the Senior Farmers Market Nutrition program, an effort that has been more successful than anyone had anticipated and one which we hope will be continued as a part of the regular farm bill.  Both these funds are to support the program in addition to the other resources from the Commodity Credit Corporation that we hope the Secretary will use to sustain and hopefully expand this program to the full $25 million level.  Let me also mention we have the strongest possible language included in the statement of managers to be certain the Secretary of Agriculture understands that we expect her to continue the Global Food for Education program. This program can help boys and girls throughout the world get the necessary food while receiving education; and when we think about what is going on in Afghanistan and the surrounding region, it is particularly vital that we see the impact that this program can have in the months and years ahead.  We have so many Members here in the House to thank, Members like the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Hall), and certainly our retired Members from the other body, Bob Dole and George McGovern, for inspiring and carrying us through on the vision for this program and what it can do around the world.  The House did go along in this measure also with the higher Senate level for title II of the Food for Peace Program, PL-480, as the House had instructed before we went to conference. I respectfully and seriously thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Bonilla) and the staff for their efforts in securing this important funding.  We do have some successes with increasing food safety funding, particularly with respect to the Food and Drug Administration. The bill provides 10.7 percent over last year's level, and we know how important that agency is now in safeguarding our food supply and the safety of our pharmaceuticals.  It also includes the additional funds to fully fund the pay increases so essential to keeping staff in place and adding staff where necessary so that we can deal with threats to public health and ensuring public health and safety here at home.  We also included an increase of $15 million over last year for BSE prevention and enforcement. This is commonly known as mad cow disease. We have seen what it has done in other parts of the world, and we know that increasing monitoring of imports and inspection of feed mills here at home is essential to keeping that tragedy out of the American food chain.  We have included additional funds for food safety activities, including our import inspections and monitoring activities; and we have also important successes in this bill on funding for animal welfare, for rural development, for water and housing programs and research programs at our 1890 Institutions.  I know that the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Mrs. Clayton), who has worked so hard in order to increase funding, will speak on this matter very shortly; and we thank her so very much for her leadership and dedication on this important improvement to what our country offers, not just here at home but around the world.  Let me just say as I wrap up here, I am concerned about inadequate funding levels for food safety activities, particularly in the wake of what happened on September 11; and I am really encouraged that Secretary Thompson has recommended over $61 million in supplemental funds for the purpose of strengthening FDA's food safety and security activities. This truly is a step in the right direction, but only a step; and we look forward to working with the Bush administration on improving those numbers.  We also had research funding requests from hundreds and hundreds of members that had to be reduced due to limits imposed in this bill. Hopefully in future years, we will be able to find a way to meet these important researchactivities which are the seed bed for innovation and advancement in our Nation.  Let me also say that the gentleman from New York (Mr. Hinchey) was such a leader on this matter in our subcommittee, and this deals with the assistance to specialty-crop producers, particularly apple producers, that in the conference bill we have provided $75 million to assist those who have been so adversely affected by weather and drought conditions. In our original bill we had hoped to get $150 million. We just did not have the funds. We just did not have the allocation to do that; and I wanted to again recognize the gentleman from New York (Mr. Hinchey), the gentleman from New York (Mr. Walsh), and the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Nethercutt), who have my personal commitment to work with them to make sure producers get the help they need.  On two final points, let me just say the conferees were successful in retaining language to retain the pork check-off program. We expect the Department to honor the votes of producers to terminate that program or to put any settlement agreement to a new vote.  Finally, and this is truly emotional for all Americans, we were so pleased to be able to work with the able gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Meehan) to include language naming our very well-respected Farmer to Farmer program as the John Ogonowski Farmer to Farmer Program. John Ogonowski was the pilot of American Airlines Flight 11 which crashed into one of the World Trade Towers and citizen of Massachusetts.  He had exemplified the intent of the Farmer to Farmer program in reaching out among others to Cambodian producers, new immigrants to our shores, who had the need of improved skills to maximize their farming proficiencies, and naming this program for him offers the program an example of an outstanding American who knew both the responsibilities and joy of helping others to improve their situation while taking satisfaction from the accomplishment that such help provides.  Today, in the Sun newspaper from Massachusetts, there was a story that talks about American Airlines pilot John Ogonowski, and it talks about the former Under Secretary of Agriculture August Schumacher, who was a friend of John Ogonowski, and talked about how he was a fourth generation farm boy who never forgot his roots and he made real differences with his new entry programs for farmers in our country. John Ogonowski's father, Alexander Ogonowski, also a farmer, was overwhelmed when he learned of this great honor for his son and American patriot; and he said it is a little too much right now to even comment on.  As we move this bill to the floor today, we especially honor pilot John Ogonowski, and all those who fly on behalf of our commercial airlines and all those in service to our country in every walk of life. We owe them the freedom of expression that we enjoy here in this Chamber today.  I include for the Record the article from the Sun newspaper.      Bill Aims To Rename U.S. Farm Program For Late Dracut Pilot                          (By Kathleen Deely)       DRACUT--A federal program in which U.S. farmers help their      counterparts overseas will be named after deceased Dracut      resident John Ogonowski if a bill before Congress is      approved.       Ogonowski, who died piloting American Airlines Flight 11      when it was hijacked and crashed into the World Trade Center      on Sept. 11, had for years harvested hay and produce on his      150-acre farm on Marsh Hill Road.       Renaming the Department of Agriculture's Farmer-to-Farmer      program after Ogonowski has been included in the federal      Agriculture Appropriation bill for 2002. The House and Senate      are expected to pass the legislation, which will then go to      President Bush for his signature, in the next few weeks.       John's sister, Carol Ogonowski, said naming the program      after her brother is ``one of many tributes that John      deserves.''       ``John would be honored. It's only a fitting tribute to his      life that touched so many others,'' she said.       The program is similar to the New Entry Sustainable Farming      Project that Ogonowski ran for Cambodian farmers on his      Whitegate Farm for several years. The partnership between      Tufts University, the University of Massachusetts Extension      Service and the state Department of Food and Agriculture      helps immigrants grow their native vegetables and learn the      farming industry.       Likewise, the program provides agricultural technical      assistance to developing countries around the world and      increases food production there.       The idea to name the program after Ogonowski came from      August Schumacher Jr., the former undersecretary for farming      and international agricultural programs, who was a friend of      Ogonowski.       U.S. Rep. Martin Meehan, a Lowell Democrat, worked to have      the name changed included in the 2002 agriculture bill.       ``John was a fourth-generation farm boy who never forgot      his roots,'' said Meehan. ``He made a real difference with      his New Entry programs.''       Attaching Ogonowski, who was a full-time pilot, to the      project makes sense, those who knew him said, because farming      was his true passion.       John's father, Alexander Ogonowski, also a farmer, was      overwhelmed when he learned of the honor.       ``It's a little too much right now.'' he said.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), a member of the subcommittee without whose excellent work this bill would not have been possible.  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur) for yielding me the time, and I rise in strong support of this conference report.  It addresses the many and often competing priorities of agriculture, health and nutrition; and I want to say thanks to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Bonilla), the chairman; and the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), the ranking member, for their leadership, and the subcommittee and associate staff for their hard work.  Connecticut is a leader in New England's agriculture, in eggs, peaches, milk production per cow. Like other farmers, Connecticut farmers are facing the toughest times since the Great Depression: plunging commodity prices, urban sprawl which puts it in the top 10 States in lost farm land. This spring, record low temperatures eliminated almost 40 percent of our peach and pear crops.  I am proud of the funding for programs that reach out and help our farmers: rural development, conservation, pest management, and commodity marketing assistance. I am also proud of the extension of dairy price supports through May 31, 2002. This program is an essential safety net for Connecticut's dairy farmers, all the more so since reauthorization of the Northeast Dairy Compact has not happened yet.  The compact is vital to the very existence of Connecticut's 228 dairy farms, each one a small family farm, and their way of life. In 2000, it returned $4.8 million in income back to these dairy farms. This is an average of $21,000 per farmer. Congress must address this issue. Without the compact, New England's farms are lost.  The conference report also funds coverage for more than 7.5 million WIC participants. I cannot emphasize enough how important WIC is in addressing the economic problems that this country faces. As unemployment increases, so does the number of families eligible for WIC. This essential nutrition, which currently serves approximately 47 percent of all infants born in the United States, provides low-income mothers and their children with nutritious supplemental food packages, nutrition education and counseling and a gateway to pre- and post-natal health care.  WIC does more than help families get through tough times. It contributes to better birth outcomes and reductions in childhood anemia.  This bill also funds safety efforts, but we do need to do more to protect American families from potential bioterrorist threats. Each year, 5,000 Americans die from food-borne illnesses; 76 million get ill, and 325,000 are hospitalized.  FDA inspects all types of food except meat, poultry and eggs. Yet, to cover the 37,000 companies that make this food, the FDA has only 400 inspectors. For the 4.1 million imported food items, the FDA has less than 120 inspectors. These inspectors can barely cover 1 percent of the food coming into the country. In today's times, this is a crisis waiting to happen unless we do something.  I also want to work through the supplemental funding process to provide assistance to America's apple farmers. There are apple farmers in the State of Connecticut and the plunging market prices for apples are destroying the years of hard work put in by these dedicated men and women. We must be there for them.  Once again, I am proud of the work of the conference committee. I am proud to serve on the agriculture appropriations subcommittee. My thanks to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Bonilla) and to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur) for their leadership throughout the year in support of America's farmers and America's families.
