Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Mr. Daniel Brown. For the past three decades he has been a proponent of higher education in northwest Ohio, serving our community as President of Owens Community College.  Mr. Brown has been affiliated with Owens since its inception in 1965, serving in various capacities that culminated in his serving the past seventeen years as President. Always a proponent of the student, he has been the watchdog on tuition increases. He proved his commitment to higher education by lowering tuition five percent for the 2000-01 academic year. Through his hard work and dedication, Owens and its Findlay campus have excelled into the fastest growing two-or-four-year college in Ohio.  His dedication to students doesn't stop there. Owens has articulation agreements with almost twenty four-year colleges and universities, including Bowling Green State University, Ohio State University, University of Michigan and University of Toledo, allowing a smooth transfer for graduates pursuing bachelor's degrees. The school offers more than 100 technical programs and majors in various fields, such as health, business, industrial and engineering technologies and agriculture, in order to prepare students for careers of the future.  With a focus on state-of-the-art facilities, President Brown has expanded the college with such complexes as the Fire Science/Law Enforcement Center and Industrial and Engineering Technologies Building. A new library, audio/visual classroom center, math/science center and student health and activities center have increased the Galleria Complex, a new addition to the old campus. A Fine and Performing Arts Center will round out the construction for this site.  Even though growth, both at the physical campus and enrollment, has been exponential during the tenure of Mr. Brown, Owens remains committed to offering small classes, personal attention and flexible class schedules so that each person interested in a higher education will be afforded the opportunity to quality instruction.  The efforts of Daniel Brown will be evident for years to come. He has touched the lives of countless individuals and will be remembered with reverence and veneration.                          ____________________
