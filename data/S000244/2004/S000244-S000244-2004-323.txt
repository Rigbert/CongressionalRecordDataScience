Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, today we debate whether we should amend the Constitution of the United States to allow House Members to be appointed in the wake of mass vacancies caused by a terrorist attack.  After September 11, 2001, no one would deny the real potential of such a catastrophe striking this body, but fundamentally today's debate is about whether to preserve lawmaking by a House of Representatives elected by the people or to deny the right of elected representation during the most crucial moments of American history and allow lawmaking by an appointed aristocracy.                              {time}  1545  I would urge the membership to soundly defeat this constitutional amendment to preserve the People's House as an elected House and not as an appointed House.  Let us be clear, any constitutional amendment denying the right to elected representation would accomplish what no terrorist could, namely striking a fatal blow to what has always been the People's House. The House, unlike the Presidency and the Senate, are unique among all branches and bodies of the entire Federal Government. It is the only branch institutionally designed to always reflect the popular will through the legislation it passes.  When terrorists attacked on September 11, 2001, it was an elected not an appointed Congress that acted in its wake; and the legislation passed by that elected Congress has a legitimacy that legislation passed by an appointed Congress would not have had. All of Congress' powers under Article I of the Constitution are only legitimately exercised by an elected House.  H.R. 2844, the Continuity in Representation Act, which passed the House on April 22 by an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 306 to 97, with more Democrats voting for it than against it, will ensure that the House is repopulated by legitimate democratic means within a maximum of 45 days after an attack causes mass vacancies. Within those 45 days, any constitutional amendment that allowed lawmaking by appointed members would pose far more risks than benefits; and legislation passed by an appointed House that did not comport with the people's will would have to be repealed by a later elected House, leading to further discontinuity at the very time when continuity is most important.  The Founders explicitly rejected the proposition that the appointment of Members is compatible with the American Republic. James Madison wrotethat ``it is particularly essential that the House should have an immediate dependence on, and an intimate sympathy with, the people'' and that ``elections are unquestionably the only policy by which this dependence and sympathy can be effectively secured.'' As Madison stated in his speech to the Constitutional Convention, ``a gradual abridgement of the right to elected representation has been the mode in which aristocracies have been built on the ruins of popular forms.''  This amendment is an abridgement of the right to elected representation. Contrary to the claim made by proponents of constitutional amendments, the President would not be unconstrained in its conduct immediately following a catastrophic terrorist attack. Of course, the President would be well within his constitutional authority to execute the laws in times of crisis.  However, the Founders also made it clear that the President would always be subject to impeachment by the House of Representatives, either a House operating on reduced membership or a later fully reconstituted House if the President abused executive authority at any time. And of course no law can be enacted solely by a House operating with a few Members alone. Further, the issue of incapacitated House members can be handled by changes to House rules. The Committee on Rules is already exploring those options.  Demonstrating this is not a partisan issue but one concerning the legitimacy of all Members of the House and of the legislation it passes, the House of Representatives, controlled both by Democrats and Republicans, throughout history has rejected all constitutional amendments authorizing appointed House Members sent to it by the Senate, even during the height of the Cold War. It is important to remember that the American people have always been able to elect their leaders, even during our Nation's darkest hour, the Civil War, when General Lee's Army was just a few miles away from this building.  Today we consider House Joint Resolution 83 sponsored by the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Baird). This proposed constitutional amendment contains all the flaws of amendments allowing the appointment of nonelected members, but it also has some unique additional problems.  The Baird amendment would not only override H.R. 2844, which already has passed the House by an overwhelming bipartisan vote, but it would forever strip the Congress of its discretionary authority to expedite special elections in emergency under its existing constitutional powers.  Let me repeat this. The amendment before us takes away the right of Congress under Article I, section 4, that expedites special elections in emergencies.  The amendment also requires House Members, prior to taking the oath of office, to submit a list of names to the governor that the governor can draw from in appointing that Member's replacement. This would subject candidates for Congress forever after to endless questions during their campaigns regarding whom they placed on the list and their connection to the candidate, and perhaps questions that can become embarrassing, creating needless distractions in what is supposed to be a clear contest between individual candidates.  And if a candidate did not tell the press who was on his or her list, the voters would not have a say on who the candidate's potential replacement should be. Such a list would also invite great mischief, including the placing of names on the list of those owed political favors.  Finally, H.J. Res. 83 provides that ``Congress may by law establish the criteria for determining whether a Member of the House of Representatives or Senate is dead or incapacitated.'' This provision would deny the House its existing authority under the Constitution that allows each House to adopt its own rules, an authority the Committee on Rules is already exercising, to address incapacitation by the rules, and needlessly involve the Senate in how the House operates. By doing so, it would unfortunately make addressing continuity of government more difficult than it already is.  Mr. Speaker, I doubt that any Member has faced a vote before that so clearly defines the principles stood for. Either you will vote to tear the fabric of our Constitution and deny the right of self-government under the laws passed by the people's chosen representatives, or you will vote to preserve the sacred right to elected representation.  That sacred right has endured since America's birth, through two World Wars, a Civil War, and now a shadow war waged by vicious haters of democracy. The terrorists would like nothing more than to see us rewrite our Constitution, the supreme law that comes closest to being our Nation's soul, to reflect their twisted vision of autocratic rule.  Around the world, both our friends and our enemies are watching. Vote this amendment down and show them what this House stands for and what it stands against.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
