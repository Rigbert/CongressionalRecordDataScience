President, the chairman of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, Senator McConnell, and I have agreed to an amendment he is offering to rescind $25 million in funds appropriated in Public Law 104-107, the fiscal year 1996 Foreign Operations bill, for the Export-Import Bank. Those funds would then be eligible for transfer to the Commerce, Justice, State Subcommittee for programs under the jurisdiction of the Attorney General.  Senator McConnell and I have also agreed that if the $50 million emergency supplemental appropriation for anti-terrorism assistance for Israel that is contained in this omnibus appropriations bill is offset with Defense Department funds or military construction funds, the $25 million transfer to the Commerce, Justice, State Subcommittee may occur. However, if any of the Israel supplemental is offset with Foreign Operations funds, the transfer will not occur. This ensures that if the Israel supplemental is paid for with Foreign Operations funds, the Export-Import Bank money would remain in the Foreign Operations budget and would reduce the impact of that offset on Public Law 104-107.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Senator from Vermont, Senator Leahy, has accurately stated our understanding.
