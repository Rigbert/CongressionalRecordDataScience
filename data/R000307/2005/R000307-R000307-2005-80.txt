President, I rise today to recognize and pay tribute to Major General Thomas J. Romig, The Judge Advocate General of the Army, for his many years of exceptionally meritorious service to our country. General Romig will retire from the Army on September 30, 2005, having completed a distinguished 34-year career. We owe him a debt of gratitude for his many contributions to his Nation and the legal profession, particularly during operations in support of the Global War on Terrorism.  As The Judge Advocate General since October 1, 2001, General Romig served as the legal advisor to the Chief of Staff of the Army and the Army Staff, as well as the military legal advisor to the Secretary of the Army and the Assistant Secretaries. As such, he has been at the forefront of the most pressing issues affecting our Nation and the military today.  General Romig's inventive and steady leadership is reflected every day in the superb legal services provided by each and every judge advocate, civilian attorney, legal administrator, paralegal, and legal specialist of The Judge Advocate General's Corps. His professional legal advice has demonstrated his abiding concern for the Army's mission and his sincere interest in the welfare of soldiers and their families. The Army and The Judge Advocate General's Corps have benefited immeasurably from his leadership.  General Romig was born in 1948 at Manhattan, KS. He graduated from Manhattan High School in 1966 and attended Kansas State University where he received a Bachelor of Science degree in 1970. He was commissioned through the ROTC program and entered active duty in October 1971. After graduating from the Infantry Officer Basic and Airborne Courses, he served almost 6 years as a Military Intelligence Officer at Fort Bragg, NC, and Fort Huachuca, AZ.  In 1977, General Romig was selected for the Funded Legal Education Program and attended the University of Santa Clara School of Law, Santa Clara, CA, where he graduated with honors in 1980. During his 25 years of distinguished service as a judge advocate, General Romig served in many positions of great responsibility, including service as a prosecutor withthe 2d Armored Division; an instructor at The Judge Advocate General's School; the Staff Judge Advocate of the 32d Army Air Defense Command; the Chief of the Personnel, Plans, and Training Office; the Staff Judge Advocate of V Corps; the Assistant Judge Advocate General for Civil Law and Litigation; and the Assistant Judge Advocate General for Military Law and Operations.  He reached the top of his profession when he was appointed the 36th Judge Advocate General of the Army. General Romig is now completing his remarkable military career.  I know all my colleagues join me in saluting Major General Thomas J. Romig and his wife Pamela for their many years of truly outstanding service to The Judge Advocate General's Corps, the U.S. Army, and our country.                          ____________________
