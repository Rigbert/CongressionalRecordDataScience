This is pretty much the same debate we just had. The difference is that this particular amendment just eliminates the Afghanistan Infrastructure Fund altogether, and the other amendment didn't do that.  This account, this Afghanistan Infrastructure Fund, was created by Congress in the fiscal 11 authorization bill and again in the fiscal 12 authorization bill--which we just passed a few weeks ago--at the request of General Petraeus, who made this one of the most important parts of his counterinsurgency strategy. Now, if you don't believe that General Petraeus knows what he's talking about, then maybe you should vote for this amendment; but those of us who have watched General Petraeus skillfully function as the leader in Iraq and there again at Central Command and there again in Afghanistan, we believe that this is not a good amendment and that it should be defeated, the same as the other amendment that we just defeated, so I rise in opposition to this amendment.  I yield back the balance of my time.
