 President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous consent that the injunction of secrecy be removed from the following treaties transmitted to the Senate on January 17, 2017, by the President of the United States: Extradition Treaty with the Republic of Serbia, Treaty Document No. 115-1; Extradition Treaty with the Government of the Republic of Kosovo, Treaty Document No. 115-2. I further ask that the treaties be considered as having been read the first time; that they be referred, with accompanying papers, to the Committee on Foreign Relations and ordered to be printed; and that the President's messages be printed in the Record.
