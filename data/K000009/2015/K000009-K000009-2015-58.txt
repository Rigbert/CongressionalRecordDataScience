And over the weekend, I was very privileged to be a part of the 125th anniversary celebration of United Allied Trades, Local 50 Plumbers, Pipefitters, and Allied Trades in northern Ohio--125 years of building America forward.  Over 1,500 people came into this mammoth hall, and we remembered those who had come before us and had been a part of building, of plumbing, of pipefitting, of building America forward--in our refineries, in our nuclear power plants, in the natural gas lines that are laid. The power of America was before us in the hands and minds of those who have the skills to build for us.  The training academy they have built at local 50 is probably the finest in the country, at least one of the finest. And I am just so proud of the younger men and women who are coming up in the trades. They have a decent wage. They can earn enough to join the middle class. They have retirement plans. They have health plans, including the one they built from scratch, serving thousands and thousands and thousands of people.  Congratulations at 125 years to United Allied Trades Plumbers and Pipefitters Local 50 in Ohio. God bless you. You have blessed America.                          ____________________
