Chairman, I would use the time remaining to emphasize that this is a bipartisan proposal between the gentleman from Oklahoma [Mr. Istook] and myself.  What we were trying to do was to ensure that States and locales have the resources to provide for the people that they represent; to provide for a fair playing field for entrepreneurs in this country.  I would emphasize we are not imposing a new tax. We are not taking anything away from Indians in the United States of America. What we are simply asking for is appropriate negotiations as far as State compacts.  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this endeavor.
