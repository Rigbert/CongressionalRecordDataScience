Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 10 seconds before I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Gekas].  I am amazed that the previous speaker would talk about the environment when in reality she has the tankers going right by her front door--of Alaskan crude oil that can possibly spill--and that is what this report says, so I cannot quite figure out the analogies of why are supposed to be environmentally safe to paint those big ships by their front door and yet say they are going to protect their coast. I just cannot figure that.  Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Gekas].
