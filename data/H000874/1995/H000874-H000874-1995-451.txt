Chairman, my amendment states that the arms embargo against Bosnia and Herzegovina shall be lifted upon receiving a request from the Bosnian Government to do so.  I suggest there is no more important issue that confronts this country and the international community at this moment in time, in this moment in history, than does this issue.  Last year, with bipartisan support the House voted overwhelmingly to lift the U.N. embargo, an action designed to uphold Bosnia and Herzegovina's inherent and recognizable right of self-defense, as provided under article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations.  Following the House vote on June 9 last year, Bosnia accepted the contact groups, that is, Britain, France, Germany, Russia, and ourselves, plan after the group assured Bosnia that if the Serbs refused the plan, international sanctions against Serbia would be tightened, more efforts would be made to afford greater protection of safe areas by the United Nations, and ultimately the arms embargo would be lifted.  Mr. Chairman, I was at a meeting with the Bosnian President, President Izetbegovic, and Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic, and others, in Sarajevo, when it was announced Bosnia would accept the plan unconditionally. That acceptance, Mr. Chairman, was met by Serbia's ultimate rejection.  And what did the international community do? First, sanctions against Serbia were eased and safe areas were left abandoned to the wanton aggression of the Bosnian Serbs and, of course, Bosnia continues to fall victim to the arms embargo.  Well, Mr. Chairman, here we are 1 year later. And what has time brought the Bosnians? Nothing other than more deaths.
