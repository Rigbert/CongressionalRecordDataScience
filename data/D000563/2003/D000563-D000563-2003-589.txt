I recall when President Clinton was preparing to take office, that same Chairman Greenspan came to Little Rock in the transition and said: The most important thing you can do for the long-term economy is to reduce the long-term interest rates which means get serious about the deficit. President Clinton took that to heart. I think the Senator, was in the Senate, and I was in the House when President Clinton came in with his budget, which didn't get a single Republican vote in the House or the Senate. It passed in the Senate with the tie-breaking vote by Vice President Gore and then, because the Democrats stood up and did what was right for the economy, we saw this dramatic period of economic growth where people's savings were growing, retirement plans were growing, where we created some 22 million new jobs, inflation was under control, new housing starts, new businesses. And we are not talking about the deep dark recesses of American history. This was just a few years ago.  Now in 2\1/2\ years, it is amazing what this President has achieved. He has managed to lose jobs at a faster pace than any President in history and create the largest deficit in the history of the United States, all in the name of fiscal conservatism. It is really hard to imagine anyone can say with a straight face that is a conservative, disciplined approach to dealing with the budget.  I am sure in Nevada and Illinois the people don't like this economic policy and what it has meant.
