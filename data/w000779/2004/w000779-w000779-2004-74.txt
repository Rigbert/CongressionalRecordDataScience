In addition to the bipartisan support in the Senate, there has been very significant bipartisan support in the business community. There are an awful lot of business leaders who have been looking for these kinds of ideas that the Senator from Minnesota has really touched on. This is a question of updating our law. I don't think anybody got up in the morning years ago and said: Let's be rotten to service workers. That was not what happened at all. I think people just did not really see what a critical role service and high technology were going to play in the economy. The business organizations that the Senator from Minnesota has mentioned do. They get it. They understand it is absolutely critical to not leave something like four-fifths of the workers behind.  I join with the Senator from Minnesota and commend him and thank him for his support.
