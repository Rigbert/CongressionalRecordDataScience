Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.  Mr. Chairman, this amendment puts the fox back to guarding the chicken coop, at least during the phase-out period in this legislation, and it is another attempt to buy time. The way it does it is to eliminate the competitive procedures that are in section 4 of the bill, which is the transitional mandatory source authority.  Now, what section 4 of the bill does, what the amendment of the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott) tries to eliminate is to phase out FPI's dependence upon the narcotic of mandatory source procurement. And it eliminates the requirements that, during the phase-out of mandatory source for all products still being provided under this authority, that FPI provides a product that meets the agency's specific needs in a timely manner and at a fair price.  So the adoption of the Scott amendment would mean that FPI decides what the agencies need, not the agencies themselves; and the FPI decides when the agencies need the goods, not the agencies themselves; and FPI decides that the price is fair, not the agencies themselves. And there is not any competition at all when FPI makes all of these decisions. This basically is another stall that rolls back the changes in the bill and leaves the decision on whether to grant a waiver and allow competitive sourcing to the FPI rather than the buying agency.  It is time we get the fox away from this chicken coop because the taxpayers are going to end up much further ahead and the agencies are going to get better goods in a more timely manner without the amendment and with the bill as written.  Mr. Chairman, I urge that the amendment be voted down.
