  Profits are reported as follows: Boeing: $393 million; General Electric: $6.6 billion; General Dynamics $247 million; Lockheed Martin: $682 million; Northrop Grumman: $252 million, and United Technologies: $750 million.  They are doing OK, and that's good.  In my mind, executive pay should be tied directly to company performance and to profits.  If the company had a great year, earned big profits and enjoyed other successes, then the chief executive should enjoy the fruits of his labor.  A big year should equal a big pay check.  A bad year might mean a pay cut.  The profit figures cited above are for calendar year 1995.  During that period, only McDonnell Douglas suffered a loss.  The company took a loss of $416 million. But guess what?  That loss did not keep the company's top executive from drawing a bigger paycheck.  The top boss' base pay went from $1.6 million in 1994 to $1.9 million in 1995, including a bonus of $1,042,400.  But that is not all.  McDonnell Douglas' chief executive, Mr. Harry C. Stonecipher, received a very generous share of company stock.  Mr. Stonecipher got cash and stock valued at a staggering $34 million--in 1995 alone.  The other top executives at McDonnell Douglas also received handsome bonuses. These generous pay packages came at a time when the company was downsizing in the face of declining sales.  Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a report on Mr. Stonecipher's pay package from the Journal of Commerce.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Journal of Commerce, Mar. 24, 1995]     McDonnell Chief's Compensation Takes On Superstar Proportions       St. Louis.--The compensation package McDonnell Douglas      Corp. assembled to attract Harry C. Stonecipher, chief      executive, last year was worthy of basketball's Michael      Jordan.       McDonnell's nearly seven-year deal with Mr. Stonecipher,      the first non-family member to run the company, could bring      him more than $34 million in cash and stock.       ``We paid the market rate for a person of his caliber,''      said James Reed, vice president for communications. ``We're      very convinced of that, and the board of directors is very      convinced of that.''       The Chicago Bulls also paid the market rate when they      signed Jordan, the National Basketball Association's top      player, to an eight-year, $28 million deal in April of 1988.       Although the $825,000 base salary and $575,000 annual bonus      target McDonnell set for Mr. Stonecipher are unremarkable for      a Fortune 500 company, the stock incentives McDonnell offered      are notable.       The aerospace giant used the promise of what is now $17.7      million in stock profits to persuade Mr. Stonecipher to leave      his job as chairman and chief executive of Sundstrand Corp.       McDonnell awarded Mr. Stonecipher 180,000 shares of      restricted stock, with a current market value of $10.1      million. The first 42,000 of those shares vest next Friday;      the rest vest in 1996, 1997 and 2002.       McDonnell also gave Mr. Stonecipher the option to buy      450,000 shares later in the decade for $36.96 each, the      market price when he joined the company on Sept. 24.
