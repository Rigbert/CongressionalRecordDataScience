Speaker, Americans have demanded a more efficient government that eliminates outdated and unnecessary bureaucracy; a government that takes a hard look at the market before deciding to regulate it--in short, a government that works. The FCC Consolidated Reporting Act accomplishes those goals, all at no cost to the taxpayer.  Today, the FCC is required to write eight separate reports on discrete components of the communications marketplace. Eight separate reports multiplies the number of hours the FCC spends writing reports, multiplies the number of employees working on such reports, and multiplies the number of times industry has to respond to information requests from the Commission.  The FCC Consolidated Reporting Act takes a smarter approach. It consolidates these eight reports into a single, comprehensive report on the state of the communications marketplace, and eliminates twelve other reports from the Communications Act.  I want to thank Communications and Technology Subcommittee Chairman Greg Walden and Representative Steve Scalise for working on this important legislation. I support it, and I urge my colleagues to support it as well.
