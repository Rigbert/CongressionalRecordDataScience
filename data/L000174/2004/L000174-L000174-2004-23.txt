President, I wish to pay tribute to an extraordinary Vermonter, Ms. Judith Maynard, who was recently named a National Distinguished Principal. As one of 65 principals chosen nationwide, this award places Ms. Maynard in an elite class of educators.  Ms. Maynard has dedicated her life to the education and well-being of Vermont children. After working her way through an undergraduate and two masters' degrees at the University of Vermont, she launched her career as an educator. For the past 26 years, Vermont students have benefited from her extraordinary leadership. She has served as the principal of Chamberlin School in South Burlington, Vermont for the last eleven years and headed the Folsom School in South Hero for 10 years before that.  At Chamberlin, Ms. Maynard sought out grant money to hire the district's first school social worker--helping prevent problems at home from damaging students' performance at school. She has reworked the school's curriculum to provide focused, cohesive instruction across grade levels. She has made a priority of spending as much time as possible with her students, personally tutoring them in math and never saying no to those students who want to read a book with her or discuss losing a tooth. And she has fought to ensure that her young students have access to a nutritious breakfast at school, providing them with the fuel they need to successfully get through the school day.  The impact of her efforts is clear. Standardized test results on mathematics problem solving for fourth-graders at her school have jumped in the last 2 years from 48 percent achieving the benchmark of success in 2002 to 70 percent in 2004. These are impressive gains by any measure.  Ms. Maynard's leadership demonstrates the importance of having strong, dedicated principals in each of our schools. Providing vision, direction and support to all who work under the schoolhouse roof ensures that our children receive the best possible education. Together they provide our children with the skills and confidence needed to achieve their goals and lead happy, meaningful lives. America's future depends on the efforts of exceptional educational leaders like Judith Maynard. I congratulate her for her success and salute her for her tireless dedication to the children of Vermont.                          ____________________
