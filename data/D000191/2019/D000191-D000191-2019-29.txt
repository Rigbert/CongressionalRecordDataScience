Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, the gentleman said he wants healthy trust funds. Well, we got a heck of a healthful trust fund when it comes to harbor maintenance, but we also have a massive deficit in harbor maintenance.  We are projecting that we are going to need an extra $15.8 billion between now and just 2020 to meet the demands of larger and heavier ships that are going to come through the Panama Canal and come here. How are we going to meet that? Well, we could spend the harbor maintenance trust fund on harbor maintenance, but, no, it wasn't part of the budget caps.  Go out and tell that to people who are dependent upon getting their goods in and out of the Nation's ports and say: Oh, well. Sorry. We can't do that jetty. We can't dredge that harbor because we can't spend the money that we took from you and put in the bank, even though the need is not being met.  I don't think that is a real winning subject outside the beltway. But inside the beltway, it resonates with certain people.  Again, I am pleased to hear from the National Taxpayers Union. The Association of General Contractors will key vote this issue.  This is a program created during the Reagan administration, signed by Ronald Reagan. The money has been diverted by both Democratic Presidents and Republican Presidents for years. It is time to stop doing that.  This President expressed personally to me, in a meeting, that he wants to stop diverting that money. Mick Mulvaney, following the line of arguing we are having here, keeps trying to cut the spending on harbor maintenance so they can divert more of the tax paid by the American people to create illusory deficit reduction by putting the money in the bank.  How does that reduce the deficit? It doesn't reduce the deficit. It doesn't.  In the real world, it is the Budget Act and its definitions that we are talking about here, not the real needs of the American people, not the real needs of the American ports, not the real needs of our shippers, and not the real needs of our exporters. That is what we are talking about here today.  We can hear tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow. ``We will get to it some other time.'' Twenty-three years ago, I started working on this with Republican Chairman Bud Shuster--23 years, a quarter of a century.  This is something we can do for the American people. The President ran on providing trillions of dollars of infrastructure investment. So far, all the budgets written by Mick Mulvaney and that hench-person he has over at OMB now actually have proposed reductions in transportation spending and have proposed reductions in harbor maintenance, even though we have a dedicated tax that can pay for it.  In any sensible world, we would take the dedicated tax and spend it on its lawful purpose, and the only lawful purpose is to get into our ports and rebuild the jetties and dredge for the larger ships that are coming to America so we can be more competitive as a maritime nation and maybe reduce the trade deficit.  There was a lot of discussion about the deficit. Again, I would just recall that the deficit is up almost $400 billion in 2 years--2 years during which the Republicans controlled the House, the Senate, and the White House.                              {time}  1545  I think it had something to do with a tax cut, $3 trillion. Didn't hear much about budget caps or deficit concerns.  Oh, wait a minute. It is going to pay for itself. It was going to raise revenues. It didn't raise revenues. Revenues didn't get raised. And, oh, by the way, it didn't pay for itself.  So I would hope that Members here will realize that the vast number of Americans--I bet if you went out and polled them, saying, ``You are paying a little tax here for harbor maintenance, and it is being deposited in the Treasury to make the deficit look smaller; do you think that is a good idea?'' I think that would be one thing that people on both sides of the aisle, all across America would say, no, spend the money on our ports.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
