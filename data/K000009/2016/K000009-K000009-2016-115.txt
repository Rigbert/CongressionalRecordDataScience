Chair, I demand a recorded vote.  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered bythe gentleman from Virginia will be postponed.                              {time}  1930                   Amendment Offered by Mr. McNerney  Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Chairman, as the designee of the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Cohen), I offer an amendment.  The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.  The Clerk read as follows:       Page 43, line 24, after the dollar amount, insert      ``(increased by $2,000,000)''.       Page 50, line 21, after the dollar amount, insert      ``(reduced by $2,000,000)''.  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 743, the gentleman from California and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.  Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  This amendment would increase funding for the Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy account by $2 million for the SuperTruck II program. The SuperTruck program was started by the Department of Energy to improve freight and heavy duty vehicle efficiency.  The Committee on Appropriations acknowledged in their committee report the success of the SuperTruck II program but recommended only $20 million of the requested $60 million for the SuperTruck II program to further improve efficiency in these vehicles.  SuperTruck II will continue dramatic improvements in the efficiency of heavy-duty class 8 long-haul and regional-haul vehicles through system-level improvements. These improvements include hybridization, more efficient idling, and high efficiency HVAC technologies. By increasing the funding for the SuperTruck II program by $2 million, it will allow the Department of Energy to better achieve their freight efficiency goals.  This amendment is fully offset by a decrease in the departmental administration account.  I thank my colleague, Steve Cohen, for his continued work on this important issue. I would also like to thank Chairman Simpson and Ranking Member Kaptur for their hard work on this bill. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
