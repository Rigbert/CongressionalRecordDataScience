President, from its origins as a U.S.-based research vehicle, the Internet has matured into a democratic, international medium for communication, commerce and education. As the Internet evolves, the traditional means of organizing its technical functions need to evolve as well.  In the days before the Internet, the U.S. Defense Department's research network--called the ARPAnet--used a naming system that would map a computer's numerical address to a more user-friendly host name. With only a few computers linked to the ARPAnet, the U.S. Defense Department's research network maintained a master list of each computer's numerical address and host name. Sending an electronic message or file was a simple matter of looking up the computer's host name on a master list to find its numerical address. As the number of host computers grew, however, it became clear that a new addressing system was needed. Thus, in 1987, the current Domain Name System (DNS) was created.  On today's Internet, the DNS works through a hierarchy of names. At the top of this hierarchy are a set of Top Level Domains that can be classified into two categories: generic Top Level Domains (gTLD) such as ``.gov,'' ``.net,'' ``.com,'' ``.edu,'' ''.org,'' ``.int,'' and ``.mil,'' and the country code Top Level Domain names, such as ``.us'' and ``.uk.'' Before each TLD suffix, is a Second Level Domain name.  Since the Internet is an outgrowth of U.S. government investments carried out under agreements with U.S. agencies, major components of the DNS are still performed by or subject to agreements with U.S. agencies. Examples include assignments of numerical addresses to Internet users, management of the system of registering names for Internet users, operation of the root server system, and protocol assignment.  For the past five years, a company based in Herndon, Virginia, named Network Solutions, Inc., has served under a cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation as the exclusive registry of all second level domain names in several of the gTLDs (e.g., .com, .net, .org, and .edu). This contract will end next month, with an optional ramp-down period that expires on September 30, 1998.  The National Science Foundation's exclusive arrangement with Network Solutions regarding the assignment of domain names has drawn criticism from Internet users. This arrangement has also been the subject of antitrust scrutiny by the Justice Department and of two lawsuits in Federal Court. I wrote to Attorney General Reno in July 1997, asking to be kept apprised, as appropriate, of any developments in the Justice Department's antitrust investigation concerning the assignment of the most popular domain names for Internet addresses. I was assured that the Department's objective was consistent with my concerns to ensure that the DNS functions, to the maximum extent possible, in an open, competitive environment that maximizes innovation and consumer choice.  Despite the controversies associated with certain aspects of Network Solutions' management of the gTLDs, many of us have been concerned about what would happen at the end of that company's exclusive contract. Simply put, how will we avoid chaos on the Internet and the potential risk of multiple registrations of the same domain name for different computers?  That is why I welcomed the Administration's intent to address this issue comprehensively. In the Administration's ``Framework for Global Electronic Commerce,'' the President last year directed the Secretary of Commerce to privatize, increase competition and promote international participation in the DNS. At the beginning of this year, I wrote to Secretary Daley requesting that the Administration present its policy recommendations regarding the management of the DNS without further delay, lest the stability and integrity of the Internet domain name system be threatened.  On January 30, 1998, the Commerce Department released a ``Green Paper,'' or discussion draft, entitled ``A Proposal to Improve Technical Management of Internet Names and Addresses,'' proposing privatization of the management of the DNS through the creation of a new, not-for-profit corporation. This organization would set policy for the allocation of number blocks to regional number registries; oversee operation of the root server system; determine when new top-level-domains should be added to the root system; and coordinate development of protocol parameters for the Internet.  While the corporation would be able to decide when to add new gTLDs, the Administration has indicated that it does not want to wait until the corporation is formed to bring competition to the domain name registration process. Thus, the Green Paper proposes to allow firms other than Network Solutions assign addresses that end in the gTLDs: ``.com,'' ``.org'' and ``.net.'' The Green Paper also proposes the creation of five new gTLDs, each of which would be based on registries operated by separate firms. The Administration continues to solicit comments on the Green Paper from the DNS stakeholder community, and hopes to finalize and begin implementation of the Green Paper's proposals in April 1998.  Developing this proposal to privatize and increase competition in the DNS was an important and difficult task. I am delighted that the Administration undertook this herculean effort and has finally released its draft proposal to improve the DNS. I especially applaud the hard work of Ira Magaziner, Senior Advisor to the President for Policy Development, Larry Irving, Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information and Administrator of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), and Becky Burr, Associate Administrator, NTIA, Office of International Affairs.  I fully agree with the four basic principles guiding the Administration's proposal to structure this evolution; namely that private sector control is preferable to government control; competition should be encouraged; management of the Internet should reflect the diversity of its users and their needs; and stability of the Internet should be maintained during the transition period. These shared principles form the basis of a solid framework from which to determine the evolution of the DNS. That being said, I think it prudent that the Green Paper--already shaped by months of discussions with a variety of Internet stakeholders--is in the form of a discussion draft and that additional public comments are being solicited. The Internet is a democratic form of communication, and changes in its management structure warrant consideration through an open and democratic process.  Among the more challenging questions presented by the Green Paper arehow to protect consumers' interests in locating the brand or vendor of their choice on the Internet without being deceived or confused, and how to protect companies from having their brand equity diluted in an electronic environment. Adding new gTLDs, as the Green Paper proposes, would allow more competition and more individuals and businesses to obtain addresses that more closely reflect their names and functions. On the other hand, businesses are also rightly concerned that the increase in gTLDs may make the job of protecting their trademarks from infringement or dilution more difficult. Recent news reports have highlighted the prevalence of ``stealth'' domain name addresses, which are slight spelling variations on the addresses of popular Web sites used to increase visits by potential subscribers. For instance, as reported in the March 2, 1998 edition of Newsweek, ``www.whitehouse.com'' is an explicit adult Web site. One needs to use the domain name ``www.whitehouse.gov'' to reach the White House's web site.  Congress recently addressed certain trademark issues with passage of the Federal Trademark Dilution Act. That legislation proscribes the dilution of famous trademarks in circumstances that might not otherwise amount to trademark infringement. When that legislation passed the Senate, I noted that ``no one else has yet considered this application,'' but expressed ``my hope that this antidilution statute can help stem the use of deceptive Internet addresses taken by those who are choosing marks that are associated with the products and reputations of others.'' Congressional Record, S 19312 (December 29, 1995).  Over the past several years, I understand that disputes between trademark owners and domain name owners have been on the rise. To address the legitimate concerns of trademark holders and the diverse needs of Internet users, the Green Paper proposes that a study be undertaken on the effects of adding new gTLDs and related dispute resolution procedures on trademark and intellectual property rights holders. Specifically, the Green Paper states:       We also propose that . . . a study be undertaken on the      effects of adding new gTLDs and related dispute resolution      procedures on trademark and intellectual property rights      holders. This study should be conduced under the auspices of      a body that is internationally recognized in the area of      dispute resolution procedures, with input from trademark and      domain name holders and registries.  Although some of the recommendations in the Green Paper have proved to be controversial, I understand that DNS stakeholders of diverse background and interests, including those businesses who are concerned that the increase in gTLDs may make the job of protecting their trademarks from infringement or dilution more difficult, such as ATT and Bell Atlantic, support this Green Paper recommendation. The legislation I introduce today directs the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Assistant Secretary of Commerce and Commissioner of Patent and Trademarks, to request the National Research Council (NRC) of the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a comprehensive study of the effects on trademark and intellectual property rights holders of adding new gTLDs and related dispute resolution procedures. The study shall assess and, as appropriate, make recommendations for policy, practice, or legislative changes regarding: (1) the short-term and long-term effects on the protection of trademark and intellectual property rights and consumer interests of increasing or decreasing the number of gTLDs; (2) trademark and intellectual property rights clearance processes for domain names, including whether domain name databases should be readily searchable through a common interface to facilitate the ``clearing'' of trademarks and intellectual property rights and proposed domain names across a range of gTLDs; identifying what information from domain name databases should be accessible for the ``clearing'' of trademarks and intellectual property rights; and whether gTLDs registrants should be required to provide certain information; (3) domain name trademark and intellectual property rights dispute resolution mechanisms, including how to reduce trademark and intellectual property rights conflicts associated with the addition of any new gTLDs and how to reduce trademark and intellectual property rights conflicts through new technical approaches to Internet addressing; (4) choice of law or jurisdiction for resolution of trademark and intellectual property rights disputes relating to domain names, including which jurisdictions should be available for trademark and intellectual property rights owners to file suit to protect their trademarks and intellectual property rights; (5) trademark and intellectual property rights infringement liability for registrars, registries, or technical management bodies; and (6) short-term and long-term technical and policy options for Internet addressing schemes and their impact on current trademark and intellectual property issues.  The bill also calls upon the Secretary of Commerce to seek the cooperation of the Patent and Trademark Office, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, other Commerce Department entities and all other appropriate Federal departments, Government contractors, and similar entities with the study.  I use the Internet frequently, and I therefore have a personal stake in ensuring that the evolution of the DNS is one that makes sense from an end-user perspective. In addition, I am proud to say that Vermont companies have been leaders in cyber selling. Both users and companies seeking to do business on the Internet have a direct stake in ensuring that the DNS develops in a manner that protects the rights and promotes their shared interests.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1727       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
