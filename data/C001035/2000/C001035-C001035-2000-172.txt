Schumer, Mr. Jeffords, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Levin, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. Dodd) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources:                            S. Con. Res. 88       Whereas the price of crude oil has more than doubled in the      past year to over $30 per barrel, and prices of petroleum      products such as heating oil, diesel fuel, and gasoline have      reached record levels;       Whereas a sharp sustained increase in the price of crude      oil negatively affects the overall economic well-being of the      United States;       Whereas high oil prices harm people and businesses;       Whereas the Energy Information Administration has      determined that Northeastern United States fuel reserves are      the lowest in 20 years and that Americans are ``skating on      thin ice'' in meeting energy requirements;       Whereas the current price and supply crisis was largely      created through the actions of the Organization of Petroleum      Exporting Countries (``OPEC'') by market-distorting and      collusive production reductions, and OPEC's activities would      be in violation of United States antitrust laws if conducted      within the United States;       Whereas OPEC has demonstrated unity not seen since the      energy crises of the 1970's;       Whereas the United States has a Strategic Petroleum Reserve      of over 570,000,000 barrels of crude oil to protect against      threats to oil supplies;       Whereas many experts, trade associations, and members of      Congress have called for a drawdown of the Strategic      Petroleum Reserve to combat OPEC's market distorting      behavior;       Whereas a drawdown or the threat of a drawdown of the      Strategic Petroleum Reserve could provide a critical tool to      break the resolve of OPEC to practice market distorting      behavior, and a sale of oil from the Strategic Petroleum      Reserve would increase domestic supplies and drive down      prices in the short term;       Whereas swaps from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve offer a      way to increase the overall size of the Strategic Petroleum      Reserve at no cost to the taxpayer; and       Whereas low global inventories allow OPEC to retain      inordinate control over supply and pricing, and consequently      undue influence over the global economy: Now, therefore, be      it       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives      concurring),     SECTION 1. SENSE OF CONGRESS.       It is the sense of Congress that--       (1) using authority under existing law, directly through      time exchanges (or ``swaps'') or through other means, the      President and the Secretary of Energy should draw down the      Strategic Petroleum Reserve in an economically feasible      manner and to a responsible degree, to combat unfair foreign      trade practices of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting      Countries and alleviate the severely deleterious consequences      to people and businesses in the United States that those      practices have caused; and       (2) the President and the Secretary of Energy should      prepare for future threats to the economy and energy supply      of the United States by developing methods to--       (A) draw down the Strategic Petroleum Reserve quickly when      needed; and       (B) increase the quantity of crude oil in the Strategic      Petroleum Reserve over time in an economically reasonable      manner.
