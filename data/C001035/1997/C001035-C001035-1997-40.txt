President.  Mr. President, I rise in very reluctant opposition to the amendment offered by my friend and colleague from Alabama, Senator Sessions. I do believe that the issue of attorney's fees is an important one. But it should be debated in the context of the global tobacco settlement. My fear is that despite the best intentions of the sponsors of this amendment that passage of the Sessions amendment would jeopardize the underlying Durbin-Collins amendment to repeal the $50 billion tax giveaway to big tobacco. For that reason, I am going to vote to table Senator Sessions' amendment.  I do want to point out one issue that has become obscured in this debate, and that is that the money that will be paid in attorney's fees does not come out of the $368.5 billion global settlement. Instead, the attorney's fees will be paid by the tobacco industry, separate from the settlement. So the attorney's fees do not diminish the amount of the $368.5 billion settlement. I think that is an important point that has been lost in this debate.  I share the concerns of my colleague from Alabama about an attorney's fees. I think there are, however, constitutional issues about whether Congress can step in and abrogate contracts that were reached between the States attorneys general and private law firms. That is an issue that deserves to be thoroughly explored. But, most of all, I urge my colleagues, whatever their position on the tobacco settlement, whatever their position on the issue of attorney's fees, to save this debate for a more appropriate time. And that is when the global tobacco settlement is before the Senate. My fear is that the passage of this amendment would jeopardize the underlying amendment to repeal the $50 billion tax break, and I do not believe we should allow that to happen. For this reason, I will support the motion to table, offered by the Senator from Illinois.  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.
