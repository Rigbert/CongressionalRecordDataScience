This provision in section 5, like the rest of H.R. 1675, is intended to recognize long-established Federal-State relationships. States have traditional primacy regarding the allocation of water resources, and this merely directs the Secretary to use appropriate State forums in those cases where water is to be acquired for refuge units. This section should not be construed to otherwise alter or diminish the interests of the Federal Government as it pertains to ownership of or management authority for the National Wildlife Refuge System.
