Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Kentucky for yielding time to me.  I rise in support of H.R. 4276. This bill, Mr. Chairman, takes important steps to deal with illegal immigration and related crimes, such as alien smuggling and drug smuggling. As in previous years, the bill provides for 1,000 new border patrol agents and 140 support personnel for those agents. These new agents can help the United States regain control of its borders.  H.R. 4276 also addresses the INS's longstanding unresponsiveness to the problems imposed on communities by criminal illegal aliens. Too often the INS has failed to deport criminal aliens arrested by State and local police officers. The bill directs the INS to set up an around-the-clock 800 number that State and local officers can call to arrange for apprehension and removal of criminal aliens.  The bill also directs the INS to deputize State law enforcement officials when requested, as authorized by the 1996 immigration reform law, so they can assist the INS in removing criminal aliens from the United States. Too often the INS has released criminal aliens into American communities because of inefficient use of limited detention space. H.R. 4276 provides substantial resources for a major increase in detention spaces available to the INS.  Finally, Mr. Chairman, the bill directs the INS to maintain the integrity of immigration benefits by investigating and rejecting fraudulent applications. Equally as important, it also mandates improved speed and efficiency for serving immigration applicants, and provides important funding for that purpose, funding which was not requested by the administration.  I urge my colleagues to support and vote for H.R. 4276, the Commerce, Justice, State, and the Judiciary appropriations bill.
