 President, tomorrow the Senate will resume consideration of S. 1805, the gun liability bill. Senator McCain will then be recognized to offer an amendment relating to the gun show loophole, which will immediately be laid aside for Senator Feinstein to offer her assault weapons ban amendment. Senator Frist will then be recognized to offer his D.C. gun ban amendment. Following the offering of these amendments, the time until 11:35 a.m. will be equally divided for debate on these three amendments. At 11:35 a.m., the Senate will proceed to a stacked series of votes culminating in the passage of the bill. Therefore, I inform our colleagues that the first vote of tomorrow's session will occur at 11:35 a.m.                          ____________________
