Speaker, America is aware of the fact that if Congress does not take immediate action at midnight tonight, the Federal Government will shut down. How did we reach this point?  First, we have seen gross mismanagement of the congressional schedule this year in the House of Representatives. In the first 100 days with the so-called Contract With America, Speaker Gingrich and the Republicans insisted on considering 31 bills on an emergency basis, many of them without committee hearing. As a result of 100 days of action and activity on the floor of the House, 31 different bills were called; 3 have been signed into law.  Because of our dedication of time to that Contract With America, we have fallen behind in our responsibility to pass appropriation bills. The budget resolution was a month late; the appropriations bills which keep the Government running were supposed to be presented, all 13 of them, to the President by October 1--2, 2 of the 13 have made it.  So now we are considering what we call a continuing resolution, a spending bill to keep us in business, and along comes the Republican leadership and Mr. Gingrich, and instead of sending a bill to the President just to keep the Government running while we do the rest of our business on Capitol Hill, he insists on this paragraph.  This is the reason the Government is shutting down. Mr. Gingrich insists that in order to keep the Government running, he wants to include these nine lines, which increase Medicare premiums on senior citizens as of January 1 by 25 percent. What does this have to do with keeping the Government running? Little or nothing. But it is part of the political egoism which we are seeing as part of this crisis.  Mr. Speaker, I have a solution to this problem and the solution is very simple. It is H.R. 2281. It does not even take up two pages. It is a bill I introduced in the House and Senator Barbara Boxer introduced into the Senate. It is very simple. It simply states, no budget, no pay.  It basically says to Members of Congress, if you cannot keep Government in operation, if you want America to default on its national debt, why should you be paid? You have failed in your responsibility as Members of Congress elected to this body. How can the train crew that caused the train wreck ask to be paid while the passengers are suffering? How can Speaker Gingrich and Members of Congress send 800,000 Federal employees home tomorrow without pay and continue to draw their own paychecks?  The failure of the Republican leadership to pass appropriations bills required by law or to produce an honest continuing resolution is a complete abdication of responsibility. Penalizing Federal employees and the American people by shutting down the Government is a shameful political ego trip. If the Government shuts down, so should congressional paychecks.  So, Mr. Speaker, I will be following the provisions of H.R. 2281: no budget, no pay. I will be returning my pay while the Government is shut down.  Perhaps if Speaker Gingrich and his leaders tasted the bitter medicine of a government shutdown personally, they might be willing to help this country get well.  I urge every one of my colleagues and every American who is sick and tired of this political gamesmanship to call Speaker Newt Gingrich in Washington and demand that no budget, no pay, H.R. 2181 be voted on on an emergency basis. Senator Barbara Boxer and I are joining in a letter to the Speaker today to urge that this be brought before the House.  We are going to spend the whole day on a series of suspension bills which are unimportant. They are innocuous and unnecessary. We ought to bring up no budget, no pay, and perhaps avert this Government crisis.  Mr. Speaker, it is time for some of the Republican leaders in Congress to put their money where their over-active political mouths have been.                          ____________________
