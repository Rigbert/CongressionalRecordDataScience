 President, my amendment, I do not think, will be controversial. I hope it has been cleared on both sides. I believe it has. My amendment will modify section 505 of the bill.  Section 505 of the bill streamlines the procedure for retiring our most senior military officers. That means admirals and generals who hold three- or four-star rank. Under current law, the President must nominate the most senior officers for retirement, which involves senatorial confirmation under existing law. If a three-star or four-star officer is not nominated or not confirmed under current law, that individual then, as we all know, reverts to his or her permanent grade, which, obviously, is lower.  For a three-star general, as an example, this could mean retirement with a two-star, or even a one-star grade, I believe. I hope I understand it well. section 505 would eliminate Senate confirmation. That means section 505 of this bill would do away with Senate confirmation of three-star and four-star officers who are retiring.  When Senator Hutchison and Senator Nunn, and others, first introduced this measure, it was introduced as S. 635 and introduced on March 28 of this year. At that time, I very much opposed the idea, and I joined Senator Boxer and Senator Murray in signing a letter to the committee on May 11 of this year expressing opposition to the bill by Senators Hutchison and Nunn. We felt that S. 635 would undermine congressional oversight, that it would undermine civilian control of the military, and would undermine accountability.  Our most senior military officers, we felt--because they are entrusted with tremendous power and responsibility--ought to, in all instances, be proven to do that. So, for that reason, and that reason alone, we feel that they must be held to the very highest possible standards.  Well, section 505 of this bill is not much different from the original S. 635. The language has not changed much, but I can say that we have changed as we viewed the intent of the Nunn-Hutchison bill.  Our initial reaction to S. 635 was tempered by several very difficult and controversial retirement nominations last year. Remember Admiral Kelso, Gen. Buster Glosson, General Barry, Admiral Mauz. We thought that we had good reason to question those nominations for retirement. We thought our concerns were justified. We still do.  Well, after the Hutchison-Nunn bill was introduced, I asked the American Law Division of the Congressional Research Service to assess all of the bill's implications. Mr. Bob Burdette, legislative attorney with the division, was kind enough to prepare a very thoughtful and helpful analysis of the proposed changes to the law, as suggested by our colleagues. Mr. Burdette's report helped to lay most of my concerns to rest.  I ask unanimous consent to have that report printed in the Record at this point.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                   Congressional Research Service,                                          Library of Congress,                                  Washington, DC, July 20, 1995.       To: Hon. Charles E. Grassley. Attention: Charlie Murphy.     From: American Law Division.     Subject: The Legal Effect of Enacting Section 505 Of S. 1026,          104th Cong., 1st Sess., Respecting Retirements of          Commissioned Officers Who Have Served At Grades O-9 and          O-10.       This memorandum explains the legal effect of enacting      Section 505 of S. 1026, 104th Cong., 1st Sess. (1995). This      section of the proposed legislation would make four changes      in the provision presently codified at 10 U.S.C. Sec. 1370.      By way of ``conforming amendments,'' this section would also      repeal provisions presently codified at 10 U.S.C.      Sec. Sec. 3962(a), 5034, and 8962(a).       The proposed legislation would not amend paragraph (1) of      subsection (a) of 10 U.S.C. Sec. 1370. That is, regardless of      whether the proposed legislation is enacted, this paragraph      will still specify a general rule that a commissioned officer      of the Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marine corps shall, except      as provided in paragraph (2) of 10 U.S.C. Sec. 1370(a), be      retired in the highest grade in which he served on active      duty satisfactorily for at least six months.                     section 505(a)(1) of the bill       The first change, which would be made by section 505(a)(1)      of the bill, is substantive in nature. It would strike out      the words ``and below lieutenant general or vice admiral''      which presently appear at 10 U.S.C. Sec. 1370(a)(2)(A). With      such words excised from subparagraph (A) of Sec. 1370(a)(2),      that subparagraph would read, as follows:       In order to be eligible for voluntary retirement under any      provision of this title in a grade above major or lieutenant      commander [...], a commissioned officer of the Army, Navy,      Air Force, or Marine Corps must have served on active duty in      that grade for not less than three years, except that the      Secretary of Defense may authorize the Secretary of a      military department to reduce such period to a period not      less than two years in the case of retirements effective      during the nine-year period beginning on October 1, 1990.       As a consequence of the excision, commissioned officers      serving, or who have served, at the grades of O-9 and O-10      would be eligible to retire at such grades only after serving      at them for at least either three years or, if authorized by      both the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the      military department concerned, as little as two years in the      case of retirements occurring during the specified nine-year      window.       Subparagraph (B) of Sec. 1370(a)(2) would not be amended by      the proposal. Hence, it would still confer none-delegable      authority on the President to ``waive subparagraph (A)'' in      individual cases involving either extreme hardship or      exceptional or unusual circumstances. In other words, a      relevant presidential waiver made under the conditions      specified could render a particular commissioned officer      above the grade of O-4 (albeit now including officers      serving, or who have served, at the grades of O-9 and O-10)      eligible to retire at the highest grade at which that officer      had served without regard to the length of time he had served      at that highest grade.                     section 505(a)(2) of the bill       The second change, which would be made by section 505(a)(2)      of the bill, is likewise substantive in nature. It would      strike out the words ``and below lieutenant general or vice      admiral'' which presently appear at 10 U.S.C.      Sec. 1370(d)(2)(B). Subsection (d) of 10 U.S.C. Sec. 1370      relates generally to retirements of reserve officers under      chapter 1225 of Title 10. Paragraph (1) of 10 U.S.C.      Sec. 1370(d) specifies that a person entitled to retired pay      under chapter 1225 is to be credited with satisfactory      service in the highest grade in which that person served      satisfactorily at any time. With the relevant words excised      from subparagraph (B) of Sec. 1370(d)(2) as indicated in the      proposed legislation, that subparagraph would read, as      follows:       In order to be credited with satisfactory service in an      officer grade above major or lieutenant commander [...], a      person covered by paragraph (1) must have served      satisfactorily in that grade (as determined by the Secretary      of the military department concerned) as a reserve      commissioned officer in an active status, or in a retired      status on active duty, for not less than three years. A      person covered by the preceding sentence who has completed at      least six months of satisfactory service in grade and is      transferred from an active status or is discharged as a      reserve commissioned officer solely due to the requirements      of a nondiscretionary provision of law requiring that      transfer or discharge due to the person's age or years of      service may be credited with satisfactory service in the      grade in which serving at the time of such transfer or      discharge, notwithstanding failure of the person to complete      three years of service in that grade.       As a consequence of the excision, reserve commissioned      officers serving, or who have served, at the grades of O-9      and O-10 would be eligible to retire at such      grades only after serving at them for at least either three      years or, in the specified circumstances, as little as six      months.       It might be pointed out that no authority is presently (or,      under the proposed legislation, would be) conferred on the      President to ``waive subparagraph (A)'' in individual cases      involving either extreme hardship or exceptional or unusual      circumstances. Thus, eligibility for high-grade retirement      presently does (and under the proposed legislation would      continue to) differ as between regular and reserve officers.                     section 505(b)(1) of the bill       The third change, which would be made by section 505(b)(1)      of the bill, is nonsubstantive. It would amend subsection (c)      of 10 U.S.C. Sec. 1370 by replacing certain words with      certain other words. That is, the words ``Upon retirement an      officer'' would be stricken out and replaced by the words      ``An officer.'' All this amendment does is simply remove      excess verbiage.                     section 505(b)(2) of the bill       The fourth change, which would be made by section 505(b)(1)      of the bill, is substantive in nature. It would amend      subsection (c) of 10 U.S.C. Sec. 1370 by striking out the      words ``may, in the discretion'' and all that follows and      replacing them with certain other words. This amendment would      alter the thrust of the subsection entirely. At present,      subsection (c) is the provision which allows officers serving      at grades O-9 and O-10 while on active to duty to be retired      at those grades, at the discretion of the President and      subject to Senate confirmation. The proposed amendment would      change the subsection, as already amended by section      505(b)(1) of the bill, to read, as follows:       ``An officer of the Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marine Corps      who is serving in or has served in a position of importance      and responsibility designated by the President to carry the      grade of general or admiral or lieutenant general or vice      admiral under section 601 of this title may be retired in the      higher grade under subsection (a) only after the Secretary of      Defense certifies in writing to the President and the Senate      that the officer served on active duty satisfactorily in that      grade.''       One obvious effect of this change would be to eliminate the      requirement of Senate confirmation for officers retiring at      grades O-9 and O-10. Another effect of this change is less      obvious.       As noted at the outset of this memorandum, paragraph (1) of      subsection (a) of 10 U.S.C. Sec. 1370 presently specifies a      general rule that a commissioned officer of the Army, Navy,      Air Force, or Marine Corps shall be retired in the highest      grade in which he served on active duty satisfactorily for at      least six months. The language setting out that general rule      is preceded by the caveat ``[u]nless entitled to a higher      retired grade under some other provision of law.'' The words      ``higher grade'' used in this caveat are not used anywhere      else in subsection (a). Consequently, when the new language      that would be added to subsection (c) of 10 U.S.C. Sec. 1370      refers to ``the higher grade under subsection (a),'' it      clearly implies that there may be instances in which officers      who would not otherwise be entitled to retire at higher      grades under the terms of 10 U.S.C. Sec. 1370 (e.g., because      they have not served long enough at those higher grades)      could under some unspecified ``other provision of law'' be      entitled to retire at those higher grades so long as the      Secretary of Defense ``certified'' served satisfactorily for      an unspecified period of time in the grade concerned and      supplied such certification to the President and to ``the      Senate.'' The transmittal of such a certification to ``the      Senate'' is of unknown significance.                                               Robert B.
