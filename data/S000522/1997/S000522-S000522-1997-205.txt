We are saying where we can protect an unborn child and a generation of unborn children from aggressive lobbying by a non-governmental organization, we are going to do it. If we cannot save all of the kids, we try to save some.  To say we have to have some kind of equal policy, just because we like to say everything is the same everywhere, that to me is not productive. When we can save a child in Kenya or we can save a child in Central or South America from an assault on the law that protects them, we ought to do it.  Let me also point out to the gentleman, if the gentleman from Minnesota will continue yielding, we are talking about discretionary funding. This is not entitlement funding. We inthis Congress appropriate every year certain amounts of money to be used for this purpose. It should not be the NGOs to dictate to us that, we will not take your money unless we do this, that, and the other thing. We should put simple conditions and say, do family planning; do not permit abortions.
