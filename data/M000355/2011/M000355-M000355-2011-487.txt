 President, I, too, rise to honor our colleague, the senior Senator from Maryland, on becoming the longest serving female Senator in the history of the Senate. In achieving this milestone, Barbara passes Margaret Chase Smith, as the majority leader indicated, who served the people of Maine from 1949 to 1973. As was indicated, she is also only the second woman to be elected to both the Senate and the House.  When first elected to the Senate in 1986, Barbara was only the 16th woman to ever serve. Today, there are more female Senators than that in the 112th Congress alone.  Barbara has served as a role model and mentor to many of them, and I know they are grateful for it. She has been a champion of the space program, scientific research, welfare reform, major transportation, homeland security, and environmental issues in Maryland.  I think Barbara would be the first to tell you that becoming the longest serving female Senator wasn't easy. Like all streaks, including that of another Marylander Cal Ripken, there are a lot of bumps in the road. But she has made it through it all and we are happy to share in this milestone with her today.  I wish to recognize Barbara not only for her accomplishment as the longest serving female in the Senate history but also for all of her many accomplishments as a Senator and for the pioneering model she has been to so many women in her distinguished career. Again, congratulations, Senator Mikulski.
