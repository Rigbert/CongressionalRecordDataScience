President, I said a few words on the floor the other day. I meant every one of them. Senator Paul Sarbanes has been kind enough to thank me. I wanted to say briefly that from time to time people back in Illinois would ask me: Of all those Senators whom you serve with, which ones do you respect the most? Without hesitation, I would always mention the name Paul Sarbanes. I respect him so much, not only for his intelligence and his good humor but also for his wit and his wisdom.  The reflective past he has referred to in public service starts in the House of Representatives, his service on the House Judiciary Committee during the tumultuous days of the Watergate hearings, impeachment trial, and coming full circle to the Senate. He has a lifetime of public service to be proud of.  Christine, his wife, has been at his side. And I know she has shared in many of the great victories that their family has been able to point to. The greatest victory, I understand, is now the election of her son. She is so proud, as Paul told us, their son John is going to follow in his father's footsteps as a Congressman in this upcoming Congress.  I will truly miss Paul Sarbanes as a great Senator and a great friend.
