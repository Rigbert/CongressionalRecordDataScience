 President, the committee is aware that States have prefinanced construction projects authorized under the Appalachian highway program are reimbursed at 70 percent Federal share, while those States expending funds for the new mileage receive an 80-percent Federal share. The committee recognizes that this provision treats those States that have taken the initiative to prefinance these needed road projects differently and urges the appropriate authorizing committee to consider correcting this funding inequity over the period during which funds are made available to complete the ADHS.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would like to ask Senator Warner if he agrees with my assessment of the problem and would help me correct this error in the reauthorization of the surface transportation bill, which is set to expire on September 30.
