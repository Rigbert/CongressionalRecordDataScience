Mr. Chairman, I come to the floor to compliment the chairman of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, Mr. Olver, on preparing an excellent and well-balanced appropriation bill.  The large number of important priorities included in this bill create difficult choices, and the chairman has done an excellent job balancing the competing interests and preparing a good bill for consideration in the full House.  As the co-Chair of the House COPD Caucus, I want to speak about one item that falls under the jurisdiction of the subcommittee, and that is the implementation of the 1986 Air Carrier Access Act. This act was intended to protect individuals with disabilities who fly on commercial air carriers from discriminating practices. The legislation has done a reasonably good job of protecting most passengers.  The Acting CHAIRMAN. The time of the gentleman from Massachusetts has expired.
