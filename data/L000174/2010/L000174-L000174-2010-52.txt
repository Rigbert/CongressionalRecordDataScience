 Mr. Cole's nomination has been pending on the Executive Calendar for 4\1/2\ months, since it was reported favorably by the Judiciary Committee in July. I have a hard time remembering any time, in either a Democratic or Republican administration, that the Deputy Attorney General has been held up like this.  Those Republican Senators who continue to block us from considering this well-qualified nominee should come forward and explain why they feel it is justified to continue to leave America without a crucial resource we need to combat terrorism and to keep the country safe. Instead of doing this anonymously, the Senators ought to step forward and say why we cannot confirm this Deputy Attorney General, the No. 2 law enforcement position for the whole United States of America.  Today, I will seek unanimous consent for a time agreement to debate this nomination and finally have a vote in the full Senate. I have alerted the distinguished ranking member of the Judiciary Committee of this request. Those who oppose the nomination are free to say why and they can vote no, but let's end the stalling.  You have Senators say that they don't want to vote yes and that they don't want to vote no, but that they want to vote maybe. This is what is happening now with the nomination for the No. 2 law enforcement official of the country.  Madam President, we were all elected for 6-year terms, with the responsibility to vote yes or no in the best interests of the United States. Voting maybe does not serve those interests.  President Obama nominated Jim Cole to be Deputy Attorney General on May 24. That was 6\1/2\ months ago. I thank the Judiciary Committee ranking member, Senator Sessions, for working with me to schedule a hearing on the Cole nomination while the committee was preparing for Justice Kagan's confirmation hearing.  The problem was not with the Senator from Alabama. He helped me move forward with that hearing in the committee, and I wish we could have proceeded in the same spirit in the Senate. As the former Deputy Attorneys General wrote, ``Because of the responsibilities of the position of Deputy Attorney General, votes on nominations to fill this position usually proceed quickly.'' They also note that of the 11 nominations to fill this position over the last 20 years, from both Democratic and Republican Presidents, ``none remained pending for longer than 32 days.'' Indeed, all four of the Deputy Attorneys General who served under President Bush, three of whom signed the letter we received yesterday, were confirmed by the Senate by voice vote an average of 21 days after they were reported by the Judiciary Committee. In fact, we confirmed President Bush's first nominee to be Deputy Attorney General the very same day it was reported by the committee.  We should treat the nomination of Jim Cole with the same urgency and seriousness with which we treated President Bush's nominations of Larry Thompson, James Comey, Paul McNulty, and Mark Filip. We should reject the strategy of some Senate Republicans of elevating their partisan goal to weaken the Obama administration over taking actions to keep us safe.  In November, over 4 months after Mr. Cole responded to written questions following his confirmation hearing, only two Senators sent him additional followup questions on a topic covered extensively during the earlier questioning. Two weeks ago, Mr. Cole promptly answered even these additional questions. There is no reason for Republicans to continue blocking the Senate's consideration of this nomination.  Jim Cole served as a career prosecutor at the Justice Department for a dozen years and has a well-deserved reputation for fairness, integrity, and toughness. He served under both Republican and Democratic Presidents. He clearly demonstrated during his confirmation hearing months ago that he understands the issues of crime and national security that are at the center of the Deputy Attorney General's job.  The nomination received strong endorsement from Republican and Democratic public officials, and from high-ranking veterans of the Justice Department, including the letter to the Senate leaders yesterday from eight former Deputy Attorneys General who served in the administrations of President Reagan, President George H.W.Bush, President Clinton, President George W. Bush, as well as the current administration. Former Republican Senator Jack Danforth, who worked with Jim Cole for more than 15 years, described Mr. Cole to the committee as someone without an ideological or political agenda.  The months of delay of this nomination have been unnecessary, debilitating and wrong.                               Exhibit 1                                                 December 1, 2010.     Hon. Harry Reid,     Senate Majority Leader,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Addison Mitchell McConnell,     Senate Minority Leader,     Washington, DC.       Dear Leaders Reid and McConnell: We are a bipartisan group      of former Deputy Attorneys General of the United States. We      write to urge the expeditious consideration by the Senate of      the nomination of James Cole to be Deputy Attorney General.       The Cole nomination was received by the Senate on May 24,      2010, and reported favorably from the Judiciary Committee on      July 20, 2010, so the nomination has been pending before the      Senate for more than one hundred and twenty days. Because of      the responsibilities of the position of Deputy Attorney      General, votes on nominations for this position usually      proceed quickly. Over the past twenty years, presidents of      both parties nominated eleven individuals to serve as Deputy      Attorney General. Their nominations were pending on the      Senate calendar for an average of twelve days, and none      remained pending for longer than thirty-two days. Nine of the      eleven nominees were confirmed by voice vote or unanimous      consent.       The position of Deputy Attorney General is an important      position in the federal government. The Deputy Attorney      General functions as the chief operating officer of the      Department of Justice, supervising its day-to-day operations.      As such, the Deputy plays a central role in ensuring      effective enforcement of federal laws, including laws against      mortgage fraud, health care fraud, organized crime and child      exploitation. The Deputy is also a key member of the      president's national security team, a function that has grown      in importance and complexity in the years since the terror      attacks of September 11. He or she supervises the work of the      Department's National Security Division, and is called upon      to make crucial, time sensitive decisions to protect the      American people.       There is a capable individual currently serving as Acting      Deputy Attorney General, but it is important to the proper      functioning of the Department that there be a confirmed      official in this position. Only a Deputy appointed by the      President may formally and automatically assume all of the      duties of the Attorney General when that Cabinet official is      unavailable for one reason or another. And there is at least      one critical statutory responsibility that an Acting Deputy      cannot perform--signing applications to the Foreign      Intelligence Surveillance Court.       We strongly urge that the Senate vote on the nomination of      James Cole as soon as possible.           Sincerely,     Donald B. Ayer,     Carol E. Dinkins,     Mark R. Filip,     Jamie S. Gorelick,     Philip B. Heymann,     Paul J. McNulty,     David W. Ogden,     Larry D. Thompson.
