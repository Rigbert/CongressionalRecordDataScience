 President, I rise today to introduce legislation with Senator Snowe that will provide our Nation's migrant agricultural and forest workers with a safe ride to work. The Farm and Forestry Worker Transportation Safety Act would require a designated seat and seatbelt for each person riding in a vehicle used to transport these workers.  Today, many migrant workers travel to their jobs in dangerous and unsafe conditions. It is not uncommon for these workers to ride in overcrowded vans and trucks while sitting on benches and buckets with no access to seatbelts.  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 78 agricultural workers lost their lives and 440 were injured in transportation accidents in 2004.  I would like to take a moment to share with you just a few of the accidents that have resulted from the lack of adequate safety regulations for these workers:  In December of 2005, two Guatemalan forest workers were killed when their vehicle crashed driving off icy roads in Washington. Five Guatemalan forest workers were killed in the same manner the previous year.  In June of 2004, 2 migrant workers were killed in Port St. Lucie, FL, when their overcrowded van carrying 11 people rolled over on Interstate 95. Two months later, 9 citrus workers were killed in Fort Pierce when their 15-passenger van rolled over and ejected all 19 passengers.  In September 2002, 14 forestry workers were killed when their van transporting them to work toppled off a bridge in Maine.  In August 1999, 13 tomato field workers were killed when their van slammed into a tractor-trailer in Fresno County, CA. Most of the victims were riding on three benches in the back of the van.  As you can see, this issue does not just affect my home State of California. It is a problem that requires national attention. Congress needs to take action to ensure these workers safe travel to and from their jobs. My bill would seek to provide these workers with a designated seat and operating seatbelt.  This legislation would also address the issue of converted vehicles. The bill would direct the Department of Transportation to develop interim seat and seatbelt safety standards for vehicles that have been converted for the purpose of transporting migrant workers. Owners and operators of these vehicles would have 7 years to make the necessary improvements so that their vehicles would meet the same safety standards as new vehicles.  I hope my colleagues will join me in standing up for the safety of our Nation's migrant workforce.  Mr. President, I request that the text of this legislation appear immediately following this statement in the Congressional Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3702       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Farm and Forestry Worker      Transportation Safety Act''.     SEC. 2.

(a) Seats.--Except as provided in subsection (d), in      promulgating vehicle safety standards under the Migrant and      Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act (29 U.S.C. 1801      et seq.) for the transportation of migrant and seasonal      agricultural workers by farm labor contractors, agricultural      employers or agricultural associations, the Secretary of      Labor shall ensure that each occupant or rider in, or on, any      vehicle subject to such standards is provided with a seat      that is a designated seating position (as such term is      defined for purposes of the Federal motor vehicle safety      standards issued under chapter 301 of title 49, United States      Code).       (b) Seat Belts.--Each seating position required under      subsection (a) shall be equipped with an operational seat      belt, except that this subsection shall not apply with      respect to seating positions in buses that would otherwise      not be required to have seat belts under the Federal motor      vehicle safety standards.       (c) Performance Requirements.--       (1) In general.--Not later than 6 months after the date of      enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Transportation, in      consultation with the Secretary of Labor, shall issue minimum      performance requirements for the strength of seats and the      attachment of seats and seat belts in vehicles that are      converted, after being sold for purposes other than resale,      for the purpose of transporting migrant or seasonal      agricultural workers. The requirements shall provide a level      of safety that is as close as practicable to the level of      safety provided for in a vehicle that is manufactured or      altered for the purpose of transporting such workers before      being sold for purposes other than resale.       (2) Expiration.--Effective on the date that is 7 years      after the date of enactment of this Act, any vehicle that is      or has been converted for the purpose of transporting migrant      or seasonal agricultural workers shall provide the same level      of safety as a vehicle that is manufactured or altered for      such purpose prior to being sold for purposes other than      resale.       (d) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be      construed to alter or modify the regulations contained in      section 500.103, or the provision pertaining to      transportation that is primarily on private roads in section      500.104(l), of title 29, Code of Federal Regulations, as in      effect on the date of enactment of this Act.       (e) Definitions.--The definitions contained in section 3 of      the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act      (29 U.S.C. 1802) shall apply to this section.
