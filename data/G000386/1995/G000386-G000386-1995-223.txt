 President, I have asked to speak at length on this conference agreement to raise some serious reservations about the funding levels it contains for defense. I appreciate Chairman Domenici's cooperation in allowing me this time.  I would like to say first that I will vote for this conference report. I spoke at length earlier today about the positive aspects of this budget, and why it's needed for this country's future. Whatever reservations I have about the defense numbers, they are secondary to the main priority--which is a credible, balanced budget.  To me, the explosion of debt sanctioned by Congress over the last three decades is unconscionable. It has become a moral issue with me. We are mortgaging our children's future by failing to act responsibly now. It has to stop. The goal of this conference agreement is, in fact, to restore responsibility to our fiscal policy. And that's why I support the conference agreement despite my opposition to the defense budget levels.  Let me also say that I strongly supported the Senate budget, including the defense numbers. To me, the Senate's version of the budget we passed in May was the most credible budget passed by this body that I have voted for. There was no smoke and mirrors. Just sound, tough choices. And as I have done before on this floor, including today, I want to once again commend Chairman Domenici for his outstanding leadership in crafting that budget.  Having provided that context, Mr. President, I would like now to address the defense issue.  The conference report pumps $40 billion into the defense budget over the next 7 years. There are two justifications given. First, the defense budget is ``underfunded.'' Second, we need more money for weapons so we can have more money for readiness.  Neither argument has credibility, in my view.  The defense debate is often dominated by fancy buzz words and phrases. Two examples are: First, the defense budget is ``underfunded''; and second, we cannot sacrifice ``future readiness'' for current readiness. These are the phrases being used. But what do they mean?  What I plan to do is explain these arguments in terms the taxpayers can understand. That way, they can see how they are getting ripped off.  First, the underfunding argument. This argument cites a gap between the level of funding for programs in the defense budget, versus the realistic cost of those same programs when the bills come due. It says more money is needed to fund everything that's in the defense budget.  This argument is bogus. The fact of the matter is, more money would not be needed if the defense managers were to manage their programs properly. The funding gap cited in the conference agreement is future cost overruns that happen historically because defense managers are not doing their jobs.  The defense budget is not underfunded; it is overprogrammed. The cost of what is in the budget is deliberately underestimated. That way, the bureaucrats can squeeze more programs in. It is a bait-and-switch game that would make the best of the con artists green with envy.  Once they get all the programs stuffed in by underestimating their cost, they turn around and say: ``Gosh, we need more money to pay for everything we just crammed in there.''  If it were not for the conscious game of deliberately underestimating costs to shoehorn more programs into the budget, the term ``underfunding'' might be legitimate. But that is not the case. The fact that it is a deliberate scheme to game the system is why it is really a case of overprogramming, not underfunding.  For example, when Republicans accuse President Clinton of using rosy economics to balance the budget--therefore, claiming his budget really is not balanced--we are accusing him of not making the tough choices. By assuming a rosier revenue stream, he is trying to fit more programs into the Federal budget, and make fewer cuts. It is poor management and leadership. It will lead to higher deficits. In his case, our accusations are justified.  It is the same with the defense budget. That is why I call the defense budget a ``blivet''--5 pounds of manure in a 4-pound sack. The question is, after they pull this bait-and-switch routine, do we give them a bigger sack, or do we ask them to manage their manure better?.  Interestingly, Mr. President, I used this argument to successfully freeze the defense budget in 1985--during the height of the Soviet threat. If the argument was successful then for spending less money, why would we use it now to argue for more money, especially when the threat is gone?  Simply put, those who are using the argument now to justify more spending do not understand the issue.  The Defense Department has a history of playing the overprogramming game. I first uncovered it in 1983, and used analysis of that problem to show how more money was making the funding gap worse. The answer was not more money, but rather better management. Using that argument, we froze defense spending in 1985, and it has been plateaued ever since.  The overprogramming gap was bad back in 1983, and it hasn't gotten any better. The data confirm this. The conference report language acknowledges that the problem is still with us. But what the report does not do is present a logical case for why an argument that once was used to justify less spending and better management, is now used to justify more spending in place of better management.  If my colleagues were to respond correctly to this problem, we would say better management must substitute for more money. That means taking away a pound of manure, rather than getting a bigger sack. Better yet, preventing the excess manure in the first place is what we want. That is proper management. If all we do is keep getting a bigger sack, we're rewarding bad management.  It is a game. It is a game mastered by crafty bureaucrats to extort taxpayer money out of Congress. In reality, by doing what is argued for in this conference agreement, we would be covering the cost overruns that will result from putting in more money.  You see, the cost overruns have not occurred yet. They will occur each of the next 7 years, if business is conducted as usual. Putting $40 billion more in the defense budget guarantees that business will be as usual. And we will get $40 billion of cost overruns as a result.  Now, let me address the second argument used by the conferees. It is really just another symptom of the problem I just described.  The second argument goes like this: More money lessens the need for Pentagon decisionmakers to sacrifice future readiness to meet current readiness requirements.  ``Current readiness'' means spare parts, fuel, and training. ``Future readiness'' means procurement. This argument simply means that DOD managers do not want to have to manage and prioritize. As cost overruns due to bad management occur in each of the next 7 years in weapons accounts, the managers don't want to have to rob the readiness accounts to pay for the weapons. That is what they used to do. But that would hollow out the force. Instead, this time they want more procurement money to cover the cost overruns.  When you hear the cry for more money for things like ``procurement'' or ``modernization'' or ``future readiness needs''--all of which are fancy buzz words--those are euphemisms for putting in more money to cover cost overruns. It says, ``We are not going to manage better. We have run the defense budget this way for decades, and we're not going to change now.''  That is the attitude that troubles me, Mr. President. What troubles me even more is that the new Republican Congress is willing to tolerate it. We are treating it as a sacred cow. Worse. We are treating it as a sacred fatted cow.  Why is it that Members on my side of the aisle send their management principles on a vacation whenever the defense budget is mentioned? We scrutinize every other program for better performance. But when it comes to the defense budget, it is a jobs jamboree. A pork paradise.  It is hypocritical. It undermines our credibility as a party. We are not willing to tolerate business-as-usual in any corner of the Federal Government, except for defense. On defense, we worship at the altar of the sacred fatted cow.  I want to make it clear, Mr. President, that my colleagues in the Senate did not have this attitude, for the most part. It was mainly those of the other body. During the conference, we met with our counterparts in a very important defense discussion. Afterward, we reached a compromise on the defense numbers.  I do not intend to mention names. But I would like to relay a couple points that were made by House leaders in defense of pumping up the defense budget.  The first argument was the pork argument. At the time of the defense meeting of conferees, the relevant House committee had already completed work on this year's defense bill. If the conferees did not pump up the numbers, it would mean going back to Members of Congress and saying we would have to go back on our promise to fund this project or that program.  Now, when a Member of Congress is faced with a choice like that, guess what he or she will do? The choice is, go along with the pumped-up defense numbers, or we'll cancel this project in your district. And that'll mean jobs.  What kind of national security strategy is this, Mr. President?  Everyone knows, the defense budget is justified by a national security strategy. We've all heard of the two-war strategy. The defense budget is built on a strategy of fighting and winning two near-simultaneous wars in different parts of the globe.  Now, I am not so naive to think there's any real tight connection between a national strategy and our defense budget. But at least our defense community usually goes along with the gag. They pay lip service to the connection, even though we all know the defense budget is as much a big pork factory as it is a generator of fighting capabilities. If we did not pay lip service, there would be no justification for budget increases, and hence no credibility.  In this case--in my discussion in that defense meeting--there was not even lip service. It was unadulterated realpolitik. The justification for more defense spending was more pork ad more jobs. Period.  The other comment that was made was the recognition that a national security strategy is no longer the basis of our defense budget, since the cold war is over. So what, I asked, is the justification for the present budget, let alone vast new increases. The answer I got was that more defense spending is needed because the United States must police the world. And we are the only ones who can do it.  My question is, how in the world can that justify the spending levels in this agreement? If anything, it undermines it. This defense budget is still based on an obsolete, cold war strategy. We are still buying cold war relics. Before this conference agreement, we were on a path toward a post-cold war budget. But with this influx of money, we are now returning to the cold war budget in a post-cold war era.  If we are now going to be policemen of the world, why are we still buying things that were specifically designed to counter the Soviet threat, not to police the world? We are still buying Seawolfs and B-2's and F-22's and Comanche helicopters, and the like. If we are supposed to now police the world, why are we buying these? The fact is, this argument does not justify these larger defense numbers.  Another argument is that the defense budget is not going up, we are simply trying to freeze it, and keep it from going down. But this is not a credible argument. And it never has been. The defense budget is based on a national strategy, at least supposedly. If the budget declines, which would be consistent with the disappearance of the Soviet threat, what is the problem? There should not be a problem--unless, that is, we view it as a port factory with jobs attached.  Mr. President, there is no logical basis for the defense numbers in this conference agreement. The arguments are bogus, and they reflect a lack of serious, credible justification.  As I mentioned earlier, I support the conference agreement because I believe it will lead to a legitimate balanced budget in 2002. And I am willing to accept the defense compromise if that's what it takes to get an overall agreement.  But I am taking this opportunity to warn my Republican colleagues not to repeat the mistakes we made in the 1980's with the defense budget. In the 1980's, our goal was not a defense build-up. It was a defense budget build-up. We ended up buying much less with much more than we got and spent under the Carter administration. That's because we substituted more money for better management. We lost credibility as a party because of it.  As the party that now controls Congress for the first time in 40 years, we are right back where we were in 1981. Our defense policy, as reflected in this conference agreement, is to once again build up the defense budget, not defense. It is to, once again, create jobs, not a lean fighting machine.  I have been given assurances by Members of the other body that defense reforms are forthcoming. After concentrating this year on health care reform, the top reform priority of the other body next year will be major defense reform.  By inference, my colleagues are admitting that they will tolerate business-as-usual with the Defense Department--at least for 1 more year. I am here to warn my colleagues that 1 year is all they will get. One year to conclude that better management will win out over more money, as a solution.  Because if there is not a change next year to doing business-as-usual in defense, then I will expend everything in mu arsenal to bring sanity to our defense policy. Just like I did from 1983 to 1985, when I ended the irrational defense budget buildup under President Reagan. It was my amendment on this very floor on May 2, 1985, by a vote of 50-49 that ended the insanity back then. And I will do it again.  Even if it takes me 2 full years to do it, like it did back then. And I will win. Because it is not right to have a double standard--one for defense, and one for the rest of Government. All that will do is hurt the credibility of our party. And I do not want that. Because in my view, our party is the only one that can restore hope and opportunity for the next generation.                          ____________________
