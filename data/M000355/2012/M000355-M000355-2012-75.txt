  I am surprised they announced no more votes a little while ago. We are prepared to finish business today. In fact, I intend to offer shortly the unanimous consent agreement that the majority leader himself was shopping last night. Our side of the aisle is prepared to finish up the business for this particular preelection session.  I ask unanimous consent that at 5 p.m. today, the Senate proceed to the consideration of S. 3576, Senator Paul's bill regarding foreign aid; that there be up to 2 hours of debate, equally divided between Senators Paul and Kerry or their designees; that upon the use or yielding back of that time, the Senate proceed to vote on passage of the bill; that the vote on passage be subject to a 60-vote affirmative threshold; that if the bill does not achieve 60 affirmative votes, it be considered as having been read twice, placed on the calendar; that following the vote on passage of that legislation, S. 3576, the Senate proceed to consideration of Calendar No. 418, S.J. Res. 41; that there be up to 60 minutes of debate, equally divided between Senators Graham and Senator Paul or their designees; that upon the use or yielding back of that time, the Senate proceed to vote on passage of the joint resolution; that if the joint resolution is not passed, it be returned to the calendar; that following the vote on the joint resolution, the Senate resume consideration of H.J. Res. 117, the continuing resolution; that the motion to proceed be agreed to, there be up to 30 minutes of debate, equally divided between thetwo leaders or their designees, with Senator Coburn controlling 15 minutes of the Republican time, prior to a vote on passage of the joint resolution; that the vote on passage be subject to a 60-vote affirmative threshold; that following the vote, the majority leader be recognized; and, finally, that no amendments, motions or points of order be in order during the consideration of these measures.
