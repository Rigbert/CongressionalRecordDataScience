President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee-reported amendment be agreed to and be considered original text for the purposes of further amendment; that the Klobuchar-Johnson of Wisconsin-Franken amendment, which is at the desk, be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read a third time and passed, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate, and any statements related to the bill be printed in the Record.
