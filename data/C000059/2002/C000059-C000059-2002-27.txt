Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication to the community and to the overall well-being of Norco, CA, is exceptional. The city of Norco has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated business and community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give time and talent to making their communities a better place to live and work. Mrs. Velma Hickey is one of these individuals.  On January 26, 2002, Mrs. Hickey will be honored as the outgoing 2001 president of the Norco Chamber of Commerce. Through the years, Velma has served as a director on the Board of the Chamber, the Virginia Weidman Home Arts Competition Chairman, Installation Banquet Chair and most recently the Norco Fair Chairman in 2001. She is an active member of the Republican Women's Club, United We Stand America organization, and the vice president of the Norco Historic Society.  Velma Hickey's leadership has led to numerous awards and recognitions. The highlights include: Volunteer of the Year Award from United We Stand America in 1990 and Principal for a Day received from the Corona/Norco Unified School District in 2001, and Lecturer at St. Mel's Catholic Church in Norco from 1987 thru 1990. A graduate of UC Irvine, Velma has a Bachelor of Science degree in Sociology.  Velma's tireless, engaged action has propelled the city of Norco forward in a positive and progressive manner. I know that all of Norco is grateful for her contribution to the betterment of the community and salute her as she departs. I look forward to continuing to work with her for the good of our community in the future.                          ____________________
