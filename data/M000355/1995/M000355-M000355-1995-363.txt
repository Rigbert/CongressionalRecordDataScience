 The relevant part provides that defendants       Are not required to warn with respect to products, or      ingredients in them, which are only dangerous, or potentially      so, when consumed in excessive quantity, or over a long      period of time, when the danger, or potentiality of danger,      is generally known and recognized. Again the dangers of      alcoholic beverages, are an example, as are also those foods      containing such substances as saturated fats, which may over      a period of time have a deleterious effect upon the human      heart.  I thank my colleague for responding to my inquiries.
