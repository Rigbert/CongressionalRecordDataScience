President, in every community there is someone who has changed the direction of events, who has shaped the future of its residents. Burlington, VT has John Davis. This month John is saying goodbye to the City of Burlington's Community and Economic Development Office CEDO where he has spent the last 10 years making Burlington a better place to live and work. As Housing Director for most of that period John has worked to make affordable housing a reality for countless low and moderate income people living in Vermont's most expensive housing market. Since 1994 John has also been the driving force behind the effort to revitalize Burlington's Old North End through its designation as Vermont's only Enterprise Community.  When President Clinton first announced the Empowerment Zone and Enterprise Community Initiative, John was quick to see the opportunity to turn around the decline of Burlington's Old North End. There was no shortage of roadblocks on that long road to winning the designation of Enterprise Community. I think that only John's unique mix of grass-roots organizing skills, MIT professor's intelligence, and every day Vermonter common sense could have brought together all of the disparate groups involved to develop a plan for building a ``New'' North End where the ``Old" one stood before.  There was little doubt in my mind that the project, under John's leadership, would succeed when I walked with HUD Secretary Cisneros down Archibald Street in the fall of 1994. Already there were signs of the changes to come, in particular the block long mural depicting neighborhood residents supporting the initiative, a mural John's family and many area residents worked on. One year later Secretary Cisneros walked down a very different Archibald Street in a very different neighborhood and pronounced Burlington's ``New'' North End the most advanced Enterprise Community he had visited.  In December of 1994 when I was honored to announce that the Old North End in Burlington had been selected as an ``Enterprise Community'', John Davis was quick to attribute that success to the people of the Old North End saying ``The reason we won was not because of the problems. . . We won because of our assets.'' Well, John was most definitely one of those assets, as was the community enthusiasm, cooperative spirit, and sense of hope he helped to bring out in a part of the city that many had written off. That renewed spirit has continued to grow and will sustain the renewal of the New North End when John has moved on.  I wish John the best of luck in whatever challenge he takes on next. I know his wife Bonnie Acker and his daughter Dia are looking forward to seeing more of him in the weeks ahead, but he will certainly be missed by those of us (and there are many) who have been lucky enough to work with John during his 10 years of service to the city and people of Burlington, VT.                          ____________________
