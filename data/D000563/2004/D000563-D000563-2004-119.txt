President, this week we mark two significant dates. Tomorrow, September 11, the third anniversary of our attack which will truly live in infamy as the attack on Pearl Harbor. It is a moment when we reflect on what has happened to America since that time.  A member of the diplomatic corps once asked me: Did Osama bin Laden win that battle? The answer, clearly, is no. But did he change America? The answer, clearly, is yes.  We are debating in the Senate a bill for billions of dollars to be spent in defense of America, which we might not have even considered 3 years ago. Now it is reality.  In a few moments I will leave to go to National Airport. Before I board my flight back to Illinois, I will take off my shoes and my belt and my watch and I will hold my arms out to be ``wanded,'' to make certain that I am safe enough to go on the airplane. America has truly changed.  But our values have not changed. Ted Sorensen may be one of the greatest speech writers in the history of our Nation. On May 21 he delivered a commencement address at the New School University of New York where a friend and former colleague, Bob Kerry, is president.  I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Sorensen's commencement address be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:Commencement Address of Theodore C. Sorensen Upon Receiving an Honorary             Doctor of Laws Degree From New School University                             A Time to Weep       As a Nebraska emigre, I am proud to be made an Honorary      Doctor of Laws by another Nebraska emigre, President Kerrey .      . . at an institution founded by still another, Alvin      Johnson.       Considering the unhealthy state of our laws today, they      probably could use another doctor.       My reciprocal obligation is to make a speech.       This is not a speech. Two weeks ago I set aside the speech      I prepared. This is a cry from the heart, a lamentation for      the loss of this country's goodness and therefore its      greatness.       Future historians studying the decline and fall of America      will mark this as the time the tide began to turn--toward a      mean-spirited mediocrity in place of a noble beacon.       For me the final blow was American guards laughing over the      naked, helpless bodies of abused prisoners in Iraq. ``There      is a time to laugh,'' the Bible tells us, ``and a time to      weep.'' Today I weep for the country I love, the country I      proudly served, the country to which my four grandparents      sailed over a century ago with hopes for a new land of peace      and freedom. I cannot remain silent when that country is in      the deepest trouble of my lifetime.       I am not talking only about the prison abuse scandal--that      stench will someday subside. Nor am I referring only to the      Iraq war--that too will pass--nor to any one political leader      or party. This is no time for politics as usual, in which no      one responsible admits responsibility, no one genuinely      apologizes, no one resigns and everyone else is blamed.       The damage done to this country by its own misconduct in      the last few months and years, to its very heart and soul, is      far greater and longer lasting than any damage that any      terrorist could possibly inflict upon us.       The stain on our credibility, our reputation for decency      and integrity, will not quickly wash away.       Last week, a family friend of an accused American guard in      Iraq recited the atrocities inflicted by our enemies on      Americans, and asked: ``Must we be held to a different      standard?'' My answer is YES. Not only because others expect      it. WE must hold ourselves to a different standard. Not only      because God demands it, but because it serves our security.       Our greatest strength has long been not merely our military      might but our moral authority. Our surest protection against      assault from abroad has been not all our guards, gates and      guns or even our two oceans, but our essential goodness as a      people. Our richest asset has been not our material wealth      but our values.       We were world leaders once--helping found the United      Nations, the Marshall Plan, NATO, and programs like Food for      Peace, international human rights and international      environmental standards. The world admired not only the      bravery of our Marine Corps but also the idealism of our      Peace Corps.       Our word was as good as our gold. At the start of the Cuban      Missile Crisis, former Secretary of State Dean Acheson,      President Kennedy's special envoy to brief French President      de Gaulle, offered to document our case by having the actual      pictures of Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba brought in.      ``No,'' shrugged the usually difficult de Gaulle: ``The word      of the President of the United States is good enough for      me.''       Eight months later, President Kennedy could say at American      University: ``The world knows that America will never start a      war. This generation of Americans has had enough of war and      hate . . . we want to build a world of peace where the weak      are secure and the strong are just.''       Our founding fathers believed this country could be a      beacon of light to the world, a model of democratic and      humanitarian progress. We were. We prevailed in the Cold War      because we inspired millions struggling for freedom in far      corners of the Soviet empire. I have been in countries where      children and avenues were named for Lincoln, Jefferson,      Franklin Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy. We were respected,      not reviled, because we respected man's aspirations for peace      and justice. This was the country to which foreign leaders      sent not only their goods to be sold but their sons and      daughters to be educated. In the 1930s, when Jewish and other      scholars were driven out of Europe, their preferred      destination--even for those on the far left--was not the      Communist citadel in Moscow but the New School here in New      York.       What has happened to our country? We have been in wars      before, without resorting to sexual humiliation as torture,      without blocking the Red Cross, without insulting and      deceiving our allies and the U.N., without betraying our      traditional values, without imitating our adversaries,      without blackening our name around the world.       Last year when asked on short notice to speak to a European      audience, and inquiring what topic I should address, the      Chairman said: ``Tell us about the good America, the America      when Kennedy was in the White House.'' ``It is still a good      America,'' I replied. ``The American people still believe in      peace, human rights and justice; they are still a generous,      fair-minded, open-minded people.''       Today some political figures argue that merely to report,      much less to protest, the crimes against humanity committed      by a few of our own inadequately trained forces in the fog of      war, is to aid the enemy or excuse its atrocities. But      Americans know that such self-censorship does not enhance our      security. Attempts to justify or defend our illegal acts as      nothing more than pranks or no worse than the crimes of our      enemies, only further muddies our moral image. 30 years ago,      America's war in Vietnam became a hopeless military quagmire;      today our war in Iraq has become a senseless moral swamp.       No military victory can endure unless the victor occupies      the high moral ground. Surely America, the land of the free,      could not lose the high moral ground invading Iraq, a country      ruled by terror, torture and tyranny--but we did.       Instead of isolating Saddam Hussein--politically,      economically, diplomatically, much as we succeeded in      isolating Khadafy, Marcos, Mobutu and a host of other      dictators over the years, we have isolated ourselves. We are      increasingly alone in a dangerous world in which millions who      once respected us now hate us.       Not only Muslims. Every international survey shows our      global standing at an all-time low. Even our transatlantic      alliance has not yet recovered from its worst crisis in      history. Our friends in Western Europe were willing to accept      Uncle Sam as class president, but not as class bully, once he      forgot JFK's advice that ``Civility is not a sign of      weakness.''       All this is rationalized as part of the war on terror. But      abusing prisoners in Iraq, denying detainees their legal      rights in Guantanamo, even American citizens, misleading the      world at large about Saddam's ready stockpiles of mass      destruction and involvement with al Qaeda at 9/11, did not      advance by one millimeter our efforts to end the threat of      another terrorist attack upon us. On the contrary, our      conduct invites and incites new attacks and new recruits to      attack us.       The decline in our reputation adds to the decline in our      security. We keep losing old friends and making new enemies--     not a formula for success. We have not yet rounded up Osama      bin Laden or most of the al Qaeda and Taliban leaders or the      anthrax mailer. ``The world is large,'' wrote John Boyle      O'Reilly, in one of President Kennedy's favorite poems,      ``when its weary leagues two loving hearts divide, but the      world is small when your enemy is loose on the other side.''      Today our enemies are still loose on the other side of the      world, and we are still vulnerable to attack.       True, we have not lost either war we chose or lost too much      of our wealth. But we have lost something worse--our good      name for truth and justice. To paraphrase Shakespeare: ``He      who steals our nation's purse, steals trash. 'Twas ours, 'tis      his, and has been slave to thousands. But he that filches our      good name . . . makes us poor indeed.''       No American wants us to lose a war. Among our enemies are      those who, if they could, would fundamentally change our way      of life, restricting our freedom of religion by exalting one      faith over others, ignoring international law and the      opinions of mankind; and trampling on the rights of those who      are different, deprived or disliked. To the extent that our      nation voluntarily trods those same paths in the name of      security, the terrorists win and we are the losers.       We are no longer the world's leaders on matters of      international law and peace. After we stopped listening to      others, they     stopped listening to us. A nation without credibility and      moral authority cannot lead, because no one will follow.       Paradoxically, the charges against us in the court of world      opinion are contradictory. We are deemed by many to be      dangerously aggressive, a threat to world peace. You may      regard that as ridiculously unwarranted, no matter how often      international surveys show that attitude to be spreading. But      remember the old axiom: ``No matter how good you feel, if      four friends tell you you're drunk, you better lie down.''       Yet we are also charged not so much with intervention as      indifference--indifference toward the suffering of millions      of our fellow inhabitants of this planet who do not enjoy the      freedom, the opportunity, the health and wealth and security      that we enjoy; indifference to the countless deaths of      children and other civilians in unnecessary wars, countless      because we usually do not bother to count them; indifference      to the centuries of humiliation endured previously in silence      by the Arab and Islamic worlds.       The good news, to relieve all this gloom, is that a      democracy is inherently self-correcting. Here, the people are      sovereign. Inept political leaders can be replaced. Foolish      policies can be changed. Disastrous mistakes can be reversed.       When, in 1941, the Japanese Air Force was able to inflict      widespread death and destruction on our naval and air forces      in Hawaii because they were not on alert, those military      officials most responsible for ignoring advance intelligence      were summarily dismissed.       When, in the late 1940s, we faced a global Cold War against      another system of ideological fanatics certain that their      authoritarian values would eventually rule the world, we      prevailed in time. We prevailed because we exercised patience      as well as vigilance, self-restraint as well as self-defense,      and reached out to moderates and modernists, to democrats and      dissidents, within that closed system. We can do that again.      We can reach out to moderates and modernists in Islam, proud      of its long traditions of dialogue, learning, charity and      peace.       Some among us scoff that the war on Jihadist terror is a      war between civilization and chaos. But they forget that      there were Islamic universities and observatories long before      we had railroads.       So do not despair. In this country, the people are      sovereign. If we can but tear the blindfold of self-deception      from our eyes and loosen the gag of self-denial from our      voices, we can restore our country to greatness. In      particular, you--the Class of 2004--have the wisdom and      energy to do it. Start soon.       In the words of the ancient Hebrews:       The day is short, and the work is great, and the laborers      are sluggish, but the reward is much, and the Master is      urgent.
