 President, I rise to pay tribute to a loyal friend and trusted advisor who left my staff in late August. Caran Kolbe McKee came to work for me 14 years ago. She served the people of Iowa in a number of capacities in my office. In every case, Caran demonstrated remarkable leadership qualities, steadfastness of purpose, and the kind of problem-solvingability that can make our Government work for the people in the best way possible.  Caran came to the Senate in 1987, when she joined my staff as assistant press secretary. Two years later, she became my press secretary. During this time, she dealt with a range of important issues, including the Gulf War, Supreme Court nominations, whistle-blower protections, a farm bill, civil rights legislation, a campaign to apply labor and employment laws to Congress, and the budget battle of 1990. She made certain that Iowans had access to accurate and timely information through the news media and fostered a better understanding of the way in which the issues addressed by Congress affect the lives of individuals and families.  In 1994, Caran took on new challenges as a special assistant. She developed initiatives and reached out to the grassroots. Caran brought to her work a great appreciation for the people who make Iowa the extraordinary place that it is. She grew up on a farm in Western Iowa, graduated from Iowa State University, and maintains many close family ties in Iowa.  Caran is the kind of person who is always looking ahead and making a plan to improve things for others no matter what their stage and place in life. Just last week, President Bush signed into law legislation re-authorizing the Drug Free Communities Act, a bill I sponsored in the Senate. During his remarks, the President took time to recognize a coalition I launched in Iowa to address our state's growing drug problem. Called ``Face It Together''--or FIT--it is the first-ever community-based, statewide anti-drug coalition. The goal is to help Iowans work together to keep their neighborhoods, schools, workplaces and communities drug-free. I hope to see this productive effort continue in the years ahead. No individual deserves more credit for making FIT a reality and a success than Caran Kolbe McKee. Her vision for the project, gift for bringing people together and dedication to making the program happen were vitally important.  In recent years, Caran also managed my correspondence with Iowans. In the Senate, I work hard to made the process of representative government work. I keep in close touch with Iowans by returning home when the Senate is not in session. And since 1981, I have conducted a meeting in each of Iowa's 99 counties at least one time every year. I am committed to an active dialogue with constituents, so at town meetings I always say representative government is a two-way street. While I have come to them for a meeting about the issues, they also have a responsibility to write to me expressing concerns and views and asking questions. Well, each and every one of these letters or e-mail messages deserves and receives as answer from me. Caran made sure that Iowans who wrote or called received a reply that was not just a piece of paper but a substantive, informative response. In this way, she helped representative government work for the people in a fundamental, meaningful way.  Caran Kolbe McKee was a true public servant. She was a mentor to many of her fellow staff members. And she was an inspiration for the way she handled challenges--both professional and personal--with compassion, strength and courage. Now Caran has decided to spend more time with her family. She will be greatly missed, but I admire her decision and wish her the very best. Above all, I extend to her my deepest thanks.                          ____________________
