Speaker, I rise today in tribute, to the millions of men and women who have served this Nation in its Armed Forces. Call it by any name you wish, Remembrance Day, Decoration Day, Memorial Day. It is a time when this country recounts the price for the liberty and freedom it enjoys today. That cost was paid for in the numerous lives and countless sacrifices given to it, by the servicemen and women of this country. The courage and devotion they expressed are the finest example by which all Americans must measure themselves. It is their sense of responsibility and duty that has tied them to all the generations of Americans, past and present, who have answered their country's call to service.  Who are these extraordinary people who have made such a difference in our lives? they are not the sons and daughters of kings or emperors but the hard working farm boys of the heartland, who sat in the muddy trenches of Europe in World War I. They are the former store clerks and factory workers who withstood the crushing siege of Bastogne in World War II. They are the courageous men and women who fought to stem the tide of communism along the 38th parallel in Korea. They are the devoted servicemen and women who fought in the steamy jungles and rice paddies of Vietnam. In our own decade they have been our own sons and daughters and in some circumstances our grandchildren who marched off to the desert to liberate the country of Kuwait.  How does one thank these men and women who have suffered so much that many could live in freedom? Mr. Speaker the debt of gratitude we owe is immeasurable. These men and women, whose deeds and stories are countless, are the reason why this country has been able to remain a shining example of freedom and democracy for the world. To merely say thank you is not enough. This country's continued support for its veterans must be a priority. The words of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Jesse Brown, ring strongly: ``I believe a Nation is judged by the way it treats its Veterans.'' It is this thought that we must bear in mind when issues arise in the Congress that may impact the veterans of this country.  To ignore these issues is to do our veterans and their families a great disservice. Their sacrifice and commitment must be equally reflected in our effort to pay a debt that can never be monetarily repaid. Mr. Speaker, what price can you put on the life of a citizen who is willing to pay the ultimate sacrifice for his or her country in a time of war or national peril?  It is fitting that on this occasion we reaffirm our support and gratitude to this special group of Americans whose devotion to duty was expressed in the highest manner. By their willingness to lay down their life for this Nation, they have assured the security and future for generation of Americans to come.  Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure and honor to express my deep and heartfelt gratitude for the service of America's veterans. Call this day by what ever name you choose, it is a memorial to all the generations of men and women who have served this Nation and upheld its finest traditions of liberty and democracy. God bless our veterans.                          ____________________
