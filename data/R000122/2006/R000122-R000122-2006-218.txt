President, my amendment is straightforward. It would increase funding for the LIHEAP program, the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, by $3.318 billion. It is paid for fully by the closing of corporate tax loopholes and is cosponsored by Senators Kennedy, Kerry, Clinton, Lieberman, Rockefeller, Dorgan, Levin, Dayton, Schumer, Kohl, Bayh, Johnson, Leahy, Menendez, and Harkin.
