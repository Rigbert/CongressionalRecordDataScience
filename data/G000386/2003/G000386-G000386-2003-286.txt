 The amendment has two parts. First, it would permit the Secretary, starting in 2009, to designate an alternative payment system for PPOs in a limited number of regions that the Secretary has determined to be highly competitive. This alternate payment system would permit the Secretary to set the Federal contribution for participation plans solely based on the bids they submit to the Secretary. The Secretary would still be required to choose the three plans with the lowest credible bids to participate. The Federal contribution would be set for the three plans participating by the second lowest bid submitted.  The second thing the amendment would do is authorize the Secretary, also starting in 2009, to establish a number of projects in the fee-for-service Medicare Program. These projects would be designed to provide enhanced services or benefits to improve the quality of care provided to Medicare beneficiaries, to improve the health care delivery system under the Medicare Program, and lower expenditures in that program. The enhanced services or benefits would include preventive services, chronic care coordination, disease management services, or other services the Secretary determines will advance the purposes of these projects.  The total cost of this amendment would be $12 billion starting in the year 2009 and would be equally divided between the alternative payment system and the fee-for-service projects.  Mr. President, this amendment represents a very reasonable compromise on the question of how to introduce into the Medicare Advantage Program a more competitive payment system.  I thank everyone, and most especially Senator Baucus, for working so hard and in a cooperative spirit to develop this amendment now before the Senate.  I yield the floor.
