The other conference report, there are many others, but one that we are very interested in is the labor-health-education conference report. Does the leader have any insight as to when that might be considered on the floor?  Mr. DeLAY. If the gentleman would yield, we certainly want to try to get moving on this most important piece of legislation as soon as possible. Unfortunately, the other body has trampled on the constitutional prerogatives of the House in initiating tax provisions in their bill.  The bill that the other body has passed has been blue-slipped appropriately by the Committee on Ways and Means, and until this blue-slip issue is resolved, I just cannot give the gentleman any sort of prediction as to when we would appoint conferees.
