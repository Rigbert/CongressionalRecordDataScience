Specifically, page 611 constitutes legislation in an appropriations bill and is, therefore, in violation of clause 2 of Rule XXI of the House.  Let me just point out for the Members that section 611 provides that earmarks, limitations or minimum funding requirements contained in any other act shall not be applicable to funds appropriated under this act. This provision purports to render ineffective any earmark limitation or minimum funding requirements contained in any act. The effect of this provision is very, very far reaching.  For example, the Foreign Relations Authorizations Act, which was signed into law last year and which went through my committee, went through the full committee, and was on this floor for the better part of a week, and obviously went through the same process on the Senate side, and it has a number of minimum funding requirements with respect to programs that would be declared null and void.  So I would ask the Chair that this section be declared out of order.
