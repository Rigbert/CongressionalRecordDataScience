 President, I rise today to congratulate Bob Taylor on his accomplishments at the University of Louisville Business School and in the Louisville business community.  From the moment Bob took over the reigns at UofL's business school in 1984, good things started to happen. Bob is a man of vision and incredible instincts about what works in the business world. He brought those talents to UofL to improve the quality of the program and strengthen the students' capabilities in a real-life business environment. Bob succeeded at both of those goals and brought UofL's rankings among U.S. business schools up to an honorable level and continues to rise in national recognition.  Numerous academic achievements mark Bob's tenure at UofL, including Success magazine's recent naming of UofL as one of the best in the nation for training entrepreneurs. Also, the business school has begun offering master's level programs overseas and now offers varied advanced degrees.  Several personal achievements are evidence of Bob's knowledge of and influence in the business world. He became the president of the American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business last year, which serves as the accrediting body for business schools nationwide. Bob also serves the community on the board of directors for the Rawlings Company, Logan Aluminum Inc., the Louisville Police Administration Advisory Commission, and the Metro United Way.  Many of Bob's colleagues and members of the Louisville business community have noted his extraordinary leadership skills. Bob took on a huge responsibility when he came to UofL, and he continues to press on to reach higher goals for the school. For this, I commend Bob and thank him for his dedication to UofL. His hard work has paid off and students from across the state and even the nation are reaping the benefits of Bob's success. His experience in business and success at Louisville is a sign of more good things to come for the school and the great State of Kentucky.  Bob, on behalf of my colleagues and myself, thank you for your commitment to the students and faculty at UofL's College of Business and Public Administration. I have every confidence in your ability to lead the school to even greater heights with more accomplishments and successes in the years to come.  Mr. President, I also ask that an article which ran in the Louisville Courier-Journal on Sunday, March 19, 2000, appear in the Record following my remarks.          [From the Louisville Courier-Journal, Mar. 19, 2000]U of L Dean Doubles as Civic Leader--Low-Key Leader Guides a School and                               a Community                           (By David McGinty)       When he arrived in Louisville in 1984 to become dean of the      University of Louisville's business school, Robert Taylor did      not expect to hang around.       ``I was going to stay here three years and move on,'' he      recalled.       For perhaps one of the few times in his life, Taylor's      expectation for the future was faulty. At the time, he      thought his job would be fairly simple: To help a small      business school win accreditation.       Tayor did not foresee the complications and twists that      life would throw in his path, or where they would lead.       The business school now has master's-level programs in      three overseas locations, offers several advanced degrees and      is becoming known in academic circles.       In a recent U.S. News and World Report survey its      undergraduate programs ranked 93rd among more than 327      programs--not in the top ranks, but a big step up from the      bottom levels the program once inhabited.       Success magazine has ranked the school's program for      training entrepreneurs among the best in the nation. And last      year Taylor became president of the American Assembly of      Collegiate Schools of Business, the accrediting body for      business schools.       Apart from his academic accomplishments, Taylor may also be      one of the most influential civic figures you never hear of.       He serves on a number of boards, charities and advisory      bodies, including the boards of directors of the Rawlings Co.      and Logan Aluminum Inc. and the Louisville Police      Administration Advisory Commission. He is most proud, he      said, of his service on the board of Metro United Way--but      his greatest influence may be through less visible      activities.       Although his style is low-key and his name rarely surfaces      publicly, behind-the-scenes business and political leaders      have learned he is a prescient adviser, and they seek him      out. His contacts are widespread and so, although it is      subtle and anonymous, is his contribution to Louisville's      economic well-being.       ``You've got to put him among the top five'' civic leaders      whose contributions are not publicly known, said Bill      Samuels, president of Maker's Mark distillery.       Samuels, a longtime friend, said Taylor ``is as bright as      anybody I've ever met. . . . I've never had a dull      conversation with him, and I've had several thousand. In a      sense he's been a mentor to me.''       Former Louisville Mayor Jerry Abramson said that while he      was in office he often worked with Taylor, particularly in      urban workshops on visits to other cities to observe their      accomplishments. After a visit Taylor would lead group      discussions on what lessons could be learned, and he proved      to be an adroit moderator with a gift for shaping a plan of      action.       ``Whenever we needed someone who could think outside the      box and be a visionary and push the envelope a little bit, we      always looked to the dean,'' Abramson said.       ``There have been times when we worked on issues that I      wasn't ready for a public discussion on, that I would take      him into my confidence. He's a tremendous listener, and he      can frame a consensus out of disparate views.''       ``He's probably one of the biggest assets to the      community,'' said David Wilkins, chairman of Doe-Anderson      Advertising and Public Relations. ``He moves in and out of      virtually every circle and level of the community with ease.      He's trusted and respected by everybody.''       Wilkins' relationship with Taylor is a close one, with an      unusual twist. In 1994, in what Taylor said was a pivotal      moment for him, he took a six-month sabbatical to work at      Wilkins' agency and learn firsthand how the business world      works.       At the time, Taylor was winding up a decade of busy and      often frustrating activity. He took charge of the business      school just as it was entering an unforeseen period of      problems and change.       At Doe-Anderson, Taylor made an abrupt eye-opening      transition from academia to the business world. He quickly      learned ``that the environment business people were facing      was changing daily.''       ``Everything was getting much faster,'' Taylor said. ``The      turnaround time on work was faster, the demands were faster.      In order to be successful, they had to be completely      flexible.''       Taylor's own background is a mix of academic and military,      with no private business experience. A native of Pittsburgh,      he graduated from Allegheny College in 1961 with a U.S. Air      Force commission through the ROTC. Later he received advanced      business degrees from Ohio State University and Indiana      University.       He had a eight-year stint at the U.S. Air Force Academy in      Colorado, rising to head the Department of Economics,      Geography and Management. After retiring from the Air Force      in 1981 he joined the faculty of the University of Wisconsin-     Stevens Point, where he headed the division of business and      economics. From that job he came to U of L.       After his stint at Doe-Anderson, Taylor returned to U of L      convinced that the business school was not keeping up with      the world outside, so he set up teams of faculty to      reorganize the school.       ``I said, `Look, gang, we are not adapting quickly enough.      We've got to do something different so that we have the same      sense of urgency, the same flexibility that our students must      have if they're going to be successful in business.' ''       The response, Taylor acknowledged, was not overwhelming.      One faculty member said he'd left the business world because      ``I didn't want that kind of frenzy.''       And some of the results weren't successful. But such      stumbles are part of progress, Taylor believes, and the      school has made progress. When he came back from his      sabbatical, he set long-range goals for the school.       He wanted it to achieve national recognition for its public      administration programs. That recognition is coming, and the      school's overseas programs are gaining an international      reputation and alumni base.       He wanted the schools entrepreneurial program to start new,      student-run businesses. That effort is beginning to get off      the ground through a venture-capital fund, a      telecommunications research center intended to incubate new      businesses and the aid of former business executives on the      faculty.       He wanted the school's endowment to top $25 million. It has      topped $21 million and is growing.       In Louisville's business community the school's reputation      is increasingly solid, in no small part because of Taylor's      own credibility. Civic figures who have worked with him say      he has been a prescient advocate--sometimes the first--for      coming economic trends.       He was one of the first voices in the community to preach      the importance of new technology and the Internet.       Doug Cobb, who was until recently president of Greater      Louisville Inc., said Taylor ``is the original champion of      the idea that Louisville needs to be more entrepreneurial.''       Cobb, himself one of the city's foremost advocates of      entrepreneurial activity, said he feels like ``I walk in his      steps a little bit.''       To Taylor, this kind of trailblazing is part of the job.      ``I feel like my responsibility to this community is that we      have to be on the leading edge, and somebody has to be      telling people what is happening.''       It has not always been rewarding work, and by his own      account Taylor has not always been successful. In the early      1990s, he foresaw a coming shortage of workers in the      community and began urging measures to attract immigrants to      Louisville.       But when he proposed such steps to a committee planning      economic-development strategies for the community, the      reception was hostile. ``I'll never forget. A couple of      aldermen and other people just berated me, saying we've got      unemployed in this community we've got to help first.''       Without rancor, Taylor characterized that period as his      ``biggest failure'' to direct the community's attention to an      important issue.       Now, of course, employers are straining to find qualified      workers. Civic leaders are pondering how to ensure that the      community will have enough workers in the future to support      economic growth--and one of the strategies is to attract      immigrants.       ``I think if we had been prepared, we wouldn't have had the      pressure on our work force that we have today, and we could      be bringing in more people than we bring in now,'' he said.       That's an opportunity missed. Taylor now is pushing the      community's business leaders not to miss other opportunities      that he sees, particularly in rapidly evolving technologies.       Traditionally, Taylor said, Louisville has been content to      follow economic trends. That's got to stop, he said. ``I'm      saying the trends are occurring so quickly we can't afford a      time lag. We have to go and grab it.''       Taylor is already pushing his faculty to what he sees as      emerging possibilities for global education--a degree program      that involves courses in two countries, two universities, two      languages, two cultures.       ``That's my new vision,'' he said, and he admits that when      he espouses it ``some people are looking at me like I've gone      off the deep end.''       To his friends, that's just vintage Bob Taylor.       ``He's such an individualist,'' Samuels said. ``He enjoys      ideas that are in the unconventional vein. And I've got so      much respect for his judgment. I think he'd make a wonderful      CEO.''                          ____________________
