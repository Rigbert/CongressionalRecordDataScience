 Lieberman):  S. 886. A bill to reform the health care liability system and improve health care quality through the establishment of quality assurance programs, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.   THE HEALTH CARE LIABILITY REFORM AND QUALITY ASSURANCE ACT OF 1997  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Health Care Liability Reform and Quality Assurance Act of 1997. This is virtually the same legislation as S. 454 that I introduced in the last Congress with Senators Lieberman and Kassebaum. That bill was reported out of the Labor Committee and received the support of 53 Senators when it was added as an amendment to the product liability legislation. Ultimately, however, the amendment was withdrawn under the threat of a filibuster. I am very happy to, once again, be joining with Senator Lieberman in this effort.  Health care liability is one issue on which there has been some bipartisan consensus about the need to make significant changes. This bill which I am introducing today with the cosponsorship and assistance of Senator Lieberman represents this bipartisan effort.  The purpose of our bill is to promote patient safety, compensate those who suffer injuries fully and fairly, without enriching lawyers and bureaucrats, make health care more accessible, gain some cost containment in health care, strengthen the doctor-patient relationship and encourage medical innovation. Our present system, unfortunately, does none of the above.  First of all, patients don't get compensated. The Rand Corp. has reported that only 43 cents of every dollar spent in the liability system goes to the injured party. That means lawyers, experts, and court fees eat up a significant percentage of every dollar spent in the liability system.  Second, the prohibitive cost of liability insurance means some doctors won't provide care to those in our society who need it most. Half-a-million rural women can't get an obstetrician to deliver their babies. This problem, however, is not limited to rural areas. High malpractice premiums force doctors to avoid the practice of medicine in urban areas as well, making it more difficult for minority communities to get necessary care.  Third, companies that invent new products are discouraged under the current system from putting them on the market. Medical device manufacturers are finding it more difficult to get raw materials to produce life saving devices because of the risk of lawsuits.  Fourth, doctors are less likely to explore risky treatment because of the proliferation of lawsuits. A doctor has a better than 1 in 3 chance of being sued during his practice years. And the likelihood of suit has nothing to do with whether the doctor was negligent. The General Accounting Office reports that almost 60 percent of all suits are dismissed without a verdict or even a settlement.  So, something is very wrong with our liability system, and our bill will help solve the problem. I have included a summary of the bill's provisions, and I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill and the summary be printed in the Record.  Mr. President, I am hopeful that health care liability will get full consideration and action in this Congress. It is very important that we tackle this issue, and I look forward to prompt action.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 886       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

(a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:       (1) Effect on health care access and costs.--The civil      justice system of the United States is a costly and      inefficient mechanism for resolving claims of health care      liability and compensating injured patients and the problems      associated with the current system are having an adverse      impact on the availability of, and access to, health care      services and the cost of health care in the United States.       (2) Effect on interstate commerce.--The health care and      insurance industries are industries affecting interstate      commerce and the health care liability litigation systems      existing throughout the United States affect interstate      commerce by contributing to the high cost of health care and      premiums for health care liability insurance purchased by      participants in the health care system.       (3) Effect on federal spending.--The health care liability      litigation systems existing throughout the United States have      a significant effect on the amount, distribution, and use of      Federal funds because of--       (A) the large number of individuals who receive health care      benefits under programs operated or financed by the Federal      Government;       (B) the large number of individuals who benefit because of      the exclusion from Federal taxes of the amounts spent to      provide such individuals with health insurance benefits; and       (C) the large number of health care providers who provide      items or services for which the Federal Government makes      payments.       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to implement      reasonable, comprehensive, and effective health care      liability reform that is designed to--       (1) ensure that individuals with meritorious health care      injury claims receive fair and adequate compensation;       (2) improve the availability of health care service in      cases in which health care liability actions have been shown      to be a factor in the decreased availability of services; and       (3) improve the fairness and cost-effectiveness of the      current health care liability system of the United States to      resolve disputes over, and provide compensation for, health      care liability by reducing uncertainty and unpredictability      in the amount of compensation provided to injured      individuals.     SEC. 102. DEFINITIONS.       As used in this subtitle:       (1) Claimant.--The term ``claimant'' means any person who      commences a health care liability action, and any person on      whose behalf such an action is commenced, including the      decedent in the case of an action brought through or on      behalf of an estate.

(16) State.--The term ``State'' means each of the several      States of the United States, the District of Columbia, and      the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.     SEC. 103. APPLICABILITY.

(b) Preemption.--       (1) In general.--The provisions of this subtitle shall      preempt any State law existing on, or enacted subsequent to,      the date of enactment of this Act, only to the extent that      such law is inconsistent with the limitations contained in      such provisions and shall not preempt State law to the extent      that such law--       (A) places greater restrictions on the amount of or      standards for awarding noneconomic or punitive damages;       (B) places greater limitations on the awarding of attorneys      fees for awards in excess of $150,000;       (C) permits a lower threshold for the periodic payment of      future damages;       (D) establishes a shorter period during which a health care      liability action may be initiated or a more restrictive rule      with respect to the time at which the period of limitations      begins to run; or       (E) implements collateral source rule reform that either      permits the introduction of evidence of collateral source      benefits or provides for the mandatory offset of collateral      source benefits from damage awards.       (2) Rules of construction.--The provisions of this subtitle      shall not be construed to preempt any State law that--       (A) permits State officials to commence health care      liability actions as a representative of an individual;       (B) permits provider-based dispute resolution;       (C) places a maximum limit on the total damages in a health      care liability action;       (D) places a maximum limit on the time in which a health      care liability action may be initiated; or       (E) provides for defenses in addition to those contained in      this Act.       (c) Effect on Sovereign Immunity and Choice of Law or      Venue.--Nothing in this subtitle shall be construed to--       (1) waive or affect any defense of sovereign immunity      asserted by any State under any provision of law;       (2) waive or affect any defense of sovereign immunity      asserted by the United States;       (3) affect the applicability of any provision of the      Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976;       (4) preempt State choice-of-law rules with respect to      actions brought by a foreign nation or a citizen of a foreign      nation;       (5) affect the right of any court to transfer venue or to      apply the law of a foreign nation or to dismiss an action of      a foreign nation or of a citizen of a foreign nation on the      ground of inconvenient forum; or       (6) supersede any provision of Federal law.       (d) Federal Court Jurisdiction Not Established on Federal      Question Grounds.--Nothing in this subtitle shall be      construed to establish any jurisdiction in the district      courts of the United States over health care liability      actions on the basis of section 1331 or 1337 of title 28,      United States Code.     SEC. 104. STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.       A health care liability action that is subject to this Act      may not be initiated unless a complaint with respect to such      action is filed within the 2-year period beginning on the      date on which the claimant discovered or, in the exercise of      reasonable care, should have discovered the injury and its      cause, except that such an action relating to a claimant      under legal disability may be filed within 2 years after the      date on which the disability ceases. If the commencement of a      health care liability action is stayed or enjoined, the      running of the statute of limitations under this section      shall be suspended for the period of the stay or injunction.     SEC. 105. REFORM OF PUNITIVE DAMAGES.       (a) Limitation.--With respect to a health care liability      action, an award for punitive damages may only be made, if      otherwise permitted by applicable law, if it is proven by      clear and convincing evidence that the defendant--       (1) intended to injure the claimant for a reason unrelated      to the provision of health care services;       (2) understood the claimant was substantially certain to      suffer unnecessary injury, and in providing or failing to      provide health care services, the defendant deliberately      failed to avoid such injury; or       (3) acted with a conscious, flagrant disregard of a      substantial and unjustifiable risk of unnecessary injury      which the defendant failed to avoid in a manner which      constitutes a gross deviation from the normal standard of      conduct in such circumstances.       (b) Punitive Damages Not Permitted.--Notwithstanding the      provisions of subsection (a), punitive damages may not be      awarded against a defendant with respect to any health care      liability action if no judgment for compensatory damages,      including nominal damages (under $500), is rendered against      the defendant.       (c) Procedure for Determining Punitive Damages.--       (1) In general.--In any health care liability action      subject to this subtitle in which punitive damages are      recoverable, the trier of fact shall determine, concurrent      with all other issues presented in such action, whether such      damages shall be allowed. If the trier of fact determines      that such damages are allowed, a separate proceeding shall be      conducted by the court to determine the amount of such      damages to be awarded.       (2) Separate proceeding.--At a separate proceeding to      determine the amount of punitive damages to be awarded under      paragraph (1), the court shall consider the following:       (A) The severity of the harm caused by the conduct of the      defendant.       (B) The duration of the conduct or any concealment of such      conduct by the defendant.       (C) The profitability of the conduct of the defendant.       (D) The number of products sold or medical procedures      rendered for compensation, as the case may be, by the      defendant of the kind     causing the harm complained of by the claimant.       (E) The total deterrent effect of other damages and      punishment imposed upon the defendant as a result of the      misconduct, including compensatory, exemplary and punitive      damage awards to individuals in situations similar to those      of the claimant and the severity of any criminal or      administrative penalties, or civil fines, to which the      defendant has been or may be subjected.       (3) Determination.--At the conclusion of a separate      proceeding under paragraph (1), the court shall determine the      amount of punitive damages to be awarded with respect to the      health care liability action involved and shall enter      judgment for that amount. The court shall clearly state its      reasons for setting the amount of such award in findings of      fact and conclusions of law, demonstrating consideration of      each of the factors described in paragraph (2).       (d) Limitation Amount.--The amount of damages that may be      awarded as punitive damages in any health care liability      action shall not exceed 3 times the amount awarded to the      claimant for the economic injury on which such claim is      based, or $250,000, whichever is greater. This subsection      shall be applied by the court and shall not be disclosed to      the jury.       (e) Restrictions Permitted.--Nothing in this Act shall be      construed to imply a right to seek punitive damages where      none exists under Federal or State law.     SEC. 106. PERIODIC PAYMENTS.       With respect to a health care liability action, if the      award of future damages exceeds $100,000, the adjudicating      body shall, at the request of either party, enter a judgment      ordering that future damages be paid on a periodic basis in      accordance with the guidelines contained in the Uniform      Periodic Payments of Judgments Act, as promulgated by the      National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws in      July of 1990. The adjudicating body may waive the      requirements of this section if such body determines that      such a waiver is in the interests of justice.     SEC. 107. SCOPE OF LIABILITY.       (a) In General.--With respect to punitive and noneconomic      damages, the liability of each defendant in a health care      liability action shall be several only and may not be joint.      Such a defendant shall be liable only for the amount of      punitive or noneconomic damages allocated to the defendant in      direct proportion to such defendant's percentage of fault or      responsibility for the injury suffered by the claimant.       (b) Determination of Percentage of Liability.--With respect      to punitive or noneconomic damages, the trier of fact in a      health care liability action shall determine the extent of      each party's fault or responsibility for injury suffered by      the claimant, and shall assign a percentage of responsibility      for such injury to each such party.     SEC. 108. MANDATORY OFFSETS FOR DAMAGES PAID BY A COLLATERAL                    SOURCE.       (a) In General.--With respect to a health care liability      action, the total amount of damages received by an individual      under such action shall be reduced, in accordance with      subsection (b), by any other payment that has been, or will      be, made to an individual to compensate such individual for      the injury that was the subject of such action.       (b) Amount of Reduction.--The amount by which an award of      damages to an individual for an injury shall be reduced under      subsection (a) shall be--       (1) the total amount of any payments (other than such      award) that have been made or that will be made to such      individual to pay costs of or compensate such individual for      the injury that was the subject of the action; minus       (2) the amount paid by such individual (or by the spouse,      parent, or legal guardian of such individual) to secure the      payments described in paragraph (1).       (c) Determination of Amounts From Collateral Services.--The      reductions required under subsection (b) shall be determined      by the court in a pretrial proceeding. At the subsequent      trial--       (1) no evidence shall be admitted as to the amount of any      charge, payments, or damage for which a claimant--       (A) has received payment from a collateral source or the      obligation for which has been assured by a third party; or       (B) is, or with reasonable certainty, will be eligible to      receive payment from a collateral source of the obligation      which will, with reasonable certainty be assumed by a third      party; and       (2) the jury, if any, shall be advised that--       (A) except for damages as to which the court permits the      introduction of evidence, the claimant's medical expenses and      lost income have been or will be paid by a collateral source      or third party; and       (B) the claimant shall receive no award for any damages      that have been or will be paid by a collateral source or      third party.     SEC. 109. TREATMENT OF ATTORNEYS' FEES AND OTHER COSTS.       (a) Limitation on Amount of Contingency Fees.--An attorney      who represents, on a contingency fee basis, a claimant in a      health care liability action may not charge, demand, receive,      or collect for services rendered in connection with such      action in excess of the following amount recovered by      judgment or settlement under such action:       (1) 33\1/3\ percent of the first $150,000 (or portion      thereof) recovered, based on after-tax recovery, plus       (2) 25 percent of any amount in excess of $150,000      recovered, based on after-tax recovery.       (b) Calculation of Periodic Payments.--In the event that a      judgment or settlement includes periodic or future payments      of damages, the amount recovered for purposes of computing      the limitation on the contingency fee under subsection (a)      shall be based on the cost of the annuity or trust      established to make the payments. In any case in which an      annuity or trust is not established to make such payments,      such amount shall be based on the present value of the      payments.     SEC. 110. OBSTETRIC CASES.       With respect to a health care liability action relating to      services provided during labor or the delivery of a baby, if      the health care professional against whom the action is      brought did not previously treat the pregnant woman for the      pregnancy, the trier of fact may not find that the defendant      committed malpractice and may not assess damages against the      health care professional unless the malpractice is proven by      clear and convincing evidence.     SEC. 111. STATE-BASED ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION                    MECHANISMS.       (a) Establishment by States.--Each State is encouraged to      establish or maintain alternative dispute resolution      mechanisms that promote the resolution of health care      liability claims in a manner that--       (1) is affordable for the parties involved in the claims;       (2) provides for the timely resolution of claims; and       (3) provides the parties with convenient access to the      dispute resolution process.       (b) Guidelines.--The Attorney General, in consultation with      the Secretary and the Administrative Conference of the United      States, shall develop guidelines with respect to alternative      dispute resolution mechanisms that may be established by      States for the resolution of health care liability claims.      Such guidelines shall include procedures with respect to the      following methods of alternative dispute resolution:       (1) Arbitration.--The use of arbitration, a nonjury      adversarial dispute resolution process which may, subject to      subsection (c), result in a final decision as to facts, law,      liability or damages. The parties may elect binding      arbitration.       (2) Mediation.--The use of mediation, a settlement process      coordinated by a neutral third party without the ultimate      rendering of a formal opinion as to factual or legal      findings.       (3) Early neutral evaluation.--The use of early neutral      evaluation, in which the parties make a presentation to a      neutral attorney or other neutral evaluator for an assessment      of the merits, to encourage settlement. If the parties do not      settle as a result of assessment and proceed to trial, the      neutral evaluator's opinion shall be kept confidential.       (4) Early offer and recovery mechanism.--The use of early      offer and recovery mechanisms under which a health care      provider, health care organization, or any other alleged      responsible defendant may offer to compensate a claimant for      his or her reasonable economic damages, including future      economic damages, less amounts available from collateral      sources.

Subtitle B--Biomaterials Access Assurance     SEC. 121. SHORT TITLE.       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Biomaterials Access      Assurance Act of 1997''.     SEC. 122. FINDINGS.       Congress finds that--       (1) each year millions of citizens of the United States      depend on the availability of lifesaving or life enhancing      medical devices, many of which are permanently implantable      within the human body;       (2) a continued supply of raw materials and component parts      is necessary for the invention, development, improvement, and      maintenance of the supply of the devices;       (3) most of the medical devices are made with raw materials      and component parts that--       (A) are not designed or manufactured specifically for use      in medical devices; and       (B) come in contact with internal human tissue;       (4) the raw materials and component parts also are used in      a variety of nonmedical products;       (5) because small quantities of the raw materials and      component parts are used for medical devices, sales of raw      materials and component parts for medical devices constitute      an extremely small portion of the overall market for the raw      materials and medical devices;       (6) under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21      U.S.C. 301 et seq.), manufacturers of medical devices are      required to demonstrate that the medical devices are safe and      effective, including demonstrating that the products are      properly designed and have adequate warnings or instructions;       (7) notwithstanding the fact that raw materials and      component parts suppliers do not design, produce, or test a      final medical device, the suppliers have been the subject of      actions alleging inadequate--       (A) design and testing of medical devices manufactured with      materials or parts supplied by the suppliers; or       (B) warnings related to the use of such medical devices;       (8) even though suppliers of raw materials and component      parts have very rarely been held liable in such actions, such      suppliers have ceased supplying certain raw materials and      component parts for use in medical devices because the costs      associated with litigation in order to ensure a favorable      judgment for the suppliers far exceeds the total potential      sales revenues from sales by such suppliers to the medical      device industry;       (9) unless alternate sources of supply can be found, the      unavailability of raw materials and component parts for      medical devices will lead to unavailability of lifesaving and      life-enhancing medical devices;       (10) because other suppliers of the raw materials and      component parts in foreign nations are refusing to sell raw      materials or component parts for use in manufacturing certain      medical devices in the United States, the prospects for      development of new sources of supply for the full range of      threatened raw materials and component parts for medical      devices are remote;       (11) it is unlikely that the small market for such raw      materials and component parts in the United States could      support the large investment needed to develop new suppliers      of such raw materials and component parts;       (12) attempts to develop such new suppliers would raise the      cost of medical devices;       (13) courts that have considered the duties of the      suppliers of the raw materials and component parts have      generally found that the suppliers do not have a duty--       (A) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the use of a raw      material or component part in a medical device; and       (B) to warn consumers concerning the safety and      effectiveness of a medical device;       (14) attempts to impose the duties referred to in      subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (13) on suppliers of      the raw materials and component parts would cause more harm      than good by driving the suppliers to cease supplying      manufacturers of medical devices; and       (15) in order to safeguard the availability of a wide      variety of lifesaving and life-enhancing medical devices,      immediate action is needed--       (A) to clarify the permissible bases of liability for      suppliers of raw materials and component parts for medical      devices; and       (B) to provide expeditious procedures to dispose of      unwarranted suits against the suppliers in such manner as to      minimize litigation costs.

(a) Motion To Dismiss.--In any action that is subject to      this subtitle, a biomaterials supplier who is a defendant in      such action may, at any time during which a motion to dismiss      may be filed under an applicable law, move to dismiss the      action against it on the grounds that--       (1) the defendant is a biomaterials supplier; and       (2)(A) the defendant should not, for the purposes of--       (i) section 125(b), be considered to be a manufacturer of      the implant that is subject to such section; or       (ii) section 125(c), be considered to be a seller of the      implant that allegedly caused harm to the claimant; or       (B)(i) the claimant has failed to establish, pursuant to      section 125(d), that the supplier furnished raw materials or      component parts in violation of contractual requirements or      specifications; or       (ii) the claimant has failed to comply with the procedural      requirements of subsection (b).       (b) Manufacturer of Implant Shall Be Named a Party.--The      claimant shall be required to name the manufacturer of the      implant as a party to the action, unless--       (1) the manufacturer is subject to service of process      solely in a jurisdiction in which the biomaterials supplier      is not domiciled or subject to a service of process; or       (2) an action against the manufacturer is barred by      applicable law.       (c) Proceeding on Motion To Dismiss.--The following rules      shall apply to any proceeding on a motion to dismiss filed      under this section:       (1) Affidavits relating to listing and declarations.--       (A) In general.--The defendant in the action may submit an      affidavit demonstrating that defendant has not included the      implant on a list, if any, filed with the Secretary pursuant      to section 510(j) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act      (21 U.S.C. 360(j)).       (B) Response to motion to dismiss.--In response to the      motion to dismiss, the claimant may submit an affidavit      demonstrating that--       (i) the Secretary has, with respect to the defendant and      the implant that allegedly caused harm to the claimant,      issued a declaration pursuant to section 125(b)(2)(B); or       (ii) the defendant who filed the motion to dismiss is a      seller of the implant who is liable under section 125(c).       (2) Effect of motion to dismiss on discovery.--       (A) In general.--If a defendant files a motion to dismiss      under paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (a), no discovery      shall be permitted in connection to the action that is the      subject of the motion, other than discovery necessary to      determine a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, until      such time as the court rules on the motion to dismiss in      accordance with the affidavits submitted by the parties in      accordance with this section.       (B) Discovery.--If a defendant files a motion to dismiss      under subsection (a)(2)(B)(i) on the grounds that the      biomaterials supplier did not furnish raw materials or      component parts in violation of contractual requirements or      specifications, the court may permit discovery, as ordered by      the court. The discovery conducted pursuant to this      subparagraph shall be limited to issues that are directly      relevant to--       (i) the pending motion to dismiss; or       (ii) the jurisdiction of the court.       (3) Affidavits relating status of defendant.--       (A) In general.--Except as provided in clauses (i) and (ii)      of subparagraph (B), the court shall consider a defendant to      be a biomaterials supplier who is not subject to an action      for harm to a claimant caused by an implant, other than an      action relating to liability for a violation of contractual      requirements or specifications described in subsection (d).       (B) Responses to motion to dismiss.--The court shall grant      a motion to dismiss any action that asserts liability of the      defendant under subsection (b) or (c) of section 125 on the      grounds that the defendant is not a manufacturer subject to      such section 125(b) or seller subject to section 125(c),      unless the claimant submits a valid affidavit that      demonstrates that--       (i) with respect to a motion to dismiss contending the      defendant is not a manufacturer, the defendant meets the      applicable requirements for liability as a manufacturer under      section 125(b); or       (ii) with respect to a motion to dismiss contending that      the defendant is not a seller, the defendant meets the      applicable requirements for liability as a seller under      section 125(c).       (4) Basis of ruling on motion to dismiss.--       (A) In general.--The court shall rule on a motion to      dismiss filed under subsection (a) solely on the basis of the      pleadings of the parties made pursuant to this section and      any affidavits submitted by the parties pursuant to this      section.       (B) Motion for summary judgment.--Notwithstanding any other      provision of law, if the court determines that the pleadings      and affidavits made by parties pursuant to this section raise      genuine issues as concerning material facts with respect to a      motion concerning contractual requirements and      specifications, the court may deem the motion to dismiss to      be a motion for summary judgment made pursuant to subsection      (d).       (d) Summary Judgment.--       (1) In general.--       (A) Basis for entry of judgment.--A biomaterials supplier      shall be entitled to entry of judgment without trial if the      court finds there is no genuine issue as concerning any      material fact for each applicable element set forth in      paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 125(d).       (B) Issues of material fact.--With respect to a finding      made under subparagraph (A), the court shall consider a      genuine issue of material fact to exist only if the evidence      submitted by claimant would be sufficient to allow a      reasonable jury to reach a verdict for the claimant if the      jury found the evidence to be credible.       (2) Discovery made prior to a ruling on a motion for      summary judgment.--If, under applicable rules, the court      permits discovery prior to a ruling on a motion for summary      judgment made pursuant to this subsection, such discovery      shall be limited solely to establishing whether a genuine      issue of material fact exists as to the applicable elements      set forth in paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 125(d).       (3) Discovery with respect to a biomaterials supplier.--A      biomaterials supplier shall be subject to discovery in      connection with a motion seeking dismissal or summary      judgment on the basis of the inapplicability of section      125(d) or the failure to establish the applicable elements of      section 125(d) solely to the extent permitted by the      applicable Federal or State rules for discovery against      nonparties.       (e) Stay Pending Petition for Declaration.--If a claimant      has filed a petition for a declaration pursuant to section      125(b)(3)(A) with respect to a defendant, and the Secretary      has not issued a final decision on the petition, the court      shall stay all proceedings with respect to that defendant      until such time as the Secretary has issued a final decision      on the petition.       (f) Manufacturer Conduct of Proceeding.--The manufacturer      of an implant that is the subject of an action covered under      this subtitle shall be permitted to file and conduct a      proceeding on any motion for summary judgment or dismissal      filed by a biomaterials supplier who is a defendant under      this section if the manufacturer and any other defendant in      such action enter into a valid and applicable contractual      agreement under which the manufacturer agrees to bear the      cost of such proceeding or to conduct such proceeding.       (g) Attorney Fees.--The court shall require the claimant to      compensate the biomaterials supplier (or a manufacturer      appearing in lieu of a supplier pursuant to subsection (f))      for attorney fees and costs, if--       (1) the claimant named or joined the biomaterials supplier;      and       (2) the court found the claim against the biomaterials      supplier to be without merit and frivolous.     SEC. 127. APPLICABILITY.       This subtitle shall apply to all civil actions covered      under this subtitle that are commenced on or after the date      of enactment of this Act, including any such action with      respect to which the harm asserted in the action or the      conduct that caused the harm occurred before the date of      enactment of this Act.

TITLE II--PROTECTION OF THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF PATIENTS     SEC. 201. ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR STATE HEALTH CARE QUALITY                    ASSURANCE AND ACCESS ACTIVITIES.       Each State shall require that not less than 50 percent of      all awards of punitive damages resulting from all health care      liability actions in that State, if punitive damages are      otherwise permitted by applicable law, be used for activities      relating to--       (1) the licensing, investigating, disciplining, and      certification of health care professionals in the State; and       (2) the reduction of malpractice-related costs for health      care providers volunteering to provide health care services      in medically underserved areas.     SEC. 202. QUALITY ASSURANCE, PATIENT SAFETY, AND CONSUMER                    INFORMATION.       (a) Advisory Panel.--       (1) In general.--Not later than 90 days after the date of      enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the Agency for      Health Care Policy and Research (hereafter referred to in      this section as the ``Administrator'') shall establish an      advisory panel to coordinate and evaluate, methods,      procedures, and data to enhance the quality, safety, and      effectiveness of health care services provided to patients.       (2) Participation.--In establishing the advisory panel      under paragraph (1), the Administrator shall ensure that      members of the panel include representatives of public and      private sector entities having expertise in quality      assurance, risk assessment, risk management, patient safety,      and patient satisfaction.       (3) Objectives.--In carrying out the duties described in      this section, the Administrator, acting through the advisory      panel established under paragraph (1), shall conduct a survey      of public and private entities involved in quality assurance,      risk assessment, patient safety, patient satisfaction, and      practitioner licensing. Such survey shall include the      gathering of data with respect to--       (A) performance measures of quality for health care      providers and health plans;       (B) developments in survey methodology, sampling, and audit      methods;       (C) methods of medical practice and patterns, and patient      outcomes; and       (D) methods of disseminating information concerning      successful health care quality improvement programs, risk      management and patient safety programs, practice guidelines,      patient satisfaction, and practitioner licensing.       (b) Guidelines.--Not later than 2 years after the date of      enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall, in accordance      with chapter 5 of title 5, United States Code, establish      health care quality assurance, patient safety and consumer      information guidelines. Such guidelines shall be modified      periodically when determined appropriate by the      Administrator. Such guidelines shall be advisory in nature      and not binding.       (c) Reports.--       (1) Initial report.--Not later than 6 months after the date      of enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall prepare and      submit to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources of the      Senate and the Committee on Commerce of the House of      Representatives, a report that contains--       (A) data concerning the availability of information      relating to risk management, quality assessment, patient      safety, and patient satisfaction;       (B) an estimation of the degree of consensus concerning the      accuracy and content of the information available under      subparagraph (A);       (C) a summary of the best practices used in the public and      private sectors for disseminating information to consumers;      and       (D) an evaluation of the National Practitioner Data Bank      (as established under the Health Quality Improvement Act of      1986), for reliability and validity of the data and the      effectiveness of the Data Bank in assisting hospitals and      medical groups in overseeing the quality of practitioners.       (2) Interim report.--Not later than 1 year after the date      of enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall prepare and      submit to the Committees referred to in paragraph (1) a      report, based on the results of the advisory panel survey      conducted under subsection (a)(3), concerning--       (A) the consensus of indicators of patient safety and risk;       (B) an assessment of the consumer perspective on health      care quality that includes an examination of--       (i) the information most often requested by consumers;       (ii) the types of technical quality information that      consumers find compelling;       (iii) the amount of information that consumers consider to      be sufficient and the amount of such information considered      overwhelming; and       (iv) the manner in which such information should be      presented;     and recommendations for increasing the awareness of consumers      concerning such information;       (C) proposed methods, building on existing data gathering      and dissemination systems, for ensuring that such data is      available and accessible to consumers, employers, hospitals,      and patients;       (D) the existence of legal, regulatory, and practical      obstacles to making such data available and accessible to      consumers;       (E) privacy or proprietary issues involving the      dissemination of such data;       (F) an assessment of the appropriateness of collecting such      data at the Federal or State level;       (G) an evaluation of the value of permitting consumers to      have access to information contained in the National      Practitioner Data Bank and recommendations to improve the      reliability and validity of the information; and       (H) the reliability and validity of data collected by the      State medical boards and recommendations for developing      investigation protocols.

SEVERABILITY.       If any provision of this Act, an amendment made by this      Act, or the application of such provision or amendment to any      person or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional, the      remainder of this Act, the amendments made by this Act, and      the application of the provisions of such to any person or      circumstance shall not be affected thereby.                                  ____     Health Care Liability Reform and Quality Assurance Act of 1997                       TITLE I--LIABILITY REFORM                subtitle A--health care liability reform     1. Scope       The bill: Applies to any action, filed in federal or state      court, against a health care provider, professional, payor,      hmo, insurance company or any other defendant (except in      cases based on vaccine-related injuries);       Preempts state law to the extent it is inconsistent with      the provisions herein; no preemption for state laws which      provide, among other things: a. additional defenses; b.      greater limitations on attorneys' fees; c. greater      restrictions on punitive or non-economic damages; d. maximum      limit on the total damages.       Does not create federal jurisdiction for health care      liability actions.     2. Uniform statute of limitations       Cases could be filed two years from the date that the      injury was discovered or should have been discovered, except      that any person under a legal disability may file within two      years after the disability ceases.     3. Limit on punitive damages       Punitive damages will be awarded if it is proven by clear      and convincing evidence that the defendant: a. intended to      injure; b. understood claimant was substantially certain to      suffer unnecessary injury and deliberately failed to avoid      injury; or c. acted with conscious disregard of substantial      and unjustifiable risk which defendant failed to avoid in a      way which constitutes a gross deviation from the normal      standard of conduct.       No punitive damages where compensatory damages of less than      $500 are awarded.       Trier of fact determines if punitive damages are allowed.      If so, then a separate proceeding is conducted by the court.       In determining the amount, court must consider only: a.      severity of harm; b. duration of defendant's conduct and any      concealment; c. profitability of defendant's conduct; d.      number of products sold/procedures rendered which caused      similar harm; e. similar awards of punitive damages in      similar circumstances; f. criminal penalties imposed on      defendant; g. civil fines imposed.       No award may exceed the greater of 3 times the amount of      economic damages or $250,000.     4. Periodic payment of future damages       No more than $100,000 of future damages may be required to      be paid in one single payment. The court will determine the      schedule for payments, based on projection of future losses      and reduced to present value. This requirement may be waived,      in the interests of justice.     5. Several, not joint, liability       A defendant would be liable only for the amount of non-     economic and punitive damages allocated to defendant's direct      proportion of fault or responsibility. The trier of fact      determines percentage of responsibility of each defendant.     6. Collateral source       Total damages must be reduced by payments from other      sources to compensate individuals for injury that is the      subject of the health care liability action. The offset is      reduced by any amount paid by the injured party (or family      member) to secure the payment. The reductions must be      determined by the judge in a pretrial proceeding.     7. Attorneys' fees       This section limits attorney contingent fees to 33\1/3\% of      the first $150,000 and 25% of any amount in excess of      $150,000.     8. Obstetric cases       This section precludes a malpractice award against a health      care professional relating to     delivery of a baby, if the health care professional did not      previously treat the woman during the pregnancy, unless      malpractice is proven by clear and convincing evidence.     9. State-based alternative dispute resolution       Prior to the filing, or immediately following the filing of      the action, the parties are encouraged to participate in a      state administered alternative dispute resolution system.       The Attorney General will develop adr methods for use by      the states, including arbitration, mediation, early neutral      evaluation, early offer and recovery. The parties may elect      binding arbitration.     10. Certificate of merit       The certificate of merit provision requires that, prior to      bringing a lawsuit, an individual (or his or her attorney)      must submit an affidavit declaring that a qualified      specialist reviewed the facts and concluded that the claim is      meritorious.       A qualified specialist means a health care professional      with expertise (the specialist practices or teaches or has      experience or demonstrated competence) in the same or      substantially similar area of practice as that involved in      the case.       A court may impose sanctions for the submission of a false      affidavit.                Subtitle B--Biomaterial Access Assurance     1. Summary       The Biomaterial Access Assurance Act would allow suppliers      of the raw materials (biomaterial) used to make medical      implants, to obtain dismissal, without extensive discovery or      other legal costs, in certain tort suits in which plaintiffs      allege harm from a finished medical implant.           TITLE II--PROTECTION OF PATIENT HEALTH AND SAFETY     1. Quality assurance       The quality assurance section requires each state to      establish a health care quality assurance program and fund,      approved by the Secretary of HHS. It also allocates 50% of      all punitive damage awards to be transferred to the fund for      the purpose of licensing and certifying health professionals,      implementing programs, including programs to reduce      malpractice costs for volunteers serving under served areas.     2. Risk management programs       Finally, professionals and providers must participate in a      risk management program to prevent and provide early warning      of practices which may result in injuries. Insurers also must      establish risk management programs and require participation,      once every 3 years, as a condition of maintaining insurance.                                 ______                                       By
