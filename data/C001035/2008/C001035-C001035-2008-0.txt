President, Maine and New Hampshire have much in common. When John Sununu came to the Senate six years ago, I immediately saw in him those traits shared by the people of our two States: a strong work ethic combined with a great sense of humor, traditional values balanced by a spirit of innovation, and fiscal prudence always tempered by compassion. He quickly became not only a valued colleague but also a trusted friend.  John's extraordinary intellect, wisdom, and experience belied his young age and benefited this chamber and Nation. His upbringing in a family devoted to public service, his education in science, engineering, and business, and his experience in the House of Representatives made him a veteran from day one. His ability to analyze challenges and devise creative solutions made him an esteemed colleague.  In the best tradition of the Senate, John brought his knowledge and experience to bear on some of the most pressing issues we face. In technology, he has been a leader committed to growth and advancement. He has been a devoted advocate for special education and rural health care. He has been a strong voice for our forest products industry and for a sound energy policy that would reduce our dangerous reliance on foreign oil.  It has been an honor to work with him on the Homeland Security Committee. His diligence and commitment have helped make America safer. His tireless leadership to reform the Patriot Act demonstrated his unwavering commitment to safeguard the civil liberties Americans cherish.  In addition to his leadership on national issues like the Patriot Act and tax policy, John has been an effective advocate for projects of special concern to New Hampshire, whether it is low-income heating assistance and weatherization programs or the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. We recently worked closely together with our two colleagues to secure $20 billion for the shipyard's new dry dock to help secure its future.  Above all, Senator John Sununu has distinguished himself as a champion of good government. He is an independent thinker who stands up--always--for what he believes to be right for New Hampshire and right for our country. He has a sharp eye for wasteful spending and is a resolute fighter for fiscal responsibility.  It has been an honor to serve with John, and I wish him and his family allthe best. I will miss serving with him day to day, but I know that he will continue to accomplish a great deal.                             pete domenici
