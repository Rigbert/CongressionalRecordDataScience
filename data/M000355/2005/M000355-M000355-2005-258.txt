 President, I pay tribute to a great leader in public service, Mr. Everett Rains. Everett served as county clerk in Whitley County, KY, for 24 years. I first met him when I started my political career in Kentucky, more than two decades ago. Everett was known for his numerous acts of kindness and generosity. He inspired others to serve, including his own nephew Tom Rains, who succeeded him as Whitley County clerk.  Last month, Everett passed away at the age of 88. He spent his career serving the people of Whitley County, and will be missed by all who knew and loved him.  On October 26, 2005, The Williamsburg News Journal published an article highlighting Everett's contributions, caring nature, and strong character. I ask that the full article be printed in the Record and that the entire Senate join me in paying our respect to this beloved Kentuckian.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:          [From the Williamsburg News Journal, Oct. 26, 2005]    Family, Friends Have Fond Memories of Rains, Former County Clerk                            (By Mark White)       Everett Rains will undoubtedly go down in history as one of      the most successful politicians in Whitley County history,      but his nephew, current Whitley County Clerk Tom Rains, says      he will remember Everett more as a generous man that always      tried to help people.       ``Many times at the Corbin hospital we would go visit the      sick men, who were his friends. If the men didn't have a pair      of socks on, that really bothered him the most,'' Rains said      Monday afternoon, unsuccessfully trying to choke back tears.      ``He would pull his socks off and give them to them. He would      leave and go home without any socks on. I've never seen      anybody do that before in my life; that was how generous he      was.''       Everett Rains, who served as Whitley County Clerk for 24      years, passed away Saturday afternoon at the Oak Tree      Hospital in Corbin at the age of 88.       ``He was a tremendous gentleman. They called him the best      politician in Whitley County, but it all came from his heart.      Everything came out of Everett's heart. He did things for      people out of his heart, not because he was county clerk. He      was just that type of person,'' said Tom Rains, who worked      for Everett for eight years before succeeding him as county      clerk. ``He treasured this office. He was a good county      clerk.''       Everett Rains began his career in politics serving one term      as Whitley County sheriff from 1954 through 1957. At the      time, sheriffs couldn't succeed themselves, and Rains made a      failed bid for county clerk in 1957 against incumbent Ernie      Hickey. He ran again for county clerk in 1961, and was      elected to the first of his six terms in office. Rains was      unopposed in his bid for re-election during three of his six      terms, and left office in 1985. Kay Schwartz, who has worked      in the county clerk's office for nearly 31 years and who      worked for Everett Rains for 11 years until he left office,      described her former boss as an easygoing person, who never      raised his voice to any workers.       ``He would always tell us in a kind way how things needed      to be done, or what he needed done. He never did anything to      humiliate you. He always wanted to help you,'' she noted.       ``He was a very good man. He was always kind to people. It      didn't matter if they came in mad, they never left mad. He      always calmed them down, and took care of their needs. It      didn't matter what they needed, he always tried to help      them,'' Schwartz said. ``Even if he knew somebody was against      him, he was kind to them when they came in. He shook their      hand, and he helped them. It didn't matter to him. He was a      man that would turn the other cheek. He was always good to      people.''       Tom Rains said some of his fondest memories as a child were      of he and his twin brother riding around with Everett as he      traveled the county buying and selling cattle.       ``We used to come down and sit on the sheriff's counter.      While he was working we used to get to stay a few hours at      the courthouse. It was the biggest treat ever. He was a      special person, who made you feel so good,'' Tom Rains said.       Everett Rains and his wife of 46 years, Delois, never had      any children. The couple didn't marry until they were 42      years old, Tom Rains noted. Still, the couple had a large      family, including seven nephews and five nieces.       Everett and Delois attended 73 birthday parties for their      great-nephews and nieces in Tom Rains' family, only missing      one birthday party due to illness.       Tom Rains noted that Everett had a great love for children,      period. ``There is probably not anyone in this county that      Everett Rains didn't buy a bottle of soda pop for when he was      young. Young boys would run to the county store when they saw      Everett coming down the road because they knew Everett would      buy them a pop. Every child everywhere he went, he would give      them a quarter and in later years he would give a dollar to      every child he saw. He was really so generous,'' Tom Rains      said.       In addition to being a politician, Rains was also an active      farmer, who raised crops and cattle on his farm near Dal Road      until last year.       ``He had a real closeness to all the farmers in Whitley      County,'' Tom Rains noted Monday. ``Back in the '40s, '50s      and '60s, everyone had a milk cow; in Whitley County that was      the most valuable thing on your place. Everett would loan      people milk cows. So many people came to me today, and said,      'I remember when your uncle brought us a milk cow.' He didn't      ask nothing.''       Rains said about a year ago, Everett suffered a bump on his      head that required surgery in Lexington for internal bleeding      in his brain. After the stint in the hospital, he developed      lung problems, and had suffered from pneumonia for the past      month until he passed away Saturday.       Funeral services were scheduled for 2 p.m. today at the      Ellison Funeral Home Chapel with the Rev. Bill Mitchell      officiating. He will be buried at the Highland Park Cemetery      in the Davis Addition.       The Whitley County Courthouse closed at noon Wednesday for      the funeral, and remained closed for the remainder of the      day.                          ____________________[Pages S12676-S12677]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                      TRIBUTE TO MR.
