President, on Senate rollcall vote 7, to invoke cloture on The Safe, Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient Transportation Equity Act of 2003 (S. 1072), I was absent due to a delayed flight. If I had been present for the vote I would have voted in the affirmative, to invoke cloture and proceed to the bill.
