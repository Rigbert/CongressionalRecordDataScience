 President, I thank my colleague for that. The beginning of my comments was a polite way of apologizing for my being so persistent. I have been here 28 years. I have never threatened a filibuster. I have never threatened to hold up legislation. I have never once stopped the business on the floor--not that that is not every Senator's right. I have never done that. I care so much about this legislation that I was prepared to do whatever it would take. I apologize for being so pushy about it. But there is nothing I have done in 28 years that I feel more strongly about than this. I apologize to my friends for my being so persistent.
