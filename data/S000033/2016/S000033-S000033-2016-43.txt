 President, I ask to have printed in the Record copies of some of the finalist essays written by Vermont High School students as part of the sixth annual ``What is the State of the Union'' essay contest conducted by my office. These finalists were selected from nearly 800 entries.  The material follows:        ADAM FLEISCHMAN, SOUTH BURLINGTON HIGH SCHOOL (FINALIST)       The state of the union is strong. Americans are working      hard, unemployment is down, the stock market is up, and the      recession of 2008 feels like ancient history. Still, we face      problems. Climate change is one of those issues, particularly      because of the denial by politicians in our government that      refuse to do anything, because their re-election campaigns      rely on oil and gas companies' contributions.       In the 114th congress, 170 members deny that global warming      is real. Many representatives receive huge donations, as much      as $63 million from big oil and gas companies, and in return,      they support deregulation initiatives in Congress to protect      the corporations. In other words, they prevent progress and      obstruct a move away from non-renewable energy sources. In      this way, they are not representing their constituents--     they're representing the interests of the very wealthy      corporations--and it's undermining the political system we      have.       In a legislative body that is constantly blinded by the      goal of staying in office, rather than passing comprehensive      reforms to save our planet, the denial is rampant. Even      though 97% of scientists agree that climate change is real,      and manmade, these elected officials with no background in      science choose to ignore it, and instead put trillions of      taxpayer money into a defense budget that is bloated and      unnecessary. For climate change to be properly addressed, it      starts with Congress. If we invest money into clean energy--     solar panels, wind turbines, natural gas--we will slowly be      able to move away from non-renewable, dirty sources.       We also must take a stand against the corporations      profiting off of non-renewable sources, making it clear that      their campaign contributions should not be the difference      between whether or not we leave a healthier planet for future      generations. If we wait long enough, it will be too late to      do anything. It's not part of a ``liberal agenda'' that some      in Congress like to criticize. It's a common problem that is      hurting our common home, and it's up to all of humankind to      deal with it. That can't happen if the political charades are      continued in Washington, D.C.     ELLERY HARKNESS, CHAMPLAIN VALLEY UNION HIGH SCHOOL (FINALIST)       My fellow Americans, there are many important issues      burdening our world today; in order to fix these problems, we      need an education system that produces well educated leaders      to solve these issues. Our education system as it stands      today needs to be modified and socioeconomic factors      hindering education need to be addressed.       Education should be an equalizer, so that anyone, no matter      their circumstances, can realize their potential; this isn't      the reality though. The truth is that kids from disadvantaged      families have a far lower chance for success. Inequality due      to wealth and race are huge problems; the disturbing school      to prison pipeline is one outcome of this. Only 1 in 12      children in poverty will graduate from college today and      almost half won't graduate from high school. Studies have      also found that African American and Hispanic high school      graduation rates are 10% lower than the U.S. average.      Education can raise people out of poverty, while ignoring      these problems only continues to perpetrate a horrific cycle      of poverty and create more economic problems.       Consider that by 2020, 65% of U.S. jobs will require a      postsecondary education, according to Georgetown Public      Policy Institute. Yet only 1 of 4 students are ready for      college in the 4 core subjects when graduating high school,      according to U.S. news. Regrettably, the education system not      only isn't preparing students for college, it also forces      students to bear an unreasonable financial burden in order to      go to college. With free or reduced tuition programs, college      education would be more accessible.       There is no single fix for the educational problems      plaguing our country yet it is clear that major reforms need      to take place. Potential solutions are policies that provide      family support so that students grow up in places that      encourage learning. Since teachers are the most important      aspect of education, more resources could be put into teacher      programs and salaries that incentivize job growth. Congress      could also work towards bipartisan policies that ensure      schools around the U.S have equal quality and access to      resources through more funding. In 2015, 55% of government      funding went to the military, while only 6% went to      education. An increase in education funding is a justifiable      change that could dramatically help broken systems.       With a better educated workforce, people will have better      jobs and rely on government less, benefiting the U.S.      economy. Opportunity gaps in education would also decrease      and the U.S. would become more competitive as a result. This      is another incentive for making education a priority to those      in Washington.       Our combined futures are dependent on the youth of today;      but our nation's children are only as good as the education      they are provided with. As Nelson Mandela said, ``Education      is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the      world.'' Let's take advantage of it.          MEGAN HUGHES, CANAAN MEMORIAL HIGH SCHOOL (FINALIST)       As many Americans know, we are very blessed to have      colleges available in our country. College allows a young      adult to further his or her knowledge of the world around      them so they can be ready to enter the workforce. College      tuition used to be affordable, so that everyone could further      their education. This is important because more educated      people means a stronger growing economy. At the same time,      the cost of tuition rises dramatically each year, and      families with more than one child find themselves in tough      financial situations. Most of the time people use loans, and      end up paying back student debt for years. Every American      deserves to have a college education, which is why state      colleges should be tuition free.       Elementary and high school is mandatory for all American      citizens. Parents who refuse to send their children to school      have to pay large fines or even serve jail time. If early      education is this important to Americans, why is college not?      Why should the emphasis just be on getting a primary or      secondary education? More and more jobs today are requiring      higher than just a high school diploma. In an article by Adam      Davidson, he says that ``Workers with more education are more      productive, which makes companies more profitable and the      overall economy grow faster.'' This is true, more educated      people means more jobs are being done correctly and      efficiently, and as a result boosting the economy.       In an article by Steven Goodman he said ``Two-thirds of      American undergraduates are in debt. This year, student loan      debt will grow to more than a trillion dollars, outpacing      credit card debt for the first time.'' This article was      written in 2011, meaning only four years ago student debt was      already in the trillions. When young adults leave home and      enter the work force, they have to deal with adult      responsibilities for the first time. On top of that, they      usually need to pay off student debt. If college were to be      tuition free these people would not have large debts. The      money they make could go towards paying bills, and saving      money for their future or retirement. It would also help      attract those who were never thinking about going to college      because of the high costs. All this leads to more people      buying and selling goods which is important for a country to      prosper.       State colleges should be free because the economy will grow      faster with more educated people, and young adults will not      be paying college debt for half their life. How exactly this      would be done is simple, put higher taxes on the wealthy.      With the top class distributing their money towards      education, everyone can have the opportunity to further their      education. People can use their hard working money on other      things, like purchasing a house or providing for a child.      That is why it is important to have free college tuition      because it creates an educated population, less debt, and      saving for other necessities.      TORI JARVIS, MISSISQUOI VALLEY UNION HIGH SCHOOL (FINALIST)       Since the recent crimes committed by the terror group ISIS,      hate crimes against Muslims have skyrocketed. Recently, ``an      Arab-American man was brutally attacked by two white men . .      . (who) also taunted his daughter, who wears a hijab, making      references to ISIS . . . The attackers called (them) `r--     head' and said, `Go back to your country.' '' Wrote Tom      Carter for an article on the World Socialist Website.      Obviously, these men attacked the man and his daughter for      their race and religion, equating the fact that they were      Muslim with terrorism even though there was no sensible      reason to. People are so scared of terrorism that they lash      out at anything they can associate with it.       People in power or who wish to be in power are using this      fear to convince them that Muslims are the ones to be feared.      The most recent--and most dangerous--example is Donald Trump,      who wants to ban Muslims from coming into the country. This      move has not only heightened the fear of ISIS, but made      people believe the Muslims currently in our country are      associated with terrorism, creating more violence. Encouraged      by Presidential candidates like Donald Trump, some Americans      blame the entire religion of Islam, and anyone who follows      it, for all of our country's problems. They believe that      because these terrorists are following a distorted version of      the Qu'ran and the religion of Islam, that anyone else who      worships the peaceful religion is a terrorist as well.      Unfortunately, people don't realize that Muslims are not      terrorists. Muslim athlete Muhammad Ali once said;      ``Terrorists are not following Islam. Killing people and      blowing up people and dropping bombs in places and all this      is not the way to spread the word of Islam. So people realize      now that all Muslims are not terrorists.'' Muslims are too      often oppressed, even violently attacked by Americans who      blame them for terrorism. Muslims in America today are now      experiencing racism the way black people used to, and are      violently and verbally abused by white people who are looking      for someone to blame.       Jermaine Jackson, one of Michael Jackson's siblings, has      pointed out ``Muslims have become the new Negroes in America.      They are being mistreated at airports, by the Immigration--     everywhere. Islam is a religion of peace. They are wrong.''      People who wear hijabs seem to have a target placed on them.      Muslims are ``randomly selected'' for full body searches at      airports, forced to prove they're in this country legally,      and attacked by people who have different religious opinions.      The violence against Muslims must end, whether it physical or      mental. As the civil war in the Middle East is creating      unlivable conditions for its inhabitants, they're counting on      us to take them in and keep them safe.       America is trying to divide and conquer--focusing on      conquering Muslims as a whole rather than just ISIS. Rather      than attacking the Muslims in our country, we should be      focusing on the actual members of ISIS, and not people who      have no association with the organization.    ALEXIS MANCHESTER, GREEN MOUNTAIN TECHNOLOGY AND CAREER CENTER                                (FINALIST)       Today in America, people are going to prison wasting      countless economic resources and potentially ruining the      lives of people all because of the recreational use of      marijuana.       While people often say marijuana is a gateway drug, I      strongly disagree. There are more people that drink a glass      of milk per day and become addicted to more serious drugs,      than those who use marijuana. It is not uncommon to hear      echoes of this sentiment in other contexts as well,      particularly, the media and Presidential candidates. In fact,      Senator Sanders himself suggests that marijuana should be      legalized: ``I suspect I would vote yes. And I would vote yes      because I am seeing in this country too many lives being      destroyed for non-violent offenses. We have a criminal      justice system that lets CEOs on Wall Street walk away, and      yet we are imprisoning or giving jail sentences to young      people who are smoking marijuana. I think we have to think      through this war on drugs which has done an enormous amount      of damage.'' I strongly agree with this statement because      there is not one reported death from an overdose of      marijuana. In fact, 88,000 people have died from alcohol use.      I personally have never heard of somebody murdering someone      because they were under the influence of marijuana. Alcohol      on the other hand, has been proven to impact our culture      negatively.       Facts don't lie. 58% of Americans think marijuana should be      legalized, including me. Around 40% of Americans admit to      already using marijuana. If marijuana was legalized, we could      tax it and allow citizens who choose to use it to benefit our      communities in more effective ways than keeping it illegal.      Marijuana is a safer drug than others and there is a very low      risk of abuse. Marijuana can be safe and useful for instance.      Legalizing marijuana will bring the nation's largest cash      crop under the rule of law, creating jobs, and economic      opportunities in the formal economy instead of the illicit      market. Washington, Alaska, Oregon and Colorado haven't had      any major issues with their legalization. Washington State      raked in more than $70 million in taxes its first year of      legal regulated marijuana sales. In Colorado the total of      marijuana tax and license cash funds is the total of      $11,290,012 annually. Alaska stands to make between $5.1      million and $19.2 million in tax revenue from commercial      marijuana in 2016, according to the preliminary estimate by      the Alaska Department of Revenue. Oregon's first week of      recreational use of marijuana sales top $11 million dollars.      Clearly, the taxes incurred would positively benefit our      state and country should we choose to jump on board.       In closing, I hope you can appreciate my ideas, although I      am just one voice. America is a progressive kind of people      and we must do what we can to continue to demonstrate the      values that make us great. Thank you for your time.                          ____________________
