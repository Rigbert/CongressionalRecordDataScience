Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, in the age of ultrasound imaging and benign life enhancing healthcare interventions for the baby in the womb, how is it that Planned Parenthood first dehumanizes and then massively kills unborn children--more than 7 million since 1973--and then demands that taxpayers subsidize the organization to the tune of about $500 million?  Caught on numerous videos, Planned Parenthood abortionists describe how they dig with knives and cut out the inner organs of babies all while altering pain-filled dismemberment procedures so as to preserve intact baby hearts, lungs, and livers for a price.  This isn't the first time Planned Parenthood has been caught red-handed. In 2011, videos by Live Action exposed several Planned Parenthood clinics eager to facilitate secret abortions for undercover pimps for child sex trafficking. In 2012, more videos by Live Action exposed Planned Parenthood advising undercover investigators how to procure sex selection abortions for little girls.  Have we lost our capacity to be shocked? Can we not empathize with the child victim?  Support the override.
