  In his over more than two decades in the House of Representatives, Cummings became a living legend in his native Baltimore. By all accounts, he was a powerful and passionate voice on the national stage and was a strong advocate for his neighbors, his district, and his values. He counted close friends and admirers from all across the political spectrum.  The Capitol will lower its flags today to mark this significant loss and remember a life well lived. The Senate unites our prayers with those in the House for Maya, Elijah's wife; for his children; and for all of the colleagues, friends, and staff who will miss him greatly.                          ____________________
