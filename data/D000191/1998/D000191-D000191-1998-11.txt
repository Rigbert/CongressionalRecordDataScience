  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, today is day 109 of work for this do-nothing Congress. No budget, not done, we are going to do another temporary continuing resolution to fund the entire United States Government at 2:30 this afternoon.  The Republican leaders would like to blame the President for the fact that they have failed for the first time in 25 years in Congress to produce a budget resolution and a budget to send to the President. The reason they have failed is we have only worked 109 days here in Washington, D.C., and many of those days were starting at 5:00, out at 6:00. A lot of Americans would love to have that kind of a schedule.  The average American has worked 200 days this year. Day in, day out they have produced. They have worked, and they have gotten a modest salary.  The Republican Congress has worked only 109 days in Washington, D.C., and failed miserably in its most basic task, producing a budget, let alone in producing other legislation to protect Americans against health care fraud and other issues.                          ____________________
