I think he said it very well. I think it is very important, and the 11 freshman Members are probably in a better position than anyone else to remind the people that what happened on November 8, 1994 in an appropriate way at the ballot box, was, in fact, a revolution.  It is the first time in about 40 years that we have been able to look at Government and redefine its role and answer the question, has Government become involved in more things in a heavyhanded way, than it was intended to be involved in?  I know it is the liberal agenda of giving away, having programs for all needs, taking care of everyone from the cradle to the grave, is something that is easy to demagog, but to stand here and know that there are limited resources, I think it is irresponsible to continue that.  I think the people in November voted for changes, not so much Republican versus Democrat. Sure, the Republicans took over the House, and they took over the Senate. That is the first time that has happened. The main thing is that we campaigned for things that we have consistently voted for that contradict the behavior of Congress for the past 40 years.  When we look at Government's role, we have to ask the question, is Government's responsibility to take care of all the social needs? It is a difficult thing to talk about because it is easy to demagog.  I was distressed probably as much as anyone was when the President and others went out and said, well, the Republicans are trying to take the milk away from babies during the nutrition program debate when, in fact, the Republicans were suggesting a 4\1/2\ percent increase.  This is very disturbing. The people have awakened in America and they do not buy that kind of talk anymore. They are going to demand changes.  I have heard, and there is a perception that the U.S. Senate is operating so slowly, that we are not getting anything done. Now, I suggest, Mr. President, that we operate differently in the Senate, and as one who used to serve in the House of Representatives the same as the Senator from Wyoming, maybe we like the way that operates a little bit better because it is faster. And, the occupant of the chair was also there and knows what I am talking about.  On the other hand, there was not a day that went by in the U.S. House of Representatives when I was over there when this conversation did not occur. One would say, ``Are we really quite ready to vote on this? Should we refine it more?'' The answer is always ``Do not worry, the Senate will take care of that.''  For the first time in my life, when I was elected this last time to the U.S. Senate, I realized what our Founding Fathers had in mind when they said they wanted a bicameral system. In fact, we have to slow that train down.  How slow has the train been? The agenda, the Contract With America, had 10 items in it. In the House of Representatives, they were able to pass 9 of the 10. The only area that they did not pass was term limitations. In the Senate, in just the first 3 months, we passed congressional accountability, that is forcing Government to live under the same laws we pass.  We passed an unfunded mandates bill. As a former mayor of a major city, I can say that the major problem that exists in cities in America today is the fact that the Federal Government tells them what to do but does not send the money down. They are called unfunded mandates. We have passed that major reform here in the U.S. Senate, along with congressional accountability. A line-item veto--we have talked about line-item veto now for a long period of time. Now we have passed it here. We passed a moratorium on endangered species.  So we have actually handled about three or four of the major contract items and we are on schedule to handle the rest of them. But I honestly believe it is a responsibility, as the Senator from Wyoming said, of the freshman class, those of us who heard the mandate on November 8, 1994, to keep this train on track and to keep focused. We still have to finish up the rest of the items.  Right now, as soon as I leave the floor, I will be going over to the Environment and Public Works Committee hearing. Over there we are handling another one of the contract items; that is, doing something about the heavyhandedness of Government through its EPA regulations: what is happening in this country with the Superfund; what is happening with wetlands; what is happening with endangered species.  Oklahoma is somewhat of an agricultural State. As I traveled through, campaigning, I do not remember, of the hundreds of farmers I talked to during the campaign, any of them coming up to me and saying, ``I want to know what the farm bill is going to do. I want to know about price supports.'' What the farmers in Oklahoma and throughout America are concerned about is property rights. That is one of the things we talked about in the Contract With America, that we have the fifth amendment to the Constitution and the 14th amendment to the Constitution that guarantee our property rights, not to lose our property without due process. We all know when farmers have property that is declared to be wetlands, they lose the value of that, and I have every expectation we are going to be able to pass the Private Property Protection Act that is going to guarantee the protection of private property and the value of that property to all Americans. Again, this is one of the contracts.  In this same committee meeting we are going to be hearing about the Superfund problems that exist. We know, and it is a fact today, that there are people who have received phone calls and letters from the EPA that have put them out of business for something over which they had no control. One such case was a lumber store owner in Tulsa, OK, by the name of Jim Dunn. He got a letter from the EPA that would have put him out of business, invoking $25,000 a day fines. Checking to see what he was guilty of, we found that for 10 years he used the same person to sell his crankcase oil to. This contractor was licensed by the Federal Government, by the State of Oklahoma, even by the county and City of Tulsa, yet they came back and traced some of that oil to a Superfund site and came to the conclusion that he was liable. In the absence of joint and several reform, he could be liable for the whole amount. And for that he was threatened to be charged a fine of $25,000 a day and possible criminal sanctions. That is the very thing that we are not going to allow to happen. It is the overregulation, the heavyhandedness of Government.  The Endangered Species Act--I am very proud the Senator from Texas, Senator Hutchison, was able to get an amendment through on the floor to put some sanity on that, to slow that train down so that, before we add any new critters to the Endangered Species Act, we are able to sit back and look at the cost/benefit of all these things. It was not long ago they decided to put the Arkansas shiner under the Endangered Species Act. Here is a little minnow that I guess they have decided is more important than people are. It would cost the average farmer in Oklahoma who has runoff into the Canadian system about $2,000 to protect this critter.  [[Page S6133]] This is the type of foolishness we are going to stop. We are all sensitive to the environment and we are sensitive to the need for some controls. But we are not going to allow Government to continue its heavyhanded treatment of its citizens, the people who are out there who are paying for all this fun we are having in Washington.  So we have an agenda. Those of us who are the freshmen, the 11 freshmen--I am very pleased we are going to be driving this train, keeping it on track, keeping the focus, and not forgetting. Let me give assurances to everyone out there: We are not going to forget what the mandate was of November 8.  I yield the floor now to my very close friend from the House, where I served with him and was elected with him, and now he is a leader in the U.S. Senate, the Senator from Arizona, Senator Kyl.
