Chairman, reclaiming my time, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Green) for his comments. Mr. Chairman, I also want to thank him and congratulate him for his work on this subject.  Obviously, we have talked a lot about in the previous decade, previous century about prevention, about how health care would be much cheaper if we prevented illness as opposed to treating illness. Nothing has been so successful, I think, in that regard as has childhood immunization.  We have, in effect, eliminated some diseases that have afflicted children and human beings for centuries really; and, therefore, this investment in immunizations plays an incredible dividend. It is probably as good an investment as we can possibly make, so not only is it the right thing to do to keep children healthy and to protect them from diseases, but it is also, from a financial standpoint, a very worthwhile investment that saves us a very geometric savings for every dollar invested.  I thank the gentleman for his leadership and would be glad to yield to him for any comment he might have.
