  I wouldn't argue with a single thing that any of our colleagues has said about the importance of combating teenage drinking. Everybody thinks it is important to combat teenage drinking. Fortunately, over the past 20 years teenager drinking has gone down. However, according to a highly respected University of Michigan study, teenage drug use has gone up 46 percent since 1992.  We should let this effort to combat teenage drug use, which is dramatically on the increase, go forward. On another day in another contest, let's pursue an effort to deal with teenage drinking.  This amendment, regretfully, would gut a very important campaign to combat teenage drug use. That is not me speaking. That is Mario Cuomo and Bill Bennett, chairman of the Partnership for a Drug-Free America, who oppose this amendment, which is not to say that either one of those men is in favor of teenage drinking.  Let's keep this antidrug effort intact and let what we hope will be an effective advertising campaign go forward.  I thank Senator Campbell for yielding time to me.
