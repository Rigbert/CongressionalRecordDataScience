FRIST. The amendment in the underlying bill, not your amendment or mine, as the Senator pointed out earlier, is $100 million. As I understand it, the amendment of the Senator would take that up to a total of $500 million.  Our amendment will take $100 million on top of that with an understanding, as I said earlier, that funds comparable to that $500 million will be laid out by the administration over the next 2 weeks.
