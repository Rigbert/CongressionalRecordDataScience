 President, last Friday, on behalf of Senator Bob Kerrey and myself, I introduced legislation that will chart a new United States approach to the terrible problem of child exploitation in overseas labor markets.  This legislation, S. 553, the International Child Welfare Protection Act, will target new, additional trade benefits to countries that comply with the provisions of the International Labor Organization's Convention No. 138 concerning the minimum age for admission to employment, also known as the Minimum Age Convention.  The aim of the Minimum Age Convention is to abolish child labor throughout the world by establishing a minimum age at which children may be employed.  Our legislation will do two things:  It will give the President the authority to grant a country that complies with the Minimum Age Convention up to a 50-percent tariff rate cut on items produced in that country that would not otherwise be eligible for preferential tariff rates.  It will also permit the President to waive current limitations on the amounts of additional goods that countries complying with the Minimum Age Convention may export to the United States.  In the unlikely event the President finds that domestic industries are hurt because of these special, targeted trade benefits, the President also has the authority to suspend, limit, or withdraw the benefits.  This legislation is important for three reasons.  First, it is a tragic fact that child labor is rampant in many places in the world, despite more laws aimed at stopping this inhumane practice. International Labor Organization statistics show that between 100 and 200 million children worldwide are engaged in providing goods and services. Ninety-five percent of these children, according to the ILO, work in developing countries. Why are children pressed into service as low-paid or unpaid workers? Because, according to the ILO, children are ``generally less demanding, more obedient, and less likely to object to their treatment or conditions of work.'' It is very obvious that we must all do what we can to stop this unconscionable practice.  The second reason we need this legislation is because it is clear that regulation and enforcement alone will not work. Incentives are needed as well. The reason that it is so tough to enforce child labor standards is that it is often very difficult to trace specific products to specific plants in specific countries. The Department of Labor's Bureau of International Labor Affairs says that quantifying the extent of child labor in a particular country's export industry ``can seldom be done with specificity.'' If you can't even trace the goods or services with certainty, you can't expect enforcement alone to be the answer. Hence the incentives that are in our legislation.  Finally, we need this legislation because even though the ILO Minimum Age Convention was adopted in 1973, only 21 developing country member states out of 173 ILO member states have ratified the Convention to stop child labor. Out of the 21 developing country member states that have ratified the Convention, none is from Asia, where over half of all working children are to be found. If even one additional ILO member state ratifies the Convention because of the trade incentives this legislation offers, we will have achieved a great deal.  I am on the floor today stating again what is obvious but also to remind my colleagues, with the introduction of this bill by Senator Kerrey of Nebraska and myself on Friday, you have an opportunity to cosponsor this bill, and I hope you will do so. I hope then that we have results from legislation which we have already on the books to enforce regulation, but we also have results from these efforts that are presented in our legislation for a more market-oriented approach to helping solve this bad economic situation of very young child labor.  I ask unanimous consent that S. 553 be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 553       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``International Child Welfare      Protection Act''.     SEC. 2. ADDITIONAL BENEFITS FOR CERTAIN BENEFICIARY                    COUNTRIES.
