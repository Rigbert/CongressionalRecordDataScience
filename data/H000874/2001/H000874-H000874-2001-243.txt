Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson) for her contribution. I want to join her in saying that it was not any individual Member of this Congress of African American descent seeking to have a new book published with his picture. It was a thought, as the gentleman from New York (Mr. Meeks) mentioned and the gentlewoman has mentioned, that we have millions of young people around this country who are not sure of what the opportunities are. And knowing that there have been trailblazers who have done that and been there will give them a confidence that they, too, can seek opportunity and success in any place in America.  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cummings), my very close friend, who is the Vice Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus and a great leader of this Congress.
