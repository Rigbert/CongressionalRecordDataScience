 FRANKEN. One second. I want to explain the end of this.  So this was the unfunded liability--assuming people lived to 150 and still retired at 67. That meant an 83-year retirement and that we would live to 150. I assume the first 50 years would be great, the next 50 years not so great, and the last 50 years horrible. Ridiculous stuff.  Let's have an honest debate, for goodness' sake. Let's not put up charts that contend one thing and that are just not true.  I yield to Senator Sanders.
