Mr. Speaker, last month the House passed H.R. 795, the Rocky Boy's Water Rights Settlement Act. Today we have before us S. 438, a companion bill to H.R. 795. The only difference between these bills is a small change regarding the treatment of tribal water rights off reservation. This change has been agreed upon by all parties involved in the legislation. The Rocky Boy's Water Rights Settlement Act process has been important for a number of reasons. I congratulate the gentleman from Montana (Mr. Hill). In the State of Montana, the tribe has spent a good deal of time working on the issues in a constructive fashion, taking steps to minimize the impact on other affected water users.  Furthermore, there has been minimal emphasis on some of the outmoded basis that calculate in Federal reserve Indian water right claims. This process has allowed the parties to look to newer, more flexible negotiations that find the solutions which provide tribes with real opportunities without making demands that may destroy the economic livelihood of existing water users.  In addition, this process has brought new solutions, introduced private sector expertise into the tribe's efforts to utilize the water supplies once the settlement is authorized.  By approaching these water rights settlements in more creative ways, Congress and the Federal Government can narrow the divergent expectations of the parties as they enter negotiations and attempt to correct problems that have existed for decades. It is important for Congress to modernize the process and basis for settling these claims. It is taking far too long to arrive at a settlement. Often tribes receive water and money under circumstances that do not ultimately help them realize the benefits of a broader economy.  It is the intention of this settlement to help the tribe reach this goal of self-determination, and I urge my colleagues to support the legislation.
