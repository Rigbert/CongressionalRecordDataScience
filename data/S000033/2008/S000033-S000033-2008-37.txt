 Thankfully, thankfully--let's give credit where credit is due--by threatening their mass resignation, the top leaders of the Justice Department forced the President to revise his and the Vice President's legal justification for this wiretap program, making it only a bit less objectionable.  While I am opposed to the wiretapping program in its current form due to the fact that it does not have an adequate check on the power to monitor the conversations of innocent Americans, I do respect--and I hope we all respect--those individuals at the Department of Justice who, during this time in 2003 and 2004, stood up for the basic aspects of our legal system.
