Unfortunately, my Democratic colleagues have failed to reach this obvious conclusion, so let me offer them some help.  This is our country. This is our country's Outer Continental Shelf. There is oil and natural gas in the Outer Continental Shelf that belongs to us, the American people. As offshore oil production increases, our domestic oil supply increases. As oil supplies increase, prices will decline. Let me repeat that for my Democratic colleagues.  This is our country. This is our country's Outer Continental Shelf. There is oil and natural gas in the Outer Continental Shelf that belongs to us, the American people. As offshore oil production increases, our domestic oil supply increases. As supplies increase, prices will decline.  Hopefully, for the sake of the Americans that are suffering at the gas pump, our Democratic colleagues can learn what everybody else in the world has known all along: If you have energy resources, use them.                          ____________________
