President, we have had a lot of discussion about judicial nominees recently. One issue is on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals.  I mention that because at the time when President Clinton nominated highly qualified people to go there, my friends on the other side said the workload was such that the DC Circuit Court of Appeals didn't need extra judges. So they were never given a hearing, never given a vote. One of those nominees is now the dean of the Harvard Law School. In fact, the chief judge, as I recall, a Reagan appointee, said they definitely didn't need more judges; they didn't have the workload. He took that position consistently throughout President Clinton's term.  Now we have a new President. The workload has gone down in that court. But we have several people suddenly nominated for the seats that just a few months ago were unneeded, we were told, by all the Republican leadership. We were told by the Republican leadership on this very political court that we didn't need anybody. Suddenly we need somebody.  The interesting thing about that is the Washington Post, which has been very supportive--more supportive than most newspapers in the country--of President Bush's judicial nominees, no matter who they are, took a different position. Even that paper, which has basically given in many ways--and it is their right--a blank check to the administration, wrote an editorial this morning called ``Fueling the Fire.'' They basically ask what I have: What is the sudden change?  I ask unanimous consent that editorial be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Washington Post, Aug. 1, 2003]                            Fueling the Fire       In nominating people to fill the last two seats on the U.S.      Court of Appeals for the     D.C. Circuit, President Bush had a unique opportunity to      begin de-escalating the war now raging over judicial      nominations. The need for judges in these two slots--the 11th      and 12th authorized judgeships--is far from clear, as      Republicans argued in blocking the confirmation of qualified      Clinton administration nominees. Since then, the court's      workload has declined. Additional D.C. Circuit nominations      should have awaited a more comprehensive understanding of the      court's needs. If two more judges were needed, we had hoped      that Mr. Bush would have been mindful of the history and      nominated qualified candidates who easily could win      Democratic as well as Republican support. Instead, Mr. Bush      has nominated two people who will only inflame further      politics of confirmation to one of this country's highest-     quality courts.       Both nominees--White House counsel Brett M. Kavanaugh and      California Supreme Court Justice Janice Rogers Brown--are      people of substance, nominees whose records and      qualifications might well under other circumstances command      support. But these nominations could not be better calculated      to pour salt on Democratic wounds. Mr. Kavanaugh is a fine      lawyer who could be a fine judge. He also has spent the past      few years as, first, a key figure in former independent      counsel Kenneth W. Starr's investigation and, more recently,      an official in the White House counsel's office working on      such politically sensitive matters as judicial nominations      and executive privilege. Whatever the merits of his work in      these two roles, they are sore spots for Democrats.       Likewise, Justice Brown possesses a serious judicial mind.      But she also has a long record of opinions that will provoke      liberal anxiety; one, for example, declares in its opening      section that ``private property, already an endangered      species in California, is now entirely extinct in San      Francisco.'' It takes nerve for Mr. Bush to ask Senate      Democrats to confirm such people to positions whose very      necessity Republican senators were busily questioning until      only two years ago.       The White House appears to believe that any accommodation      of Democratic concerns would be a sign of weakness in the      face of the filibusters and stalling of the president's other      nominees. Mr. Bush's grievances are real; the Senate      continues to filibuster the nomination of the qualified      Miguel A. Estrada, for example, more than two years after his      nomination. But both sides in the past several years have      behaved badly in the fight over judicial nominations. Their      war may help both political parties rally their bases and      raise money. But it is deeply harmful, not least to the      public perception of judging as an apolitical task. And it      will not end until someone extends an olive branch. That      someone has to be the president, the only person with the      power to do it meaningfully. The D.C. Circuit would have been      a great place to start. Too bad Mr. Bush is too busy playing      politics to lead.
