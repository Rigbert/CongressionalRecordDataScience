Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Riverside Community Hospital, which will observe its 100th anniversary on December 2. For the past century, Riverside Community Hospital has been committed to delivering the very best healthcare to the people of Riverside and the Inland Empire.  One hundred years ago, local physicians in Riverside, concerned by the lack of available healthcare facilities and the performance of surgeries in private homes, formed what would become Riverside Community Hospital. In a meeting at the home of Dr. C. Van Zwalenburg, these local physicians pledged their own money to convert a 12-room house at the southwest corner of Eleventh and Orange Streets as the first hospital.  Shortly after the hospital opened, it was bursting at the seams and the construction of a new building was desperately needed. The citizens of Riverside generously provided much-needed financial assistance for the building's construction. In May 1904, a brand new two-story hospital building opened on Walnut Avenue, which would later become Brockton, between Eleventh and Twelfth Streets. The Riverside Daily Press described the new hospital as ``a handsome two-story building with pebble dash finish and a handsome pillared portico.''  Over the last 100 years, Riverside Community Hospital has seen its community change quite a bit. When it first opened the area was full of orange groves and people from Los Angeles drove east to take in the winter sun. A lot has changed since then but one thing has remained constant, Riverside Community Hospital's dedication to its friends and neighbors.  Riverside Community Hospital has demonstrated an ability to meet whatever challenges its faces: its staff has successfully adapted to a rapidly growing community; secured financial resources to meet the community's health demands; as well as, kept pace with scientific advances and technological changes.  On behalf of the citizens of the 43rd congressional district of California, as well as the countless number of patients they have served, I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks and congratulations to the Riverside Community Hospital for their 100 years of outstanding service to the community.                          ____________________
