 I gather he is saying he will take care of the consent for their side? I thank the Senator from Montana.  I ask unanimous consent at a time to be determined by the majority leader, after consultation with the Republican leader, the Senate proceed to consideration of H.R. 3996, the House-passed AMT bill, and it be considered under the following limitations: There be 1 hour of debate on the bill, equally divided between the two leaders or their designees, followed by a vote on a motion to invoke cloture on the bill; provided further, that if cloture is not invoked, then the only amendments in order to the bill be the following, and be offered in the following order: A substitute amendment to be offered by Senator McConnell or his designee, which is to be an unoffset AMT extension and an unoffset extenders package; a Baucus or designee first-degree amendment to the McConnell substitute which is to be a set of offsets for the extender package; a Sessions amendment related to AMT and exemptions; an Ensign amendment which is an AMT repeal and extends other expiring provisions; a DeMint amendment which relates to AMT and flat tax; provided further, that there be an additional 2 hours for debate on the bill, equally divided between the two leaders or their designees; that there be a time limitation of 2 hours for debate on each amendment equally divided in the usual form, provided that each amendment would require 60 votes in the affirmative for adoption and that each amendment that does not require 60 votes then be withdrawn; I further ask that, notwithstanding the adoption of any substitute amendment, the other amendments be in order, and finally that following the consideration of the above amendments, 60 votes be required for passage of the bill as amended, if amended.
