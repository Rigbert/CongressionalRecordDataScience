President, I answer my friend from North Dakota that we have been willing to move forward on amendments on the Energy bill. We are not the ones who brought up the extraneous cloture votes which are not going anywhere. Maybe some want to get off the Energy bill. I note that the distinguished Senator mentioned Senator Cantwell's amendment. I was very proud to support that amendment. It was excellent and, as the Senator said, it would protect the consumers.  It was interesting because, at one point, she had the amendment won, and you heard the snap, crackle, and pop, not of Rice Crispies but the arms being twisted and snapped as votes were being changed. Most of the power company lobbyists were saying to the leadership on the other side that you cannot allow that to go through, and votes were being changed. It came within two votes.  I agree with the Senator from North Dakota that people are going to look in the rear view mirror and say Senator Cantwell was right, and that should have been allowed to go through.
