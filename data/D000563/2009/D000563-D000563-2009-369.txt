This is not an amendment about transferring from Guantanamo to the United States. It is about whether we will spend the money to make sure, when these detainees are under trial in the United States, which they can be legally, they will be held safely. The Inhofe amendment precludes the expenditure of funds to improve the security of law enforcement facilities to contain these Guantanamo detainees.
