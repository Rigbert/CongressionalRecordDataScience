Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend and my colleague, who is really my friend and my brother, for yielding and for hosting this special order tonight, along with my friend, my colleague, and my brother, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LaHood).  I want to thank the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer) for those wonderful words and for being part of this journey, this dialogue, this trip, this privilege to Alabama.  In my position here in the Congress, but as an individual, as co-chair of an organization, Faith and Politics, with my good friend and brother the gentleman from New York (Mr. Houghton), this was our third trip to Alabama. We felt it was necessary for us to travel as Members of Congress with our spouses, with our staff members, and with our friends to go, to see, to feel, to travel the roads where other travelers 35 years ago and more to go back to Birmingham, as my colleague stated, to visit the church, to visit the park where the dogs and the fire hoses were used, to visit the city of Montgomery, visit Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s church, to visit the memorial to the civil rights martyrs, to travel to Selma and to visit the Brown Chapel AME Church, to walk across that bridge across the Alabama River one more time.  I think it was not just a trip, but it was an opportunity for us to bond, to become brothers and sisters, to become, yes, a band of brothers and sisters to engage in a meaningful discussion, a meaningful dialogue about race.  Because I think what the struggle was all about 35 years ago, and still today under the leadership of Doug Tanner and the good people of Faith and Politics, to bring us together to that point where we can lay down the burden of race and build a truly beloved community, to build a truly interracial democracy in America, where committee can forget about race and color and see people as people, as human beings.  I think that is what is so meaningful about a group of us coming together not as Democrats, not as Republicans, but as Americans, as men and women, who believe somehow and some way that we can find a way to create a sense of community, to create one house, one family, the American house, the American community.  So I am so thankful and grateful tonight to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer) for taking the time out to have this special order to share with our colleagues and share with our friends this journey to Alabama, this journey of reconciliation, this journey on understanding.                              {time}  2115
