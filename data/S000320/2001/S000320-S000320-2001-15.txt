 President, I rise today in remembrance of a long-time former employee of mine, Terry Michael Lynch. Terry was killed Tuesday morning at the Pentagon in the tragic and senseless events of a day that will never be forgotten in America. Terry worked for me for over 15 years, both in the House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate, and I would like to take this opportunity to reflect on the life of a dedicated family man and a true patriot.  Terry was born in 1952 in Youngstown, Ohio, Terry grew up as the son of a steel-factory administrator. he graduated from high school in Youngstown, and received both his bachelor's and master's degrees in history from Youngstown State. It was there that Terry met his wife of 24 years, Jackie.  Terry worked on Capitol Hill as an aide to former Alabama Republican Congressman Albert Lee Smith. Some of you might remember the Congressman. He began working for me in 1983, when I was a Member of the U.S. House of Representatives. When I entered the race for the United States Senate in 1986, Terry was one of the first volunteers to take personal time away from his family here in Virginia and travel throughout Alabama doing any task that was needed. Terry came over to the U.S. Senate with me as my Legislative Assistant assigned to the Armed Services Committee and continued in that position from 1987 through 1994. In 1995, Terry became a professional staff member of the Senate Intelligence Committee and for two years brought his expertise to the Intelligence Committee. He subsequently worked as a member of the professional staff of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee chaired by Senator Specter. Terry was most recently employed by the consulting firm of Booz Allen and Hamilton.  To say and give you all of this background does not touch the essence of Terry Lynch. He was one of the most loyal, caring, unpretentious, and compassionate human beings I have ever had the privilege of knowing. Terry was a foundation of strength and stability for everyone that knew and loved him. He was the kindest soul and the most dedicated and loving father to his two daughters, Tiffany and Ashley. Terry's passion for helping others, especially the men and women in uniform with which he so closely worked, was always evident over the course of his career. This week, former staff members have called from all over the world to express their deep grief. And, although they had not seen Terry in many years, he made such a strong impact on all of us that to this day, he still lives on in each of our hearts in some way. Terry Lynch's spirit and his memory will forever be with us--the people who worked with him and knew him in the House of Representatives, who worked with him and knew him in the Senate, and who worked with him and knew him in the Pentagon where he died.  We are all, I believe, better people for having known Terry Michael Lynch.  Terry was an intelligent man with a heart of gold. He was also a great American. His life should not have ended in this unfortunate and premature manner, because he had so much ahead of him. But I promise you I will do everything in my power to ensure that Terry's life, and the lives of all Americans affected by this terrible tragedy, did not end in vain.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.                          ____________________
