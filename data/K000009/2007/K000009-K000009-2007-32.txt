Speaker, I join with my colleague, Mr. Jordan, in extending deepest sympathy to the family of Specialist Neff, and thank him for his valorous service to our Nation.  At the same time, today I would like to welcome to our Chamber and ask my colleagues to join me in welcoming the students from Christ the King School in Toledo, Ohio, 57 strong, who are here today, the future leaders of our country. We have sitting there future teachers, future astronauts, future Members of this House, future doctors, future military leaders, future librarians, future priests, future leaders in every sector. I'm just so pleased that they were able to visit our Nation's Capitol today. To see their enthusiasm and to know that America will be placed in their hands in a very short while gives me great hope for this 21st century. I know they will lead America to years of greater progress, greater opportunity and greater waves of peace for the people of our Nation and the people of the world. I'm so happy that they could visit today.                          ____________________
