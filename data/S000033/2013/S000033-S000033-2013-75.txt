 President, I rise to ask that this body pay high tribute to an outstanding leader and trusted advocate for our nation's injured and ill veterans, their families, and survivors. I am referring to Arthur H. Wilson, the chief executive officer and national adjutant of the Disabled American Veterans. Mr. Wilson, after dedicating 47 years of service to our nation's veterans, is retiring as leader of that august group of 1.2 million veterans. His steadfast devotion and dedication in leading DAV has made the organization the Nation's premier veterans service organization offering assistance, compassion, and support to our injured heroes.  DAV is a service organization representing the brave men and womenwho have suffered and survived wartime military service. Founded in 1920 by those wounded in World War I, DAV has been a devoted advocate for 92 years on behalf of those who have sacrificed for our freedom.  Mr. Wilson served with distinction in the U.S. Air Force as a runway construction specialist from 1962 to 1966, including service in Southeast Asia. He joined DAV as a national service officer trainee in Atlanta following his honorable discharge in 1966. He was subsequently assigned as a national service officer in Buffalo, NY, and Philadelphia, PA, and later held supervisory positions in DAV's national appeals office at the Department of Veterans Affairs' Board of Veterans Appeals in Washington, DC, in 1974.  In 1976, Mr. Wilson was promoted to management duties at DAV's National Service and Legislative Headquarters in Washington, DC, serving for 12 years as national service director before being appointed Executive Director of the Washington headquarters in 1993.  For the past 19 years, Mr. Wilson has served as national adjutant and chief executive Officer of DAV.  He is retiring from his distinguished career as only the sixth national adjutant in the history of the organization. He also serves as president of the Disabled Veterans' LIFE Memorial Foundation working to build the American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial in Washington, DC, and is a member of the board of trustees of the USS Intrepid Museum Foundation.  I ask my colleagues to join me in extending our nation's thanks to Arthur Wilson for his dedication and commitment to our nation's veterans and his leadership of DAV. His devotion to America's wartime heroes serves as a brilliant example to all citizens of our nation.                          ____________________
