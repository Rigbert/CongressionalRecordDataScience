President, approximately 3.4 million students entered kindergarten in U.S. public schools lastfall, and experts predict wildly different futures for them. Many children do well throughout elementary school, only to slip and fall between the cracks in middle school. This so-called ``achievement gap'' opens wide in middle school and grows throughout high school if nothing is done to stop it.  Raising test scores in K-12 education has brought the achievement-gap issue to the forefront of the national education debate and created a new opportunity to support those states that are making a real effort to improve student achievement. But trying to close the gap by simply bumping up test standards only pushes kids out of school rather than across the gap.  Few have really looked at the most logical place to begin to close the gap: summer school. Students take their achievement tests in April but have to return to school in the Fall. Summer school is one place to begin helping students close the gap, yet the Federal government does nothing to create and support successful summer academic programs.  The legislation I am introducing today, the Student Education Enrichment Development Act, or SEED Act, will leverage summer academic programs to boost student performance. SEED will support all struggling students by providing the first federal funds to backstop state and local efforts to develop, plan, implement, and operate high quality summer academic enrichment programs.  The disparity in school performance tied to race and ethnicity, known as the achievement gap, shows up in grades, test scores, course selection, and college completion. To a large extent, these factors predict a student's success in school, whether a student will go to college, and how much money the student will earn when he or she enters the working world. It happens in cities and in suburbs and in rural school districts. The gaps are so pronounced that in 1996, several national tests found African-American and Hispanic 12th graders scoring at roughly the same levels in reading and math as white 8th graders. By 2019, when they are 24 years old, current trends indicate that the white children who are now nearing the end of their first year in school will be twice as likely as their African-American classmates, and three times as likely as Hispanics, to have a college degree.  In Oregon last year, only 52 percent of the tenth graders met the state's standard for reading, while only 36 percent met the standard for math. But students in Oregon are actually doing better than the national average. More than two-thirds of American high-school seniors graduated last year without being able to read at a proficient level. Results like these are the reason we need SEED.  This week's Time Magazine reports that at least 25 percent of our U.S. school districts are mandating summer school for struggling students--twice that number in poor urban areas. While these programs are helping some students, the results should be better. Only 40 percent of New York students who failed state exams and completed summer school passed on the state exam on their second attempt. In the Pacific Northwest, Seattle canceled its summer program after students made only meager academic gains. I ask unanimous consent that the article from Time magazine be included in the record at the conclusion of my statement.  Schools should strive to meet higher standards, and we should have high expectations for every child. But our kids should not be punished because our education system has failed them. It's time to make sure every child learns and succeeds. According to a recent study, more than half of our teachers promoted unprepared students because the current system does not provide adequate options.  High-quality summer academic programs would give struggling students a chance to succeed in a system that has failed them and help reverse the trend of poor student performance by preparing students to succeed where they have previously failed. Over the past years, we've heard a lot of rhetoric about education, but empty promises won't help our kids learn. Our children deserve more.  I am pleased to be joined by Senators Landrieu, Breaux and Bayh in introducing the bill today, and ask unanimous consent that my statement and a copy of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2970       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Student Education Enrichment      Demonstration Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds that--       (1) States are establishing new and higher academic      standards for students in kindergarten through grade 12;       (2) no Federal funding streams are specifically designed to      help States and school districts with the costs of providing      students who are struggling academically, with the extended      learning time and accelerated curricula that the students      need to meet high academic standards;       (3) forty-eight States now require State accountability      tests to determine student grade-level performance and      progress;       (4) nineteen States currently rate the performance of all      schools or identify low-performing schools through State      accountability tests;       (5) sixteen States now have the power to close, take over,      or overhaul chronically failing schools on the basis of those      tests;       (6) fourteen States provide high-performing schools with      monetary rewards on the basis of those tests;       (7) nineteen States currently require students to pass      State accountability tests to graduate from high school;       (8) six States currently link student promotion to results      on State accountability tests;       (9) excessive percentages of students are not meeting their      State standards and are failing to perform at high levels on      State accountability tests; and       (10) while the Chicago Public School District implemented      the Summer Bridge Program to help remediate their students in      1997, no State has yet created and implemented a similar      program to complement the education accountability programs      of the State.     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.       The purpose of this Act is to provide Federal support      through a new demonstration program to States and local      educational agencies, to enable the States and agencies to      develop models for high quality summer academic enrichment      programs that are specifically designed to help public school      students who are not meeting State-determined performance      standards.
