 Let's debate the issues on the floor.  I hope we show our respect to the veterans by not getting into issues that have nothing to do with veterans' needs. I hope we are not off debating Iran or ObamaCare or gay marriage or whatever it may be. I guess those are good political issues for some people. I hope people understand how significant and important the issue itself is--the needs of our veterans--and we stay focused on that issue as we bring forth amendments.  With that, I yield the floor.
