Speaker, I rise in tribute to someone whom I have known and called a friend for many, many years--over three decades, perhaps four--Barbara Mikulski--the tallest short person I have ever met. She fills a room. Everybody knows when Barbara Mikulski is in the Chamber or in the room or in the auditorium.  Barbara Mikulski, as you have heard, will retire at the end of this Congress after having served Maryland in the House and Senate since 1977. I had the opportunity to serve with her in this House for some 6 years.  For 40 years, she has been a voice for the people of our State, not just a voice for all people, but, in particular, for those people whose voices needed amplifying: the poor, the sick, the overworked, the underpaid, the Baltimore dockworkers worried for their jobs, the women earning less than their male colleagues for the same work, the children in foster care or in homeless shelters. All of them have come to see Barbara Mikulski as their champion.  In many ways, she began her career as a social worker and brought that work to Congress. She returns as one of the most successful social workers in history. She has worked hard to clean up the Chesapeake Bay, to support America's first responders, and to broaden our exploration of space and science. What a giant she has been for NASA. She has helped seniors afford health care and keep America's promise to its veterans. She passed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, introduced the Paycheck Fairness Act to end the wage gap once and for all, and has fought continuously to raise the minimum wage.  Senator Mikulski blazed the trail as the longest-serving woman in the history of Congress; was the first woman to be elected without a relative as a predecessor; and was the first woman and first Marylander to chair the Appropriations Committee. She has left an indelible mark on millions across Maryland and across America.  I have been proud to serve alongside her and I will miss her in the Capitol as I know so many others will as well. My colleagues and I rise. We will lament the loss of Senator Mikulski as our colleague in the Congress, but we will be so proud that we have been able to call her colleague and friend.                          ____________________
