President, today for the second time in a month, the Senate of the United States has gone on record supporting sensible gun safety legislation. It has gone on record to say that we should close the gun show loophole; that we should ban the importation of large capacity ammunition clips; that we should require the use of child safety locks; that we should prohibit the possession of assault weapons by juveniles.  This body could not be clearer on where it stands when it comes down to the issues. What is confusing is the fact that we are unable to reach these issues in a substantive, decisive way because the legislation is not on this floor but bottled up in a conference committee.  We are responding to many things. Most recently, we were responding to hundreds of thousands of American men and women who came to this capital to ask their Senators to act. How do we act? We do it by debate and by voting. That is what we did this afternoon. It is difficult, sometimes, to achieve a vote because of the procedures of the Senate, but in consequence of that, there has always been the presumption that debate should be free ranging, should be open, and should be easy to obtain.  Today, we should celebrate not only the victory--again, within a month--of what I think is reason over unreason, of sensible safety when it comes to guns, over a fascination with the proliferation of weapons in society, but we all should celebrate the fact that finally and ultimately we have gotten a chance to speak about this issue, speak for the hundreds of thousands of mothers who came last weekend to Washington to ask us to live up to our oaths and our duty and to protect their children and all Americans by enacting sensible gun safety legislation.
