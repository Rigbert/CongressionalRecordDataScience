 President, we have hotlined in both cloakrooms all offices asking for an indication of how many amendments might be offered to the underlying resolution. Regretfully, it is roughly 50.  I am authorized to say on behalf of the majority leader, it is our intention to wrap up business this week. We haveno intention of trying to shut out any Senators who want to offer amendments. We had hoped some might come over tonight and offer them. We will certainly have all day tomorrow to deal with any and all amendments that Senators feel strongly about and on which they would like to have votes. But we really must move the process along, and that is the reason the majority leader wished to file a cloture motion tonight.
