President, I want to take a minute to call the Senate's attention to a small U.S. aid program in Afghanistan that has a big impact, which I suspect few people here know about.  Shortly after 9/11 and the U.S. invasion to topple the Taliban, a young Californian woman named MarlaRuzicka traveled alone to Afghanistan where she soon learned about incidents where U.S. bombs had missed their targets and killed civilians. The international press ran stories about those tragedies but nothing was being done to take responsibility for what had happened or help the families of the victims.  Marla decided to do something about it, and she organized protests at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, rallied the media, and not long after was in Washington urging Congress to help the families and show that the United States does not turn its back on innocent victims of our own mistakes.  It was because of Marla that we started a new program, now known as the Afghan Civilian Assistance Program, ACAP, which is managed by the U.S. Agency for International Development and implemented by the Afghan staff of the International Organization for Migration. Over the past 8 years, ACAP has provided millions of dollars in small grants to families and communities that have suffered losses as a result of the military operations. The funds have been used for such things as to rebuild a house that was damaged or destroyed, buy a herd of sheep, start a small grocery or weaving business, or provide medical care or vocational training.  After the invasion of Iraq, Marla moved on to Baghdad and, to make a long story short, again thanks to her advocacy we started a similar program there. Tragically, on April 16, 2005, she too became an innocent victim, and died, along with her Iraqi colleague Faiz Ali Salim, in a car bombing. That program is now known as the Marla Ruzicka Iraqi War Victims Fund, and it has helped the families of thousands of innocent Iraqi victims rebuild their lives.  Earlier this week I received from USAID some descriptions of recent ACAP assistance to Afghan families. While they describe exceedingly tragic losses of innocent life, they also illustrate the difference a program like this makes and why it is so important to our larger goals in that country. I ask unanimous consent that they be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                            Northern Region             Dawri Rabat Village, Chardara District, Kunduz       School teacher Ghulam Sakhi was shot dead during a      firefight between international military forces and the      Taliban. The incident happened in the village of Nahri Suf,      Chardara District, in February 2010. Ghulam Sakhi was the      breadwinner for his family. He left behind his wife, four      daughters and five sons.       His eldest son Zabihullah is 20 years old and a student.      After the death of his father, Zabihullah was forced to take      responsibility for his family. He decided to leave school in      search of work. He was unsure how he would be able to support      his family.       ACAP provided Ghulam Sakhi's family with a livestock      business, together with the full range of standard kits, plus      a livestock kit.       Zabihullah said: ``After my father was killed, life was      very hard for us. We asked for help from Allah. We were very      happy when a worker from ACAP came to interview us and      offered help. We were told we would be given help setting up      our own small business. We chose a livestock business because      my mother, sisters and brothers could take care of the      animals, leaving me with the time to resume my education. We      sell the milk from the cows to a dairy and make enough money      not to be worried. Without this help, my family would find it      very difficult to live. Now we can earn a living for      ourselves.''                             Western Region             Eshaq Suleiman village, Injil District, Herat       Widow Zubaida lost her son during an air strike on her      village in October 2001. A total of 26 civilians were killed      and 62 injured in the incident. Fourteen families suffered      serious damage to their property.       ACAP was informed of the incident several years later and      recently completed a monitoring report in order to measure      the impact of assistance on one widow's life.       Zubaida had received a small livestock business. Her      children and grandchildren received educational lessons. ACAP      also provided Zubaida with the full range of the program's      standard kits, which include household goods, as well as      educational, tailoring, and livestock items.       She told the ACAP monitoring assistant: ``After the death      of my husband in an IED explosion in late 2000, my son      Abdullah was the only supporter of our family. He was running      a shop and we could handle the difficulties of life. Abdullah      and I were living in a small rented house happily but it did      not last long.       ``One year later there was a conflict in Eshaq Suleiman,      where I am originally from. We were bombarded due to the      presence of Taliban fighters in the area. In the morning      Abdullah left the house to work but he did not come back      again. After the death of Abdullah I not only lost my son but      my only supporter.''       She added: ``I was not able to pay the rent any more so I      left the house and went to live in my daughter's house. I      tried to find a job. I did everything I could. I worked as a      housemaid--cooking, cleaning, and washing. Life was passing      with difficulties but then your colleague came to meet me six      months ago.       ``I received the livestock through which I now earn my      living. Before I felt that I was a burden on my daughter and      resting on her husband's shoulder but now I have a source of      income that pays for the house expenditures. Farzanah and      Khalil Ahmad, my granddaughter and son, are enjoying the      education assistances of your office. They are both attending      an English course. I received all the needed equipment for      keeping my livestock. Receiving the assistance from ACAP has      changed my life and that is why I am really grateful for this      program.''       Another victim of the incident whom ACAP has helped is      mother-of-three Rezagul. She lost her husband in the fierce      bombardment. Rezagul has two sons and one daughter. After her      husband died, her eldest son Gul Ahmad, who was 13 at the      time, was forced to abandon school to become the breadwinner      for the family. He tried his best to continue his education      in his spare time but it proved too difficult for him.       He was responsible for financially supporting his mother as      well as his younger brother Basir Ahmad and sister Sima Gul.      He knew that if he did not work full-time then his family      would face severe hardship.       An ACAP field assistant assessed the family's requirements.      A small business grant was approved which was used to set up      a grocery shop. Rezagul's daughter Sima Gul received English      lessons. ACAP also provided standard kits.       Sima now helps her brother run their family grocery      business. She packs the dry fruit which is sold to export      companies. Rezagul told how she no longer has money worries.      She said: ``My husband was the only financial supporter of      the family. Losing him was extremely difficult. My son did      not have a fixed job.'' She added: ``We always wanted to have      a family business where my younger son and I could help in      the absence of my eldest son. But we could not afford that.      But we have been given that opportunity through your      generosity.''                            Northern Region              Omarkhil village, Ali Abad District, Kunduz       An ISAF air-strike on two oil tankers captured by the      Taliban resulted in a high civilian death toll. It is      estimated that 70 civilians were killed and dozens injured.      ACAP has helped 59 families affected by the incident. One      beneficiary said that assistance from ACAP helped prevent up      to 600 men from joining the Taliban. The air-strikes took      place in September 2009 in Kunduz province. The Taliban had      hijacked two NATO oil tankers but one of the vehicles became      stuck in mud at a riverbank. German forces called in air      support and a U.S. Air Force F-15E was dispatched to destroy      the tankers. Local villagers had flocked to the abandoned      tankers in order to siphon off fuel. They were mistaken for      insurgents.       One of the affected families which ACAP helped is that of      widow Lailoma. When her husband was killed in the air-strike,      she was left unable to financially support her five children.       Lailoma had to rely on friends' charity until ACAP stepped      in. Lailoma received the full range of standard kits, which      include household goods, as well as educational, tailoring,      and livestock items. Lailoma decided to use her ACAP small      business grant to buy a pick-up truck. She teamed up with a      business partner and now the business generates enough money      so that she can comfortably support her family.                          ____________________
