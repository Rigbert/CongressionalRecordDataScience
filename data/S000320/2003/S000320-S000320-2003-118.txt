 President, I want to associate myself with the statement of Senator Voinovich regarding the importance of the M1A2 System Enhancement Program. I strongly support providing the necessary funding to modernize the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment (ACR) tank fleet. I would ask Chairman Stevens and Senator Inouye to work with us to find a way to address this important issue in conference.
