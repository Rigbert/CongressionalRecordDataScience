President, I rise today to pay tribute to a remarkable and legendary Illinoisan, Jerome Holtzman. Mr. Holtzman was a pioneer of baseball writing and renowned for his numerous accomplishments. He passed away on July 19 at the age of 81.  The first official historian of Major League Baseball, Holtzman wrote about the game, but truly he cared about the people. He was known for spending time with umpires before games and was able to bring generations of fans together through his columns.  Jerome Holtzman was a true American success story. In 1943, at the youthful age of 17, he started his newspaper career as a copy boy for the Chicago Times. After 2 years in the U.S. Marine Corps during World War II, he covered high school sports at the Times and Sun-Times.  He started at the bottom, but he impressed many along the way. Holtzman stayed on as a baseball beat writer and columnist at the Chicago Sun-Times for 30 years. It was at the Sun-Times where Holtzman met his wife Marilyn Ryan. With their five children, they lived in Evanston--in a home frequented by baseball fans and Jerome Holtzman fans. He spent the last 10 years of his career writing for the Chicago Tribune.  One of the most distinguished honors Holtzman achieved over his remarkable career was the induction into the writers' wing of the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1989. His colleagues knew him as ``the Dean,'' a nickname given to him by fellow Hall of Famer Billy Williams. The nickname reflects his stature as a baseball-writing ``lifer'' and his loyal dedication to the game.  Among his accomplishments was the creation of the save. Holtzman's save rule became an official Major League Baseball statistic that acknowledges effective relief pitching. Acknowledging his profound influence, former Sun-Times columnist Bill Gleason stated, ``The reality is, he revolutionized baseball.''  In addition to his columns, Holtzman was the author of six books, including a classic titled ``No Cheering in the Press Box.'' Many columnists considered his book required reading and a foundation to baseball writing. Cubs Chairman Crane Kenney remembered Holtzman as ``an accomplished writer who earned respect from both his readers and from those whom he covered.''  Jerome Holtzman will be remembered as a great friend and mentor. Chicago and baseball fans across the Nation have lost a celebrated sportswriter and icon, but future generations will continue to remember his great legacy and influential contributions to the game.                          ____________________
