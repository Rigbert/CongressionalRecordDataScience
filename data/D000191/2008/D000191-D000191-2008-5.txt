  Mr. DeFAZIO. Madam Speaker, there are many of us from day one who questioned the Paulson premise that dumping $700 billion into bad debt on Wall Street would somehow help revive the American economy, help Main Street, help small businesses, help the people I'm here to represent. I believe today gives us an opportunity to step back and begin again to construct a package that does not put the taxpayers at risk for $700 billion.  William Isaac headed up the FDIC during the savings and loan crisis. He took a $100 billion problem and he solved it for $2 billion; he says we can do the same thing here, pennies on the dollar. And then, that would leave a lot of borrowing capacity to help begin to inject money into public works projects, infrastructure in this country, other things that benefit average Americans, put us back to work, and make us a more competitive economy.  We need to go back to the drawing board with a democratic proposal. Hank Paulson just got his rejection notice here from Congress.                          ____________________
