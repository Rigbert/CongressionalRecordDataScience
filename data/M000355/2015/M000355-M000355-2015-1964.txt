 President, today the Senate is continuing to consider S. 1, a bill to approve the Keystone XL Pipeline. Chairman Murkowski and Senator Cantwell are here this morning to manage debate, and there are several amendments pending. We will begin voting on those--and any amendments in the queue--around 2:15 p.m. on Tuesday afternoon.  I encourage all Senators who have not already done so to talk to the bill managers about scheduling a time to come down and offer their amendments.  It has taken a while to get going on this bill, and the last thing we need at this point is for Members who have been saying they want to have amendments to be reluctant to offer them.                          ____________________
