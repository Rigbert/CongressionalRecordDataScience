 Speaker, for the benefit of my colleagues I would like to have printed in the Record this statement by high school students from Canaan High School in Vermont, who were speaking at my recent town meeting on issues facing young people.       Mr. Fillion. Congressman Sanders, fellow students, we are      here today to voice our opinion on the legalization of      industrial hemp. Industrial hemp is not a drug, it is not      marijuana; it is a relative of the marijuana plant, but      contains virtually no delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC,      the mind-altering drug found in marijuana. This means that      industrial hemp cannot get anyone high, even the most      stubborn pot smoker.       There are innumerous benefits to be gained from the      cultivation of industrial hemp. If only 6% of the contiguous      United States were used to grow hemp, it could supply to us      all of the electricity, heat, and all the fuel we need for      our cars. Hemp could also be used to make stronger and more      moisture-resistant paper which would stop paper from      shrinking, curling or deteriorating as easily. An acre of      hemp can produce four times as much paper as an acre of      trees, saving this country's diminishing forests and the      rainforest.       Vermont definitely could benefit from industrial hemp's      legalization. If Vermont's agricultural and dairy farmers      would turn to industrial hemp as their main asset, the      farmers could quadruple their agricultural income.       These are just a few of the ways that industrial hemp can      be utilized. We would like to know why we are striving if      this invaluable resource can help us so tremendously with our      problems today?       Mr. Paul. Hemp can be used to improve so many of the      products that we use today. It can be used in ropes and sails      for ships; stronger papers and materials ranging in quality      from burlap to silk; and healthier, less fatty foods,      especially meat substitutes and birdseed.       Hemp can be used for fuel with a 95% efficiency conversion,      and unlike fossil fuels (petroleum) or nuclear power, it is a      renewable and replenishable resource, and it is extremely      easy to grow in nearly all climates, including Vermont's.       Hemp fiber needs little more than nitrogen to grow. Even      here in Vermont hemp and other cannabis plants grow wild in      ditches and forests. In fact, Australia survived two 19th      century famines on the seeds and leaves of industrial hemp      alone.       Mr. Fillion. Many officials believe that legalizing hemp      would lead to the legalization of marijuana and eventually      even harder drugs such as cocaine and heroin. There is no      basis whatever for these assumptions. Industrial hemp, as we      have stated, is not a drug,     so how do you go from legalizing harmless plants to      legalizing hard-core drugs? There is no connection between      the two.       It makes no sense to be afraid of a plant that has been      grown for thousands of years around the globe. In fact,      industrial hemp was grown in the United States in the 18th      and 19th centuries. It was made illegal in 1937 by the Food      and Drug Administration, but only years later during World      War II, it was relegalized because of economic troubles. It      makes more sense to be afraid of not having it.       Industrial hemp's roots are strong and very extensive, and      have been shown to hinder and ultimately prevent erosion in      such erosion-prone places as China where hemp, but not      marijuana, is legal.       We are not for the legalization of marijuana; we are for      the legalization of industrial hemp.       The government already knows the great benefits of      legalizing industrial hemp. Our question is, what's the      holdup?       Mr. Paul. Because they do not really know the facts. There      are a lot of differences between industrial hemp and      marijuana, but because of the world hemp a lot of people have      come to believe is a slang word for marijuana. They confuse      the two and believe that they are the same thing.       Mr. Fillion. Industrial hemp is a biomass like many other      plants, and by using a procedure called porolysis it can be      diverted into something that can be used for fuel and into      things such as crude oil or oils close to vegetable oil and      petroleum.                               ____________________
