President, I rise today to pay tribute to GEN James E. Cartwright, who is retiring after 40 years of accomplished military service. Since becoming the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on August 4, 2007, General ``Hoss'' Cartwright has testified numerous times and provided expert testimony, leadership, and advice to Congress, the President, and the American people regarding our Nation's security and the future of our Armed Forces.  General Cartwright hails from Rockford, IL. He graduated from the University of Iowa in 1971 and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the U.S. Marine Corps shortly thereafter. The general served as a naval flight officer in the F-4 and as a pilot in the F-4, OA-4 and the F-18. His flying career culminated with command of the First Marine Aircraft Wing in Okinawa, Japan. The general is also a distinguished graduate of the Air Command and Staff College and earned his master of arts in national security and strategic studies from the Naval War College.  After an assignment as the Director for Force Structure, Resources and Assessment, J-8, on the Joint Staff, then-Lieutenant General Cartwright was selected for promotion to general and became the first Marine Corps officer to lead U.S. Strategic Command. While at STRATCOM, General Cartwright led the development of strategies during a rapidly evolving national security environment, particularly in the areas of cyber, space, nuclear proliferation, and missile defense. He reorganized the command to increase interagency cooperation and streamlined operations. As a result of the changes the general implemented at STRATCOM, the effectiveness of the command for the deployed warfighter increased substantially to meet the new challenges of the 21st century.  During the last 4 years, General Cartwright has served as Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. One of his top priorities has been to reduce the loss of American lives in combat by leveraging technology and streamlining acquisition processes to quickly iver new capabilities to the battlefield. His efforts to lead the MRAP program resulted in a 50 percent decrease in deaths attributed to improvised explosive device attacks.  The general can take pride in many other notable accomplishments, including the integration of technologies that enabled the destruction of a failing satellite by a missile for the first time and the successful raid against Osama bin Laden.  During his service, General Cartwright took every opportunity to recognize the efforts and sacrifice of the 2.4 million active, guard and reserve members of the Armed Forces and their families. He remains actively engaged for the benefit of our wounded warriors and always remembers the families of those who made the ultimate sacrifice on our battlefields. General Cartwright will be remembered for his strategic intellect and his ability to drive innovative change. His tenure leaves a lasting legacy to the Armed Forces. I appreciate his extraordinary service to our country and wish him all the best in the next chapter of his life.                          ____________________
