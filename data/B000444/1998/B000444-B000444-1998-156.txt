 President, as we focus on improving our education system on the national state and local levels, it is my pleasure to offer congratulations to an award-winning teacher from Dover, Delaware who exemplifies excellence in education for her students, her community, my home state of Delaware, and indeed, this nation.  For the second consecutive year, Patty Richardson Hinchey received the second place award in the category ofAchievement/Research--Faculty Adviser of Student Publications for Secondary Schools. This award is given by the prestigious National Federation of Press Women. The award recognizes the outstanding high school journalism advisers/teachers.  Patty also won first place in the State of Delaware competition for the past two years in the same category from the Delaware Press Women, which made her eligible for the national award.  What my colleagues might find most interesting and ironic--the name of the student newspaper at Dover High School for which Patty is the faculty adviser is ``The Senator.'' The 24-page award-winning issue captivated the pulse of student activities, highlighted the history of soon-to-be graduates, spotlighted student leadership during their four years at Dover High School, congratulated Athletes of the Year, and featured articles about teachers who make a difference.  Patty's work on the student newspaper goes well beyond the final afternoon school bell. She and her students calculated spending more than 6,000 hours in the last four years putting editions of ``The Senator'' to bed. Even more remarkable, due to a school-related accident leaving Patty unable to walk, she worked from her home with the students to get the final issue to press on time.  I have spoken often about the need in this day and age to give young people an ``excuse'' to stay on the road to achievement, stay in school, stay away from alcohol, drugs and gangs, and stay off the streets. Student newspapers, like Dover High School's, and teachers like Patty Hinchey, are providing these students with that valuable ``excuse.'' This is positive peer pressure, and our country needs more of it. The students know they have to keep their grades up, get their work done on strict deadlines, and keep out of trouble or else they will not experience the thrill and pride of seeing their byline on an article they researched and wrote.  So, I want to thank Patty for providing these award-winning students the opportunity to be their very best and strive for excellence in their work. The lessons and values they have learned working on the school newspaper will serve them well throughout their lives--the lessons of deadlines, responsibility, accountability, how to communicate verbally and in writing, and most importantly how to get along with and respect other people.  I could go on about how impressed I am with Patty, but listen to what her students say about her. The Editor-in Chief of ``The Senator'' said: ``Mrs. Hinchey is an inspirational, talented, creative, hard-working, and most importantly, loving teacher. I am currently a senior and have been in her class since my freshman year. Over this time, I have been able to observe how many students she has become close to and how many people both trust and respect her.''  Another student, Kate Basone, Advertising Editor, said: ``Mrs. Hinchey inspired the students to produce work that reflected their best effort. She would not accept articles that she felt were not up to the standards of ``The Senator'' which she established. Therefore, because of her constant pushing and sometime pulling, many students found themselves producing some of their best work.''  Patty is not only a talented teacher, she is a terrific mother to her daughter Andrea, who is student at the University of Delaware, and a career military wife to the now retired Lieutenant Colonel John Hinchey.  It is with great pleasure that I congratulate Patty Richardson Hinchey for her outstanding accomplishments as an awarding-winning teacher and faculty adviser for the Dover High School newspaper ``The Senator.''                          ____________________
