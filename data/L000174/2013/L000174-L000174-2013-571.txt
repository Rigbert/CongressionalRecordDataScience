President, any one of us can only imagine what it would be like to be wrongly arrested, tried, convicted, and sentenced to death for a crime we did not commit. And whatever we imagined would pale by comparison to reality.  Kirk Nobel Bloodsworth, who I am privileged to call a friend, was the victim of such a horrific miscarriage of justice. He served 9 years for the rape and murder of a young girl he never met, based on the mistaken identification by one of Kirk's neighbors.  Eyewitness identifications, assumed to be among the best evidence, are notoriously unreliable. Case after case demonstrates this. Take the massive search currently underway for Christopher Dorner, the former Los Angeles police officer suspected in three killings. The police have been inundated with numerous false ``sightings.''  Kirk Bloodsworth is a free man today not because the justice system worked. For 9 years it failed miserably, and during that time the real killer was free. Rather, he had to prove his innocence thanks to DNA evidence, which is not available in most cases. One shudders to think of the number of factually innocent people who may be serving long sentences for whom exoneration through DNA testing isn't an option.  A February 5, 2013, article in the New York Times quotes Kirk: ``The adversarial system doesn't know who's guilty or who's innocent. The millstone doesn't know who's under it.'' That article, entitled ``A Death Penalty Fight Comes Home,'' is notable because it describes the campaign Kirk is helping to lead to abolish the death penalty in Maryland, the State where he was convicted and sent to death row.  Kirk is an example of someone who was subjected to the basest indignities and humiliation, and who then came back to inspire others to prevent future unjust convictions. It is the mark of a man of extraordinary character and courage, who deserves our praise and admiration. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, Feb. 5, 2013]                    A Death Penalty Fight Comes Home                            (By Scott Shane)       Annapolis, MD--Kirk Noble Bloodsworth, a beefy, crew-cut      man whose blue T-shirt read ``Witness to Innocence,'' took      the microphone in a church hall here and ran through his      story of injustice and redemption one more time. Twenty years      ago, he walked out of a Maryland prison, the first inmate in      the nation to be sentenced to death and then exonerated by      DNA.       About 60 activists against the death penalty listened with      rapt attention, preparing to descend on state legislators to      press their case. Maryland appears likely in the next few      weeks to join the growing list of states that have abolished      capital punishment. Some longtime death penalty opponents say      no one in the country has done more to advance that cause      than Mr. Bloodsworth. But ending executions in Maryland, the      state that once was determined to kill him, would be a      personal victory for him.       Even for proponents of capital punishment, Mr.      Bloodsworth's tale is deeply unsettling. In 1984, he was a      former Marine with no criminal record who had followed his      father's profession as a waterman on the Eastern Shore of      Maryland. A woman glimpsed on television a police sketch of      the suspect in the rape and murder of a 9-year-old girl      outside Baltimore. She thought it looked like her neighbor      Kirk, and she called the police.       From there, with the police and prosecutors under intense      pressure to solve the crime, it was a short route to trial,      conviction and a death sentence for a man whose Dickensian      name, after all, seemed to imply guilt.       ``I was accused of the most brutal murder in Maryland      history,'' Mr. Bloodsworth, now 52, told the church audience.      ``It took the jury two and a half hours to send me to the gas      chamber.''       Only after nine years in the state's most decrepit and      violent prisons did Mr. Bloodsworth, through his own      perseverance and some aggressive lawyering, manage to get the      still-novel DNA test that finally proved his innocence in      1993.       Even then, prosecutors publicly expressed doubt about his      innocence. ``Nobody knew what DNA was then--it was sort of      shaman science, a `get out of jail free' card,'' he said in      an interview. It took another decade--and, again, Mr.      Bloodsworth's own dogged efforts--before officials ran the      DNA from the murder scene through a database and identified      the real killer, who is now serving a life sentence. He bore      little resemblance to the description that the police had      compiled from eyewitnesses.       Mr. Bloodsworth said he kept pursuing the test to clear      himself once and for all, but also to find the killer of the      girl, Dawn Hamilton, who was found in the woods stripped of      clothing from the waist down, her head crushed with a piece      of concrete. ``This was a ghastly, horrific thing,'' he said.       Even after his release, Mr. Bloodsworth could never quite      escape the false charges that had threatened him with      execution. He tried to return, he said, to ``a normal life,''      but he was haunted by what he had learned about the justice      system.       ``If it could happen to me, it could happen to anybody,''      he said. He threw himself into work against capital      punishment and for justice reform, first as a volunteer      speaker and later as a professional advocate. Last month he      began work as the advocacy director for Witness to Innocence,      a Philadelphia-based coalition of exonerated death row      inmates who push to end capital punishment.       The movement to end the death penalty has garnered more      support from politicians and the public as it has shifted      from moral condemnation of capital punishment to a more      practical argument: that mistakes by witnesses and the police      inevitably mean that innocent people will be executed. While      DNA gets the limelight, of 142 prisoners sentenced to death      and then exonerated in the last 40 years, just 18 were freed      over DNA     evidence, according to the Death Penalty Information Center      in Washington.       Use of the death penalty has been steadily declining, and      17 states no longer have it on the books, with 5 of them      abolishing it since 2007, said Richard C. Dieter, the      center's executive director. Executions dropped to 43 last      year from 98 in 1999.       ``These innocence cases are the biggest single factor,      because it has spread doubt throughout the system,'' Mr.      Dieter said.       Mr. Bloodsworth, a tireless public speaker who has visited      state after state to lobby for repeal, handing out a 2004      book on his case, called ``Bloodsworth,'' has used his own      experience to promote those doubts. ``I think no single      individual has changed as many minds as Kirk,'' said Jane      Henderson, the director of Maryland Citizens Against State      Executions, a lobbying group. ``He's articulate, patient, and      he's got a huge heart.''       His homespun eloquence has unmistakable appeal, but his own      tale is his most powerful argument. Prosecutors and jurors      ignored glaring problems with witnesses--two were boys who      did not pick Mr. Bloodsworth out of a lineup--and dismissed      five alibi witnesses who testified that he was home at the      time of the murder.       ``The adversarial system doesn't know who's guilty or who's      innocent,'' Mr. Bloodsworth said. ``The millstone does not      know who's under it.''       At the Maryland Penitentiary in Baltimore, he could stretch      out his arms and touch the sides of his cell. He stuffed      paper in his ears at night to keep the cockroaches out. His      skull was cracked by another inmate who swung a sock stuffed      with batteries. He was still locked up when his mother died.       After his release, he was pardoned and was paid $300,000 in      compensation by the state. But even as he worked for death      penalty abolition in other states, he became a regular      visitor to Annapolis, pressing legislators to learn from his      case. ``I'm a walking reminder for them,'' he said.       Delegate Barbara A. Frush, a Maryland legislator for 19      years, said a visit from Mr. Bloodsworth two years ago      changed her mind about capital punishment, which she had long      favored. ``I sat across the desk from him and looked in his      eyes and listened to his story,'' she said. ``It sent shivers      down my spine. I thought, I can't take the chance that I      might send an innocent man to death.''       This week, for the first time, he had a private visit with      the longtime president of the State Senate, Thomas V. Mike      Miller Jr., who has decided to allow a floor vote on the      repeal bill. Mr. Bloodsworth left the meeting more optimistic      than ever.       From time to time, he has heard from the people who sent      him to prison. A juror got in touch to apologize. One of the      two lead homicide detectives sought him out; ``it seemed like      he wanted absolution,'' Mr. Bloodsworth said. One of the      prosecutors, S. Ann Brobst, who had called him ``a monster''      at trial, insisted on driving to the Eastern Shore to give      him in person the news of the DNA hit on the actual murderer.       At the church hall, he turned from his own story to the      prospects for action in Maryland.       ``What do you smell?'' he bellowed.       ``Victory!'' the advocates yelled back.       ``It's time to close the case,'' Mr. Bloodsworth declared,      raising his arms in anticipation.                          ____________________
