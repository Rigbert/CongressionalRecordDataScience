Speaker, since the beginning of the 104th Congress, the American people have listened to Democrats and Republicans debate national priorities. The priorities of the Republican Party are crystal clear. They support a contract with the wealthy over our historic contract with older Americans.  Under the Republican budget resolution, the wealthiest 1.1 million Americans will receive a $20,000 tax break. In return, 37 million seniors will see their Medicare benefits cut by over $1,000 a year by the year 2002.  Let me remind my Republican colleagues that Medicare is not a welfare program, it is not a luxurious giveaway like the Republican tax cuts, and it is not a fiscal candy jar. It is an insurance program that has enabled 37 million seniors to live lives of independence and dignity.  Let us not make seniors pawns in the Republican budget game--raiding Medicare to pay for tax cuts to the wealthy is completely unacceptable.                          ____________________
