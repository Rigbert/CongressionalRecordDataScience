President, today I am introducing legislation along with Senator Obama that will address some serious deficiencies we have found in the Veterans Administration's health care quality assurance efforts. Over the past several months, we have learned of problems in the hiring practices and quality of care at the veterans hospital in Marion, IL. What we have learned suggests that there are flaws that could equally affect the hiring and quality assurance programs in other VA hospitals.  The problems at Marion first came to light in August after the VA became aware that there had been an abnormal spike in deaths at the hospital the previous winter. A doctor was practicing at Marion even though a year earlier he had agreed to stop practicing medicine in Massachusetts. This fact came to light only after he had resigned from Marion because he was being sued for malpractice involving a case at Marion. It turned out that he had been involved in at least nine other cases at Marion in which the patient died, and he had been the subject of at least two malpractice settlements and a disciplinary action in Massachusetts before moving to Illinois.  The VA initiated an investigation and has taken steps to protect the patients at Marion. All but the most simple outpatient surgeries have been suspended, one doctor has resigned, four others have had their privileges restricted, and four top staff members have been temporarily reassigned.  The VA's Inspector General is conducting a thorough investigation and I am looking forward to considering his conclusions. But we know enough to take action now. And we must take action now because what happened at Marion may not be an isolated case. The same problems may exist at other VA hospitals as well.  The legislation we are introducing has three main objectives. First, it would improve the process of vetting doctors applying to and working in the VA. Second, it would expand the quality control programs in the VA health care system. And third, it would create incentives to encourage high-quality doctors to practice at veterans hospitals.  The VA's standards for evaluating employment applicants must be strengthened. When the doctor whose problematic service brought this issue to light was hired by the VA, he had two malpractice payments on his record, but he had only disclosed one to the VA. He was also under investigation by the Massachusetts medical board for gross incompetence in several cases that led to the deaths of patients. This was not disclosed to the VA.  Our legislation will fix this problem. It will require all physician applicants to the VA, and all doctors practicing in the VA, to disclose any judgments, settlements, disciplinary actions, and open investigations involving them. In addition, each doctor would be required to make a written request to the State medical board of any State in which they have held a license, requesting that the board release this same information to the VA.  Now, as a lawyer, I understand the caution that must be used when dealing with investigations that are not complete and judgments that are not final. But doctors and hospitals understand and work with confidential information all the time. VA officials with hiring authority will keep this information confidential and will be able to differentiate between a frivolous lawsuit and a case that should raise real concern. Before we entrust our Nation's veterans to a doctor, the VA should know all the pertinent information about that individual. Before the VA hires a physician, it should be required to examine this kind of information to make sure the physician should not be disqualified from employment in the VA.  In addition, our bill requires doctors employed by the VA to be licensed in the state in which they practice.  The bill's second objective is to improve the VA's quality assurance program. Our legislation would establish a quality assure officer at each VA medical facility, in each Veterans Integrated Service Network, VISN, region,and at the VA national headquarters. These officers would establish and carry out a quality assurance program at each VA medical facility.  Over the year and a half that this doctor practiced at Marion, at least a few of the nurses had concerns about his skills and competence and raised those concerns with the hospital leadership. They were ignored. This is absolutely unacceptable.  Concerns about the quality of care in a VA facility should never go unexamined. If local hospital officials will not listen, another avenue should be available for raising these concerns. Our legislation would allow employees to raise quality of care concerns to the local quality assurance officer and the regional quality assurance officer, ensuring that there is a place employees can go and know that their concerns will be considered.  In addition, we would require that the quality assurance program at each hospital include a mechanism for the peer review of physicians in the hospital. At Marion, it appears that any kind of peer review program that might have been present was either dormant or ignored. As a result, early warning signs were missed that might have saved lives.  Our measure would require that the quality assurance officers be licensed physicians, so that they will be qualified to monitor the performance of other doctors and ensure a fair but thorough peer review process is in place.  Finally, our legislation includes provisions to encourage talented doctors to practice in the VA system. We would direct each VA hospital to seek to affiliate with a nearby medical school so that our hospitals will have the benefit of the fresh, young minds of medical students and the more experienced judgments Of medical school faculty. These affiliations would introduce young doctors to the work of the VA, which might lead them to consider a career there. We also would create loan forgiveness and tuition reimbursement programs to encourage doctors to commit to practice in VA hospitals.  We also recognize that many experienced doctors might be willing to practice part-time in a VA hospital but would be unwilling to totally leave private practice. Our bill would instruct the VA to develop programs to increase the recruitment of experienced, quality doctors who might be willing to practice part-time in the VA health care system. It would also offer access to the federal employees health insurance program to doctors who are willing to practice at least five days per month in a VA medical facility.  This bill addresses very real issues that directly affect the health of our veterans. The VA's investigation of what went wrong at Marion may lead us to additional legislative initiatives, but the steps we have outlined in this bill are steps that need to be taken now to protect veterans in VA hospitals throughout the country.  This legislation has been endorsed by Veterans for America. I urge my colleagues to join in moving forward with this legislation to ensure that our veterans receive the quality of care they deserve.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2377       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
