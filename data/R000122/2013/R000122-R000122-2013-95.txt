President, July 1 is less than 1 week away. We need to reassure students who will be taking out loans for school this fall that their interest rates will not double.  It is safe to say most of us on both sides of the aisle would want to see a long-term approach to setting student loan interest rates rather than a temporary extension of the current rate. We have been working, Senator Harkin, Senator King, Senator Manchin, Senator Burr, Senator Coburn, Senator Warren, and many others about finding a way forward.  Unfortunately, all of the proposals that are on the table today would leave students worse off in the future, frankly, worse off than simply allowing the interest rate to double.
