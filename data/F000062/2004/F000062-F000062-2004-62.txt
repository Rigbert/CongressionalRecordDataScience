 President, I rise to introduce legislation to protect one of Americans' most valuable but vulnerable assets: Social Security Numbers. The bill I propose today is identical to legislation that is making progress in the House of Representatives. Just before recess, the House Ways and Means Committee passed the bill not only with bipartisan support, but with unanimous support. Even though this bill has differences from S. 228, which I proposed at the beginning of this Congress to help prevent the misuse of Social Security numbers, the issue is too important for me, or for any other Senator, to stand by and do nothing.  The legislation, which in the House is H.R. 2971, was authored by Representative Clay Shaw, the Republican from Florida's 22nd Congressional District. Very briefly, the key provisions of the legislation will do the following: It will generally prohibit the Federal and State governments, and private businesses, from displaying, buying, and selling Social Security Numbers. However, realizing that there are certain instances where Social Security Numbers must be communicated, the bill makes exceptions for areas such as law enforcement, national security, vehicle registration, and certain limited forms of research.  The bill will also toughen the methods that the Social Security Administration uses to verify birth records, and that it uses to issue Social Security numbers to newborn infants.  Additionally, the legislation will prohibit companies from requiring consumers to provide their Social Security Numbers, and will treat any such requirement as a prohibited unfair trade practice.  The bill will also punish violators with fines and up to five years in prison, with up to 25 years for those who are involved in drug trafficking or terrorism.  The bill also allows other sections of Federal law to impose stronger restrictions, and calls for reports analyzing the process for issuing Social Security Numbers.  This legislation is necessary to help stop the epidemic of identity theft that has been plaguing America and its citizens.  According to a report that the Federal Trade Commission released in September, 2003, almost ten million people were victimized by identity theft in the previous year. This led to losses of over 47 billion dollars.  The damage is not merely monetary. According to the same FTC report, the average victim had to spend thirty hours that is, three-fourths of a standard work-week--to resolve the problems. Often, the entire process can drag out for years.  Perhaps worst of all, victims must confront the trauma that someone else has hijacked their very identity. According to the Identity Theft Resource Center, a non-profit group that operates in my home state of California: ``Each time you answer the telephone or go to the mailbox, you wonder what new bill will appear. The idea of dealing with yet another collection agency or a newly discovered credit card leaves you filled with dread, rage and helplessness. . . . Some feel like they are experiencing a form of `post-traumatic stress disorder' for a short time.''  Theft of a Social Security number can be especially devastating, because that piece of information has become a de facto universal identifier in American society.  One recent book on privacy in the United States documents how far the use of Social Security Numbers has spread beyond its original purpose, when they were created in 1936, of tracking American workers' earnings and benefits. According to the book: ``The SSN began to be used for military personnel, legally admitted aliens, anyone receiving or applying for federal benefits, food stamps, school lunch program eligibility, draft registration, and federal loans. State and local governments, as well as private sector entities such as schools and banks, began to use SSNs as well--for drivers' licenses, birth certificates, blood donation, jury selection, worker's compensation, occupational licenses, and marriage licenses. `` (SOURCE: Daniel Solove and Marc Rotenberg, Information Privacy Law, Aspen Publishers, 2003, at page 447-48.)  Despite this widespread use of Social Security Numbers, according to the General Accounting Office, ``No single federal law regulates the overall use or restricts the disclosure of SSNs by governments.'' (SOURCE: Social Security Numbers: SSNs are Widely Used by Government and Could be Better Protected, 2002 (Report Number GAO-02-691T) at page 5). As a result, the use of Social Security Numbers is regulated by an inconsistent and insufficient patchwork of State and Federal laws, that often leaves the numbers in plain view of the whole world.  It isn't surprising, then, that the sale of Social Security Numbers is proceeding at a furious pace. According to the GAO in a report that it released earlier this year, ``Internet-based information resellers whose Web sites we accessed also obtain SSNs from their customers and scour public records and other publicly available information to provide the information to persons willing to pay a fee.'' (SOUCE: Social Security Numbers: Private Sector Entities Routinely Obtain and Use SSNs, and Laws Limit the Disclosure of this Information (2004, Report Number GAO-04-11), on Highlights Page).  I personally first became aware of the need for a law to restrict the sale and display of Social Security numbers about eight years ago, when one of my staff members sat me down and downloaded my own Social Security Number from the Internet in a matter of minutes. Congress has done shockingly little to protect Social Security Numbers since then.  Therefore, we badly need a uniform law such as the one that the GAO report anticipates. Year after year, I have advocated and proposed such legislation that would restrict the public display and use of Social Security Numbers.  In the 106th Congress, I introduced S. 2966.  In the 107th Congress, I introduced, S. 848 and S. 3100.  In the 108th Congress, I introduced S. 228.  None of these bills moved. Today, I stand before you yet again, to introduce a fifth bill to take steps that will make it more difficult for thieves to steal this precious resource. This is not a partisan issue--all of the bills that I introduced in the past were bipartisan. And so is this bill: in the House, as I mentioned, it was passed unanimously in the Ways and Means Committee, and also has 41 co-sponsors, including 16 Republicans and 25 Democrats. This issue does not concern Republican government or Democratic government; rather, this is an issue of good government.  Earlier this year, the President signed into law a bill that I helped to author, to increase punishment for those who steal the identities of others. But punishment is not enough. We need to stop identity theft from occurring in the first place.  We have only three weeks until the end of this Congress to enact this legislation to prevent such thefts by protecting Social Security Numbers. If we do not pass this legislation now, we will have to wait yet again to give basic protection to information that should have been under lock and key long ago. It is time for us to act. Thank you.  I ask unanimous consent, the text of the accompanying bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2801       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

RESTRICTIONS ON THE SALE OR DISPLAY TO THE GENERAL                    PUBLIC OF SOCIAL SECURITY ACCOUNT NUMBERS BY                    GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES.       (a) In General.--Section 205(c)(2)(C) of the Social      Security Act (42 U.S.C. 405(c)(2)(C)) is amended by adding at      the end the following new clause:       ``(x)(I) An executive, legislative, or judicial agency or      instrumentality of the Federal Government or of a State or a      political subdivision thereof or a trustee appointed in a      case under title 11, United States Code (or person acting as      an agent of such an agency or instrumentality or trustee) may      not sell or display to the general public any social security      account number if such number has been disclosed to such      agency, instrumentality, trustee, or agent pursuant to the      assertion by such an agency, instrumentality, trustee, or      agent to any person that disclosure of such number is      mandatory. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, such      number may be sold or displayed to the general public in      accordance with the exceptions specified in subclauses (II),      (III), (IV), (V), (VI), (VII), and (VIII) (and for no other      purpose).       ``(II) Notwithstanding subclause (I), a social security      account number may be sold by an agency, instrumentality,      trustee, or agent referred to in subclause (I) to the extent      that such sale is specifically authorized by this Act.       ``(III) Notwithstanding subclause (I), a social security      account number may be sold by an agency, instrumentality,      trustee, or agent referred to in subclause (I) to the extent      that is necessary or appropriate for law enforcement or      national security purposes, as determined under regulations      which shall be issued as provided in subparagraph (I) of this      paragraph.       ``(IV) Notwithstanding subclause (I), a social security      account number may be sold by an agency, instrumentality,      trustee, or agent referred to in subclause (I) to the extent      that such sale is required to comply with a tax law of the      United States or of any State (or political subdivision      thereof).       ``(V) Notwithstanding subclause (I), a social security      account number may be sold by a State department of motor      vehicles as authorized under subsection (b) of section 2721      of title 18, United States Code, if such number is to be used      pursuant to such sale solely for purposes permitted under      paragraph (1), (6), or (9) of such subsection.       ``(VI) Notwithstanding subclause (I), a social security      account number may be sold or otherwise made available by an      agency, instrumentality, trustee, or agent referred to in      subclause (I) to a consumer reporting agency (as defined in      section 603(f) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C.      1681a(f))) for use or disclosure solely for permissible      purposes described in section 604(a) of such Act (15 U.S.C.      1681b(a)).       ``(VII) Notwithstanding subclause (I), a social security      account number may be sold by an agency, instrumentality,      trustee, or agent referred to in subclause (I) to the extent      necessary for research (other than market research) conducted      by any agency or instrumentality referred to in subclause (I)      (or an agent of such an agency or instrumentality) for the      purpose of advancing the public good, on the condition that      the researcher provides adequate assurances that the social      security account numbers will not be used to harass, target,      or publicly reveal information concerning any identifiable      individuals, that information about identifiable individuals      obtained from the research will not be used to make decisions      that directly affect the rights, benefits, or privileges of      specific individuals, and that the researcher has in place      appropriate safeguards to protect the privacy and      confidentiality of any information about identifiable      individuals, including procedures to ensure that the social      security account numbers will be encrypted or otherwise      appropriately secured from unauthorized disclosure. In the      case of social security account numbers which constitute      personally identifiable medical information, the Commissioner      of Social Security, with respect to medical research referred      to in the preceding sentence, and the Attorney General of the      United States, with respect to any medical research not      referred to in the preceding sentence but which is treated in      regulations of the Attorney General issued pursuant to      subclause (VIII), shall maintain ongoing consultation with      the Office for Civil Rights of the Department of Health and      Human Services to ensure that the sale or purchase of such      social security account numbers is permitted only in      compliance with existing Federal rules and regulations      prescribed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services      pursuant to section 264(c) of the Health Insurance      Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (110 Stat. 2033).       ``(VIII) Notwithstanding subclause (I), a social security      account number may be sold or displayed to the general public      by an agency, instrumentality, trustee, or agent referred to      in subclause (I) under such other circumstances as may be      specified in regulations issued as provided in subparagraph      (I) of this paragraph.       ``(IX) This clause does not apply with respect to a social      security account number of a deceased individual.       ``(X) For purposes of this clause, the term `sell' means,      in connection with a social security account number, to      accept an item of material value in exchange for such number.       ``(XI) For purposes of this clause, the term `display to      the general public' shall have the meaning provided such term      in section 208A(a)(3)(A). In any case in which an agency,      instrumentality, trustee, or agent referred to in subclause      (I) requires transmittal to such agency, instrumentality,      trustee, or agent of an individual's social security account      number by means of the Internet without reasonable provisions      to ensure that such number is encrypted or otherwise      appropriately secured from disclosure, any such transmittal      of such number as so required shall be treated, for purposes      of this clause, as a `display to the general public' of such      number by such agency, instrumentality, trustee, or agent for      purposes of this clause.       ``(XII) For purposes of this clause, the term social      security account number includes any derivative of such      number. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, any      expression, contained in or on any item sold or displayed to      the general public, shall not be treated as a social security      account number solely because such expression sets forth not      more than the last 4 digits of such number if the remainder      of such number cannot be determined based solely on such      expression or any other matter presented in such material.       ``(XIII) Nothing in this clause shall be construed to      supersede, alter, or affect any restriction or limitation on      the sale or display     to the general public of social security account numbers,      provided in any Federal statute, regulation, order, or      interpretation, if the restriction or limitation is greater      than that provided under this clause, as determined under      applicable regulations issued by the Commissioner of Social      Security or by the Attorney General of the United States or      another agency or instrumentality of the United States as      provided in subparagraph (I) of this paragraph.''.       (b) Effective Date and Related Rules.--       (1) In general.--Initial final regulations prescribed to      carry out the provisions of section 205(c)(2)(C)(x) of the      Social Security Act (added by this section) shall be issued      not later than the last date of the 18th calendar month      following the date of the enactment of this Act. Such      provisions shall take effect, with respect to matters      governed by such regulations issued by the Commissioner of      Social Security, or (pursuant to section 205(c)(2)(I) of such      Act (added by section 102)) by the Attorney General of the      United States or any other agency or instrumentality of the      United States, 1 year after the date of the issuance of such      regulations by the Commissioner, the Attorney General, or      such other agency or instrumentality, respectively. Such      amendment shall apply in the case of displays to the general      public, as defined in section 208A(a)(3) of such Act (added      by section 108), to such displays originally occurring after      such 1-year period. Such provisions shall not apply with      respect to any display of a record (containing a social      security account number (or any derivative thereof))      generated prior to the close of such 1-year period.       (2) Sunset of exception.--The last sentence of subclause      (XI) of section 205(c)(2)(C)(x) of the Social Security Act      (added by this section) shall cease to be effective with      respect to sales, purchases, or displays to the general      public occurring after 6 years after the 18th calendar month      referred to in paragraph (1).
