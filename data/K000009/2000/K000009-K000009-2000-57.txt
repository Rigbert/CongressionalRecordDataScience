Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. Gilman) for taking time out of his busy schedule to be here on such a critical issue.  I wanted to thank the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Callahan), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, Export Financing and Related Programs, for allowing us just this moment. If so many billions of dollars were not involved, I would not press to spend a few extra moments here this afternoon.  I wanted to thank the ranking member, the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), for allowing us this time.  We have had absolutely no other opportunity to bring this to international attention than this moment. We think it is the right time, and we look forward to working with the authorizing and appropriations committees in the future to keep our assistance on a short lease and to recover assets that are due to our company and our people and to move our aid in the direction of reform in both of those very strategic nations.
