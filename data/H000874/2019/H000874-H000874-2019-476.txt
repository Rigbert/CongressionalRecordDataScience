. Bush on July 26, 1990. This transformative and trailblazing piece of legislation, which was supported by both Democrats and Republicans, serves as a lasting reminder that Congress can bring so much opportunity for our people when we join together for the greater good. The ADA calls us to continue to act on behalf of millions of Americans with disabilities to ensure that their hopes, dreams, and aspirations are as valid and attainable as those of every other American. It remains a powerful expression of Congress's determination that disability rights are civil rights.  On July 23, advocates for those with disabilities are also pausing to celebrate and recognize the many contributions of Helena Berger, President & CEO of the American Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD), who will be retiring this August after thirty years of service and leadership in the disability rights movement. Ms. Berger held several leadership positions with AAPD prior to becoming President & CEO, including Executive Director, Chief Operating Officer, and Executive Vice President. Under Ms. Berger's leadership, AAPD has significantly increased its reach and impact across the country, including through the expansion of AAPD's renowned Summer Internship Program, which cultivates the next generation of leaders in the disability rights movement.  I join in thanking Ms. Berger for her years of service to AAPD and the broader disability rights community, for her tireless efforts to fight for representation and economic opportunities for Americans with disabilities, and for ensuring that AAPD can continue to advocate on their behalf for years to come. I hope all of my colleagues who value and celebrate what the ADA represents will join me in paying tribute to Ms. Berger for her leadership and wishing her all the best in her retirement.                          ____________________
