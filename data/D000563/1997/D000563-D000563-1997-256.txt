President, in closing, there are 102 counties in Illinois, and of the 12 or 13 million people in the State, most are Bulls fans. There is one exception. Hamilton County, in southern Illinois, had a banner on its courthouse which said ``go Jazz go.'' Why would this one county in the entire State be rooting for the Utah Jazz? Because Jerry Sloan, the coach of the Jazz, came from McLeansboro, IL. He played for the Bulls, and we think he learned a lot in that process.  I join my colleague in saluting the Jazz. What a fine team. They really put up great competition. There were those in Chicago who said, ``We are going to win this easily.'' Many of us had second thoughts. We knew the Jazz was a talented, dedicated team, and they played very well. I salute Karl Malone and John Stockton, as well as Coach Sloan, and our colleagues, Senators Hatch and Bennett, the best fans the Utah Jazz ever had. ``Wait until next year,'' they will say, and that is what we say to. Wait until next year for a six pack from the Chicago Bulls.                          ____________________
