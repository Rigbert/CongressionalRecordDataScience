President, I wish to honor the life and legacy of Dr. Margaret T. Burroughs, an artist, writer, and cofounder of the DuSable Museum of African American History in Chicago, IL.  Although she was born in Louisiana, Dr. Burroughs moved to Chicago to pursue a career in education and the arts. She spent her life documenting and preserving the history and culture of people of African descent and encouraging fair representation of African Americans. Dr. Burroughs made the first of her many contributions to African-American arts and culture at the age of 22 when she founded the South Side Community Arts Center, a community organization that serves as a gallery and workshop studio for artists and students.  She later went on to establish the DuSable Museum of African American History in 1961, the first museum in the country developed to preserve and interpret the experiences and achievements of people of African descent. The museum is recognized internationally as an educational resource for African-American art and history, with a collection of over 15,000 pieces, including paintings, sculptures, and historical memorabilia.  Dr. Burroughs' many contributions to art and history have been honored nationally. Her literary works and painting have traveled throughout the country--from my home State of Illinois to Washington, DC--and they serve as an inspiration to students and collectors of art. In 1975, Dr. Burroughs was honored for her service to the arts with the President's Humanitarian Award by President Gerald Ford.  Dr. Burroughs' passing in November of 2010 reminds us of the importance of history and the arts and our responsibility to preserve it. Her presence in Chicago and at the DuSable Museum will be greatly missed. As the city of Chicago recognizes the achievements of African Americans and the DuSable Museum during Black History Month, we in Congress honor the life of the DuSable Museum's founder, Margaret Burroughs. It is my hope that her legacy will live on through aspiring artists, historians, and philanthropists.                          ____________________
