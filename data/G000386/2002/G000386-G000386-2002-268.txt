 President, Secretary of Agriculture Veneman has proclaimed this to be ``National Agriculture Week.'' In this spirit, I rise today to recognize the countless and immeasurable contributions of hard-working farm families across the country who throughout our nation's history have worked relentlessly to ensure the food security of our nation and to eliminate hunger around the world.  Some of my colleagues may believe I sound like a broken record when it comes to my advocacy for the nation's mid-section and its hard-working food producers. But I like to remind them about an old saying: ``We're only nine meals away from a revolution.'' In other words, empty stomachs can prompt a traditionally law-abiding populace to mob hysteria and mayhem. A stable food supply brings social stability.  For seven decades the Federal Government has recognized the importance of maintaining a farm safety net to ensure America's homegrown food security. The tragic event of September 11 underscored the significant responsibilities the Federal Government must undertake to protect our national security interests at home and abroad.  Safeguarding the American public and shielding the U.S. economy, transportation infrastructure, health care delivery systems, energy supplies, natural resources and production agriculture from the threats of 21st century terrorism have become Washington's top priority. This effort must include a farm safety net that works to ensure our farmers and ranchers are able to continue feeding America by making a decent living off the land. Otherwise, American consumers could well find themselves at the mercy of foreign suppliers at the grocery store much like we are today at the gas station.  We must not forget our nation's long agrarian heritage. In 1790, ninety percent of the nation's labor force were farmers--feeding a population of only 4 million.  Today, with less than 2 percent of our population actively engaged in agriculture, our nation's family farmers feed a U.S. population of 265 million, along with millions of others around the world.  The contributions of the agriculture industry on our economy are many. Agriculture is the largest positive contributor to our nation's balance of trade. Last year, American farmers exported $53 billion worth of commodities. The State of Iowa alone exported more than $3 billion worth of corn, soybeans, live animals, and red meats.  Moreover, according to the Department of Agriculture, each dollar from agricultural exports generates another $1.47 in additional economic activity. Twenty-four million Americans depend on agriculture for their livelihoods.  Despite the enormous contributions of farming to our country, today, fewer and fewer people have direct ties to life on the farm, and fewer still depend solely on farming for their livelihood. Technological efficiencies and mechanical advances on today's farm require less labor to produce more food. While fewer hands may be needed on the farmplace, new opportunities exist in food production and value-added agriculture to keep future generations of Iowans productive contributors in the food chain.  In conclusion, farming has come a long way over the last 100 years. The horse-drawn plow has turned into a tractor-drawn, fully-computerized farm implement. In the next 100 years, farmers will again serve as pioneers in newly-tilled fields of emerging technologies.  The world's food producers will not only feed the world but expand their traditional contribution to humanity as advances in agricultural sciences allow raw food to carry health, disease-resistant benefits for consumers.  Whatever the future may hold, I will keep my nose to the grindstone in Washington to help Iowa's century farms and farm families enjoy another 100 years of prosperity.                          ____________________
