President, I commend my colleague from Alaska. I do not know the particulars of his bill, but as I listened to his description of it, it is long overdue. Simplifying this Tax Code so the average American believes it is fair and understandable is essential for the integrity of our tax system.  I have always said there is one law we can pass which would result in tax simplification overnight, and that would be a requirement that every Member of the Senate and House prepare and file their personal income tax returns. It is a humbling experience. A few years ago, in Springfield, IL, when my accountant passed away, I decided, as a lawyer and a Senator: I will do it myself. I spent the whole Sunday afternoon, and then Monday went begging for help. I thought to myself: Mine is not that complicated. It should be a system that is much simpler and more direct and fair.  I thank the Senator for stepping in to meet that challenge. The Bowles-Simpson Commission talked about tax reform as one of the central elements to dealing with our deficit and expanding our economy. I think I might add to that: fairness in the way our taxes are treated. So I thank the Senator for his leadership on that issue.
