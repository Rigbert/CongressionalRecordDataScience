Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy) for the purposes of inquiring of the majority leader-elect the schedule for the week to come.  Mr. McCARTHY of California. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, on Monday, no votes are expected in the House. On Tuesday, the House will meet at noon for morning hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business. Votes will be postponed until 6:30 p.m. On Wednesday and Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning hour and noon for legislative business. On Friday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business. Last votes of the week are expected no later than 3 p.m.  Mr. Speaker, the House will consider a few suspensions next week, a complete list of which will be announced by close of business tomorrow and which, I am proud to say, will include additional bills to combat human trafficking.  In addition, the House will consider two bills to support innovation and enhance financial counseling in higher education: H.R. 3136, the Advancing Competency-Based Education Demonstration Project Act, authored by Representative Matt Salmon; and H.R. 4984, the Empowering Students through Enhanced Financial Counseling Act, authored by Representative Brett Guthrie.  The House will consider H.R. 3393, the Student and Family Tax Simplification Act. It is a bipartisan bill, authored by Representatives Diane Black and Danny Davis, to ensure a simple and fair Tax Code so that students and families can afford a college education.  The House will consider H.R. 4935, the Child Tax Credit Improvement Act of 2014, authored by Representative Lynn Jenkins, to help low- and middle-income families save for child expenses.  Finally, the House will also consider legislation to address the growing crisis on the border and the reauthorization of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act.
