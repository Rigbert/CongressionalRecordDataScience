 Mrs. McCASKILL. Not a dime of it paid for--not one dime. It is all on the credit card, one big blob of red ink.  Is the Senator aware how many of our friends on the other side of the aisle have new religion--this is new religion about balancing the budget--and how many actually voted for Medicare D? It was a brandnew entitlement program, a massive government entitlement program, a government-run health care-related government program, and not one dime was paid for? Do you know how many on the other side, who are still serving today, voted for this new entitlement program?
