Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding, and I thank him for bringing this bill to the floor.  Drill Responsibly In Leased Lands. The assertion was that Democrats are not for drilling. This gives lie to that assertion. This says, as we have been saying, there are 88 million acres available for drilling right now. Those acres are subject to lawsuit, my friend says. Any acreage would be subject to lawsuits. This acreage is subject to the availability of drills. Black and Decker or otherwise. What an absurd, I say to my friend, assertion. There are no drills available currently to drill in new lands here or other places.  The minority leader, I presume, is going to be speaking in some few minutes. He said this: ``They're,'' meaning the Democrats, ``offering excuses designed to get people thinking about something other than drilling. They worship at the altar of radical environmentalists.''  This is, of course, the crowd that said global warming didn't exist until just a few months ago. This is the crowd that has been in charge of the White House for the last 7\1/2\ years.  The gentleman from New Mexico says, Gee whiz, let's bring the price of gasoline down.  They had an energy policy which they came up with under Dick Cheney. Some people say it failed. I'm not sure the oil companies thought it failed. It was $1.46 when they brought up the policy. It's now $4 at the pump. The oil companies are making the biggest profits they've made in their history.  The assertion Mr. Boehner made is, as I said again, that we worship at the altar of radical environmentalists. Let me quote one of those radical environmentalists: ``I have been an oilman my whole life, but this is one emergency we can't drill our way out of.'' That radical environmentalist's name is T. Boone Pickens, and as he said earlier in that statement, ``I have been an oilman all my life.'' He understands very well what can and cannot be done.  This bill says let's drill. Let's get American product to American consumers and try to bring down prices. We've also asked the SPR be released. Not all of it. Maintain most of it. Why? To bring prices down, to free the oil that Americans have bought for their use and to bring prices down. With Americans being pummeled by $4-a-gallon gas, it's high time that America did just that. With the passage of the DRILL bill, America will move decisively to increase its domestic oil production.  Now, ladies and gentlemen of the House, isn't it an ironic happenstance that the day before we put this bill on the floor, 24 hours before we put this bill on the floor and say let's drill in the National Petroleum Reserve, isn't it ironic that the White House announces they're going to do just that? My, my, my. What an awful idea we had--right up until the time 24 hours ago when the administration decided they would do it.  I'm glad they've done it. And if our actions spurred their action, so be it. And we're going to take credit. Because they've been in office 7\1/2\ years. They took it 24 hours ago. What was the reaction of the oil industry? They were happy.  Now, nobody is saying if you have land over here you have got to use it before you get land over here. What we're saying is you can't inventory land. You can't inventory acreage. You can't be a huge, rich oil company and want no competition and therefore inventory land. We're saying that. Yes, we are. We think that makes good sense for the American public.  Today we call their bluff, I think. Yesterday they saw us. And they said, we'll drill here.                              {time}  1430  Mr. Speaker, 68 million acres of American oil-producing land are sitting leased, available, and idle. There is even more land available for drilling in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, or NPR-A, which we're dealing with today.  Combined, we are talking about an area the size of--and all my colleagues listening to this debate and anybody else who is listening to it, they ought to know currently what is available--the area of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, and most of my own State, Maryland. That entire area is currently available for drilling, for getting American product to Americans.  Let's help the oil companies get that oil out of the ground and get it flowing to the Americans who need it. The DRILL bill speeds up the leasing process in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska. It ensures that Alaskan oil will fill American gas tanks.  That is, I presume, why, when they knew this bill was coming to the floor, yesterday the administration said they were going to have this land leased. Yesterday. The American public is pretty smart. There's nobody I think that's hearing my voice, wherever they are, doubts that if they just did it yesterday, after being in office for 7\1/2\ years, then maybe, maybe, maybe there was a relationship between Chairman Rahall bringing this bill to the floor and the action yesterday to try to preclude the credit for doing what we think is good policy. Hopefully, we're all going to vote for good policy today and vote for this bill.  It calls upon the President to speed up the completion of the Alaskan oil and gas pipelines. That's what it does because we need those lines to get that oil and product, natural gas and oil, to market and to Americans.  ``Drill on the leases you have, or let somebody else do it. But don't just sit on them while Americans are paying $4 a gallon. Use it or lose it.''  The gentleman says, well, they're not just sitting there; they're afraid of lawsuits. We may all be afraid of lawsuits. We may never drive our car because we're afraid of an accident or a lawsuit. That's not what they're in the business for, and very frankly, in terms of fear, when you're making the largest profit for a product, you go look for more, unless of course you want to keep the price high and supply down.  Why is our plan better than the Republicans'? One, it means more oil. The National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, which is already approved for drilling, has an estimated 10.6 billion barrels of oil. ANWR has 10.4 billion. And the information we have is the oil companies aren't too interested in drilling there.  Two, our plan means more oil, faster. Unlike ANWR and protected coastal areas, NPR-A plus the 68 million leased acres elsewhere are currently approved for production.  And get this, right now, today, available pipelines reach to within 5 miles of the National Petroleum Reserve, and if the pipelines are completed soon, we will speed production up even more.  Third, I see no reason to give even more handouts of public land to companies enjoying record profits and billions of dollars in taxpayer subsidies unless they are using that which they currently have. Inventorying land, inventorying acreage, inventorying possible oil supplies is not what the American people want.  What the American people want is they want production. They want performance. They want prices to go down. That's why we say let's start on the land they already have. Let them eat their vegetables before they think about dessert.
