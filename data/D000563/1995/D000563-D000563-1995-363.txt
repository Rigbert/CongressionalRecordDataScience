Speaker, the Congress of the United States is involved in a very important debate on the future of America's welfare system. Both parties have come to the understanding and agreement that the current welfare system is, by and large, a failure. It is a system which is loathed not only by the people who are in the system, but certainly by taxpayers, who see a great deal of waste and misguided policy.  Unfortunately, this debate took a bad turn on Capitol Hill several weeks ago when my Republican colleagues announced one of the first casualties in this debate would be the Federal nutrition programs, programs which have been tried and tested over decades and which have been proven to be dramatic successes.  I went back to my district this last weekend and on Saturday had a town gathering in Quincy, IL, inviting people from the general area to come and tell me their experiences with three specific programs. I would like to share them with you this afternoon.  I think these personal human stories tell a lot more about this welfare reform debate than all the books and statistics and all the high-flying political speeches that you are going to hear in the next several weeks.  The first little fellow I met was named Reed. Reed was the cutest little 7-month-old you could imagine, 20 pounds, bouncing up and down, happiest kid I could ever remember seeing.  His mom told the story about how Reed was not always this way, how he got off to a slow start in life. They could not find an infant formula that worked for him. Finally, they did. A pretty rare commercial infant formula which Reed could tolerate and, in fact, grow very well on.  That formula was provided to that working mother, who is struggling to get by on a low-wage job, by the WIC Program, a Federal program that steps in with low-income families and gives them a helping hand. If you could have seen the smile on Reed's face and his mother's face as they told the story, you can understand that the concept of block-granting these programs and cutting funds for them will cut off children just like that, forcing the mothers of Reed and others across the country into a welfare system that we are trying to pare down.  And then, of course, we had another young lady there, a mother of a little girl named Shay. She had three children. They were in day care homes. Now that is different from the day-care centers that you might drive by. In my part of the world, people have day-care services in their basements, in family rooms, and they are licensed by the State. They provide low-cost day care for mothers who otherwise could not work without it.  Well, she had three children in day care. The Federal Government helps provide for those in day care about $4 a day to feed the kids, a little snack and a little lunch during the course of the day.  One of the proposals before Congress is to eliminate that altogether. What this mother told me was that while she was off working 40 hours a week in a fast food restaurant, working several days a week just to pay for day care, she said $4 a day does not sound like much, but it is $15 per week times 3 kids is 180 bucks per month. She said, ``Congressman, think about what I am earning for a living, $4 or $5 an hour is not much, and the impact it is going to have on me. I need to have affordable day care to stay out of welfare.''  Finally, one of our school superintendents came in and told a story about school lunch. It is nothing short of amazing to me that our Republican friends now want to go after the school lunch program. I have been around here for a few years, and I cannot recall scandals, massive scandals, and waste in the bureaucracy. This is a program administered at the local level that works.  A school superintendent came in to tell the story of a little boy about 10 years old. Several years ago his mother went out for groceries and never came back. That left him with his two brothers and his father alone. Because his father works long hours, it became his burden to basically raise his little brothers.  They come to school each day, those three kids, and the superintendent told me, he said,       Congressman, make no mistake about it, it is the best meal      of the day for them. It may look like just a plateful of      spaghetti and pizza to somebody walking through the      cafeteria, but these kids wolf it down. Sometimes we have to      bring them down to the cafeteria for crackers and milk to      keep them going.  So let us not get caught up in all the statistical debate and forget the real people involved. We have got to keep good nutrition programs that are working in place doing their job. We cannot have a strong America without strong children and strong families.                          ____________________
