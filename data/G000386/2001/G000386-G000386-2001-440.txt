 President, I rise today along with Senators Baucus, Graham, Hatch, Breaux, Murkowski, Kerry, Jeffords, Torricelli, Kyl, Lincoln, Hutchinson, Johnson, Hagel, Durbin, Gregg, Schumer, Hutchison, Bayh, Chafee, and Reid to introduce bipartisan legislation intended to help Americans build a more secure retirement. Many of these members, such as Senator Graham, Hatch, Breaux, and Jeffords have been engaged in pension reform issues for many years. Others bring new energy to the pension reform debate. I want to take a moment to thank them all for their hard work and enthusiasm in this bipartisan effort.  For five years now, Senate Finance Committee has worked on this comprehensive pension reform legislation. In the last Congress, we came very close to enacting it into law. For example, the Finance Committee unanimously reported out the bill in early September 2000. While our bill was not considered on the floor, my colleagues and I are not discouraged. We have built on the work from the last five years in crafting the Retirement Security and Savings Act of 2001.  Many baby boomers will enter retirement ill prepared for the potentially high costs of supporting themselves. Inflation alone can siphon money from a fixed income, reducing a retiree's standard of living. So it is important to have a considerable sum saved for one's postemployment years. A fixed income for a worker who retires today will have half the purchasing power 20 years from now, assuming the historical average rate of inflation of 3.25 percent. Having adequate retirement savings can protect against inflation and other unexpected costs. Savings rates are at an historical low, but this bill will provide the incentives individuals need to boost their savings rates.  The Retirement Security and Savings Act of 2001 has six titles: individual retirement arrangements; expanding coverage; enhancing fairness for women and families; increasing portability for participants; strengthening pension security and enforcement; and reducing regulatory burdens. Let me highlight a few provisions from each title.  The limit on annual contributions to an IRA has not increased in twenty years. If the contribution limit kept up with inflation, individuals would now be able to contribute around $5000 to an IRA each year. Our bill would increase the maximum contribution limit from $2000 to $5000 and adjust that limit for inflation.  The Retirement Security and Savings Act of 2001 would also eliminate the marriage penalty applicable to contributions to a Roth IRA. The income limits for contributing would now be increased so that the applicable limit for married couples is twice the limit for single taxpayers.  The Small Business Administration reports that, small businesses employ 52 percent of the private sector labor force. An amazing 75 percent of new jobs are created by small businesses. Yet less than 20 percent of small business employees are covered by a retirement plan of any kind. By contrast, approximately 70 percent of employees who work for larger firms are offered a retirement plan. We work to address this disparity in the bill by making pension plans more attractive to business owners. The limitations on annual contributions to 401(k) plans would increase from $10,500 to $15,000. The SIMPLE limit would increase to $10,000. We know that pension plans are bought and not sold. In a voluntary system such as ours, retirement plans must be attractive to the business owner in order for him or her to establish a plan in the first place and maintain it over many years. These higher limits help to make qualified plans more attractive, relative to non-qualified plans. When a business establishes a qualified plan, workers benefit, as well as business owners.  The bill would also help defray the administrative costs of setting up a retirement plan by offering a partial tax credit of the costs associated with starting a plan. Furthermore, the bill would provide an additional credit for small business employers who make an employer contribution to the new retirement plan for the benefit of non-highly compensated employees. These credits have the potential to expand coverage among small businesses and we hope they will help us to accomplish that objective.  This bill also encourages lower or middle income individuals, to save for their retirement by establishing a retirement savings tax credit. This non-refundable credit will be equal to 50 percent of up to $2000 in contributions for a married couple with an income up to $30,000, and $15,000 for an individual taxpayer. Our goal with this provision is get people, especially young people, in the habit of saving.  The Retirement Security and Savings Act of 2001 would encourage small businesses to start a retirement plan for their employees by eliminating unnecessary administrative complexity in the top heavy rules. Top heavy rules that apply only to small businesses and, according to an Employee Benefits Research Institute, EBRI, survey, are the number one regulatory reason why small business owners do not start a pension. While the language in this bill may not go as far as many would like, the changes we have made are a step in the right direction.  Women tend to be somewhat more at risk of living in poverty as they age. There are many causes for this trend. For example, women may have breaks in service to care for young children or for elderly family members. Consequently, we hope this legislation will help women workers more saving options despite periodic departures from the paid workforce.  The Retirement Security and Savings Act partially restores the artificial limits on how much people can save in their employer's pension plan. One of the most burdensome provisions in the Internal Revenue Code is that 25 percent of compensation limitation contained within section 451(c). Under section 415(c), total contributions by employer and employee into a defined contribution plan are limited to 25 percent of compensation or $35,000, whichever is less.  But the retirement savings vehicle available for most private sector workers is the 401(k) plan where the maximum amount a worker can save is currently $10,500. Thus, a workers who makes $40,000 annually could only save $10,000, but not the additional $500 allowed by the rules in the Code. My colleagues and I see section 415(c) as an artificial barrier to saving of ordinary Americans and believe the 415(c) limit should be removed.  Our bill also allows catch-up contributions for contributions to defined contribution plans and IRAs. The provision is applicable only to individualsage 50 and older--aiding many who may have started saving late in life or after other major financial obligations were out of the way such as paying down mortgages or sending children to college. It may also help those who were not in the paid labor force while they took time off to care for young children or ailing family members.  This provision is also important for those who save for retirement only through an IRA. As I said a moment ago, the limits on IRAs have not escalated for twenty years. IRA savers have lost out on twenty years of contributions and earnings on those contributions that presumably would have been made had the limits increased with inflation as they do in other plans. Under current law, certain workers who save in section 403(b) plans or 457 (or in some cases a 401(k)) deferred compensation plans for state and local government employees are allowed to make catch-up contributions for a period of time prior to their retirement dates.  I know of no justification why catch-up contributions should not be allowed for all types of defined contribution plans. One complaint that plan administrators in the 403(b) and governmental (both 457 and 401(k)) plans have made is that the rules concerning when such catch-up contributions can be and how they must be made are cumbersome. Those plan experts advocate a greatly simplified framework for allowing catch-up contributions such as the one in our bill.  Under current law, an employer may require up to five years of service before an employee is entitled to employer's matching contributions to its retirement savings plan. The legislation would reduce the maximum number of years of service required to vest the employer's matching contributions to only three years. A shorter vesting requirement would ensure that more short-service workers will have a vested right to their employers' matching contributions. Thus, larger accounts will be available to be saved for retirement despite frequent job changes.  The legislation also contains proposals which promote retirement savings plan portability. The lack of portability among plans is one of the weak links in our current retirement saving system. This is an especially difficult problem for our public employees for whom current law does not permit rollovers. A police officer or firefighter who leaves public service at age 50 or 55 and begins another career in the private sector, may not transfer savings to his or her new plan even if the new employer's plan would accept them. Our bill would change this. It removes unnecessary obstacles to portability for all types of plans in the governmental, not-for-profit and the for-profit sectors of our economy.  In addition, this bill allows public sector workers to take benefits from a defined contribution plan and by service credit in their defined benefit plan. For example, many school teachers who move from one school district to another may not accrue sufficient years of service in their defined benefit plan to obtain the maximum benefit they need to retire. Yet many school teachers are good savers. They discipline themselves and save regularly in their defined contribution plans. Our bill will permit those employees who choose to do so, to ``purchase service credit'' in the defined benefit plan offered by their employing agency.  It is said that knowledge is power. Knowledge about an individual's pension benefits gives him or her the power to plan for retirement and correct errors before they enter retirement. The legislation would require that plan sponsors provide benefit statements to their participants on a periodic basis. For defined contribution plans, the statement would be required annually. For defined benefits plans, a statement would be required every three years. However, employers who provide an annual notice to employees of the availability of a benefit statement would not be required to provide automatic benefit statements to all employees.  The bill also simplifies and repeals some of the legal requirements that burden plans and increase costs for employers who sponsor pension plans. For example, the legislation seeks to repeal the full-funding limit that is imposed on defined benefit plans. This limit prevents employers from funding their defined benefit plans based on the current liability. This depressed funding level threatens the ability of employers to pay benefits, especially as the Baby Boom begins to retire.  This bill will also adjust the section 415 limits that have harmed many participants in multiemployer pension plans over the years. It will also provide a default option for a rollover to an IRA for certain involuntary cash outs. This is our first look at ways to reduce plan leakage.  In the case of a significant restructuring of a pension plan benefit formula, the Retirement Security and Savings Act of 2001 would require that affected recipients be given a benefit estimation tool kit. This would allow pension plan participants to easily determine how their individual benefits would be altered. The bill also directs the Treasury Department to study on the long-term effects of the trend of restructuring retirement plans.  To reduce the burdens of plan compliance, and to encourage voluntary compliance, the legislation includes a number of proposals intended to peel away at the layers of laws and regulations that add costs to plan administration, but don't add many benefits. The legislation would repeal unnecessary rules bogging down pension administration, such as the multiple use test and the same desk rule. Moreover, mistakes made in administering a pension plan are often inadvertent. The IRS would be directed to simplify and expand its voluntary compliance resolution system.  The Retirement Security and Savings Act of 2001 has considerable bipartisan support. Furthermore, over the years that it has been pending, this legislation has received the support of over 100 organizations. These organization include business groups and labor unions; large companies and small companies; private sector organizations and organizations representing government employees and many individuals. Few bills in the Senate can claim the diversity of support from organizations that traditionally don't agree on policy that the Retirement Security and Savings Act of 2001 enjoys. I am proud of this fact. I think it is the clearest signal that we need to enact comprehensive pension reform this session.  I am happy to add one more organization to the list of organizations supporting the Retirement Security and Savings Act of 2001. Horace Deets, Executive Director of AARP sent a letter to me this week expressing AARP's support for the legislation.  I will work to pass this critical piece of pension reform legislation this Congress. I urge my colleagues who have not already done so, to support the Retirement Security and Savings Act of 2001 and help Americans build a more secure retirement.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Retirement Security and Savings Act of 2001 be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill S. 742 was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 742       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
