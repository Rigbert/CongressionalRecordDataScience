 President, I want to talk about the Senate's appropriation for the Corporation for National Service. In particular, I want to talk about the appropriation for AmeriCorps. The program is not yet out of the woods. Though the program may be funded, the Senate should do so only with continued and close scrutiny.  I have been one of the most outspoken critics of the President's AmeriCorps Program. It has begun reform, but still needs more time to succeed. AmeriCorps has former Senator Harris Wofford as its new chief executive officer. He has approached me for assistance in helping the program to succeed.  Senator Wofford has assured me that he is attempting to reform the program. I think that the program deserves that chance. It is a high priority for the President, and I believe that a President should have the benefit of the doubt on his highest priorities. However, this program still needs to meet the tough standards that the President set. Frankly, AmeriCorps has not yet met those standards.  I want to praise the appropriators. In their subcommittee, Senators Bond and Mikulski have funded the National Service Corporation for fiscal 1997 at last year's levels. Because of my involvement, I am particularly proud of one new initiative to be funded in the AmeriCorps Program.                       Awards for Education Only  I want to draw attention to this new cost saving initiative that I helped to develop. Of the entire appropriation for the National Service Trust, $9.5 million will be set aside to award true education scholarships for service. AmeriCorps has announced that it is awarding the first of 2,000 separate volunteers with scholarships, and only scholarships.  In other words, for volunteerism there shall be a reward of education. Gone will be the living allowances, recruitment costs, and much of the administrative overhead. These education-only awards will help true students go to college. The taxpayers will be rewarded with a greater value for their dollar. I believe that this pilot project may become so successful that it could become the future of AmeriCorps.                         Matching Requirements  Senator Wofford has told me he has increased the program matching requirement for all grantees. This requirement was 25 percent and has become 33 percent. This means that 67 percent of the program subsidy for AmeriCorps volunteers should come directly from the Federal taxpayer. This might seem attractive to some, but I have reservations.  I am reserved because, if there is an immediate problem with this target, then the problem could be in the sources of the 33 percent matching funds. It seems that a sizable portion of these matching funds will come from coffers of State governments. Because State taxpayers are also Federal taxpayers, I think that the State taxpayers reasonably expect that we in the Federal Government will do careful oversight of their tax dollars. That is why I hope that AmeriCorps will quantify and reach an acceptable goal for true private sector contributions. I emphasize the words private sector, and I hope that AmeriCorps will adopt a similar emphasis.                            A New GAO Study  In its brief history, AmeriCorps has developed an infamous past. The inspector general of the Corporation for National Service attempted to audit the AmeriCorps' books and determined that the books were unauditable. There has been a lack of financial controls. It seems that some people who were in charge of writing checks were also in charge of accounting for receipts.  Last year, the General Accounting Office found that the AmeriCorps cost per participant was $27,000 instead of the $18,000 promised by the President.  This year, Senator Bond and I have asked the General Accounting Office to conduct another study. The GAO will go out to study the AmeriCorps programs at the State level.  The GAO will audit matching funds gathered by the State programs. The GAO will also look into the feasibility of giving more responsibility to the State commissions under the AmeriCorps Program. Greater autonomy for the State programs is a criterion that was reached in my agreement with Senator Wofford.        The President's New AmeriCorps Initiative, Read America  Mr. President, before I conclude, I want to briefly discuss something regarding AmeriCorps that the President mentioned at his political convention. He mentioned that he would like to employ AmeriCorps subsidized workers to help teach some children to read. Although teaching children to read is a worthy cause, I will say two things about using AmeriCorps to do it.  First, as far as I am concerned, AmeriCorps is still on probation until it solves all of its current and continuing troubles. I question the wisdom of sending more money and increased responsibility to AmeriCorps until it has proven to the taxpayers that it is out of the woods.  The President has called for a massive increase in a program that has only had trouble. That plays into the claims of many that the President has no real interest in seeing AmeriCorps succeed. To them it shows that the President is only interested in seeing it used for campaign promises and political commercials.  Second, I think that if the President wants to help kids to learn to read, then he should allow parents to help their own kids to learn to read. He could do this by delivering on the middle class-tax cut that he promised. With fewer taxes, maybe both parents in a family will not have to work full time as they currently do. I think that many parents would enjoy teaching their own children to read if they only had the time. In short, families do not need more government spending, they need less government spending and fewer taxes.  Mr. President, AmeriCorps has reported that it is attempting to mend its programs. I think that the program deserves that chance. I conservatively support this appropriation with the reservations that I have spoken of.                safe drinking water revolving loan fund
