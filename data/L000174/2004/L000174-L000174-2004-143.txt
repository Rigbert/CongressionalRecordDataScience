President, if I could have the attention of the managers, we have had the basic debate on this amendment. I ask that we have 2 minutes on each side and then go to a vote, if that is agreeable. I will make that request.  I ask unanimous consent that we have 4 minutes equally divided and that it then be in order to request the yeas and nays and go to a vote.
