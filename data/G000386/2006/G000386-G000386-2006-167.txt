 President, today, as everybody is doing, I want to discuss the three stem-cell-research-related bills before the Senate. I have been in the Senate for 26 years now. Every day, we make decisions that impact Americans. It becomes difficult,however, when we debate bills that involve the lives of women and families, especially those who are sick and dying. We must be cognizant of their plights, but we cannot forget about those who don't have a voice.  Tomorrow, I will vote in favor of those who are not yet brought into this world. I will vote for those who don't have a chance to speak against legislation that doesn't give them a chance at life.  First, I intend to support S. 3504, the ban on fetus farming. This bill states that a person cannot solicit or knowingly acquire, receive, or accept a donation of fetal tissue or an embryo if the pregnancy was initiated to provide such material. This bill will reduce the likelihood that women will be used solely for their production of embryos. We have to draw the line, and we have to prevent the corruption that could occur.  Second, I intend to support a bill numbered S. 2754, which directs the National Institutes of Health to fund alternative techniques for stem cell research. It will allow researchers to use different techniques to derive pluripotent stem cells without destroying human life. This research could be done under current law, but a vote in support of this bill will send a signal to the NIH that we want to see even more of this research.  Finally, I will oppose H.R. 810 because it would expand Federal funding for embryonic stem cell research.  Some of my colleagues will characterize the bill, H.R. 810, as a lifesaving opportunity for many people with diseases.
