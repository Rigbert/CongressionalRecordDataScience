If the distinguished ranking member would indulge me further, I would like to call to his attention a research initiative regarding food safety and security that is on the Committee's list of projects eligible for funding. This initiative is one that holds great potential to protect our military from a chemical or biological threat. Does the Senator from Alaska share my view that this kind of a program ought to be a priority for the chemical and biological defense initiative fund?
