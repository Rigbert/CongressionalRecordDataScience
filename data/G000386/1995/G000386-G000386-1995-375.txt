 First of all, S. 1, as far as the unfunded mandates are concerned, the statutory authority that the regulator has to fulfill their responsibilities to protect the public is binding. That is not the sense of the Senate. But I am not saying that because I want to bring less significance to my sense of the Senate. I am saying that because that is the role--that is the place of sense-of-the-Senate resolutions in policymaking in our constitutional system of Government.  The regulator would go ahead and put in the more expensive product to protect the public. But, if I, Senator Grassley, 6 months later said, ``Well, you know, I have some doubts about this. Is it within the cost?'' I ask the CBO to study what the cost is. Let us suppose CBO comes up with the fact that it is over the unfunded mandate estimate.  That is a quantifiable fact that does not affect the decision of the regulators. And that is the intent. But, to be perfectly candid to both of my colleagues who have spoken in opposition to this, I would expect maybe at reauthorization time that that fact could be a basis for maybe tightening up some of the statutes so that regulations cannot circumvent the original intent of the statute.  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?
