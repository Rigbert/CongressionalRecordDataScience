President, far too often, in Washington, the human side of Federal programs are forgotten. This year's debate has been more concerned with the bottom line and tax cuts than how best to serve the people. In a recent column in the Burlington Free Press, Barbara Leitenberg put a face on what is at stake in the Medicaid debate. I ask unanimous consent that Ms. Leitenberg's article be printed in the Record for my Senate colleagues to read.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:            [From the Burlington Free Press, Sept. 4, 1995]                   Seniors Fear Holes in Medicaid Net                        (By Barbara Lettenberg)       ``It's not a Contract with America; it's a contract with      death,'' says Lyman Deavitt, 65, of Burlington, his blue eyes      flashing in anger. ``I'd like to meet Newt Gingrich one-on-     one.''       Deavitt is especially worried about congressional proposals      to limit the growth of Medicaid, the ultimate safety net for      health-care costs.       He suffers from insulin-dependent diabetes and resulting      neuropathy in both legs, two hard-to-treat ancurysms, blood      vessel and bowel blockages, cataracts, and infections in his      one remaining kidney.       Because of surgery for cancer of the bladder, he must use a      device that siphons his urine directly from his kidney to a      pouch outside his body.       ``I have no way to pay for these things,'' says Deavitt.      ``All I have is $704 a month from Social Security. You can      understand why I get on a rampage about those jerks in      Washington.''       Medicaid is a federal/state program, started in 1965, which      provides medical and long-term care for people with very low      incomes. In Vermont, that means no more than $683 per month.      $741 in Chittenden County. A single person must have no more      than $2,000 in resources; a married couple, no more than      $3,000.       More than 82,000 Vermonters participate in Medicaid: Almost      45,000 are under 18; 28,000 are 18-64; and 9,500 are 65 and      older. Medicaid pays for physician and hospital care, and      some home health and personal care. It is the payer of last      resort for care in nursing homes. Medicaid also has special      programs in which people who do not quite meet its strict      income and resource eligibility rules can get benefits when      they face extraordinary health-care bills.       In its Budget Resolution, passed in June, Congress proposes      to cut $182 billion from Medicaid by the year 2002. This      would be done by limiting the rate of increase from about 10      percent a year to just below 5 percent. Although Medicaid      will still grow at this lower rate, programs will have to be      cut because the lower rate does not account for general and      medical care inflation and the growth in the eligible      population.       Some 7,100 Vermonters would be cut from the Medicaid rolls      between 1996 and 2002 if these changes are approved, says the      national Long Term Care Campaign in its study, ``Some Cuts      Never Heal.''       Lyman Deavitt was born in Fletcher, one of nine children:      five boys and four girls. He attended a one-room schoolhouse      and ``just missed graduating from high school in Johnson.''      When he was a young man, his family moved to Essex Junction.       After a series of jobs at the Park Cafe and the old      Oakledge Manor in Burlington and after five years working in      Boston, he became credit manager at Flanders Lumber Co. in      Essex Junction. He stayed there 15 years until his bout with      cancer in 1981 and successive disabilities made him unable to      work.       ``I tried to go back to work at Flanders after my cancer      surgery,'' says Deavitt, ``but I could only manage about      three hours a day, and they had to let me go. Then I had to      spend all of my money on medical care. I was put on      disability in 1984.''       Deavitt's mother taught him to crochet after his cancer      surgery, and he spends a great deal of his time making      afghans. The latest one is going to be raffled off at the      senior high-rise on St. Paul Street, with the proceeds going      to the Burlington Visiting Nurse Association.       If his benefits from Medicaid are reduced, couldn't Deavitt      get help from his family? He has a married daughter in      Florida and a grown grandson. ``There's no way my daughter      can help,'' says Deavitt. ``She's very ill. My parents and my      brothers are dead. Two of my sisters have no money, like me.      The other two are married, and I couldn't ask them. I'd      rather be put out on the street. That's what's happening: The      politicians are forcing people to live on the street.       ``It's terrifying for me to hear all this talk about cuts      in Medicaid,'' says Deavitt. ``If they want to start cutting      programs, they should leave the elderly out, the people with      disabilities, the children. Why don't they stop the space      program instead? To me, this is a bad setup.''                          ____________________
