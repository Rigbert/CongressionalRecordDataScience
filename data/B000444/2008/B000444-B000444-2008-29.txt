 I think what he has said about the consequences and effects of what he is doing are absolutely correct. At the appropriate time, with the permission of the Senator from Indiana, and in the context of a unanimous consent agreement here, we would be prepared to accept the amendment. But we are not quite there yet.  While I have the floor, if I could say for the benefit of my colleagues and their staffs who are listening as to the status of where we are, the Senator from Indiana and I think we are very close to the wrapping up of an entire unanimous consent agreement which would allow us to have no more than four votes, including final passage--at least that is the expectation--and that we would be able to do that sometime within the next 2 hours, and we would be out of here relatively early.  On that point, I thank all the Senators who have had amendments for their cooperation in moving this along, I think a great deal more rapidly than anybody anticipated, at least more rapidly than I anticipated we would be able to do.  To conclude where I began, I say to the Senator from Alabama, I think his initiative is first rate. Everything he says about the consequences of what he is talking about is absolutely accurate, as best I know the situation.  In the context of a wrap-up unanimous consent agreement, we will be able to handle all of this. So that is the intention, I say to the Senator.  I am told in the meantime if and when the Senator from Alabama yields the floor, the Senator from Florida is looking to proceed as in morning business for some relatively short period of time.                           Amendment No. 5086  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendments be set aside, and on behalf of Senator Vitter, I send to the desk an amendment to the Vitter amendment, and ask for its immediate consideration.
