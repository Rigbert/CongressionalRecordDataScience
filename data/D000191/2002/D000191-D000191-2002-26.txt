We were told it was to produce hundreds of thousands of new jobs in the United States, and we were going to ship all these goods to Mexico. Of course, what they did not look at was the total buying power. If every peso earned by every person in Mexico was only spent on U.S.-produced goods, not on bare necessities, not on rent, locally, or anything else, it would have almost equaled the buying power of the State of New Jersey. This was theoretic. And, of course, obviously, that cannot happen. And, in fact, what has happened is our trade deficit with Mexico is up 1,861 percent. We have lost hundreds of thousands of jobs. We are running a $40-billion-a-year trade deficit to Mexico. U.S. corporations are moving their capital to Mexico.  This was never intended to be an agreement for U.S. firms to produce in the United States and ship to Mexico. That was a joke. It was a lie, plain and simple. Unfortunately, a majority of our colleagues bought it. What it was always about was a cheap export platform in Mexico for U.S. manufacturers to move their capital and foreign manufacturers to move closer to the U.S. market so they would not have to ship things so far; big, heavy things.
