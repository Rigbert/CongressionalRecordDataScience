President, today I am introducing legislation that would help improve our country's aging Interstate System--the Interstate System Improvement Act of 1997. My colleagues, Senators Moseley-Braun and Reid have joined me as original cosponsors.  This bill is simple. It would fund the discretionary Interstate 4R [I-4R] program at a level of $800 million annually, a significant increase from the current level of $66 million in fiscal year 1997. I believe that the I-4R program is one of the most crucial aspects of the upcoming Intermodal Surface Transportation and Efficiency Act [ISTEA] reauthorization. And, I hope to work with my colleagues on the Environment and Public Works Committee to incorporate this important measure into ISTEA legislation later this year.  The I-4R program is critical to the resurfacing, restoration, rehabilitation, and reconstruction of our country's vital infrastructure. This year, the program is funded at $66 million. However, demand for funds has outpaced available money by more than 9 to 1. For example, in fiscal year 1997, 25 States requested $1.2 billion in I-4R funds under the discretionary program. Only six States received assistance, most at greatly reduced levels. Nineteen States will receive no I-4R discretionary funds in fiscal year 1997 and over $1 billion in funding requests have gone unanswered.  States with major interstate projects would benefit greatly from this legislation. In Illinois alone, the State faces a highway funding shortage because of crucial projects like the Stevenson Expressway in Chicago and I-74 in Peoria. These projects are simply too important to delay. A healthy I-4R discretionary program is necessary in order to rebuild this vital infrastructure.  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in advancing this important legislation.
