 President, I agree with my colleague that the USDA, which has the expertise to make an informed decision about the value of fruit and other foods in children's diets should be left alone to design the composition of the WIC food packages. Over the past several years, the Agriculture, Rural Development, and Related Agencies appropriations bill has become a vehicle for the debate surrounding the content of sugar in certain foods eligible for inclusion in the WIC program. More recently, the fiscal year 1999 Statement of Managers instructed the Department to provide $300,000 for a study by the National academy of Sciences on this issue, which was not conducted. Now, the fiscal year 2000 Statement of Managers includes language directing that no exception to the sugar cap be made. I assume that this pattern of direction is as frustrating to all of us as it is to WIC program administrators, participants, and suppliers.  Our goal, quite simply, should be to promote a healthy diet for all Americans. USDA nutrition policy should consider the totality of U.S. eating habits and aim for consumer education and program implementation that deals with a person's overall diet rather than one burdened by requirements attached in a piecemeal fashion.  It is unfortunate that the grip of political consideration has taken hold of a matter best left to nutritionists and those trained in the science of public health. It is also unfortunate that the result has been inconsistent policy development where certain nutritional limitations have been imposed on some components of USDA nutrition programs, but not on others. This issue should be resolved by experts who can best determine dietary guidelines properly suited for all Americans. My intent also does not suggest that USDA nutrition programs should be made more complicated than they are, but that a simple injection of common sense should prove refreshing and, hopefully, a basis for sound public policy.
