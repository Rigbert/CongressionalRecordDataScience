DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would simply say that if you judge how good an economy is by the number of jobs created, this policy has been a failure. If you judge economic policy by the kind of fiscal position we now hold--we have a $600 billion deficit and a $3.5 trillion debt; a $9 trillion swing as a result of the tax cuts--this policy is a failure. If you judge by how one pays and rewards work rather than wealth, by this administration's position on overtime, this position and policy is a failure.  I think as we debate the economic circumstances we face in this country these failures ought to be front and center because they are the focus of every American family today.
