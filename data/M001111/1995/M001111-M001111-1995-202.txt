  Mr. President, I am appalled and shocked that there would be this kind of display on the floor of the U.S. Senate. Certainly, Dr. Foster has made it very clear, as Senator Mikulski explained to all of us, that he does not support third trimester abortions, that he does not support abortions for sex selection, nor does he support illegal abortions.  I think it is really outrageous that guilt by association occurs on the floor of the Senate. I think the American people deserve a debate with dignity. I think Dr. Foster deserves a debate with dignity, and I hope that all of us can remember that.  Again, I remind you, Dr. Foster's nomination is in front of us because he is a man with a tremendous history of service--community service--delivering more than 10,000 babies, and I think that is what we should be debating today.  I yield my colleague from New Jersey 2 minutes.
