 Indeed, they were very, very moving. I can share my family story, although it is not as dramatic, Senator, as yours --I lost my husband to cancer, I lost my mother, my father, my in-law's. So I, in a sense, share this with the Senator. I know in their last days how important research is to patients and how willing they are to try new things. Life is critically important.  I thank the Senator for his comments.  If I may, I allot 3 minutes of my time to the distinguished Senator from South Carolina.
