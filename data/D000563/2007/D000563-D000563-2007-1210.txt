President, I rise to speak about S. 888, the Genocide Accountability Act. It is a bipartisan bill I have introduced with Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont, and Senator John Cornyn of Texas.  This Genocide Accountability Act is the first legislation produced by the Judiciary Committee's new Subcommittee on Human Rights and the Law, which I chair and Senator Coburn serves as ranking member.  I wish to thank organizations that have endorsed this act, including Africa Action, the American Jewish World Service, Amnesty International USA, the Armenian Assembly of America, the Armenian National Committee of America, the Genocide Intervention Network, Human Rights First, Human Rights Watch, Physicians for Human Rights, Refugees International, and the Save Darfur Coalition.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from the organizations I have just mentioned supporting this legislation.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                   March 15, 2007.     Hon. Richard J. Durbin,     Hon. Tom Coburn,     Subcommittee on Human Rights and the Law, Senate Committee on          the Judiciary, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Durbin and Ranking Member Coburn: We write to      express our strong support for the Genocide Accountability      Act. We believe this legislation, a product of the      Subcommittee on Human Rights and the Law's inaugural hearing      on genocide, is necessary in order to enable the United      States to lead the world in bringing perpetrators of the most      serious human rights crimes to justice. We look forward to      its swift enactment into law.       Winston Churchill once remarked that the extermination of      Jews in Europe was ``a crime without a name.'' That inspired      Raphael Lemkin to name it, and he then devoted his life to      codifying the crime of genocide in international law.      Lemkin's work culminated in the United Nations Convention on      the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. The      most serious human rights crime had a name, but since 1988,      when the United States formally ratified the treaty, genocide      has been a crime under U.S. law only in the narrowest of      circumstances.       The Genocide Implementation Act (18 U.S.C. 1091), enacted      in 1987 as a prerequisite to the United States becoming a      party to the Genocide Convention, provides jurisdiction over      the crime of genocide only in circumstances where the      perpetrator is a U.S. citizen or the crime took place in the      United States. Since the time that law was enacted, the      world's pledge that it would ``never again'' tolerate mass      slaughter has been mocked again and again--in Bosnia, in      Rwanda and now in Darfur. As the violence in Darfur rages      into its fifth year, the United States must do all it can to      deter those who act with seeming impunity, including by      removing any barriers to prosecution in this country of those      responsible for genocide.       The Genocide Accountability Act would accomplish this by      enabling the Department of Justice to prosecute foreign      nationals suspected of genocide who are present in the United      States. This is not merely a theoretical concern. The Justice      Department has already identified individuals who may have      participated in the Rwandan and Bosnian genocides and are      currently living in the United States under false pretenses,      but current law fails to provide jurisdiction to charge them      with that crime.       Like the pirate and the slave trader, perpetrators of      genocide are rightly considered to be the enemies of all      mankind. The United States must not remain passive when those     suspected of genocide enter or are found in its territory. By      eliminating barriers to prosecution, as the United States has      done in the cases of hostage-taking, torture, and other      serious crimes, the Genocide Accountability Act will ensure      that perpetrators of genocide do not evade accountability      when they are present in the United States. We welcome its      introduction and strongly urge its enactment into law.           Sincerely,         Africa Action, American Jewish World Service, Amnesty            International USA, Arab American Institute, Armenian            National Committee of America, Center for American            Progress Action Fund, Genocide Intervention Network,            Human Rights First, Human Rights Watch, Open Society            Policy Center, Physicians for Human Rights, Refugees            International, Save Darfur Coalition.
