And your minority member, Mr. McCaul, is for that resolution that is going to come out on the Turkish sanctions.  My point to you is there was no vote of this body that they should do that. They are doing their responsibility as the Select Committee on Intelligence, as the Committee on the Judiciary, as the Committee on Foreign Affairs, as the Committee on Oversight and Reform. They are doing their duty.  When they reach a conclusion, they will come and report to us. And they will report, perhaps, no finding, or maybe they will report they have findings and, as a result, this body will vote.  But the gentleman has still not answered my basic question: Do you think it is correct for a President of the United States--clearly, if you read this--you wanted to read the whole thing; you read the whole thing. Clearly, almost everybody who has read it--almost everybody who has read it, even some of Mr. Trump's friends whom he is now mad at have read it and said: Look, this was not proper.  I am asking, Madam Speaker, whether the whip thinks it is proper to ask a foreign leader to interfere in our elections.
