 I thought that was the general understanding, that we would have the ability to vote on both those amendments before cloture.  I do not understand why they are not being given that right. Again, I strongly disagree with both of them. I think there has even been a little bit of demagoguery on the bill. I resent some of the ways they have characterized the positions of some of us who support the bill, but I think they have a right to have a vote on their amendments. I thought there was an understanding.  My question is: Was there not an understanding that we would be voting today prior to cloture on some of these amendments that would be kicked out by cloture if cloture were invoked?
