 President, I rise today to honor Mrs. Mary Jane DeMatteis, Delaware's Mother of the Year 2000.  The story of Mrs. DeMatteis is one of strength and devotion. After her loving husband of twenty years passed away, she was left to raise their six children alone. Mrs. DeMatteis used her faith and her love for her children to persevere through the most difficult of times. While maintaining a job in the Delaware court system, she was able to find the time and energy to care for her children and teach them the importance of family and love.  I have had the opportunity to witness the product of Mrs. DeMatteis' many years of commitment to her children. Claire, her daughter, is one of my most senior advisors and her intellect and strength of character is certainly a reflection of the profound influence her mother has had on her life. Today the legacy of Mary Jane DeMatteis continues as her ten grandchildren are graced with the success and love that Mrs. DeMatteis infused into the lives of her children. I am sure that her impact will be felt for countless generations to come.  We all know that being a parent is the most important job in the world. I am extremely proud to recognize this wonderful honor that Mrs. DeMatteis so well deserves.                          ____________________
