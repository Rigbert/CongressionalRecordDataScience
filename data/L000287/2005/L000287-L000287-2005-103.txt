Mr. Speaker, Charles R. Adams retired from his position of National Employee Development Center Director for the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) in Fort Worth, Texas on November 3, 2005.  Adams learned the importance of self-development at an early age while growing up on his family farm in Logansport, Louisiana. His parents, the late Mr. T.C. Adams and Elneva Adams, gave him and his ten siblings firsthand experience in working the land, and he still carries those experiences with him today.  After leaving Logansport, Adams graduated from Southern University at Baton Rouge with a Bachelor of Science in Agronomy. He received his Master's Degree in Public Administration from Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachussetts in 1983 and has Ph.D. studies in Urban and Public Affairs at the University of Texas in Arlington.  His impressive career with USDA spans some 38 years, having held some of the top positions in his Agency, including Regional Conservationist for the NRCS Southeast Region, based in Atlanta, Georgia, from 1997-2004, Director of the National Employee Development Center, based in Fort Worth, Texas, from 1993-97, South National Technical Center Associate Director, also based in Fort Worth, from 1992-93, and Water Quality Coordinator at the center from 1990-92.  Before that Adams served as NRCS's State Conservationist for Arizona, based in Phoenix, from 1988-90, after having been the State Conservationist for Nevada, based in Reno, from 1986-88. He was the Deputy State Conservationist in New Mexico, based in Albuquerque, from 1985-86, after having been the Assistant State Conservationist for Operations at that location from 1984-85.  Adams worked as an area conservationist in Rio Rancho, N.M., from 1983-84, after working as an area conservationist in Flagstaff, Ariz., from 1981-82. From 1978-81 he served as a district conservationist in Edinburg, Texas, following service from 1976-78 as a district conservationist in Eastland, Texas. He was a soil conservationist for the Agency in Abilene, Texas from 1973-76. He began his full-time career with the agency as a soil scientist in Athens, Texas in 1969.  During his tenure with USDA, Charles founded some of the Agency's most innovative approaches to outreach, including the Student Trainees in Agriculture Related Sciences (STARS) program, an initiative to introduce under-served high school students in the Southeast to agriculture, as well as NRCS's American Indian Program Delivery Initiative, an annual conference linking USDA officials with American Indian leaders to promote tribal participation in USDA programs and services.  While working for NRCS Charles Adams has received a number of awards and recognitions. Within the last few years alone he received several USDA Honor Awards, including the Secretary's Award for his leadership of the Southeast Region American Indian Initiative Workgroup and the Sustainable Coffee Production Team, and his work in the Agency's Streamlining and Cost-saving Initiative. He received special recognition through a national volunteer award for his long-standing dedication to the NRCS Earth Team Volunteer Program and was the recipient of the Chief's Workforce Diversity Award which praised his encouragement and promotion of professional development among his employees. In addition, his extensive outreach efforts to minorities and women earned him a nomination for the Agency's highest Civil Rights Award in 2003.  Adams is married to the former Prenella Williamson of Port Gibson, Mississippi. In his spare time, he enjoys raising horses on his ranch in Shreveport, Louisiana, restoring his collection of antique cars, and fishing with his young grandsons.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Pages E2461-E2462]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                          BIO OF CHARLES ADAMS                                 ______                                                             HON.
