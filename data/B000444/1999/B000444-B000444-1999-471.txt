 President, I rise to introduce the Violence Against Women Act II. I am pleased to be joined by several of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who are co-sponsoring this legislation. My colleagues joining me today include Senators Specter, Boxer, Murray, Mikulski, Landrieu, Feinstein, Lincoln, Snowe, Lautenberg, Reid, Reed, Dodd, Inouye, Kerry, Robb, Kennedy, Wellstone, and Schumer.  Nearly 9 years ago when I first introduced the Violence Against Women Act, it was by no means a given that this body would consider it, let alone pass it. Although it may seem hard to believe now, at that time--less than a decade ago--few thought it either appropriate or necessary for national legislation to be enacted to confront the very serious problem of domestic violence and sexual assault.  The road to enactment was a long one. As Chairman of the Judiciary Committee in the early 1990's, I convened several hearings on the bill and released many reports on the problem of violence against women. Three times I convinced the Judiciary Committee to favorably report the bill to the full Senate. Twice, I had to re-introduce the bill.  Nearly 4 years passed from the original Violence Against Women Act's first introduction before the Senate fully considered it. But at last--in September of 1994--the Violence Against Women Act became the law of our land. And, it did so with substantial support from my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, clearing demonstrating what I have always known to be the case--that the fight to combat domestic violence and sexual assault is not a partisan issue, but a serious problem that affects our constituents in every one of our States and in every one of our home towns across this country.  But even this bipartisan support to pass the act into law did not resolve the dispute as to whether the problem of violence against women merited a national response. As many of my colleagues will recall, throughout the summer of 1995, the Congress debated whether or not we should actually fund the Violence Against Women Act.  Fortunately, by the fall of that year, the Congress finally reached a consensus that the Federal Government both can and should provide significant resources and leadership in a national effort to end the violence women suffer at the hands of men, many of who they live with or have children with. That consensus continues to this day.  Let me provide just a few statistics and examples to show how successful the initiative to fight violence against women has been, but how far we still have to go:  On the one hand, the number of women killed by someone with whom they are in an intimate relationship--such as a current or former spouse, a cohabiting partner, or a current or former boyfriend--had decreased markedly--by 60 percent--in 1996 as compared with where it was 20 years earlier.  And, the total number of women victims of domestic violence is decreasing as well. In 1993, the year before the Violence Against Women Act became law, 1.1 million women reported being the victim of domestic violence or sexual assault. By 1996, the last year for which we have complete statistics, the number had fallen by 25 percent to about 840,000. This is still far, far too many, of course--even one victim is too many--but it represents an encouraging trend nonetheless that I believe we can attribute in part to the successes of this national effort.  However, the news is not all good. One-fourth--25 percent--of women responding to a nationwide survey in late 1995 and early 1996 said that they had been raped or physically assaulted by a current or former spouse, cohabiting partner, or date in their lifetimes. And demonstrating that violence against women is primarily domestic partner violence, 76 percent of women who have been raped or physically assaulted since age 18 were attacked by a current or former husband, cohabiting partner, or date. These are troubling statistics. But the successes of the Violence Against Women Act are combating these trends in a variety of ways, such as:  Putting thousands of trained police officers on the streets to arrest abusers before they can victimize again; supporting police officers as they work to help victims; adding trained prosecutors who put these abusers where they belong--in jail--or enforce protective orders to keep them away from those they have abused; tens of thousands of women and their children have access to shelters that provide a safe haven; victims of domestic violence and sexual assault have access to a wide array of support services from counseling to legal assistance; and a national domestic violence hotline handles hundreds of thousands of calls for help.  Our consensus in the Congress reflects a fundamental agreement across our Nation: The time when a woman had to suffer--in silence and alone--because the criminal who is victimizing her happens to be her husband or boyfriend is on its way to becoming ancient history.  Today, we must build on this consensus and deliver on its promise--because for all the strides we have made, there remain far too many women and their children who are still vulnerable. The statistics I reported just now reflect that reality. Just because we have had some success does not mean we can become complacent and abandon the fight against domestic violence now. And so, the legislation I am introducing today--the Violence Against Women Act II--has one simple goal: make more women and their children more safe.  This legislation builds on the tremendous successes of the original Violence Against Women Act in three key ways--it continues what is working; it seeks to improve what could work better; and it expands the national fight into new areas where the need is clear.  There are many other ideas and proposals in addition to those contained in this bill that deserve serious consideration before the full Senate debates this legislation. And, I am sure there are ways to refine and improve this bill. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to make this bill the best it can be. There are many Senators who are deeply committed to combating violence against women, and many of them have joined me today, for which I am grateful. I encourage all of my colleagues toreview this legislation, offer their insights and lend their names as co-sponsors and leaders in the fight against domestic violence. I believe they will find that it offers comprehensive, sensible, workable, and cost-effective responses to combating violence against women.  Before I describe some highlights of this legislation, let me first emphasize what I believe to be the key, core element of the violence against women II. That central factor is a simple one--the money. We need to ensure that there continues to be dollars for cops, courts, prosecutors, judges, shelters, and all the elements which are working. Keeping the money flowing to where it works requires one simple yet crucial step--extending the violent crime reduction trust fund to 2002. The trust fund is due to expire in 2000. This is perhaps the most significant provision in the act I introduce today, and without it we will fail in the future to replicate our past successes in combating violence against women.  Beyond this fundamental step--and I cannot overemphasize the importance of the trust fund--there are four key policy areas addressed by the Violence Against Women Act II: strengthening law enforcement's tools; improving services for the victims of violence; reducing violence against children; and enhancing and supporting training and education efforts to enlist many more professionals in our shared fight.  On the law enforcement front, the bill introduced today starts with needed improvements to promote inter-state and inter-jurisdictional enforcement of ``stay-away,'' or protection, orders. This is also known as giving ``full faith and credit'' to valid protection orders from any jurisdiction where they were issued. It often happens that the cops in one State may not know that there is a valid protection order issued by another jurisdiction. It is not their fault--it is often a matter of training to recognize valid orders or the means of communicating and sharing information across state lines. This is a mobile society, and victims of domestic violence often find they must flee the place they live and where they previously obtained a protection order so that they can keep themselves and their children safe. For these situations, we propose today a few simple fixes: Permitting state and local cops to use their ``pro-arrest'' grants for this kind of information sharing; encouraging states to enter into the cooperative agreements necessary to help interstate enforcement; and calling on the Justice Department to help develop new protocols and disseminate the ``best practices'' of State and local cops.  These are all simple and common sense solutions, but very necessary nevertheless. This bill will help these fixes become reality.  Other initiatives in this bill are to: Enhance and expand the resources available for courts to handle domestic violence and sexual assault cases; target the ``date-rape'' drug with the maximum federal penalties; continue funding for police, prosecutors, law enforcement efforts in rural communities, and for anti-stalking initiatives; and extend the support of local police ``pro-arrest'' efforts.  Of course, a comprehensive effort to reduce violence against women and lessen the harm it causes must do more than just arrest, convict and imprison abusers--we must also help the victims of violence. This legislation proposes to assist these crime victims in three fundamental ways: Providing a means for immediate protections from their abusers, such as through access to shelters; easier access to the courts and to the legal assistance necessary to keep their abusers away from them; and removing the ``catch-22s'' that sometimes literally compel women to stay with their abusers--such as discriminatory insurance policies that could force a mother to choose between turning in the man who is beating her or keeping health insurance for her children. Another ``catch-22'' affects immigrant women who are sometimes faced with a similar insidious ``choice.'' In 1994, we worked out provisions so battered immigrant women--whose ability to stay in the country was dependent on their husbands--would not have to choose between staying in this country and continuing to be beaten, or leaving their abusers, but in doing so have to also leave our country (perhaps even without their children). This bill fixes aspects of this problem that leave an abused woman with such a horrible, unfair and immoral choice.  Those are this bill's three general policy goals. Let me outline more specifically just how our legislation proposes to boost the protections for the victims of violence.  First and foremost, we must build on our successful effort to provide more shelter space for battered women and their children. There have been significant efforts already to fund shelters for women who are victims of domestic violence and their children. However, the unmet need for shelter remains significant. For example, data from six states, which together have about 16 percent of the nation's population had to turn away more than 45,000 battered women who were seeking shelter because they simply did not have the space. Extrapolating these figures to the entire nation suggests that about 300,000 battered women and their children are turned away from shelters every year.  Current appropriations for shelter space stands at about $89 million. This legislation boosts this amount to $500 million over the the next three years. The additional money will help close the ``shelter-gap'' and bring us closer to the day when all battered women will have a safe, secure haven when they need it most.  We must also provide women with the Assistance necessary so that they can get access to help from our justice system. This bill does so in some clear and common sense ways, such as: Re-authorizing the expiring program to provide about $1 million per year for victim and witness counselors in court; continuing and expanding the highly successful national domestic violence hotline at a cost of about $4 million a year); and developing a coordinated approach to connecting victims of domestic abuse with trained, volunteer attorneys who can provide critical legal assistant.  To them at this very vulnerable time in their lives. I urge my colleagues to support--and even build upon--our efforts to put an end these real problems.  A third area where this legislation seeks action is on reducing violence against children. As my colleagues know, households where a woman is beaten are much more likely to also be home to child abuse and neglect. Moreover, we know that children who witness violence are much more likely to repeat the cycle when they are adults.  Here, our legislation proposes to continue two longstanding programs by providing: Resources to serve runaway and homeless youth who are victims of sexual abuse; and resources for court-appointed special advocates and special child abuse training for court personnel through the victims of child abuse act (originally cosponsored by Senator Thurmond and myself in 1990.)  The remaining area targeted by the Violence Against Women Act--two includes several efforts to help train and educate those already on the front-lines of the battle against violence against women.  Over the past few years, I have worked with several corporations who have begun their own workplace initiatives--everything from 24-hour assistance hotlines for their employees, training to help managers better recognize domestic violence, and even comprehensive employee assistant efforts.  Helping other companies start or improve--on their own initiative--such anti-violence efforts is why this legislation includes a national workplace clearinghouse on violence against women. The clearinghouse will provide technical assistance and help circulate best practices to companies interested in combating violence against women.  Another problem in the field involves the complex nature of criminal investigations into sexual assault cases. To assist the cops in the field who conduct these investigations, this legislation calls on the Attorney General to evaluate and recommend standards of training and practice of forensic examinations following sexual assaults.  Finally, this legislation continues the authorization for rape prevention and education programs. These programs provide public awareness and education efforts to teach young women how to protect themselves from rape and attack.  I have just offered the most general outline of the contents of the Violence Against Women Act II. I introducedthis legislation in the last session of Congress. My colleagues and I worked diligently and productively on it last year and made substantial progress. This year, I am determined that we will complete the work we started last year and pass the Violence Against Women Act II.  I urge my colleagues to review this legislation carefully. This is not just a bipartisan effort--it is a non-partisan effort in which I hope every one of my colleagues will join me. I am confident they will find this bill a comprehensive and practical response that will help us meet a goal I believe is shared by every member of this Senate--making more women and more children more safe now and in the future.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 51       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

(a) Findings.--Congress finds that--       (1) the goal of the immigration protections for battered      immigrants included in the Violence Against Women Act of 1994      was to remove immigration laws as a barrier that kept      battered immigrant women and children locked in abusive      relationships;       (2) providing battered immigrant women and children who      were experiencing domestic violence at home with protection      against deportation allows them to obtain protection orders      against their abusers and frees them to cooperate with law      enforcement and prosecutors in criminal cases brought against      their abusers and the abusers of their children; and       (3) there are several groups of battered immigrant women      and children who do not have access to the immigration      protections of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994, which      means that their abusers are virtually immune from      prosecution because their victims can be deported and the      Immigration and Naturalization Service cannot offer them      protection no matter how compelling their case under existing      law.       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are--       (1) to promote criminal prosecutions of all persons who      commit acts of battery or extreme cruelty against immigrant      women and children;       (2) to offer protection against domestic violence occurring      in family and intimate relationships that are covered in      State protection order, domestic violence, and family law      statutes; and       (3) to correct erosions of Violence Against Women Act      immigration protections that occurred as a result of the      Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act      of 1996.       (c) Effect of Changes in Abusers' Citizenship Status.--(1)      Section 204(a)(1)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act      (8 U.S.C. 1154(a)(1)(A)) is amended by adding at the end the      following new clause:       ``(v) For the purposes of any petition filed under clause      (iii) or (iv), denaturalization, loss or renunciation, or      changes to the abuser's citizenship status after filing of      the petition shall not preclude the classification of the      eligible self-petitioning spouse or child as an immediate      relative.''.       (2) Section 204(a)(1)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality      Act (8 U.S.C. 1154(a)(1)(A)) is amended by adding at the end      the following new clause:       ``(iv)(I) For the purposes of petitions filed or approved      under clauses (ii) and (iii), loss of lawful permanent      residence status by a spouse or parent after the filing of a      petition under that clause shall not preclude approval of the      petition, and, for an approved petition, shall not affect the      alien's ability to adjust status under section 245(a) and (c)      or obtain status as a lawful permanent resident based on the      approved self-petition under clauses (ii) and (iii).       ``(II) Upon the lawful permanent resident spouse or parent      becoming a United States citizen through naturalization,      acquisition of citizenship, or other means, any petition      filed with the Immigration and Naturalization Service and      pending or approved under section 204(a)(1)(B) on behalf of      an alien who has been battered or subjected to extreme      cruelty may be deemed to be a petition filed under section      204(a)(1)(A) of this Act even if the acquisition of      citizenship occurs after divorce.''.       (d) Determinations of Good Moral Character.--       (1) Cancellations of removal; suspensions of deportation.--     Section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8      U.S.C. 1229b) is amended by adding at the end the following:       ``(4) Good moral character determinations.--For the      purposes of making `good moral character' determinations      under paragraph (2), the Attorney General is not limited by      the criminal court record and may make a finding of good      moral character, notwithstanding the existence of      disqualifying criminal act or criminal conviction, in the      case of an alien who has been battered or subjected to      extreme cruelty but who--       ``(i) has been convicted of, or who pled guilty to,      violating a court order issued to protect the alien;       ``(ii) was convicted of, or pled guilty to, prostitution,      if the alien was forced into prostitution by an abuser;       ``(iii) was convicted of or pled guilty to committing a      crime if the alien committed the crime under duress from the      person who battered or subjected the alien to extreme      cruelty; or       ``(iv) was convicted of or pled guilty to a domestic      violence-related crime if the Attorney General determines      that the alien acted in self-defense.       ``(5) Inclusion of other aliens in petition.--An alien      applying for relief under section 244(a)(3) (as in effect      before the enactment of the Illegal Immigration Reform and      Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996) or this subsection may      include--       ``(A) the alien's children in the alien's application if      such children are physically present in the United States at      the time of application, and, if the alien is found eligible      for suspension, the Attorney General may adjust the status of      the alien's children; or       ``(B) the alien's parent in the alien's application in the      case of an application filed by an alien who was abused by a      citizen or lawful permanent resident parent and, if the alien      is found eligible for suspension, the Attorney General may      adjust the status of both the alien applicant and the alien's      parent.       ``(6) Determinations under suspension of deportation.--For      the purposes of making good moral character determinations      under section 244(a)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality      Act (as in effect before the enactment of the Illegal      Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996),      the Attorney General is not limited by the criminal court      record and may make a finding of good moral character,      notwithstanding the existence of a disqualifying criminal act      or criminal conviction, in the case of an alien who has been      battered or subjected to extreme cruelty but who--       ``(i) has been convicted of, or who pled guilty to,      violating a court order issued to protect the alien;       ``(ii) has been convicted of, or who pled guilty to,      prostitution if the alien was forced into prostitution by an      abuser;       ``(iii) has been convicted of, or pled guilty to      committing, a crime under duress from the person who battered      or subjected the alien to extreme cruelty; or       ``(iv) was convicted of, or pled guilty to, a domestic      violence-related crime if the Attorney General determines      that the alien acted in self-defense.
