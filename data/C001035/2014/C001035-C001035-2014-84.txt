Among them is Russell Currier, from the small northern Maine town of Stockholm. It is in Aroostook County. It is very near Caribou where I grew up. I rise today to celebrate the determination, hard work, and community spirit that enables Russell Currier to represent our great country in the Olympic Games.  Russell competes in the biathlon, the demanding and increasingly popular sport that combines cross-country skiing with sharpshooting. He secured his place on America's team by winning three out of four qualifying races in January at the U.S. biathlon Olympic trials.  But Russell's snow-covered trail to Russia began long before that. Fourteen years ago, as a seventh grader, he joined the local Nordic skiing program. A former coach described him as a quiet youngster with no particular interest in the sport.  That quickly changed. The next year, Russell won a county-wide middle school championship. The year after that, he won third place at the junior nationals. Caring coaches and encouraging teammates lit a fire in him that burns so brightly today.  On Russell's personal profile on the U.S. Olympic Team Web site, he wrote that his favorite quote is, ``Less talking, more doing.'' He has embraced that motto with all of his strength, and his perseverance has turned his Olympic dream into a goal he has achieved.  I have a particular rooting interest in Russell's success. He and his parents, Debbie and Chris, are graduates of Caribou High School, as am I. Debbie and I grew up spending summers at Madawaska Lake at camps that were very near each other, and we spent endless summers playing together. I have known this wonderful family for many years, and I am thrilled for them. While the world watches the Winter Olympics, the entire population of Aroostook County and indeed of all of Maine will be riveted to the biathlon competition.  As the name suggests, the town of Stockholm, ME, was settled by Swedish immigrants. When the first 21 families came to Aroostook County in the 1870s, they brought with them an unsurpassed work ethic, a strong sense of community, and a love of skiing. In fact, the entire ski industry of Maine, both Nordic and alpine, can be traced to these hardy, outdoors-loving newcomers.  Nearly a century and a half later, the work ethic and the love of skiing remains strong, and the sense of community is more powerful than ever. When Russell won his place on the U.S. team, friends and neighbors held a fundraiser, a spaghetti dinner at Caribou High School, serving up more than 300 spaghetti dinners so Russell's parents, Debbie and Chris, could make the long and expensive trip to Russia to cheer on their son.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article the local newspaper, the Aroostook Republican, published on the community's support behind the Currier family.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                    [From the Aroostook Republican]                 Benefit Supper Sends Curriers to Sochi                          (By Theron Larkins)       Caribou.--By now, Russell Currier is a household name for      residents all over Aroostook County and Sunday night was a      time to congratulate and support his family, as many County      residents attended a benefit supper held at the Caribou High      School.       The goal of the event was to raise enough money through      donations to send Russell's parents to Sochi, Russia, where      they will soon be able to watch their son compete for Olympic      gold. Thanks to hundreds, who came from all over Aroostook      County to attend the benefit, well over $6,000 was raised to      send Debbie and Chris Currier to the Sochi Winter Games.       There were a number of students, 'teachers and community      members who volunteered at the event. Whether volunteers were      serving food, taking donations, or playing piano in the      background, the towns of greater Caribou were well      represented, as citizens came to show their support and      appreciation for the pride Russell has brought to the region.       One Stockholm resident, who came out to show his support      was Russell's former coach and director of competitive      programs for Maine Winter Sports Center, Will Sweetser,      Sweetser coached Russell since junior high, but he certainly      recognized Russell's success was aided by much more than just      his coach, es.       ``They say it takes a community to raise an athlete, and I      think you can really see that in this room today,'' said      Sweetser.       Currier, who is already training for the Winter Games, in      Italy, could not be in attendance at the supper, due to the      rigorous schedule typical of any Olympic athlete. However,      that didn't hinder the community's reminiscing. Friends and      family stayed well beyond the supper's two-hour allotted time      to eat and share their stories about a young Russell, as they      watched a slideshow of photos capturing the native son not      only on the slopes, but in a number of candid moments, as      well.       ``A lot of people I've seen here tonight, throughout      Russell's entire career, have given pretty selflessly and      everyone is really excited to see him reach this point,''      said Sweetser.       As Sweetser pointed out, a large number came out to back      the Currier family during this hectic time. The last few      weeks have been overwhelming for all of us, as Debbie      Currier, told many attendees, but the community coming      together in such a way has undoubtedly helped cope with the      stress.       ``It's wonderful, it really is,'' said Debbie. ``I see all      the faces who have come out to support us, a lot of the      parents who had children that grew up playing sports with      either my daughter or Russell, they've all just been so      supportive over the years. Since this whole thing started      we've been able to go to all the venues in different towns      and meet all the people who are part of the skiing community,      and it's really awesome that so many came,'' she added.       When asked how special it would be for Russell to have his      parents able to attend such a major event, Debbie's reply may      not have been what would expect.       ``Well, in the beginning he didn't really want us to come,      That's why, originally, we didn't have plans to go,'' she      said. ``But, I wanted to go so badly. I think he's kind of      worried. We are not travelers. We've never been to any of his      races outside of Maine and New Brunswick, so our very first      event to go to in Europe will he the Olympics, and it's in      Russia at a time when things are so unsettled.''       The concern over the last few weeks in relation to      continuous terrorist threats, in Russia, may be worrisome for      many, but 10,000 Americans are still expected to make their      way to snowy Sochi for the event. A spate of suicide bombings      and jihadist threats during the last months have left      potential travelers wary of attending the Winter Games but      Russian and American security forces are vehemently working      to put minds at ease.       Many precautions are being taken, not only by Vladimir      Putin's specially assigned task forces, but the U.S. will      also deploy two Navy ships to the Black Sea to evacuate      Americans should an incident occur.       The concerns regarding safety at the upcoming Winter Games      is certainly something that neither Russell, nor his parents      are overlooking, but for the most part the Curriers have      faith in the joint effort, between the Russians and      Americans, to keep athletes and spectators safe. Security      within the Olympic circle remains extremely tight, yet      there's still concern pertaining to transit points and      scanning areas leading into the venue. If nothing else, the      terrorist threats have succeeded in creating an atmosphere of      paranoia that is tainting what has always been a jovial      celebration of sport and country.       Andrew Kuchins of the Center for Strategic & International      Studies in Washington told journalists recently that Russian      authorities want to handle security alone, even though the      country ``has no experience with an event of this      magnitude.''       Thousands of tickets have yet to be sold for numerous      events in Sochi and there is a growing concern that the      increase in security will disturb the very nature of the      Games. While no country has yet withdrawn from the Games,      many are taking extra precautions, including the U.S. Olympic      Committee, which will be providing its own set of protective      agents and has advised American athletes against wearing any      clothing that may identify them as part of the team.       ``I think it worries him, but it worries us that he's there      too,'' said Debbie Currier.       Despite the negative publicity and numerous threats      surrounding the Games there is a sense that authorities are      doing everything possible to keep the event a celebration      rather than a tragedy, and Debbie and the rest of the Currier      family are confident that everything will go according to      plan.       The U.S. Biathlon Association sent out some information to      help guide us and they seem to think it's safe enough. They      believe that Russian and American authorities are doing      everything they can to keep us all safe.''       The Curriers are planning to leave Caribou on Feb. 5th and      hope to be landing in Moscow sometime late the next day.
