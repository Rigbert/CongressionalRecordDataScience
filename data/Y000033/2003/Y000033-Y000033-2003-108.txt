Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 866, ``The Wastewater Treatment Works Security Act of 2003.'' Our nation's wastewater infrastructure consists of: 16,000 publicly owned wastewater treatment plants, 100,000 major pumping stations, 600,000 miles of sanitary sewers, and 200,000 miles of storm sewers. Taken together, our wastewater infrastructure has a total value of more than $2 trillion.  Significant damage to our nation's wastewater facilities could result in loss of life, catastrophic environmental damage, contamination of drinking water supplies, long term public health impacts, destruction of fish and shellfish production, and disruption to commerce, the economy, and our nation's way of life.  We need to protect our investment in our wastewater infrastructure and be sure it is not used to harm our people, property, or the environment.  H.R. 866 is aimed at filling a remaining major security gap involving our nation's critical infrastructure:  H.R. 866 provides for assistance to wastewater utilities by authorizing critical resources they need to conduct vulnerability assessments and implement security enhancements at their facilities.  H.R. 866 also provides for technical assistance directed to small communities on enhancing security at their wastewater plants.  For these reasons, I urge all members to support this bill.
