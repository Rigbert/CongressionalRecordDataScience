President, I rise today to introduce a bill of critical importance to the natural gas industry in Kansas.  Natural gas production is an important industry in Kansas, paying good wages to hard working Kansans and taxes to support county and state tax rolls. Kansas is a national leader in natural gas production, and we pipe our product all over the nation. It is an affordable, abundant and clean energy source. This bill will ensure that we can continue to produce this natural resource in Kansas.  This issue is complex, full of legalities and arcane federal policy. But I believe the crux of the matter will reverberate throughout the Congress.  The problem before us arises out of the system of federal price controls on natural gas. In 1974, natural gas producers were given permission to exceed the national ceiling rates for gas by the cost of any state or federal tax on production. In Kansas, one such tax was the ad valorem tax. In 1974, the Federal Power Commission issued Opinion 699-D, finding that the Kansas ad valorem tax was a production tax eligible for recovery. Kansas gas producers, like producers in other states, were allowed to exceed the national rates by the costs of a local production tax.  In 1978, Congress passed the Natural Gas Policy Act. That statute continued the practice of price controls on natural gas, but also codified prior practices that allowed natural gas producers to exceed price ceilings by the costs of production taxes. The newly created Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the federal body charged with implementing federal policies in this field, continued the practice of allowing Kansas producers to recover the costs of the Kansas ad valorem tax. Business continued as it had since 1974.  This practice of adding on the Kansas ad valorem tax was challenged in 1983. The FERC responded with opinions in 1986 and again in 1987, stating that it is ``clear, beyond question,'' that the Kansas ad valorem tax is a tax on production and therefore, under law, eligible for recovery. Kansas producers had clear authority to recover the costs of the ad valorem tax.  What happened next is inexplicable. In 1988, the prior FERC decisions on the Kansas ad valorem tax were challenged in court. The D.C. Circuit Court remanded the issue to the FERC. In 1993, five years later, the FERC did the unthinkable. They overturned all their previous rulings in this matter and required Kansas natural gas producers to refund, plus interest, all ad valorem tax monies collected above the gas price ceilings from 1988 forward. The FERC wisely chose 1988 as the collection date based on the D.C. Circuit's decision date. Unfortunately, upon challenge in 1996, the D.C. Circuit extended the refund period to 1983. The result is an estimated $340 million liability due by every producer operating between the years 1983 and 1988.  What has occurred is an atrocious miscarriage of justice. Kansas natural gas producers, who in their business practices relied on the rules and followed the orders of the FERC, were subsequently told they had been breaking federal law since 1974, or for 19 years. They were then retroactively found to be liable for all of the collected tax funds back to 1983. In layman's terms, these producers are being held liable for following the orders of the FERC.  The FERC did not carry out its duties in a vacuum. Section 110 of the Natural Gas Policy Act clearly stated that production taxes could be added to the price of gas, even if the add-on exceeded national price ceilings. The NGPA report language went so far as to spell out what kind of taxes are production taxes, stating ``The term ``State severance tax'' is intended to be construed broadly. It includes any tax imposed upon mineral or natural resource production including an ad valorem tax. . .'' It is evident to me, and I hope to anyone reading this, that Congress included the words ``ad valorem'' tax for an explicit reason--because Congress intended that ad valorem taxes were to be included in the list of taxes eligible for recovery. I have all of these documents in my possession, and would be pleased to provide any of this information to my colleagues. Mr. President, we must remedy this situation. Before us are the citizens of Kansas, the natural gas producers, who for 19 years dutifully ran their businesses in compliance with federal law, and strictly followed the edicts of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. They had a right, indeed a responsibility, to rely on the FERC's orders. Today, they are being punished for following these very orders. The FERC's incompetence has caused these honest citizens to be treated as criminals. However, it is the incompetence of the FERC that is criminal.  Mr. President, I rise today to re-introduce legislation from the last Congress. This bill would repeal the most unjust aspect of this order. Requiring producers to refund these recovered taxes is bad enough. However, assessing an interest penalty on this refund order extends beyond the bounds of decency and fairness. The interest portion represents roughly two-thirds of the estimated $340 million cost to Kansas producers. While the FERC had theopportunity to waive the interest portion, they refused to do so. This legislation is made necessary by the FERC's refusal to take any actions to mitigate this harsh, retroactive and unjust decision.  Mr. President, I will do everything in my power to push this issue through to resolution. I will continue my efforts to encourage the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee to hold hearings on this issue, so they may hear firsthand of the events that lead us where we find ourselves today. I want Congress to hear from the citizens of my state, the young and the old, those in business and those retired, those who have money, and those living on a fixed income, all of whom the FERC has ordered must pay refunds often ranging into the tens of thousands of dollars.  I also believe it is time for Congress to review the independence and power delegated to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. They are unaccountable for their actions, unwilling to accept responsibility and unmoved by the pleas of the stakeholders in this process. Congress entrusted oversight and administration of federal gas policy to the FERC. In this case, the FERC has failed to properly administer the law, and has exercised its authority in an egregious and inequitable manner inconsistent with congressional intent. Congress has a clear responsibility to intervene in this case.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 626       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. LIABILITY OF CERTAIN NATURAL GAS PRODUCERS.       The Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (15 U.S.C. 3301 et seq.)      is amended by adding at the end the following:     ``SEC. 603. LIABILITY OF CERTAIN NATURAL GAS PRODUCERS.       ``If the Commission orders any refund of any rate or charge      made, demanded, or received for reimbursement of State ad      valorem taxes in connection with the sale of natural gas      before 1989, the refund shall be ordered to be made without      interest or penalty of any kind.''.                                 ______                                       By
