Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments the gentleman has made, and he knows this has been a joint effort. The gentleman has worked well with us, and I can assure him that we are on the same page; and as we go to conference, there will be some differences of opinion, but I think if we stand shoulder to shoulder, our policy will prevail.  Now our problem is to try to get the money to take and implement that policy, and that is going to be our responsibility, and I think we can do it. I am very positive about it. I always have been, always will be because it is the right thing to do, and we will continue our efforts; and I thank the gentleman for his comments.
