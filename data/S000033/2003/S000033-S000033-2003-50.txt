 Chairman, let me express my disagreement with my good friend, because let me tell him this. I want the President of the United States to go in front of the national media and say, I am vetoing this bill because I believe in more media consolidation. I think fewer large corporations should control what we see, hear, and read. I want the President of the United States to do that.  Mr. Chairman, I think he is smart enough not to do that.
