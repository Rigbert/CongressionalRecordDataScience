 President, I thank my colleague for yielding me time tonight on this important legislation. I rise tonight to express my support for expanding stem cell research. This innovative research offers us a chance to save lives.  Families across this country are holding out hope that we will finally allow science to move forward and deliver on the promise of stem cell research. That is exactly what we should be doing. But, unfortunately, today the hands of American scientists are tied by political restrictions. I believe we can expand stem cell research while still maintaining strict ethical safeguards. That is why I will be supporting H.R. 810.  Back in 2001, President Bush imposed restrictions on promising stem cell research. Since that time, we have learned that there aren't as many useful stem cell lines as the President suggested.
