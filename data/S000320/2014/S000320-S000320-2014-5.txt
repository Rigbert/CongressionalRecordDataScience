 President, this morning I wish to join my longtime colleague and friend, the senior Senator from Maryland and chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator Barbara Mikulski, in supporting the consideration of three bills before us today. All three bills received strong bipartisan support at the full Committee on Appropriations level.  I am pleased we have begun to reestablish regular order in the appropriations process. We started that last year, and we need to continue it, and we are.  After the uncertainty of sequestration and last year's disagreement over the Budget Control Act caps, this past December's Murray-Ryan budget deal provided the clarity needed to move us toward a regular budget and a regular appropriations process.
