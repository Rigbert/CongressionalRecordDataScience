President, I am pleased that the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Thurmond, and the ranking Democratic member, Senator Nunn, and I have reached an agreement that permits this bill to be voted on today and sent to the President. I intend to vote against the bill for a number of reasons--arms control and others. But I do not want to hold up any further action on it.  I am not going to take the Senate's time to repeat the contents of the agreement. It speaks for itself. It is of critical importance, because the provision that will be deleted from the bill, or reversed in the next Defense authorization bill, would have the effect of undermining an amendment that passed the Senate by a vote of 67-27. It is an amendment that has been agreed to by the House in the fiscal year 1996 foreign operations conference report.  I think this is only the first or second time in my 21 years here when I felt compelled to delay action on a piece of legislation. I did it in this instance because it is an issue I feel very, very strongly about.  For the past 3 years, I have been trying to get the U.S. Government, and other governments, to act to stop the proliferation and use of antipersonnel landmines. There has been remarkable progress. In the past 9 months, several NATO countries took steps far exceeding those called for in the Leahy amendment. Nineteen countries have urged an immediate, total ban on these weapons. This was unheard of, even unthought of, 10 years ago.  The Leahy amendment falls short of that, but it would be a step toward that goal, a goal I support and, in fact, a goal that President Clinton declared at the United Nations 1 year ago.  I want to respond briefly to something the chairman of the Armed Services Committee said yesterday. He said my amendment would ``impose a moratorium on the defensive use of antipersonnel landmines by U.S. Armed Forces,'' and that it would ``require the removal of minefields emplaced in demilitarized zones.'' I know some in the Pentagon who lobbied against my amendment may have said that, but that is not correct.  My amendment would impose a 1-year moratorium on the use of antipersonnel mines except along international borders and except in demilitarized zones, where, I stress, their use is obviously defensive. I included that exception after discussions with officials in the administration, including the Pentagon, and with foreign governments. I concluded that in these limited instances--in fixed minefields along internationally recognized borders and in demilitarized zones where everyone knows where the mines are and where civilians can be effectively excluded and compliance monitored, an exception was warranted. I am talking about places like the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea, or the border between Finland and Russia. Again, my amendment does not require the removal of these landmines.  I do want to concur with the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee when he said yesterday that the bill contains $20 million for humanitarian demining activities--to remove these mines. I am glad he agrees with me about the compelling need for these funds, something I have urged in the past, in the Appropriations Committee as well as the Armed Services Committee. These are funds used to train and equip foreign personnel to remove landmines, in countries that do not have the expertise or capability to do it themselves.  There are 100 million--100 million--unexploded landmines. They are in over 60 countries. If not one landmine was ever put down in the future, there would still be 100 million in 60 countries, waiting to explode. Bosnia has a small percentage of them, but that is 4 to 6 million landmines. The Defense Department has done an excellent job in getting the humanitarian demining program started. The regional CINCS have all expressed very strong support for it.  Mr. President, I was prepared to speak for as long as necessary if we had not been able to reach an agreement to delete this provision. I am very grateful to Senator Thurmond and Senator Nunn, for their willingness to do this. I also want to thank Senator Warner, who I know cares a great deal about the landmine problem.  As we watch our troops land in Bosnia, the horror of landmines, and the serious impediment they pose to our forces, have become obvious to everyone. Look at this map. I ask my colleagues to take a moment to look at this map. Half of the former Yugoslavia is a minefield.  In many areas, our troops will have to crawl on their knees, probing every single inch of the ground, to be sure it is free of mines before they move on. Any step could be their last. It could be a landmine that was put there randomly, weeks, months or even years ago, and now lying hidden beneath mud or snow.  This is not an isolated problem. It is a plague that has infested almost every continent--Somalia, Rwanda, Bosnia, Central America--everywhere our troops are sent, either in combat or as peacekeepers, they will face landmines, millions and millions of them.  But the overwhelming majority of the victims are innocent civilians. In Bosnia, like so many countries, many of the mines are plastic. They are impossible to detect with metal detectors. They are the size of a can of shoe polish. Most are strewn randomly. What maps exist are unreliable.  In Bosnia already, 24 United Nations soldiers have been killed by mines, and 204 have been injured. Thousands of civilians have suffered similar fates. Mr. President, it is such a common occurrence that in Tuzla there is a place where you can buy one shoe--not a pair of shoes--but one shoe. Because so many people have lost a leg or a foot from the landmines.  I mention this not to add to the anxiety of the families of our troops. They will be as prepared as any can be to avoid the threat of landmines. But there is no way to totally eliminate that threat.  Last week, a United States sergeant in Bosnia was quoted as saying he wanted to be sure all the mines are gone before he led his men into an area. If my son was there I would want him under the command of a sergeant like that. The fact of the matter is that nobody can guarantee it. Even after our soldiers leave, the civilians and the refugees will go back to their land. When that time comes, the landmines will be there. Most countries that are littered with landmines, Bosnia included, cannot begin to afford the cost of clearing them. As one person told me from one of those countries, ``We clear the landmines an arm and a leg at a time.''  Last week, UNICEF called for a ban on these weapons because of the carnage they are causing among children, and they called for an international boycott of any company that manufactures them. The American Red Cross has called for a ban. The U.S. State Department estimates that every 22 minutes someone is killed or maimed by a landmine. In the time I am speaking here now at least one person somewhere will be killed or horribly crippled for life by a landmine.  We can debate all day about whether landmines have a military use. Of course they do. What weapon does not have some military use? But do they save lives? I challenge anyone in the Pentagon to prove that landmines save lives. One-third of our casualties--one-third--in Vietnam were from mines, including American mines. Our troops were casualties of their own minefields. That is up from 10 percent of what they were in World War II. A quarter of the Americans killed in the gulf war were from mines. Twenty-six percent of American casualties in Somalia were from mines. These are the Army's own statistics. It will be a miracle if Americans do not lose their limbs or lives from mines in Bosnia.  In October, an American nurse lost both legs and part of her face from a mine in Rwanda. In June, two Americans died from a mine while they were on their honeymoon in the Red Sea area. Another lost a leg and part of another foot on a humanitarian mission in Somalia. He considers himself lucky because he survived, unlike so many mine victims in that country.  These are the Saturday night specials of civil wars. We have a lot more to gain if we declare their use a war crime.  Since August 4 when my amendment passed the Senate, over 10,000 people have been killed or horribly maimed by these tiny explosives that are triggered by the pressure of a footstep. Think of that. In just the past 5 months.  My amendment is modeled after our 1992 law to halt U.S. exports of antipersonnel mines. Since we passed that law, 29 governments have stopped all or most of the exports, and others, including France, Belgium, Austria, and the Philippines have taken steps to ban their production or use of antipersonnel mines and even to destroy their stockpiles.  It is also totally consistent with what the President called for at the United Nations a year ago, when he declared the goal of the eventual elimination of antipersonnel landmines. Every day, 72 more people die or are mutilated by landmines. We need to stop talking about what we are going to do ``eventually,'' and start doing it today.  My amendment is a step toward that goal. I thank the 67 Senators, Republicans and Democrats alike, who voted for it.  The Pentagon says it did not create this problem and that halting our use of these weapons would not solve it. That kind of defeatist attitude does not belong in the Pentagon or anywhere else. Lest anyone forget, the moratorium in my amendment does not cover antitank mines or command detonated claymore mines that are used to guard a perimeter. It would not take effect for 3 years.  The purpose of delaying its implementation is to give us time to go to other governments and say ``we are prepared to stop this, and we want you to join us.'' It gives us the moral authority, and it shifts the responsibility to them. If the United States shows leadership, strong leadership, if we halt our use of these indiscriminate weapons even temporarily, it will give a tremendous boost to the global effort to ban them.  The certification in this bill, which was never debated or approved by either body, sounded innocent enough. But its effect would have been to prevent the moratorium from ever taking effect. It would have given the Pentagon a veto. Some have asked why wouldn't I want to know if the moratorium would endanger the lives of United States Armed Forces. Of course I am interested in the Pentagon's opinion. The conference report already asks for it. Even after the certification provision is deleted, per our agreement, the conference report will still contain a requirement that the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff submit a report to the congressional defense committees containing his responses to seven questions concerning a moratorium on the use of landmines. I have discussed this with Senator Thurmond, and he agrees that he will join with me in submitting some additional questions I have to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, for inclusion in that same report.  Mr. President, the Pentagon wants an exception for mines that automatically self-deactivate. I wish that were the solution, but it is not. Those mines are just as indiscriminate. There is no way to limit how many can be used. There is no way to get governments or rebel groups that have millions of the $2 variety, which do not self-deactivate, to destroy them so they can replace them with more expensive, modern mines. The only way is to ban all indiscriminate, antipersonnel landmines.  Mr. President, we have seen photographs of our soldiers crawling on their stomachs, with sticks in their hands, trying to find where the landmines are, never knowing when they put their hand out just to brace themselves whether their arm will be blown off. That is terrible enough. But this picture is what you see in most countries. That is not a combatant. This is the typical landmine victim, a young girl with one leg gone. Her life changed forever.  Mr. President, during the Civil War, General Sherman--no great humanitarian, called landmines ``a violation of civilized warfare.'' If President Clinton can restrain the Pentagon and my amendment becomes law, the United States will be able to show strong, moral leadership to rally others to put an end to this hideous, global curse. It will not be in time to prevent casualties of Americans or others in Bosnia, but it will save countless lives in the future.  Mr. President, I know of no Member of the Senate, Republican or Democrat, who feels any affection for landmines. Certainly those who served in combat know how terrifying it is to know that there may be landmines under foot. Where we diverge, some of us, is how to get rid of them.  I believe that as the greatest military power, we must set an example. There were negotiations in Vienna in September on proposals to deal with the landmine problem. It ended without agreement, partly because the United States did not exercise as strong leadership as it should have, and could have, on this issue, but also because of resistance by the armed forces of other countries. We did not push for what the President of the United States called for at the United Nations, the eventual elimination of landmines.  I have been to Vienna. It is a beautiful city with luxurious accommodations. I could not help but think, if those same diplomats were to meet in a field in Cambodia and were pointed to a table several hundred yards out in the field, and told to walk out to that table--``Work your way out. We will give you a probe to search for mines. Work your way out through that mine-infested field and negotiate an agreement on these perfidious weapons. And when you are done, work your way back.  ``If you have not reached agreement on the first day, the table will be in a different field on the second day. And in a different one on the third day.''  Mr. President, I think we probably would have an international ban on the use of indiscriminate antipersonnel landmines very, very quickly.  I am not so naive to think that there would not be some pariahs who would continue to use them. But, like chemical weapons and nerve gas and anthrax and dum dum bullets and so on, those who use them are so much the exception to the rule that they would be branded international pariahs and war criminals.  Maybe then a child like this can walk in a field without losing her leg. Maybe people could put their country back together after a war. Maybe American men and women who go on humanitarian or peacekeeping missions would go with one less danger.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of a letter to me from Senator Thurmond, describing our agreement, be printed in the Record, along with a newspaper article from the Washington Post, dated December 17, 1995.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                      U.S. Senate,                                  Committee on Armed Services,                                Washington, DC, December 18, 1995.     Senator Patrick J. Leahy,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: Pursuant to our discussion on the floor      this morning concerning consideration of the National Defense      Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996, I would like to recap      our agreement.       We have agreed that:       1. You will control 20 minutes of debate on the landmine      provision and I will control the same mount of time;       2. You will not filibuster the defense authorization      conference report and will not object to a unanimous consent      for a time certain to vote on the defense authorization      conference report and;       3. If the current version of the FY 96 Defense      Authorization bill does not become law, I will do everything      in my power to ensure that section 1402(b) (concerning a      certification in relation to the moratorium on landmine use)      is deleted from any subsequent version of the bill. If the      current version of the FY 96 Defense Authorization bill is      signed into law, I will do everything in my power to ensure      that section 1402(b) is reversed in the next Defense      Authorization bill.           Sincerely,                                                   Strom Thurmond,     Chairman.                                                                    ____               [From the Washington Post, Dec. 17, 1995]                       The Pentagon's Mine Games                           (By Mary McGrory)       It's ``PEACE on earth'' time. But peace in earth is of more      concern. The Pentagon is worried sick about the death buried      under the mud and snow of Bosnia, where thousands of U.S.      troops will be spending Christmas.       Every day, we hear about the hidden threat that is more      dreaded than the weather, more feared than the snipers and      the hatred that infect the area. The number of land mines is      estimated at between 4 and 6 million. Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-     Vt.) calls these $2 weapons ``the Saturday Night special of      civil wars.'' There are an appalling 100 million of them      scattered around the world, many of them planted in countries      to which our troops may be sent. The prospects make the heart      sink. One-third of our Vietnam casualties were caused by land      mines, although the majority of land mine victims are      civilians.       The Pentagon, while wringing its hands and beefing up anti-     mine training, is pressing its campaign against the anti-land      mine legislation introduced by Leahy. The chief lobbyist for      keeping the world safe for land mines is none other than the      chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. John      Shalikashvili. He says we need land mines to ``protect our      troops,'' an ironic formulation in view of the clear and      present danger they present in Bosnia.       ``While I wholeheartedly support U.S. leadership in the      long-term goal of anti-personnel land mine elimination,'' he      wrote in a letter to one congressman, ``unilateral actions      which needlessly place our forces at risk now will not induce      good behavior from irresponsible combatants.''       The Pentagon is pushing a high-tech solution: a land mine      that expires within a given period of time. The hope would be      that the 60 countries that have planted the cheap mines will      dig them up and replace them with the more expensive version.      Translation, according to Leahy: The Pentagon will decide      what weapons to get rid of--no civilian on Capitol Hill is      going to tell them.       The commander-in-chief generally makes such decisions. Bill      Clinton is an instinctive opponent of an indiscriminate      killer like the land mine. A year ago, he told the United      Nations General Assembly that the U.S. goal is the ``eventual      elimination of anti-personnel land mines.'' Since then,      however, he has fallen silent. He seems to have retreated in      the face of pentagon opposition. Lately, he has been somewhat      more assertive in his role of chief of the armed forces, but      he still tends to defer to the chairman of the joint Chiefs.      The rest of the administration is deeply divided.       Leahy has been the leader of the opposition to land mines      since 1989. He was haunted by the sight of a handsome 10-year      old boy at the Nicaraguan-Honduran border who was limping      around on a home-made crutch. A land mine had taken one leg      and had ``ruined his life.'' Leahy established a $5 million      annual fund to help victims. Three years later he got a one-     year moratorium on the U.S. export of land mines. Legislation      banning land mine use passed the Senate by a two-thirds vote      this fall and the House by a voice vote. It is currently      stuck in conference.       Leahy knows his colleagues sigh and roll their eyes when he      gets up for yet another land mine speech and shows      photographs of the hideous consequences to the causalities,      who, incidentally, are often children. On the coffee table of      his office, he keeps a small round green object made of      plastic and rubber that looks like a shoe-polish container.      It is the mine of choice for most of the countries whose land      is sown with them. He says that if U.N. negotiators were      required to sit around a table in the middle of a field in      Cambodia--now ``a land of amputees,'' in Leahy's words--they      would agree on a ban in a matter of two days at the most.       The cheap plastic mines of Bosnia are difficult to detect,      Leahy notes. An aide gets      down on his knees to show how soldiers must pass a hand-held detector      inch by inch over a suspect area. The Leahy ban would do      nothing in Bosnia. But the Army's dilemma has spotlighted the      issue, which Leahy says stirs the same powerful reaction in      audiences of all persuasions--the VFW, NRA and the League of      Women Voters. Nineteen countries are for the ban.       But in the Senate Armed Services Committee, men like Strom      Thurmond, Sam Nunn and John Warner, inveterate defenders of      the Defense Department, support the Pentagon's attempts to      gut Leahy's bill, even though it wouldn't take effect for      three years and permits mining of border and demilitarized      areas.       Only the president can lead the way out of the world's mine      fields.
