 President, I commend an initiative in my State that I am quite proud of.  I have stood on this floor many, many times over the past 28 years to laud people, programs, and events in Delaware. There is one statistic in my State, however, that I am not fond of repeating, but it is a sad fact that we must, and are, confronting: Delaware has one of the highest breast cancer death rates in the country.  Having said that, I want to commend the efforts of a special group of people who are determined to raise awareness about breast cancer and save more lives.  A couple weeks ago, a Wilmington salon, ``Chez Nicole,'' hosted a unique event to raise money for breast cancer. A couple hundred women packed this hair and manicuring salon on Sunday, March 4th. The owners, Nicole Testa and Joe Cannatelli, father and daughter, opened their business doors and offered the services of their two dozen employees, all free of charge. Nicole's husband, Ken Testa, was by her side the entire day also. The bottom line: More than $14,000 was raised to fight breast cancer.  The Biden Breast Health Initiative is a program designed to educate young women across Delaware on the importance of proper breast health and the life-saving importance of early detection of breast cancer.  Awareness and early detection are the best defenses in fighting breast cancer mortality, and for these measures to be most effective, they must be raised among young women.  Delaware has ranked, consistently and dismally, number one, two or three nationwide in breast cancer mortality rates over the past ten years.  The Biden Breast Health Initiative Committee found that ranking to be simply unacceptable for women, especially for a State as generally progressive as Delaware.  Since its inception, the ``breast health for teens'' program has been presented to many thousands of young women in nearly every high school in Delaware, both public and private.  But it takes more than the hard work of highly motivated volunteers to make a program like this work as well as it has, it also takes money.  All educational and support materials provided for the program are financed through fundraisers the committee holds annually, no taxpayer dollars are used to fund any aspect of the program.  The funds raised at the ``Chez Nicole'' event will be used to reach even more high school students and purchase supplies for the ``breast health for teens'' program. The money also is needed to train school nurses and health teachers on how to help young women maintain breast health throughout their life time.  I am proud to commend the generosity of Nicole Testa and Joe Cannatelli and their ``Chez Nicole'' team for their commitment to helping the Biden Breast Health Initiative educate more young women about breast cancer.                          ____________________
