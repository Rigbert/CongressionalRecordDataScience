 President, I rise today to pay tribute to Ms. Rebecca Ryan, who recently retired after more than twenty years of teaching in the South San Francisco Unified School District. Ms. Ryan is a shining example of what a dedicated teacher can do.  Becky Ryan began her teaching career in 1972 in the South San Francisco Unified School District. After 28 years, she is ending a career that has been filled with many accomplishments.  With over twenty years of experience teaching English as a Second Language Classes, Becky recognized that many immigrant parents, because of their inability to speak English, were reluctant to become involved in their children's education. This lack of parental involvement was detrimental to the children, and led her to found the Spruce Literacy Project at Spruce Elementary School in South San Francisco. This unique program teaches immigrant parents, mostly mothers, how to read, write, and speak English. With a better understanding of the English language, parents are able to more fully participate not only in their children's education, but also in their local communities.  The profound effect the Spruce Literacy Project has had was most evident last year, when the mothers she taught banded together to oppose funding cuts to the program. Becky has been praised for her can do spirit and her encouragement of students.  She has truly made a lasting impact on her students. She has spent her career helping to open doors to those who would have otherwise found them closed. A good teacher affects many lives, and the greatest compliment I can give to Rebecca Ryan is that she helped so many students become productive and successful citizens.  Mr. President, I ask that an article from the Friday, June 9 edition of the San Mateo County Times on Ms. Ryan's retirement be reprinted in the Congressional Record following my statement.             [From the San Mate County Times, June 9, 2000]                  Breaking Barriers and Forging Bonds                           (By Laura Linden)       South San Francisco--Many teachers upon retirement can look      back and know that they had a positive influence on their      students. But perhaps few have helped students make such      profound life transformations as Rebecca Ryan, founder of the      Spruce Literacy Project at Spruce Elementary School.       Through the program, Ryan has taught dozens of immigrant      parents, mostly Spanish-speaking mothers, how to speak, read      and write English. The idea is the parents will get involved      with their kids' educations once the language barrier is      knocked down.       But according to several mothers who attended a retirement      breakfast for Ryan on Wednesday, her work has radiated      outward, affecting every corner of their lives. Ryan, a      petite Anglo with energy to burn and a deft command of      Spanish, has pumped the women up with praise and      encouragement, propelling them into American society with a      fearless attitude.       ``I'm not afraid of anything now,'' said 30-year-old Carmen      Reyes, whose child attends Spruce Elementary.       Reyes' outlook is a psychological world away from the way      she felt when she arrived in this country in 1986 with zero      English     skills and a lot of fear about a society she didn't      understand. ``I was scared for everything, everybody,'' she      recalled.       Other mothers echoed this sentiment.       Before taking the literacy class, rites of parenthood like      teacher-parent conferences or PTA meetings were unfathomable,      they said. The thought of meeting with a teacher, principal      or doctor gripped them with fear. They were worried and      frustrated when they could not read a letter sent home from      school. Often they were too shy, or even ashamed, to try to      find out what it was about.       So assured are these women now that when the district      threatened to cut the Spruce Literacy Project last year, the      mothers vociferously rallied to save it. They are also in the      midst of a fund-raising drive to replace Spruce Elementary's      dilapidated and unsafe kindergarten playground.       The women still grapple with English, but they've learned      that stumbling through the language is the only way to get      better.       ``I can go to the doctor and to the dentist and the bank. I      don't need much help,'' said 27-year-old Cristina Rodriguez,      who immigrated from Mexico when she was 15 but only recently      learned to write. Her newfound skills helped her move up from      dishwasher to server at Denny's, she said.       Ryan started teaching English-as-a-second-language classes      in the South San Francisco Unified District in 1972 and still      wears a ring that students gave to her that year. A few of      those students were at the breakfast on Wednesday.       ``It's so great to see how well they've done,'' Ryan said.      ``One woman's son has graduated from Stanford, another one's      child became a doctor.''       When asked why she is retiring, Ryan just said ``it's      time.'' She said she will keep in touch with her former      students through sewing and reading groups.       Teaching ESL for 20 years, Ryan saw that parents were      avoiding contact with their kids' schools. She decided that      the cultural and language barriers hurt the school as much as      the families and founded Spruce Literacy Project in 1992 with      a grant from the Peninsula Community Foundation. The program      will continue with a new teacher next year, Ryan said.       On the Spruce Elementary campus, the program is a      convenience for the mothers who take their children to class      and then head to their own class down the hall.       Gladis Pacheco, 39, said two years of the literacy classes      helped her land a good job for Catholic Charities in San      Francisco. She came to this country from El Salvador 18 years      ago and for most of those years she avoided speaking English.      ``In my country I was a secretary but here I was a maid,''      she said.       Now she can help her three young children with their      homework. Her daughter, Martha, sent a letter to Ryan      thanking her for teaching her mom English.       ``It was so cute, I didn't even know that she did that,''      Pacheco said.       Perhaps the best part is knowing the children are proud of      you, Rodriguez said. ``My daughter was sad before when I      couldn't speak English but now she's happy,'' she said.       Perhaps the best example of Ryan's 28 years in the district      is the Flores family.       Alejandro Flores, 20, and Florisela Flores, 23, took ESL      classes from Ryan when they were in elementary school. Now      students at San Francisco State University, the siblings say      they gained a sense of well-being from Ryan that continues to      this day.       ``I was a silent kid, very lonely. But (Ryan) was so nice      to me. I liked computers and she rewarded me with computer      time,'' said Alejandro, who along with his studies runs a Web      design company with a friend.       Florisela said she wouldn't be studying three majors with      the intention of getting a master's degree in computer      science if Ryan hadn't shown her the power of persistence 15      years ago.                          ____________________
