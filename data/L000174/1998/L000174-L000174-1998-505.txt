President, I say to my friend from California and to my friend from Utah, I do appreciate their help in this. I can assure you that, while my family and I will gather for the hanging of this portrait--I almost blushed when you mentioned that is my reason for being off the floor--I can assure you I will be back in plenty of time for the vote and I will have 210 pounds of Vermonter standing in the well of the Senate to encourage everybody to vote the appropriate way.
