The Senator from Delaware has yielded to me. I will finish my statement in just a minute, if I can.  Here we are with the July 1 deadline having been met, and here we are with the Vermont labeling law becoming, in effect, the national law. I know there are some for that. There was one Senator from the other side of the aisle, and that was the Senator from Delaware, who went to work to get a reasonable bill. This is a well-crafted compromise. If it is a well-crafted compromise between the ranking member and the chairman with appropriate people like the Senator himself working hard to get support for that, we should go ahead and get this done. I appreciate the willingness of the Senator to work in a bipartisan fashion, and I thank him again.
