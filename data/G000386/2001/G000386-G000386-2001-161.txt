 President, today, on behalf of myself and my colleague, Senator Torricelli, I am introducing legislation, the Medical Savings Availability Act of 2001, which would make the availability of medical savings accounts permanent and would make it possible for any individual to purchase a medical savings account. Our bill would liberalize existing law authorizing medical savings accounts in a number of other respects.  Medical savings accounts are a good idea. They are basically IRAs, an idea everybody understands, which must be used for payment of medical expenses.  The widespread use of medical savings accounts should have several beneficial consequences.  They should reduce health care costs. Administrative costs should be lower. Consumers with MSAs should use health care services in a more discriminating manner. Consumers with MSAs should be more selective in choosing providers. This should cause those providers to lower their prices to attract medical savings account holders as patients.  Medical savings accounts can also help to put the patient back into the health care equation. Patients should make more cost-conscious choices about routine health care. Patients with MSAs would have complete choice of provider.  Medical savings accounts should make health care coverage more dependable. MSAs are completely portable. MSAs are still the property of the individual even if they change jobs. Hence, for those with MSAs, job changes do not threaten them with the loss of health insurance.  Medical savings accounts should increase health care coverage. Perhaps as many as half of the more than 40 million Americans who are uninsured at any point in time are without health insurance only for four months or less. A substantial number of these people are uninsured because they are between jobs. Use of medical savings accounts should reduce the number of the uninsured by equipping people to pay their own health expenses while unemployed.  Medical savings accounts should promote personal savings. Since pre-tax monies are deposited in them, there should be a strong tax incentive to use them.  As I understand it, there are approximately 100,000 MSA accounts covering a total of approximately 250,000. I understand also that approximately one-third of those who have set up medical savings accounts were previously uninsured.  But medical savings accounts have fallen short of their promise because of various restrictions in the authorizing law.  The present law has a sunset of December, 2001, which has discouraged insurers from offering such plans. Current MSA law prohibits around 70 percent of the working population from purchasing them because purchase is limited to the self-employed or to employees of small businesses of less than 50 employees.  The bill we are introducing today would eliminate the restrictions that have limited the availability of MSAs: First, it would remove the December, 2001, sunset provision and make the availability of MSAs permanent; second, it would repeal the limitations on the number of MSAs that can be established; third, it stipulates that the availability of these accounts is not limited to employees of small employers and self-employed individuals; fourth, it increases the amount of the deduction allowed for contributions to medical savings accounts to 100 percent of the deductible; fifth, it permits both employees and employers to contribute to medical savings accounts; sixth, it reduces the permitted deductibles under high deductible plans from $1,500 in the case of individuals to $1,000 and from $3,000 in the case of couples to $2,000; seventh, the bill would permit medical savings accounts to be offered under cafeteria plans; and finally, the bill would encourage preferred provider organizations to offer MSAs.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1067       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
