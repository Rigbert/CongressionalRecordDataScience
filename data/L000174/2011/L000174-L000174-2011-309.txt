Simon is the same question I have asked about Judge Chen, Professor Liu, and every judicial nominee, whether nominated by a Democrat or a Republican President: whether he or she will have judicial independence. I don't care what their politics are. I don't care what party they belong to. I don't care who they have represented in the past. All I want to know is: Will they have judicial independence? Do they understand the role of a judge and how that differs from the role of an advocate?  The judge has to protect everybody in their courtroom, on both sides. There is no question that Michael Simon is going to have judicial independence. So I hope Senators today will set aside their partisan litmus test and join me in supporting this fine nomination.                               Exhibit 1                [From the New York Times, May 22, 2011]                             Breaking Faith       ``I will not vote to deny a vote to a Democratic      president's judicial nominee just because the nominee may      have views more liberal than mine.''       That was Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee,      promising in 2003 not to filibuster judicial nominees for      reasons of ideology. But on Thursday, Mr. Alexander, along      with 41 other Senate Republicans, voted to filibuster one of      President Obama's judicial nominees for that very reason--     breaking a promise and kindling yet another row over a      president's right to appoint like-minded judges.       The fight was over Goodwin Liu, a Berkeley law professor      nominated by the president for a seat on the Ninth Circuit      Court of Appeals. He lost on a vote of 52 to 43, short of the      60-vote requirement demanded by Republicans.       He became the first Obama nominee to be successfully      filibustered, and the only nominee since 2005. That year, a      Senate ``Gang of 14'' agreed that such nominees should be      allowed an up-or-down majority vote except in extraordinary      circumstances.       The group was correct in preserving the right to filibuster      the most extreme candidates, but the agreement is meaningless      if senators are going to define someone like Mr. Liu as a      legal extremist. He is, not surprisingly, a liberal thinker      who is nonetheless squarely in the legal mainstream, having      even received the support of strong conservatives, including      Kenneth Starr and Clint Bolick.       What, specifically, made him so extraordinary that he was      not worthy of an up-or-down vote? The Republican argument      against him is laughably thin. ``He believes the Constitution      is a fluid, evolving document,'' said Jeff Sessions of      Alabama. John Cornyn of Texas falsely accused Mr. Liu of      holding the ``ridiculous view that our Constitution somehow      guarantees a European-style welfare state.''       But other Republicans were more forthcoming about the real      reason for the blockade: Mr. Liu dared to criticize Justice      Samuel Alito Jr. as harshly conservative before he was      confirmed to the Supreme Court. The filibuster apparently was      payback, and the Republican eagerness for revenge has broken      faith and a clear understanding on the Senate floor. That      will make it harder to fill benches during this      administration and many more to come.                                  ____                  [From denverpost.com, May 28, 2011]              Editorial: So Much for the Gang of 14 Truce       The Senate filibuster last week of federal appellate court      candidate Goodwin Liu wasn't just a defeat for the president      who nominated him.       It signifies the dissolution of a truce that had been      struck years earlier in which senators had generally agreed      not to hold hostage qualified judicial candidates from the      opposing political party.       It is a shame it has come to this.       Republicans may be celebrating the defeat of President      Obama's nominee, who on Wednesday officially withdrew his      nomination to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals; however,      it's an action that surely will come back to bite them.       Democrats are unlikely to forget. In fact, Senate Judiciary      Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., told reporters before the vote      that a Liu filibuster would mean Democrats would do the same      to the next Republican president's nominees.       It would be regrettable if that were to happen. The so-     called Gang of 14 had in 2005 joined forces to avert a      showdown on judicial candidates nominated by then-President      Bush.       Seven Republican and seven Democratic senators, cleaving to      the ``advise and consent'' role of senators as enumerated in      the U.S. Constitution, agreed not to filibuster or block      qualified judicial candidates unless ``extraordinary      circumstances'' were in play.       There was, at the time, little consensus as to what      constituted ``extraordinary circumstances'' and assuredly      even less agreement now.       At the time of the compromise, which then-Sen. Ken Salazar      of Colorado took part in crafting, several senators said they      would know extraordinary circumstances when they saw them.       The Republican filibuster of Liu, a University of      California-Berkeley law professor, will set precedents as to      how extraordinary circumstances will be defined. (Colorado's      U.S. Sens. Michael Bennet and Mark Udall, both Democrats,      voted against a filibuster.)       Extraordinary circumstances, it seems, will come to mean a      candidate who holds views that are ideologically repugnant.      That is a dangerous standard.       Liu is a liberal and far more so than other prominent      judicial nominees President Obama has sent to the Senate for      confirmation.       We aren't crazy about some of Liu's positions either, but      he is qualified for the job. The American Bar Association,      which independently evaluates judicial nominees, gave him      their highest ranking: unanimously well-qualified.       We have long favored an up-or-down vote on judicial      candidates, and this is no exception. Elections have      consequences, and those     include the president getting to choose judicial candidates,      even if they are controversial.       A return to the so-called judge wars in an effort to block      the president's power to fill vacancies on the federal bench      ultimately will serve neither party.                                  ____                    [From SFGate.com, May 20, 2011]             Shame on GOP Senators Who Blocked Goodwin Liu       Senate Republicans, dripping with partisanship and      hypocrisy, blocked an up-or-down vote Thursday on the      nomination of UC Berkeley law Professor Goodwin Liu to the      Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco.       Their argument that Liu is a leftist ideologue does not      hold up to scrutiny. Instead, the continuing filibuster of      Liu's nomination carries the distinct scent of political      retribution.       Fair-minded people who have looked at Liu's record and      determined that he has the intellect and temperament to be a      superb appellate judge include prominent conservatives      Richard Painter, chief ethics lawyer in the Bush White House,      and Whitewater prosecutor Ken Starr.       But neither fair play nor intellectual honesty carried the      day in the Senate, where Liu's nomination remained bottled up      through the efforts of multiple Republicans who had opined      (in the Bush years) that it was unconstitutional for senators      to deprive a judicial nominee of an up-or-down vote. The      obstructionists included Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and      Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who were among a group of 14 senators      who had pledged that they would filibuster a nominee only in      ``extraordinary circumstances.''       Both McCain and Graham suggested, unconvincingly, that Liu      was sufficiently out of the mainstream to merit such extreme      action. Graham specifically mentioned Liu's ``outrageous      attack'' on Samuel Alito during his Supreme Court      confirmation hearings in 2006. But, again, on closer      inspection, Liu's point-by-point dissection of Alito's record      was meticulously documented with facts.       Another undercurrent at play is a GOP fear that the 40-     year-old Liu, with his sharp intellect and appealing manner,      might be a candidate to become the first Asian American on      the Supreme Court. The gamesmanship against this well-     qualified nominee is a disgrace to the Senate and a      disservice to the judiciary.                                  ____                [From Press--citizen.com, May 23, 2011]                  Trashing of Court Nominees Must End       The judicial confirmation wars just got a fresh supply of      ammunition. The U.S. Senate on Thursday failed to muster the      votes needed to move forward on the confirmation of a nominee      for a federal judgeship.       That almost certainly ended the Obama administration's two-     year struggle to win confirmation for Goodwin Liu to the 9th      Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals.       The rejection also shattered any hope that partisan battles      over confirmations might finally end. Democrats outraged over      this loss will no doubt remember this and look for an      opportunity for payback. This has been the story since 1987,      when Senate Democrats led the effort to defeat Robert Bork,      Ronald Reagan's nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court. Since      then, both parties have been guilty of trashing the potential      judicial careers of clearly fit nominees: Republicans      skewering Democratic presidents' nominees; Democrats      returning the favor for Republican presidents.       Sadly, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-LA, played a role in      defeating the Liu nomination. This is especially      disappointing since, as the ranking Republican on the Senate      Judiciary Committee--which vets judicial nominees--Grassley      could have helped set a new tone on confirmations. He has      done just the opposite.       Grassley has consistently opposed Liu's confirmation      because, he has said, the professor and associate dean at the      University of California-Berkley Law School is has made      numerous controversial statements in his writings and      speeches that express an ``activist judicial philosophy'' and      because has no prior judicial experience. In a prepared      statement, Grassley said ``Liu holds a view of the      Constitution that can only be described as an activist      judicial philosophy'' and if appointed to the court, ``he      will bring a personal agenda and political ideology into the      courtroom.''       That is one opinion, and Grassley is certainly entitled to      it. Others--including several conservative Republican      lawyers, including former Whitewater prosecutor Kenneth Starr      and two former lawyers in the Bush administration--disagree.      Liu was given a unanimous ``well qualified'' endorsement from      the American Bar Association, and his resume bristles with      sterling academic and professional credentials. Liu would      have been the first Asian-American judge on the 9th Circuit      Court.       What is most disturbing about Thursday's Senate vote is not      the fact that the Senate rejected this nominee, but how it      was done: by a filibuster. In other words, the Republicans      used the Senate rules to prevent a simple up-or-down vote on      the Liu nomination. The effort to end the filibuster fell      eight votes short of the 60 needed. But had the 52 senators      who voted for cloture voted for confirmation, Liu would be      headed for the bench.       This is the very same tactic Republicans (including      Grassley) rightly condemned when Democrats filibustered to      block Republican nominees. They said that all presidential      nominees deserve an up-or-down vote, and they were right      then.       How soon they forget.       Alas, Democrats who are outraged by Thursday's move will      not forget, and this mindless back-and-forth battle over      judges will continue, probably forever. It is a sad day for      the courts, for bipartisanship in the Senate and for the      nation.
