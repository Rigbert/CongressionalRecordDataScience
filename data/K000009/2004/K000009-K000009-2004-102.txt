Speaker, it is very interesting to listen to some of the remarks on the floor this evening. We had a gentleman, one of our Members from California, say how good the economy looks to him. And yet if you read the newspaper today, U.S.A. Today indicates Gateway is going to be closing all of its stores around our country, the struggling PC computer maker, and laying off 2,500 more workers.  In the same newspaper we see a headline, ``No Shortage of Oil, Saudi Arabia Says.'' Saudi Arabia sought to quiet critics of OPEC's decision this week to cut oil production, arguing there are ample supplies, despite decade-high gasoline prices. Their foreign affairs advisor to the Crown Prince said there is no shortage of crude oil.  I would like to draw my colleagues' attention to this chart, which shows that the United States since the mid-1980s and every succeeding year has amassed more job loss and greater trade deficit than ever before in the history of our Nation. This year, the trade deficit is going to go over $580 billion. This is an unbelievable number. That means more imports coming into our country than our exports going out. We are exporting jobs and we are importing products from every other place in the world.  Someone ought to really pay attention in the executive branch, and the Members of Congress who brag how great this is better pay attention to the fundamentals that are driving us in the wrong direction. One of those fundamentals involves rising gasoline prices and rising petroleum prices because we are not energy independent here at home. We need a President and we need a Congress that will make America energy independent again.  Here is another chart. This chart shows over a period of 25 years every single year the amount of petroleum that we consume and how much every year comes from abroad. The Middle East, OPEC, controls half of what flows into this economy. Every time a U.S. consumer goes to the gas pump, at least 7 or 8 cents of what you spend per dollar for every gallon you buy goes to Saudi Arabia, a very undemocratic place, one of the worst dictatorships in the world, no matter how much sweetener they try to put on it; 2 or 3 cents goes to Kuwait and Iraq, all places without democratic governments in place.  It has been happening for a long time. It just did not start. But it has been getting worse, and the job loss in our country has really been getting worse. Good jobs with benefits that people can depend upon, retirement programs that cannot be taken away, and a chance for children to go on to college without becoming debtors, the hole we have been digging has been getting deeper every year.  A gentleman writes a letter to the editor today to U.S.A. Today. He is from out in Michigan. He says that everybody wants free trade, but it seems strange to me that the most powerful Nation on this earth can do nothing to stop the collusion, he says, among the organization of petroleum-exporting countries and our own oil companies to drive up the price of oil.  Here in Washington last night I was watching the television, and Chevron-Texaco had this big ad about how great they were except for one thing, all that oil comes from someplace else and contributes to this rising share of imported petroleum and to the amassing trade deficit that is a damper, a huge damper on creating wealth inside this economy because we are siphoning it out of our own pockets and giving it to someone else.  Imagine if we put those dollars to work to create a new industry across rural America, the biofuels industry, where we ripen ethanol production, soy diesel production, at a level where our farmers could be earning money from the marketplace, not from the Federal Government subsidy that goes to them. Imagine if we really were serious about fuel cell production, imagine if we really tried to bring modern hydrogen production to this country and push our photovoltaic production from the sun, energy from the sun to the limit, to the limit.  NASA has done a great job of helping us move the technology to where it is today, but that is where America needs to move. We do not have to have more job loss. We do not have to have rising trade deficits. We need a government in this country that is going to make us energy independent again and begin creating jobs here at home for the future.  Mr. Speaker, I include for the Record additional extraneous material.                   Pressure OPEC to Lower Gas Prices       Everybody wants free trade. But it seems strange to me that      the most powerful nation on this earth can do nothing to stop      the collusion I see among the Organization of Petroleum      Exporting Countries and our own oil companies to drive up the      price of oil (``OPEC votes to cut oil output, starting      today,'' News, Thursday).       Why can't the U.S. work with our non-OPEC industrialized      allies and other nations that also need a steady supply of      cheap petroleum and take retaliatory economic action by      withholding essential goods and services, or even military      action? We need to give the OPEC cartel a taste of its own      medicine.                                                    Donald Seagle,     Ishpeming, Mich.                                  ____                Gateway to Close All Stores, Fire 2,500                         (By Michelle Kessler)       Struggling PC maker Gateway said Thursday that it plans to      close all 188 of its retail stores and lay off 2,500 workers.       The stores will close April 9, Gateway says. Its computers      will still be sold on Gateway's Web site and via phone.                                  ____                 No Shortage of Oil, Saudi Arabia Says       Saudi Arabia sought Thursday to quiet critics of OPEC's      decision to cut oil production, arguing there are ample      supplies despite decade-high prices. ``There is no shortage      of crude oil,'' said Adel Al-Jubeir, foreign affairs adviser      to the Crown Prince of     Saudi Arabia. ``High oil prices are not good for consumers,      and low oil prices are not good for producers.'' The country      also said it remains in contact with President Bush. The 11-     member Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries voted      Wednesday to cut production 1 million barrels a day, angering      U.S. lawmakers who partly blame OPEC for record gasoline      prices in the USA.                                  ____                 [From the Times of Oman, Apr. 3, 2004]             Higher Oil Price to Take Economy to New Highs                            (By K. Mohammed)       The Sultanate's economy is poised for better performance      this year if the spiralling oil prices are any indication.      Omani crude price, the single most important factor which      drives the Omani economy, is currently staying at $31.44 per      barrel and the market expects crude prices to stay at the      current level in the rest of the year. According to      statistics, the Omani crude prices realised $29.91 per barrel      in January 2004, which is significantly higher compared to      prices realised last year. Last year, the government had      budgeted oil price at a conservative $20 per barrel but the      actual realisation was much higher at $27.84. This had      resulted in a substantial rise in government revenue with all      sectors of the economy witnessing significant growth in 2003.       The government has budgeted Omani crude price at $21 for      the current fiscal (2004) but the actual realisation may be      much higher than the prices realised last year, considering      the present buoyancy in the international oil market. The      most heartening fact about AGCC economies, and Oman in      particular, is that international oil prices have been      staying above the Opec basket price band of $22-$28 per      barrel in the new year, significantly higher than the prices      achieved last year, and Opec is expecting a steady market      this year. International oil prices are currently staying at      around $34 a barrel.       Considering that the oil production will be maintained at      the present level the prospects at the oil price front      remains brighter for the country.       Government's revenue receipts and public spending are other      indicators of the economic growth. Last year, the corporate      sector fared well on account of increased public spending.      The government's actual public spending has increased from      RO2,367.9 million in 2002 to 2,638.5 million as at the end of      November 2003, an increase of 11.4 per cent. The budget for      the year 2004 has estimated total spending at RO3,425      million. The actual public finance deficit for the year 2002      had come down drastically to RO124 million from the budgeted      RO380 million. When government spending goes up the gross      domestic product (GDP) will expand, triggering increased      economic activity and generating more job opportunities and      more revenue for the government. The increased spending      coupled with the prevailing low interest rate scenario is      expected to give the much-needed impetus to economic      growth this year.       Figures on the revenue receipt side looks rosier. As of      November-end 2003, the government's total revenue stood 8.7      per cent higher at RO2,942.5 million compared with RO2,705.9      million mainly on account of increased oil price realisation.      As the average price for Oman crude stood $29.16 a barrel in      December 2003, the government is expected to report a lower      actual deficit for the year 2003 as against the projected      RO470 million.       The country saw inflation remaining below 1 per cent last      year. This year too, the inflation is expected to remain      below 1 per cent level. However, the weakening of the dollar      is a cause for concern as it may put downward pressure on the      local currency triggering a mild flare up in the prices of      euro-denominated goods and services. Like other AGCC      countries, Oman too imports from European countries and euro-     denominated goods are bound to become costlier with the      weakening of the dollar.       The increased activities in the non-oil sector, especially      a significant rise in LNG production will also contribute      much to the strengthening of the economy.       Reflecting the pulse of the economy the local stock market      has scaled new highs. The Muscat Securities Market General      Price Index rose from 272.67 points as at the end of December      31, 2003 to 296.10 points on April 1, 2004, scoring 23.43      points. This shows a handsome gain of 8.59 per cent. The      buoyancy is also reflected in the various sector indices.       On the economic reform front, a lot of action will be seen      in the rest of the year. As part of its commitments to the      WTO, the government is expected to divest a significant stake      in Omantel. Last month, the much-publicized initial public      offering of Al Maha Petroleum opened. The opening up of the      telecom sector will see a second GSM licensee entering the      market soon, paving the way for competition in the telecom      market with consumers ultimately emerging as the winner with      better and cheaper services.               [From Reuters News Service, Apr. 2, 2004]          Bush in Touch With Saudis, Non-OPEC on Oil--W. House       Huntington, WV. (Reuters).--President Bush and the Saudi      crown prince have been discussing oil prices for some time,      and the administration is also talking with other OPEC and      non-OPEC oil producers, a White House spokesman said Friday.       ``We remain actively engaged with our friends in OPEC and      other producers around the world to address these issues,''      White House spokesman Scott McClellan told reporters. ``Bush      and the (Saudi) crown prince have been in touch on this      subject for a while now.''       Earlier this week, OPEC agreed to a production cut of 1      million barrels per day despite Bush administration requests      to delay it.                               ____________________
