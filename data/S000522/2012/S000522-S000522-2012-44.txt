Thank you very much and thank you for reminding all of us that Planned Parenthood really is Child Abuse, Incorporated, 329,000, 332,000 the year before that of innocent children decimated, killed in their clinics.  I would like to now yield to the gentleman from New Mexico, Mr. Stevan Pearce, who is back to us having served in the House. He came back after a different run.  He is a stalwart for life and a great friend of the unborn.                              {time}  2100
