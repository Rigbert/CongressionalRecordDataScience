Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 199) expressing the sense of the House of Representatives regarding the massacre at Srebrenica in July 1995, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:                              H. Res. 199       Whereas in July 1995 thousands of men and boys who had      sought safety in the United Nations-designated ``safe area''      of Srebrenica in Bosnia and Herzegovina under the protection      of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) were      massacred by Serb forces operating in that country;       Whereas beginning in April 1992, aggression and ethnic      cleansing perpetrated by Bosnian Serb forces, while taking      control of the surrounding territory, resulted in a massive      influx of Bosniaks seeking protection in Srebrenica and its      environs, which the United Nations Security Council      designated a ``safe area'' in Resolution 819 on April 16,      1993;       Whereas the UNPROFOR presence in Srebrenica consisted of a      Dutch peacekeeping battalion, with representatives of the      United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the      International Committee of the Red Cross, and the      humanitarian medical aid agency Medecins Sans Frontieres      (Doctors Without Borders) helping to provide humanitarian      relief to the displaced population living in conditions of      massive overcrowding, destitution, and disease;       Whereas Bosnian Serb forces blockaded the enclave early in      1995, depriving the entire population of humanitarian aid and      outside communication and contact, and effectively reducing      the ability of the Dutch peacekeeping battalion to deter      aggression or otherwise respond effectively to a      deteriorating situation;       Whereas beginning on July 6, 1995, Bosnian Serb forces      attacked UNPROFOR outposts, seized control of the isolated      enclave, held captured Dutch soldiers hostage and, after      skirmishes with local defenders, ultimately took control of      the town of Srebrenica on July 11, 1995;       Whereas an estimated one-third of the population of      Srebrenica, including a relatively small number of soldiers,      made a desperate attempt to pass through the lines of Bosnian      Serb forces to the relative safety of Bosnian-held territory,      but many were killed by patrols and ambushes;       Whereas the remaining population sought protection with the      Dutch peacekeeping battalion at its headquarters in the      village of Potocari north of Srebrenica but many of these      individuals were randomly seized by Bosnian Serb forces to be      beaten, raped, or executed;       Whereas Bosnian Serb forces deported women, children, and      the elderly in buses, held Bosniak males over 16 years of age      at collection points and sites in northeastern Bosnia and      Herzegovina under their control, and then summarily executed      and buried the captives in mass graves;       Whereas approximately 20 percent of Srebrenica's total      population at the time--at least 7,000 and perhaps thousands      more--was either executed or killed;       Whereas the United Nations and its member states have      largely acknowledged their failure to take actions and      decisions that could have deterred the assault on Srebrenica      and prevented the subsequent massacre;       Whereas Bosnian Serb forces, hoping to conceal evidence of      the massacre at Srebrenica, subsequently moved corpses from      initial mass grave sites to many secondary sites scattered      throughout parts of northeastern Bosnia and Herzegovina under      their control;       Whereas the massacre at Srebrenica was among the worst of      many horrible atrocities to occur in the conflict in Bosnia      and Herzegovina from April 1992 to November 1995, during      which the policies of aggression and ethnic cleansing pursued      by Bosnian Serb forces with the direct support of the Serbian      regime of Slobodan Milosevic and its followers ultimately led      to the displacement of more than 2,000,000 people, an      estimated 200,000 killed, tens of thousands raped or      otherwise tortured and abused, and the innocent civilians of      Sarajevo and other urban centers repeatedly subjected to      shelling and sniper attacks;       Whereas Article 2 of the Convention on the Prevention and      Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (done at Paris on      December 9, 1948, and entered into force with respect to the      United States on February 23, 1989) defines genocide as ``any      of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in      whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious      group, as such: (a) killing members of the group; (b) causing      serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; (c)      deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life      calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole      or in part; (d) imposing measures intended to prevent births      within the group; (e) forcibly transferring children of the      group to another group'';       Whereas on May 25, 1993, the United Nations Security      Council adopted Resolution 827 establishing the world's first      international war crimes tribunal, the International Criminal      Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), based in The      Hague, the Netherlands, and charging the ICTY with      responsibility for investigating and prosecuting individuals      suspected of committing war crimes, genocide, crimes against      humanity and grave breaches of the 1949 Geneva Conventions on      the territory of the former Yugoslavia since 1991;       Whereas nineteen individuals at various levels of      responsibility have been indicted, and in some cases      convicted, for grave breaches of the 1949 Geneva Conventions,      violations of the laws or customs of war, crimes against      humanity, genocide, and complicity in genocide associated      with the massacre at Srebrenica, three of whom, most notably      Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, remain at large; and       Whereas the international community, including the United      States, has continued to provide personnel and resources,      including through direct military intervention, to prevent      further aggression and ethnic cleansing, to negotiate the      General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and      Herzegovina (initialed in Dayton, Ohio, on November 21, 1995,      and signed in Paris on December 14, 1995), and to help ensure      its fullest implementation, including cooperation with the     International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia:      Now therefore be it       Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of      Representatives that--       (1) the thousands of innocent people executed at Srebrenica      in Bosnia and Herzegovina in July 1995, along with all      individuals who were victimized during the conflict and      genocide in Bosnia and Herzegovina from 1992 to 1995, should      be solemnly remembered and honored;       (2) the policies of aggression and ethnic cleansing as      implemented by Serb forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina from      1992 to 1995 meet the terms defining the crime of genocide in      Article 2 of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment      of the Crime of Genocide;       (3) foreign nationals, including United States citizens,      who have risked and in some cases lost their lives in Bosnia      and Herzegovina while working toward peace should be solemnly      remembered and honored;       (4) the United Nations and its member states should accept      their share of responsibility for allowing the Srebrenica      massacre and genocide to occur in Bosnia and Herzegovina from      1992 to 1995 by failing to take sufficient, decisive, and      timely action, and the United Nations and its member states      should constantly seek to ensure that this failure is not      repeated in future crises and conflicts;       (5) it is in the national interest of the United States      that those individuals who are responsible for war crimes,      genocide, crimes against humanity, and grave breaches of the      1949 Geneva Conventions, committed in Bosnia and Herzegovina,      should be held accountable for their actions;       (6) all persons indicted by the International Criminal      Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) should be      apprehended and transferred to The Hague without further      delay, and all countries should meet their obligations to      cooperate fully with the ICTY at all times; and       (7) the United States should continue to support the      independence and territorial integrity of Bosnia and      Herzegovina, peace and stability in southeastern Europe as a      whole, and the right of all people living in the region,      regardless of national, racial, ethnic or religious      background, to return to their homes and enjoy the benefits      of democratic institutions, the rule of law, and economic      opportunity, as well as to know the fate of missing relatives      and friends.
