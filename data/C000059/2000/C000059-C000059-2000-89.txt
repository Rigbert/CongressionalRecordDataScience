Speaker, I rise today as a former small business owner, a family business, and a strong supporter of H.R. 8, the Death Tax Elimination Act. This bill finally phases out the Federal estate, gift, and generation-skipping transfer tax commonly referred to as the ``death tax.''  Small businesses are a foundation of the American dream. My father, after he served in World War II, started a small coffee shop chain, started with one restaurant and built it up. My father passed away and as a family, we are facing this estate tax, as many families in this country face this tax. It is unfair, it is un-American, and we have an opportunity to end this tax today.  Mr. Speaker, it is disgraceful that we continue this practice, and I am looking forward to a vote today that will finally start us down the road to ending this tax which hopefully will be signed into law.
