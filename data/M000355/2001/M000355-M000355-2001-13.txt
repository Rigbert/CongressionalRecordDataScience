 Assembling this legislation, with important priorities such as the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Department of Education, is a daunting task and one for which you should be commended.  As the chairman knows, the Healthy Start initiative was started in 1991 to reduce the rate of infant mortality in expectant mothers. The legislation we are now considering provides nearly $90 million for Healthy Start. While this is a generous allocation, it has come to my attention that at this funding level, several Healthy Start programs which have been approved by the Department will no longer receive their Federal funding. I know of one such program that stands to lose funding, Voices of Appalachia (VOA) Healthy Start. VOA in Whitley County, KY has done a remarkable job of reducing the infant mortality rate and continues to provide invaluable services to the families of Southeastern Kentucky.  I understand that the House of Representatives has appropriated $102 million for the Healthy Start Program. Keeping in mind that resources are scarce, I would inquire of the chairman whether he would be willing to agree in conference to the level appropriated by the House.
