Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, there are all kinds of remedies, the Secretary of Commerce, the President of the United States, the Congress itself. Let us not kid ourselves. There are so many safeguards in this. This is the only State in the United States that has this ban put upon it.  This is a mischievous amendment. I do not blame the gentleman. The gentleman did not support the bill in the committee, he talked against the bill in the general debate, he wants to defeat the bill, and I understand why he offers the amendment. I compliment him for that. This is a mischievous amendment that should be soundly defeated.
