Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a very special friend and a true military leader, an all-American hero, U.S. Navy Capt. Leroy Farr.  Captain Farr is retiring from the Navy after 30 years of outstanding service to our country. He will be missed.  Mr. Speaker, I have deep respect and admiration for Captain Farr's character, commitment, and dedication. He's a doer, highly competent, yet modest. With his easy going manner, you just can't help liking the guy.  Capt. Leroy Farr has a diverse background in naval aviation and a distinguished one. Test pilot; landing signal officer; operations and maintenance officer; squadron commanding officer; air boss; program manger, and inspector general are some of the positions he has held. The veteran aviator graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1967. He majored in mathematics and aeronautical engineering. Ensign Farr attended North Carolina State University, receiving his master's degree in mechanical engineering in 1968. In April 1969, he earned the coveted naval aviation wings and entered the Light Attack community flying the A-7B. Lieutenant Farr served with VA-46, deploying twice with U.S.S. John F. Kennedy (CV-67).  In 1972, he was selected to attend the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School at Edwards AFB, CA. In 1976, Lieutenant Farr attended the Armed Forces Staff College, Norfolk, VA. He went on to serve as project test pilot at the Pacific Missile Test Center, Point Mugu, CA. He returned to the A-7 Light Attack community for a tour with VA-83 at NAS Cecil Field, FL where he deployed with U.S.S. Forrestal (CV-59). In 1979, Lieutenant Commander Farr returned to shore duty with VA-174, the A-7 Fleet Training Squadron.  In 1980 Commander Farr went back to sea as executive officer and commanding officer of VA-37 flying the A-7E and deployed on both U.S.S. Saratoga (CV-60) and U.S.S. John F. Kennedy (CV-67). He began his air boss tour in 1983 on board U.S.S. John F. Kennedy (CV-67).  Commander Farr was assigned to Naval Air Systems Command headquarters in Washington, DC in 1985. There he served as a branch head in the Test and Evaluation Division, then as the unmanned air vehicle class desk officer in Weapons Engineering Division.  From 1987 through 1990, Captain Farr commanded the Naval Weapons Evaluation Facility in Albuquerque, NM. He was again assigned to Naval Air Systems Command Headquarters, first in the Inspector General's Office, then as head of the Ship and Shore Installations Division. In July 1992, Captain Farr was named program manager for the new established Aircraft Launch and Recovery Equipment Program (PMA251).  He became commanding officer of the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst, June 1993. I am especially grateful for the critical role he played in saving Lakehurst from closing.  Lakehurst, Mr. Speaker, is the heart of naval aviation. It is a unique, one-of-its-kind, world-class facility whose primary function is to ensure that aircraft safely launch and recover from the deck of a carrier or other platform, and that support equipment assist in the service of planes, parts, and ordinance at sea. The safety and success of every single naval aircraft depends on the work and skill housed at Navy Lakehurst.  Despite it's military value, the Department of Defense erroneously targeted Navy Lakehurst for closure--and then for a radical realignment. As part of the realignment scenario, the critical manufacturing, design, and research that goes on at Lakehurst was to be split apart and relocated at other bases.  As commanding officer of Lakehurst, Captain Farr was undoubtedly between a rock and a hard place. He knew the facts. But as a Navy officer, Captain Farr could not and would not violate his chain of command. At the same time, as a captain, a pilot, a former air boss and the current commanding officer of Navy Lakehurst, Captain Farr knew better than anyone just how devastating the close Lakehurst scenario would be for national security and pilot safety.  It was an unusual situation where one's own military command was supporting a plan not in the best interest of American security. A predicament in which a man of less character,less courage, less fortitude, and less grit might decide to look the other way--and let the chips fall where they may. But not Leroy Farr.  Captain Farr simply did what was right.  I remember his wife, Barbara, telling me just how much he grieved for the future of Navy Lakehurst and the future of any pilot who might fly off an aircraft carrier without the support of the skilled workers and artisans at Navy Lakehurst.  I had the good fortune of sitting in on Captain Farr's many briefings when BRAC officials would come to the base to see for themselves what went on at Navy Lakehurst. It was in these skillful presentations that Captain Farr laid the ground work for the ultimate reversal of the close Lakehurst scenario. Captain Farr was informed, clear, concise, fair, direct, honest, sincere, and effective.  It has been my distinct honor and privilege to have worked with Captain Farr and I know I speak not only for myself but for all who support Navy Lakehurst and are dedicated to a strong, capable military defense when I say that we will sincerely miss him.  I wish nothing but the best for Captain Farr because he, his wife, Barbara, and his family are the best of the best.                          ____________________
