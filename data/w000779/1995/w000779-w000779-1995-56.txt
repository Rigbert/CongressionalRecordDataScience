 I would just like to respond, if I might, to my friend from Pennsylvania.  First, let me tell my colleagues that this amendment is far narrower in terms of protecting the rights of homeowners than any similar issue ever discussed on the floor. We have stipulated, for example, that there must be damage to the adjoining homeowners of $10,000 or more.  Second, and I want the Members to understand exactly what the double standard is which no more favorably treats developers than it does homeowners, in the bill, the developer is compensated if their property value is merely diminished. The neighboring homeowner has to meet a higher standard which requires actual physical damage such as the flooding to their basement. So there clearly is a double standard here.  I share the view of the gentleman from Pennsylvania that a developer deserves a fair shake. Certainly there are takings in our country, and developers warrant fair treatment. Let us as we finally move toward the closing of this bill produce some balance and say the millions and millions of homeowners who live next door to these developments have some rights as well. They should not just have to go out and take their chances in some local court.  This bill says that the developer gets a fair shake at the Federal level. Let us make sure that the adjoining homeowner gets a fair shake at the Federal level as well.
