 I have always believed that informed health care choice is the key to a successful Medicare+Choice system. That is why I fought hard in the 1997 Balanced Budget Act for the National Medicare Education Project, which required CMS--then called HCFA--to start a 1-800 number and to send out detailed plan comparison materials to every senior every year. I think this program has been a success, and I intend to push for additional funding for it this year. But Medicare education needs even more improvement, especially before seniors get locked-in to a specific plan for a whole year. So I think it is important that this bill delays the lock-in requirement. I would also like to point out that our doing so today is in sync with recent recommendations from the Advisory Panel on Medicare Education.  Finally, the bill gives health plans an additional three months to assess their costs before making a decision to participate in the Medicare program. Because of exceptional circumstances with respect to timing, we needed to make this change to the so-called ``ACR filing date'' now--prior to the time the Finance Committee acts on Medicare legislation. As I have mentioned, I am not normally willing to make exceptions to Finance Committee jurisdiction, but the circumstances here justify such an exception in this case.
