Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Again may I stress the importance of this legislation and the amendment which I offer to the original amendment by the gentleman from California [Mr. Miller].  This is an interpretation which was disputed between the gentleman from California [Mr. Miller] and myself and from the administration and what they requested. We still believe we did what we should have done in the original bill, or the substitute which I offered, but there is a disputing of definitions. We now believe that we have an opportunity with my amendment to take and resolve that dispute between the gentleman from California, myself, and the administration.  I have had the commitment of the gentleman from California that he is going to support this legislation if my amendment is adopted. Now, the total package will be voted on. And I have also had indications that the Senate would work appropriately with this legislation and the administration would sign this legislation if it gets out of this House in this form.  If this does not occur, that means that we would have to go back to conference; but I am confident that if we went to conference, I have the support of the ranking member and other members involved whereby we can in fact solve this problem and get the community input as necessary.  May I suggest, Mr. Chairman, there has been much said about the preservation of this forest. One of the biggest fears I have and have always had is the burning of our forests today and the lack of management.                              {time}  1245  Fires are natural, yes. We have not been involved with Smokey the Bear, but we have put out fires for many, many years. The volatility of these acres now is about 100 barrels of gasoline per acre in some of our forests. Some of the most magnificent trees today are threatened because of the lack of fire control or fire suppression or, in fact, the continued growth and undergrowth that makes it impossible to put a fire out, and it kills the soil when it burns.  So we talk about the future generations walking through the forests. There will be no forests to walk through if we do not have the proper management. Yes, we can leave some trees aside. We can leave the old growth where it is in some places. We can also take and have the management thinning in the appropriate classification. But we must have what I call the appropriate management, and who better can do that than those in the area in which it lives? I think it is so crucially important that we continue to try this pilot project.  I want to stress again and again, pilot project, five-year project, all environmental laws, all registrations now. But it allows the taking of timber. It allows the proper fire suppression. So I urge the adoption of my amendment. I think it is crucially important that we have the opportunity to continue this.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California [Mr. Calvert], on the legislation itself and not necessarily directed to the amendment.
