The nomination before us today for a lifetime appointment to the Federal bench is Thomas D. Schroeder, to the Middle District of North Carolina. He has the support of both home State Senators. I acknowledge the support of Senators Dole and Burr, and want to thank Senator Whitehouse for chairing the hearing on this nomination.  Last month, the Judiciary Committee reached a milestone by voting to report our 40th judicial nominee this year. That exceeds the totals reported in each of the previous 2 years, when a Republican-led Judiciary Committee was considering this President's nominees.  Thomas D. Schroeder is a Partner at the Winston-Salem, NC, office of the law firm of Womble, Carlyle, Sandridge & Price, PLLC, where he has worked almost his entire legal career. Mr. Schroeder served as a law clerk for Judge George E. MacKinnon on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit. He graduated from Kansas University and Notre Dame Law School, where he was Editor-in-Chief of the Notre Dame Law Review.  When we confirm the nomination we consider today, the Senate will have confirmed 39 nominations for lifetime appointments to the Federal bench this session alone. That exceeds the totals confirmed in all of 2004, 2005, and 2006 when a Republican-led Senate was considering this President's nominees; all of 1989; all of 1993, when a Democratic-led Senate was considering President Clinton's nominees; all of 1997 and 1999, when a Republican-led Senate was considering President Clinton's nominees; and all of 1996, when the Republican-led Senate did not confirm a single one of President Clinton's circuit nominees.  When this nomination is confirmed, the Senate will have confirmed 139 total Federal judicial nominees in my tenure as Judiciary Chairman. During the Bush Presidency, more circuit judges, more district judges--more total judges--were confirmed in the first 24 months that I served as Judiciary Chairman than during the 2-year tenures of either of the two Republican chairmen working with Republican Senate majorities.  The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts will list 44 judicial vacancies and 14 circuit court vacancies after today's confirmations. Compare that to the numbers at the end of the 109th Congress, when the total vacancies under a Republican controlled Judiciary Committee were 51 judicial vacancies and 15 circuit court vacancies. That means, that despite the additional vacancies that arose at the beginning of the 110th Congress and throughout this year, the current vacancy totals under my chairmanship of the Judiciary Committee are below where they were under a Republican led-Judiciary Committee. They are almost half of what they were at the end of President Clinton's term, when Republican pocket filibusters allowed judicial vacancies to rise above 100 before settling at 80. Twenty-six of them were for circuit courts.  When the President consults and sends the Senate well-qualified, consensus nominations, we can work together and continue to make progress as we are today.  I congratulate the nominee and his family on his confirmation today.                          ____________________
