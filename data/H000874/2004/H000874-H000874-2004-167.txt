Speaker, 11 years ago, the majority leader, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay), stood on this House floor and here is what he said: ``Here we are being asked this week to raise the debt ceiling so that this government can go on borrowingmoney to take care of its spending habits, and I think that is outrageous. I hope Members of the House will vote against raising the debt ceiling.'' So said the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay) the majority leader.  He went on to say, ``And I hope the American people will contact the Members of this House, Mr. Speaker, and urge them to vote against raising the debt ceiling.''  Now, the Chair of the conference, Republican conference said this: ``You see, certain lawmakers around this place have hopes of hiding a debt limit increase in a jungle of budget resolutions and conference reports. Mr. Speaker,'' said the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Pryce) chairman of the Republican conference, ``before we give them license to start construction, we must demand a separate vote on increasing the debt limit.''  I ask the distinguished lady from the Committee on Rules, are we doing that?  Well, my friends, the Republican leadership, is that your position today? Are you urging Members to vote against raising the debt ceiling for the third time in three years under your watch? Under Bill Clinton's watch in the last 4 years of his Presidency, we raised the debt limit not once. Not once. Under Ronald Reagan we raised it 17 times. In the 4 years of George Bush 1 we raised it 10 times. Under this president, this is the fourth increase and it is going to be probably somewhere in the neighborhood of $2 trillion additional debt that the children of America will be called upon to pay. And we do it without a vote.  This rule is a good rule. It should be passed unanimously. But just as they did last week in trying to pass their awful tax bill, they put things in to try to sweeten the pot. But this time you put it in to try to hide it.  Contrary to what the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay) said, contrary to what the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Pryce) said, contrary to what the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Nussle) has said, you are going to hide this vote because you do not have the courage to stand up and say I want to increase the debt, I want to undermine Social Security, I want to undermine Medicare. I do not want to be honest with the American public.                              {time}  1330  It is called situational ethics. It is not about ethics; it is about the situation. It is about whether we think it works. We ought to reject this rule. It is not right. The gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay) said vote ``no.'' The gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Pryce) said no. Let us vote ``no.''
