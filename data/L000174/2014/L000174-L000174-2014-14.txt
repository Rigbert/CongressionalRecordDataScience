President, James Baker has served the State of Vermont with great distinction over many years, and I was saddened when he announced his retirement in 2009 after 3 decades with the Vermont State Police. To no one's surprise, he finished his tenure there at the top, as commander.  But we knew retirement would not last long for a man of his talents.  In 2010, Jim Baker answered the call to step in where he was most needed, taking the helm of the Rutland City Police Department when the department and the community were beset by turmoil. Chief Baker's leadership and loyalty was infections, and his plan to serve for only a few months turned into a few years.  During that time, Chief Baker pulled together a team of committed neighbors, businesspeople and community organizers to face the challenges head-on. They tackled blighted neighborhoods and encouraged new investment. They sent a strong message to drug dealers: NOT in our community. And they developed a statistical mapping system to reduce crime in the city's worst-hit blocks. This effort, known as ``Project VISION,'' has shown great success.  With Rutland now on a steady course, one might think Chief Baker would again be thinking of retirement, but that will not be the case. Instead, Jim Baker will be bringing his leadership talents to Washington D.C., where he will serve as director of law enforcement and support with the International Association of Chiefs of Police.  Rutland's loss is our Nation's gain. I look forward to a continued working relationship with Jim, and thank him for his dedication and leadership to the State of Vermont. I ask that the following profile of Jim Baker, which recently appeared in the Vermont weekly Seven Days, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                    [From Seven Days, Nov. 19, 2014]                 Influential Police Chief Has a New Gig                            (By Mark Davis)       When Jim Baker first took over Rutland's scandal-plagued      police department in the winter of 2012, he had a running      joke with the mayor.       In department-head meetings during which a particularly      vexing problem arose, Baker would hold up his city-issued      notebook and point to the first word of his job title.      ``Mayor, mayor, look--`interim,' OK?'' Baker would say to      Mayor Chris Louras. ``That question is for the next guy.''       Baker, a former head of the Vermont State Police, initially      signed on for a six-month stint as Rutland's chief of police.      Nearly     three years later, he still occupies the corner office at the      Rutland police station.       Baker is widely credited with stabilizing the department,      initiating a statistics-based policing program and rallying      dozens of community groups to fight the city's drug problem.      ``He was the driving force not just to turn around a      dysfunctional department but in helping the renaissance of      the city,'' Louras said. ``It would not have happened without      him.''       But now, talk of the ``next guy'' is no joke.       Although the mayor had started preliminary contract      discussions to keep Baker around for a couple more years, the      chief decided it was time for something less stressful. In      December, Baker is leaving for a position with the      International Association of Chiefs of Police, a Washington,      D.C., think tank.       ``I burn a lot of jet fuel when I get into a situation like      I found here,'' said Baker, who has preferred working short      stints--no longer than a few years--during his lengthy law-     enforcement career. The D.C. opportunity, he said, will      enable him to engage in national and international issues on      a less demanding schedule.       A New York native and Southern Vermont College graduate,      Baker methodically climbed the ladder during the 30 years he      worked at Vermont State Police. He held nearly every position      there, including director, before retiring in 2009.       Baker says it is unlikely he'll ever stop working. After      leaving the state police, he launched a consulting business      and became something of a Mr. Fix-It for Vermont law      enforcement. Then a scandal rocked the Vermont Police      Academy: A training coordinator committed suicide after his      computers were seized during a child-pornography      investigation. It prompted the director of the academy to      resign, and in 2010, Baker took over that job for several      months with the intention of rooting out problems and      improving morale.       Next Baker spent a few months as interim police chief in      Manchester. That's when Louras and Rutland Police      Commissioner Larry Jensen came calling. They convinced Baker      to come aboard for six months to help ``settle down'' a      department in the midst of its own scandal.       The Rutland force had been in disarray since 2010, when      state police busted former sergeant David Schauwecker for      viewing pornography on his work computer and removing a      pornographic video from an evidence locker for personal use.      After he accepted a plea deal, Schauwecker was fired. Rutland      aldermen urged the police commission to do the same to then-     chief Tony Bossi, but they said no; Bossi finally resigned in      early 2012.       The Rutland Herald asked for documents related to the      investigation, but the city's police department refused. So      the newspaper sued--and won: In 2013, the Vermont Supreme      Court ordered the department to release the records, which      revealed that, years earlier, two other Rutland officers had      also watched porn on the job.       Meantime, the city wasn't faring much better than its      police department. Once a boomtown fueled by railroads and a      marble quarry, Rutland's economy had lagged for decades. Out-     of-state drug dealers moved in as property values plummeted,      downtown went dormant and vacant buildings proliferated.      Drugs had decimated large swaths of the city long before Gov.      Peter Shumlin devoted his 2014 State of the State address to      Vermont's ``opiate epidemic.''       Known throughout Vermont as ``Rut-Vegas''--a moniker that      Baker forbade his officers from using inside the station--the      city was the brunt of countless jokes.       Then, in September 2012, a tragedy illustrated the severity      of the city's plight. A 23-year-old Rutland man passed out      while driving through downtown, as a result of inhaling gas      from an aerosol can. His foot remained on the accelerator,      and, moving at 80 miles per hour, he slammed into a bank of      parked cars outside the Discount Food and Liquidation Center.      Carly Ferro, a 17-year-old Rutland High School senior, had      just worked a shift in the store and was walking to her      father's car when she was struck and killed.       ``That was the tipping point,'' Baker said. ``That was the      single incident where people in the community said they had      finally had enough and starting rallying around the police      department and the neighborhoods.''       To tackle Rutland's growing list of urban ills, Baker and a      few others organized regular meetings with housing agencies,      social workers, neighborhood activists, lawyers, mental      health experts, educators and city hall workers.       The group that formed called itself Project VISION--Viable      Initiatives and Solutions through Involvement of      Neighborhoods--and focused on problems related to drugs,      crime, housing and jobs. Its monthly meetings, which      attracted 70 to 100 people, helped build public support for a      methadone clinic that opened earlier this year, among other      initiatives.       Seeking further collaboration, Baker invited mental health      workers, social workers, prosecutors, probation officers and      domestic violence experts to relocate their offices to the      police station.       Meanwhile, inside the police force, the chief aimed to      strengthen relations with residents and institute smarter      enforcement. He helped create a crime-mapping project that      plotted the details of every police call--whether for a      family fight or a noise disturbance--into a database. Every      two weeks, officers and members of Project VISION reviewed      ``hot spots'' and developed strategies to defuse them.       Baker also instructed his officers to stop measuring      success by arrest numbers. ``We're not focused on arrests or      how much drugs were seized, but on working through      problems,'' Baker said.       When his first six-month contract was up, Baker signed a      one-year extension, then two more, the last of which paid him      $125,000 a year. ``I saw some opportunity, that I thought I      could contribute,'' Baker said. ``I found out there were some      people in the community working very hard to get it right.''       Among them was Linda Justin. A Rutland native who had      become increasingly distraught by the city's decline, she and      her husband, Bill Beckim, cashed out their 401(k), bought a      derelict building in Rutland's Northwest neighborhood, and in      January 2013 opened the Dream Center, where they host youth      groups, prayer sessions, meetings, block parties and free      meals. One day, Justin called Baker looking for an answer to      a neighbor's question.       After talking for a while, Baker realized, ``Oh my gosh,      you guys are doing what we're talking about doing,'' the      chief recalled.       Baker started to join Justin and Beckim on their      neighborhood walks, chatting with residents about problems      and their ideas for making things better. ``He doesn't just      sit in his office and direct,'' Justin said. ``He gets his      hands right in it. He's a real person. He's down-to-earth.''       And while no one is declaring victory, officials say      Rutland is improving. Calls for police service have dropped      since Project VISION launched, and Baker said the department      is registering double-digit drops in burglaries and property      crimes this year.       Rutland police have had a lot of help. Federal authorities      conducted a three-year operation in the city and have been      responsible for most of the prosecutions against prominent      drug dealers operating there. Vermont Attorney General Bill      Sorrell tasked one of his prosecutors to focus exclusively on      Rutland; assistant attorney general Ultan Doyle works out of      the downtown police station.       Its porn scandal may be over, but the department still      isn't perfect.       In September, two officers were suspended after a brawl      outside a Rutland bar.       In a pending lawsuit filed in January 2013, Andrew Todd, a      former Rutland police officer and now a Vermont State Police      trooper, describes a culture of police misconduct and cover-     ups, and alleges that superiors subjected him to racial      abuse.       Todd, who is African American, claims he brought several      concerns to higher-ups but that little was done. The alleged      misconduct, including officers stealing, having sex and      sleeping while on duty, occurred before Baker came to      Rutland. Though Todd left the department before Baker      arrived, he has alleged that Baker tried to ``influence'' an      outside review of the Rutland police department.       Baker declined to comment on the lawsuit.       In three years, nearly half of the department's roster has      turned over, through firings and attrition. Baker says he is      proud of the holdovers who were willing to adapt to his      methods. ``It would have been very easy for those folks to      bunker down, wait me out,'' Baker said. ``My track record is      pretty clear--I don't stay anywhere very long.''       The mayor is intent on continuing Baker's legacy. Guiding      the search for a new chief, Louras said, will be his or her      ability to adopt Baker's methods.       That includes the continuation of Project VISION. In recent      months, Baker handed off much of his work there to Capt.      Scott Tucker. The community agencies that populate the top      floor of police headquarters aren't going anywhere. And the      monthly Project VISION meetings still attract a crowd.       ``You can't lead,'' Baker said, ``if no one is following      you.''                          ____________________
