 President, I rise today to congratulate the Kennewick schools and their community for being recognized by the Center for Workplace Preparation as 1 of 21 most effective national programs working to involve parents in education. We all recognize the vital role parents have in the social, physical, and psychological growth of our children. Unfortunately, whether by choice, due to other commitments or a lack of communication between parents, children, and the school, parents are all too often excluded from school activities. Our schools recognize that if we are going to effectively deal with the problems in our classrooms, we need a higher level of parental involvement. Fortunately, many of our parents realize they have to become more involved in the education of their children and have collaborated with their schools to develop programs which meet the needs of the families, the schools and the community.  [[Page S1710]] Today, one of the greatest problems facing our schools is drug abuse. We all recognize the toll the drug abuse takes on our families, our communities, and ultimately our economy. Studies reveal that 70 percent of public school students aged 12 through 19 reported in 1989 that drugs are available at their school. Nearly 13 percent of 8th graders, 23 percent of 10th graders, and 30 percent of 12th graders had five or more drinks in a row in a 2-week period during the 1990-91 school year. And, 44 percent of all our teachers reported in 1992 that student misbehavior interfered substantially with their teaching.  There is no question that safety and order are necessary in our classrooms if we want learning to take place. Yet, the use of alcohol and other drugs is unacceptably high among our school-age children and the results of this use are increased violence, misbehavior, and little desire to engage in learning. Recognizing the toll drug abuse takes on our schools and communities, the Kennewick School District and community parents came together to develop the Parent Network which aims to curb student substance abuse and increase parent knowledge of their children's activities. To join the Network, parents must sign an agreement that their children will remain substance free for the school year and will set curfews for their children. Family and student activities are arranged by the Network which are guaranteed to be substance free. I also want to stress that while the purpose of the program is to include parents in this process, the Network ensures that students have a voice in all activities. Their involvement is critical to the success of such programs and I am pleased the school and community have sought their inclusion.  One of our national goals is to encourage parental involvement in education and I want to commend the Kennewick School District and their community not only for recognizing the importance of parental involvement but for implementing a program that works for our schools and our families. The American College Testing recently released a publication entitled: ``On Target: Effective Parent Involvement Programs'' which discusses the need for parental involvement and describes how the 21 selected programs are supporting this aim. I am very encouraged by the efforts being made by communities throughout our Nation and I hope other will follow the example set by these outstanding programs.                          ____________________
