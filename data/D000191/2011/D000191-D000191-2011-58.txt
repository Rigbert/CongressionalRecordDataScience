  Mr. DeFAZIO. This Memorial Day weekend, families all across America have cancelled their travel plans. Others are digging deep to pay 60 bucks for a fill-up. And $10 of that $60 is going to speculators on Wall Street.  Just yesterday, finally, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission filed its first suit against Wall Street market manipulation and speculation gouging the American people. The Republican reaction: Cut the budget of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission--that's what they proposed this week--and block any regulation of energy speculators.  So while families across America are struggling to keep their lifestyle, fill their tanks, and have a little fun with their families, the Wall Street speculators can ride down in their private elevators and relax in the backseat of their limousines while the chauffeur whisks them out to their third house in the Hamptons, because the Republicans have their backs and will protect the speculators at any cost.                          ____________________
