I had already stated that the statement my good friend from Vermont made was a false statement, inadvertently, in terms of Exxon and what they had paid. I commented that they paid more than $18 billion in the years between 2004 and 2008. He returned and said in 2009 is when they have not paid any. They have already paid $\1/2\ billion in 2009 in U.S. Federal income tax, and they will not know the final liability until they file a return later this year. So they are still doing it. The information that my good friend has is false.  Getting back to the bill and who this affects, it doesn't affect Exxon, BP, and all these giant companies. It is the small producers that will be driven out of business. Without being able to do the deduction of the expenses on manufacturing, if this bill passes, this is going to single out the oil and gas industry, the only industry that does not enjoy the same deductions. They are punitive to this industry because right now it is quite obvious they are trying to exploit the tragedy in the gulf.  It is my understanding I have a minute and a half remaining.
