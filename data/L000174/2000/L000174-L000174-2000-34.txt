President, on June 9, 1999, our departed friend and colleague, the former senior Senator from Georgia, introduced the National Forensic Sciences Improvement Act of 1999. This important legislative initiative called for an infusion of Federal funds to improve the quality of State and local forensic science services. I am pleased that Senator Sessions has revived the bill, and that we are passing it today as the Paul Coverdell National Forensic Sciences Improvement Act of 2000, S. 3045.  The use of quality forensic science services is widely accepted as a key to effective crime-fighting, especially with advanced technologies such as DNA testing. Over the past decade, DNA testing has emerged as the most reliable forensic technique for identifying criminals when biological material is left at a crime scene. Because of its scientific precision, DNA testing can, in some cases, conclusively establish a suspect's guilt or innocence. In other cases, DNA testing may not conclusively establish guilt or innocence, but may have significant probative value for investigators.  While DNA's power to root out the truth has been a boon to law enforcement, it has also been the salvation of law enforcement's mistakes--those who for one reason or another, are prosecuted and convicted of crimes that they did not commit. In more than 75 cases in the United States and Canada, DNA evidence has led to the exoneration of innocent men and women who were wrongfully convicted. This number includes at least 9 individuals sentenced to death, some of whom came within days of being executed. In more than a dozen cases, moreover, post-conviction DNA testing that has exonerated an innocent person has also enhanced public safety by providing evidence that led to the apprehension of the real perpetrator.  Clearly, forensic science services like DNA testing are critical to the effective administration of justice in 21st century America.  Forensic science workloads have increased significantly over the past five years, both in number and complexity. Since Congress established the Combined DNA Index System in the mid-1990s, States have been busy collecting DNA samples from convicted offenders for analysis and indexing. Increased Federal funding for State and local law enforcement programs has resulted in more and better trained police officers who are collecting immense amounts of evidence that can and should be subjected to crime laboratory analysis.  Funding has simply not kept pace with this increasing demand, and State crime laboratories are now seriously bottlenecked. Backlogs have impeded the use of new technologies like DNA testing in solving cases without suspects--and reexamining cases in which there are strong claims of innocence--as laboratories are required to give priority status to those cases in which a suspect is known. In some parts of the country, investigators must wait several months--and sometimes more than a year--to get DNA test results from rape and other violent crime evidence. Solely for lack of funding, critical evidence remains untested while rapists and killers remain at large, victims continue to anguish, and statutes of limitation on prosecution expire.  Let me describe the situation in my home State. The Vermont Forensics Laboratory is currently operating in an old Vermont State Hospital building in Waterbury, Vermont. Though it is proudly one of only two fully-accredited forensics labs in New England, it is trying to do 21st century science in a 1940's building. The lab has very limited space and no central climate control--both essential conditions for precise forensic science. It also has a large storage freezer full of untested DNA evidence from unsolved cases, for which there are no other leads besides the untested evidence. The evidence is not being processed because the lab does not have the space, equipment or manpower.  I commend the scientists and lab personnel at the Vermont Forensics Laboratory for the fine work they do everyday under difficult circumstances. But the people of the State of Vermont deserve better. This is our chance to provide them with the facilities and equipment they deserve.  Passage of the Paul Coverdell National Forensic Sciences Improvement Act will give States like Vermont the help they desperately need to handle the increased workloads placed upon their forensic science systems. It allocates $738 million over the next six years for grants to qualified forensic science laboratories and medical examiner's offices for laboratory accreditation, automated equipment, supplies, training, facility improvements, and staff enhancements.  I have worked with Senator Sessions to revise the bill's allocation formula to make it fair for all States. We have agreed to add a minimum allocation of .06 percent of the total appropriation for each fiscal year for smaller states and have increased the maximum percentage of federal funds available for facility costs from 40 percent to 80 percent for these smaller states. This is only fair for smaller States with limited tax bases and other finite resources, such as my home State of Vermont.  The bill we pass today also authorizes $30 million for fiscal year 2001 for the elimination of DNA convicted offender database sample backlogs and other related purposes. I support this provision, although I regret that it does not go further. Senator Schumer and I have proposed increasing this authorization by $25 million, which is the amount needed to eliminate the backlog of untested crime scene evidence from unsolved crimes. This backlog is as serious a problem as the convicted offender sample backlog, and we should take the opportunity to address it now.  I am also deeply disappointed that S. 3045 fails to address the urgent need to increase access to DNA testing for prisoners who were convicted before this truth-seeking technology became widely available. Prosecutors and law enforcement officers across the country use DNA testing to prove guilt, and rightly so. By the same token, however, it should be used to do what is equally scientifically reliable to do--prove innocence.  I was greatly heartened earlier this month when the Governor of Virginia finally pardoned Earl Washington, after new DNA tests confirmed what earlier DNA tests had shown: He was the wrong guy. He was the 88th wrong guy discovered on death row since the reinstatement of capital punishment. His case only goes to show that we cannot sit back and assume that prosecutors and courts will do the right thingwhen it comes to DNA. It took Earl Washington years to convince prosecutors to do the very simple tests that would prove his innocence, and more time still to win a pardon. And he is still in prison today.  States like Virginia continue to stonewall on requests for DNA testing. They continue to hide behind time limits and procedural default rules to deny prisoners the right to present DNA test results in court. They are still destroying the DNA evidence that could set innocent people free. These sorts of practices must stop. We should not pass up the promise of truth and justice for both sides of our adversarial system that DNA evidence offers.  By passing S. 3045, we substantially increase funding to improve the quality and availability of DNA analysis for law enforcement purposes. That is an appropriate use of Federal funds. But we at least ought to require that this truth-seeking technology be made available to both sides.  I proposed a modest Sense of Congress amendment to S. 3045, which the Senate is passing today. It describes how DNA testing can and has resulted in the post-conviction exoneration of scores of innocent men and women, including some under sentence of death, and expresses the sense of Congress that we should condition forensic science-related grants to a State or State forensic facility on the State's agreement to ensure post-conviction DNA testing in appropriate cases. Because post-conviction DNA testing has shown that innocent people are sentenced to death in this country with alarming frequency, and because the most common constitutional error in capital cases is egregiously incompetent defense lawyering, my amendment also calls on Congress to work with the States to improve the quality of legal representation in capital cases through the establishment of counsel standards.  I introduced legislation in this Congress that would have accomplished both of these things. The Innocence Protection Act of 2000 contains meaningful reforms that I believe could save innocent lives. As the 106th Congress winds down, we have 14 cosponsors in the Senate, and about 80 in the House. We have Democratic and Republican cosponsors, supporters of the death penalty and opponents. President Clinton, Vice-President Gore, and Attorney General Reno have all expressed support for the bill.  Tragically, real reform of our nation's capital punishment system foundered on the shoals of election-year politics. But with the Sense of Congress provision that we pass today, at least we have agreed on a blueprint for effective reform legislation in the 107th Congress.  Finally, I want to discuss another amendment that I proposed, together with Senator Sessions, and that the Senate passes today. It concerns the Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act of 2000, which the Senate passed on March 27, 2000.  The Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act was an important step forward, and I want to thank Mr. Hyde, Mr. Conyers and Senators Sessions, Schumer, Biden, and all others who worked with us in good faith to enact these long overdue reforms. At the same time, there was some unfinished business in connection with this legislation that my amendment completes.  The bill that the Senate passed by unanimous consent on March 27th was supposed to be a substitute amendment to H.R. 1658. I had been led to believe that the substitute was word-for-word that which I had painstakingly worked out over the preceding weeks for approval by the Senate Committee on the Judiciary the previous Thursday, March 23, 2000. Imagine my surprise to see reprinted in the Record the next day a substitute amendment at variance with the version to which I had agreed to and at variance with the language that had been circulated to and approved by the Committee.  Specifically, the agreed upon version of the bill would amend section 983(a)(2)(C) of title 18, United States Code, to describe what a claimant in a civil asset forfeiture case must state to assert a claim. The amendment to which I agreed and which the Judiciary Committee ``ordered reported'' requires that a ``claim shall--(i) identify the specific property being claimed; (ii) state the claimant's interest in such property; and (iii) be made under oath, subject to penalty of perjury.''  By contrast, the version of the amendment submitted to the Senate for passage contained the following additional clause in subparagraph (ii): ``state the claimant's interest in such property (and provide customary documentary evidence of such interest if available) and state that the claim is not frivolous''. I did not approve the language inserted in the version considered by the Senate and this language was not approved by the Judiciary Committee.  The inserted language is superfluous at best, since even without it, a claimant must provide evidence of his interest in the property early in the proceeding or face summary dismissal for lack of standing. Moreover, a claim already must be made under oath and penalty of perjury.  At worst, the inserted language is an invitation for mischief in an area where the record has already amply demonstrated overreaching by law enforcement agencies. At the claim stage, most claimants do not have counsel. Many are uneducated and unsophisticated. They may not know what ``customary documentary evidence'' means, and even if they do, they may not know how to get it. It is not so simple for such individuals to obtain a bank statement or a title document, much less to obtain such documents within the 30 days afforded by the Act. They may be deterred from filing a claim simply because they cannot produce documentary evidence--even if no documentary evidence exists.  Take for example an all cash seizure. What constitutes ``customary documentary evidence'' of an interest in cash? An ATM receipt? A bank record? What about money that is received from legitimate sources other than financial institutions. A waiter would be hard pressed to produce documentary evidence of his interest in tip money.  Beyond this, the inserted language gives seizing agencies too much discretion to reject claims because the documentary evidence is incomplete or otherwise unsatisfactory, and prior experience tells us that agencies may exercise their discretion to deny claims arbitrarily.  The requirement that claims be certified as non-frivolous is also problematic. If an uncounseled claimant certifies in good faith that his claim is not frivolous, and a court ultimately determines otherwise, would the claimant be put at risk of a perjury prosecution? Even the threat of such risks puts additional burdens on claimants and may dissuade claimants from filing claims.  In sum, the inserted language has the potential to deter valid claims as well as frivolous claims, and it is unnecessary: Frivolous claims will be dismissed anyway, when the claimant is unable to meet his burden of establishing standing.  For these reasons, I had objected to insertion of this language and approved a substitute amendment that did not contain this problematic insert. Moreover, the version of that substitute amendment ``ordered reported'' by the Judiciary Committee and in the Committee's official files simply does not contain that problematic insert.  We rely every day on each other and on the professionalism of our staffs. Having raised my concern about the change as soon as it was discovered, I am pleased that Chairman Hatch and Senator Sessions have worked with me to pass a correction to the law that strikes the language that was added without agreement.  I hope that the House will move quickly to pass the Paul Coverdell National Forensic Sciences Improvement Act, as amended, before it winds up its work for the year.                           Amendment No. 4345
