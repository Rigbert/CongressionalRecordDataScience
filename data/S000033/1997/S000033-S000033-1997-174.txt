 Speaker, if the gentleman would yield for a moment, I remember during the NAFTA debate, one of the frustrations that we had is that virtually every major newspaper, without exception, every major newspaper in America told us how great the NAFTA agreement would be.  Now I am wondering if anybody here tonight knows if there has been one of those newspapers yet that has apologized to their readers and has said, whoops, we were wrong. Are my colleagues aware of any newspapers that have made that statement?
