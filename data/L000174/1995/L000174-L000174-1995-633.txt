President, today, I am introducing tax legislation designed to stimulate the apply industry in the United States. I am pleased that my friend from Vermont, Senator Jeffords, is joining me as an original cosponsor of this bill.  In recent years, hard apple cider or apple cider with an alcohol level at or below 7 percent has emerged as a popular alternative to beer. Current tax law, however, unfairly taxes hard apple cider at a much higher rate than beer despite the two beverages similar alcohol levels. The bill I am introducing today will correct this inequity.  Present law taxes hard apple cider regardless of its alcohol level as a wine, subject to a tax of $1.07 per wine gallon. My legislation would clarify that hard apple cider containing not more than a 7-percent alcohol level be taxed as beer, subject to a tax of approximately 22.6 cents per gallon. The legislation would continue taxing small domestic producers of hard apple cider at a reduced rate.  I believe this small tax change would allow hard apple cider producers to compete fairly with beermakers. As hard apple cider grows in popularity, applegrowers and processors across the country should prosper because hard apple cider is made from culled apples, the least marketable apples. I have received letters from the Vermont Department of Agriculture, the New Hampshire Department of Agriculture, the Maine Department of Agriculture, and the New York Apple Association in support of this legislation.  Mr. President, I ask for unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 401       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
