It is always a great pleasure for me to be able to point to the men and women of Vermont's own National Guard as an example of everything the National Guard does right. This weekend, a battalion of the Vermont National Guard was honored with the Army's prestigious Valorous Unit Award for their service in Afghanistan. I recognized the achievements of this acclaimed unit last week here in the Senate.  I ask unanimous consent that an article from today's Burlington Free Press commemorating the award ceremony held January 12 in Norwich, Vt., and the amazing service that led to the award be printed the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:            [From the Burlington Free Press, Jan. 13, 2014]Commended for Courage: Guard Unit, Combat Medic Honored for Actions in                               Afghanistan                           (By Sam Hemingway)       Three years after the Vermont Army National Guard concluded      its largest deployment since World War II, 600 members of the      mountain infantry contingent were given a Valorous Unit Award      on Sunday for their service in Afghanistan.       ``You served in a very hostile area,'' Brig. Gen. Brian      Carpenter told the soldiers as they stood in formation during      a ceremony at Shapiro Field House at Norwich University in      Northfield. ``For a unit to be recommended, as you are, takes      tremendous leadership.''       The award, the second highest award a military unit can      receive, honored the combat performance of the 3rd Battalion,      172nd Infantry while it was carrying out its 2010 mission in      Paktya and three other provinces in eastern Afghanistan near      the Pakistani border.       The unit was attached to the active Army's 101st Airborne      Division and stationed at the Herrera and Rahman Kheyl combat      outposts and at the Gardez forward operating outpost. The      unit is largely made up of Vermonters, but includes soldiers      from Maine and New Hampshire.       Also recognized during the ceremony was combat medic Sgt.      Michael Mulcahy, who was awarded the Bronze Star for Valor      for his bravery during a platoon ambush that claimed the      lives of two Guard soldiers, Sgt. Tristan Southworth of      Walden and Sgt. Steven Deluzio of Glastonbury, Conn.       Mulcahy who was assigned to the small Herrera outpost in      Paktya province, braved enemy fire during back-to-back      ambushes near Mullafatee village on Aug. 22, 2010, according      to a narrative detailing his exploits.       Carpenter, reading a portion of the narrative to soldiers      and attendees at the ceremony, described how Mulcahy ``led      the way uphill through accurate heavy volumes of enemy fire''      in order to reach injured soldiers.       At one point, according to the narrative, Mulcahy used his      body to shield a wounded Southworth from heavy enemy fire.       ``Mulcahy moved with very little cover through RPG (rocket-     propelled grenade) and extremely heavy machine gun fire to .      . . Southworth,'' the narrative said.       After determining Southworth had died, Mulcahy again risked      his life to treat another wounded soldier.       Mulcahy, described by a colleague at the ceremony as a      ``very humble guy'' went up to Southworth's parents after the      ceremony. The three exchanged long, tearful embraces.       ``We are proud to know him,'' Julie Southworth, Tristan      Southworth's mother, said of Mulcahy after the ceremony      ended. She said the family had not met Mulcahy previously.      Mulcahy told Guard officials he did not want to be      interviewed.       Carpenter, speaking of the unit award, said the 172nd      Infantry carried out 4,300 combat patrols during the      Afghanistan deployment. Twenty-six members were awarded      Purple Hearts for injuries sustained during combat, he said.       ``Their expertise in bringing decisive combat power to bear      on the enemy wherever and whenever needed set the conditions      for overwhelming victory and represents a phenomenal      effort,'' the unit award narrative said in part.       The unit also served in the only province where no      civilians were harmed or killed during parliamentary      elections in 2010. Paktya's turnout for the elections topped      94,000, a 15 percent increase over its turnout in the      previous election.       The unit also worked on various economic development and      governance projects, and helped train Afghan army, police and      medics.       Attending Sunday's ceremonies were U.S. Sen. Bernie      Sanders, I-Vt., Rep. Peter Welch, D-Vt., Gov. Peter Shumlin      and Lt. Gov. Phil Scott, who had spent the day before as an      honorary Guard member. John Tracy, a veteran and Vermont      office director for Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., represented      Leahy. All but Scott spoke briefly at the ceremony.       ``This is a really emotional day for me,'' said Lt. Col.      Robert Charlesworth, who was based at Gardez and oversaw the      172nd Infantry's operations in Afghanistan. ``To finally see      these guys and gals recognized for the accomplishments that      they had in Afghanistan is very satisfying.''       Charlesworth, who now works at the Pentagon as a staff      planner with the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the gains made      by the infantry unit in Paktya have mostly held up since the      deployment ended.       He said the outposts at Herrera, Rahman Kheyl and Gardez      where the soldiers served have been either dismantled or      substantially altered since the unit left Afghanistan.       Charlesworth said he's hopeful for the future of      Afghanistan as the United States continues to withdraw combat      troops from the country and wind down its operations there.       ``It's a pretty pivotal moment in history right now in      Afghanistan,'' he said. ``We're in the final stages of trying      to put together our bi-lateral security agreement with      Afghanistan to try to solidify all of the gains we helped the      Afghans build over there. I think the next year is going to      be critical.''       During the course of Sunday's ceremony, one of the soldiers      in the unit collapsed as the result of an apparent seizure.      The proceedings were halted briefly while several soldiers      came to his aid. The soldier, who was not identified, was      able to walk under his own power out of the building. Maj.      Chris Gookin, the Guard's spokesman, said later Sunday he did      not believe the soldier had to be hospitalized.       Two other of the 600 soldiers who stood during the hour-     long event also grew faint during the proceedings and were      assisted by their comrades.                          ____________________
