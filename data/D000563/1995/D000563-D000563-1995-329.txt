Speaker, I would like the Chair to clarify the vote that was just taken. It is my understanding that words were taken down, words uttered by the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Hoke] and those words were determined by the Speaker to be out of order. At which point, if I recall correctly, the words were stricken, and the Chair stated a unanimous-consent request that the gentleman be able to proceed.  There was objection to that unanimous-consent request, at which point, if I am not mistaken, the Chair then stated a motion to give the gentleman the opportunity to proceed and speak.  Is my recollection correct, is that the motion which we just voted on?
