Feingold) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions:                            S. Con. Res. 153       Whereas visiting nurse associations are nonprofit home      health agencies that, for over 120 years, have been united in      their mission to provide cost-effective and compassionate      home and community-based health care to individuals,      regardless of the individuals' condition or ability to pay      for services;       Whereas there are approximately 500 visiting nurse      associations, which employ more than 90,000 clinicians,      provide health care to more than 4,000,000 people each year,      and provide a critical safety net in communities by      developing a network of community support services that      enable individuals to live independently at home;       Whereas visiting nurse associations have historically      served as primary public health care providers in their      communities, and are today one of the largest providers of      mass immunizations in the medicare program (delivering over      2,500,000 influenza immunizations annually);       Whereas visiting nurse associations are often the home      health providers of last resort, serving the most chronic of      conditions (such as congestive heart failure, chronic      obstructive pulmonary disease, AIDS, and quadriplegia) and      individuals with the least ability to pay for services (more      than 50 percent of all medicaid home health admissions are by      visiting nurse associations);       Whereas any visiting nurse association budget surplus is      reinvested in supporting the association's mission through      services, including charity care, adult day care centers,      wellness clinics, Meals-on-Wheels, and immunization programs;       Whereas visiting nurse associations and other nonprofit      home health agencies care for the highest percentage of      terminally ill and bedridden patients;       Whereas thousands of visiting nurse association volunteers      across the Nation devote time serving as individual agency      board members, raising funds, visiting patients in their      homes, assisting in wellness clinics, and delivering meals to      patients; and       Whereas the establishment of an annual National Visiting      Nurse Associations Week for the second full week of every      February would increase public awareness of the charity-based      missions of visiting nurse associations and of their ability      to meet the needs of chronically ill and disabled individuals      who prefer to live at home rather than in a nursing home, and      would spotlight preventive health clinics, adult day care      programs, and other customized wellness programs that meet      local community need: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives      concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that there      should be established an annual National Visiting Nurse      Associations Week.
