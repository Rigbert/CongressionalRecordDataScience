Speaker, this evening, as our Marines are on the ground in Afghanistan, I would like to posit that the United States is engaged in more than a war. Indeed, we are engaged in the middle of a revolution.  Today, Thomas Friedman, New York Times News Service, wrote an editorial entitled ``Shedding the Veil of bin Laden,'' which I will submit for the Record, and I will only read a small part of it. Mr. Friedman is traveling in that part of the world, in the United Arab Emirates, and he says: ``Over coffee the other day here in the gulf, an Arab friend confided to me something that was deeply troubling to him. He said, My 11-year-old son thinks bin Laden is a good man. For Americans, Osama bin Laden is a mass murderer. But for many young Arabs, bin Laden, even in defeat, is still Robin Hood. What attracts them to him is his sheer defiance of everything young Arabs and Muslims detest,'' Friedman goes on, ``their hypocritical rulers, Israel, U.S. dominance, and their own backwardness.''  He then goes on to quote Steven Cohen, the Middle East analyst, who says, ``We in America can't just go on looking at the Arab world as a giant gas station, indifferent to what happens inside. Because the gas is now leaking and all around people are throwing matches. Every day,'' he says, ``I see signs that this war of ideas is possible.''  And, indeed, we are involved in a war of ideas. I would like to commend again the book ``Sacred Rage'' by Robin Wright, as a very important contribution to our own understanding of the revolution in which we are engaged. In 1986, when this book was first published, and is now being updated, the author, Robin Wright, quotes Sajib Salom, the former Lebanese Prime Minister, who said, ``The growth of Islamic fundamentalism is an earthquake.''  She recounts from her own personal experience living in the Middle East the turning point of this revolution, centering it in Iran. Of course, the government that the United States of America had supported collapsed in Iran in 1979, the Shah of Iran deposed, something that the United States had not anticipated. And, in fact, his government at that time, serving as policeman for the entire gulf region. Well, shortly thereafter, in March of 1982, there was a huge conference in Tehran, where some 380 men with various religious and revolutionary credentials met at the former Hilton conference ballroom. Their goal was to help to create the ideal Islamic government.  As the government of Iran switched from a monarchy to a theocracy, they had many declarations that came out of that seminar, and she recounts this going back to the mid 1980s. The conclusions of the seminar in some ways were vaguely worded and riddled with rhetoric, but revolutions are that way, and Islamic militants, mainly Shi'a but including some Sunnis, and more recently even more of them, would launch a large-scale offensive to cleanse the Islamic world of the Satanic Western and Eastern influencesthat they viewed as hindering their progress, and they agreed to the following back in the early 1980s:  First, that religion should not be separated from politics; secondly, that the only way to achieve true independence, true independence, was to return to Islamic roots; third, there should be no reliance on superpowers or other outsiders, and the region should get rid of them; and, fourth, they recommended that the Shi'a should be more active in getting rid of foreign powers.  Dr. Marvin Zonis, at that time the director of the Middle East Institute at the University of Chicago, had a stunning comment about the Psychological Roots of Shiite Muslim Terrorism in a Washington seminar, in which he stated this message from Iran: No matter how bizarre or trivial it may sound on first, second, fourth or 39th hearing, is, in my opinion, the single most impressive political ideology which has been proposed in the 20th century since the Bolshevik Revolution. If we accepted Bolshevism as a remnant of the 19th century, then, he argues, that we have had only one good one in the 20th century, and I would put the word good in quotes, and it is this one: Islamic fundamentalism. This powerful message will be with us for a very long time, no matter what happens to Ayatollah Khomeini.  As I end this evening, I would just commend this book ``Sacred Rage,'' and say I will continue with briefings on this as the days proceed, and I submit herewith, Mr. Speaker, the newspaper article I referred to above:              [From the Toledo (OH) Blade, Nov. 26, 2001]                     Shedding the Veil of bin Laden                        (By Thomas L. Friedman)       Dubai, United Arab Emirates.--Over coffee the other day      here in the gulf, an Arab friend--a sweet, thoughtful,      liberal person--confided to me something that was deeply      troubling him: ``My 11-year old son thinks bin Laden is a      good man.''       For Americans, Osama bin Laden is a mass murderer. But for      many young Arabs, bin Laden even in defeat, is still Robin      Hood. What attracts them to him is not his vision of the      ideal Muslim society, which few would want to live in. No,      what attracts them to him is his sheer defiance of everything      young Arabs and Muslims detest--their hypocritical rulers,      Israel, U.S. dominance, and their own economic backwardness.      He is still the finger in the eye of the world that so many      frustrated, powerless people out here would love to poke.       The reason it is important to eliminate bin Laden--besides      justice--is the same reason it was critical to eliminate the      Taliban: As long as we're chasing him around, there will      never be an honest debate among Muslims and Arabs about the      future of their societies.       Think of all the nonsense written in the press--     particularly the European and Arab media--about the concern      for ``civilian casualities,'' in Afghanistan. It turns out      many of those Afghan ``civilians'' were praying for another      dose of B-52s to liberate them from the Taliban, casualties      or not. Now that the Taliban are gone, Afghans can freely      fight out, among themselves, the war of ideas for what sort      of society they want.       My hope is that once bin Laden is eliminated, Arabs and      Muslims will want to do the same. That is, instead of      expressing rage with their repressive, corrupt rulers, or      with U.S. policy, by rooting for bin Laden, they will start      to raise their own voices. It's only when the Arab-Muslim      world sheds the veil of bin Laden, as Afghans shed the      Taliban, and faces the fact that Sept. 11 was primarily about      anger and problems with their societies, not ours, will we      eradicate not just the hardware of terrorism, but its      software.       ``We in the West can't have that debate for them, but we      can help create the conditions for it to happen,'' remarked      the Middle East analyst Stephen P. Cohen. ``America's role is      to show the way to incremental change--something that is not,      presto, instant democracy or fantasies that enlightened      despotism will serve our interest. We can't just go on      looking at the Arab world as a giant gas station, indifferent      to what happens inside. Because the gas is now leaking and      all around people are throwing matches.''       Every day I see signs that this war of ideas is possible:      It's the Arab journalist who says to me angrily of the Arab      world today, ``We can't even make an aspirin for our own      headache,'' or it's Ahmad al-Baghdadi, the Kuwaiti professor,      who just published a remarkable essay in Kuwait's Al Anbaa      and Egypt's Akhbar Al Youm titled ``Sharon Is a Terrorist--     and You?''       [Ariel] Sharon was a terrorist from the very first moment      of the . . . Zionist entity,'' wrote Baghdadi. But what about      Arab-Muslim rulers? ``Persecuting intellectuals in the      courtrooms [of Arab countries], trials [of intellectuals] for      heresy . . . all exist only in the Islamic world. Is this not      terrorism? . . . Iraq alone is a never-ending story of      terrorism of the state against its own citizens and      neighbors. Isn't this terrorism? . . . The Palestinian Arabs      were the first to invent airplane hijacking and the scaring      of passengers. Isn't this terrorism?       ``Arab Muslims have no rivals in this; they are the masters      of terrorism toward their citizens, and sometimes their      terrorism also reaches the innocent people of the world, with      the support of some of the clerics . . .       ``[Ours] is a nation whose ignorance makes the nations of      the world laugh! The Islamic world and the Arab world are the      only [places] in which intellectuals--whose only crime was to      write--rot in prison. The Arab and Muslims claim that their      religion is a religion of tolerance, but they show no      tolerance for those who oppose their opinions.       ``. . . Now the time has come to pay the price . . . and      the account is long--longer than all the beards of the      Taliban gang together. The West's message to the Arab and      Muslim world is clear: mend your ways or else'' (translation      by MEMRI).       We must fight the ground war to get bin Laden and his      hardware. But Arab and Muslims must fight the war of ideas to      uproot his software. The sooner we help them get on to that      war, the better.       Ask the folks in Kabul.                          ____________________
