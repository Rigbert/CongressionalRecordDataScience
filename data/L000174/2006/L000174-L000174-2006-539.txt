President, I don't think this is in keeping with what I understand the distinguished Republican leader and the distinguished Democratic leader had discussed as a procedure, nor discussed by the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. So I will, for the moment, object until such time as we can figure out what is it they want. I came in late on the earlier agreement, but I want to make sure the Senator from Texas is following what the two leaders had proposed. So I will object.
