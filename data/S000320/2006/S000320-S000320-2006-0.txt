 President, today I honor LTG John R. Vines, the commanding general of the XVIII Airborne Corps and Fort Bragg.  General Vines, an outstanding American soldier from Alabama, will soon retire after more than 35 years of selfless service to this great Nation in the U.S. Army. General Vines' dedication to our soldiers, commitment to excellence, and performance of duty has been extraordinary throughout his career. General Vines' lifetime of service culminated in an assignment as the commanding general of the XVIII Airborne Corps and Fort Bragg, which he has held since 2003.  During his time in uniform, General Vines served in a succession of command and staff positions worldwide. The embodiment of an Army Ranger, General Vines has served all over the world, commanding paratroopers in combat during three separate conflicts. As a battalion commander in the 82nd Airborne Division, General Vines led a combat parachute assault in Operation Just Cause in Panama in 1989 and then led the same soldiers in Operation Desert Shield as the first ground combat unit in the gulf.  Soon after the United States went to war in 2001, General Vines, as commanding general of the 82nd Airborne Division, led his forces into Afghanistan as head of Coalition Task Force 82 and then assumed control of Combined/Joint Task Force 180 in Bagram. From January 2005 until January 2006, General Vines served as the joint forces commander of Multi-National Corps Iraq in Operation Iraqi Freedom, becoming the first general officer to command forces in both Iraq and Afghanistan.  LTG John Vines holds a B.S. degree in chemistry from the University of Alabama and an M.A. degree in National Security and Strategy from the Naval War College. His numerous awards and accolades include the Defense Distinguished Service Medal; Distinguished Service Medal; Defense Superior Service Medal, with Oak Leaf Cluster; Bronze Star Medal, with Oak Leaf Cluster; Legion of Merit, with Oak Leaf Cluster; Combat Infantryman Badge; Master Parachutist Badge, with Combat Star and the Ranger Tab.  During his distinguished Army career, General Vines earned a reputation as one of the Department of Defense's most forward-thinking and insightful leaders. Remembered by those who served under his command as both an extraordinary man and leader, General Vines wrote personal condolence letters to the families of each one of his soldiers killed in combat. General John Vines represents the epitome of what Army leaders, soldiers, and the country expect from our military officers. He is a sterling roll model for young soldiers. Well known as the ``Soldiers' General,'' his commitment to the troops he led was unparalleled, even being quoted as saying that success in combat is not about military hardware or technology. ``It boils down to the individual soldiers. It's about having people who have the commitment, the courage, the will, and the warrior values to confront the forces that threaten us. And only so long as we have those men and women who are able and willing to confront this will we be safe.''  His service to the Nation has been exceptional, and General Vines is more than deserving of this recognition. His sacrifices are appreciated and important to the freedom we enjoy every day. I hope my colleagues will join me in thanking LTG John Vines for his commendable service to our Nation and the U.S. Army. I thank his wife Pamela and his sons, Joshua and Jacob, for their steadfast support while he fulfilled this essential duty to our country. I personally wish the Vines' family all the best as they celebrate General Vines' richly deserved retirement.                           ____________________[Page S11188]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]              HONORING LIEUTENANT GENENERAL JOHN R.
