 I see no other Senators on the Democratic side, so I yield back our time.  Madam President, if I may, I wish to take a moment to thank the staff for their work. On the Democratic side: Peter Kiefhaber, Virginia James, Scott Dalzell, Rachael Taylor, and Chris Watkins. On the minority staff: Leif Fonnesbeck, Rebecca Benn, and Rachelle Schroeder. Everybody worked together. It was a very special effort and I thank them very much.
