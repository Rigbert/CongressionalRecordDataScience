Chairman, the gentleman obviously knows, being a member of the subcommittee, that the money for this is coming from an offset in another account, and in fact, there is no committee that has taken more cuts than the Committee on Agriculture. The gentleman from the State of Arkansas knows that. So the gentleman obviously knows that this is not new money. This is money that is being shifted from other programs, because we all have a commitment to reduce the deficit.
