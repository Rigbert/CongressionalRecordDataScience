 President, I did not mean to misrepresent. I have great respect for the Senator. I know he was Secretary of the Navy. He also is more informed in a personal sense about this--not, I am reluctant to say, not the issue; I think I am as informed as he is, or quite frankly, as anybody on the floor--but in terms of all that goes into a young man's or woman's head as they are about to take off the deck of that carrier or off that piece of concrete, or whatever the mission.  But let me suggest that I will lay out for you why I personally am willing to do something that I am not happy about doing; and that is, vote to support asking the brave young women and men of our military, in this case the fliers--Navy, Marine, Air Force--to risk their lives. And it is a real risk. There is a probability someone is going to get hurt.
