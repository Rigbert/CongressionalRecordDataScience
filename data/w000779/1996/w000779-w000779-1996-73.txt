I very much appreciate your comments.  I say to Senator Kerrey, I know of your interest in this health care issue and the fact that it has been longstanding. Let us say that for purposes of working on this in a bipartisan way, I will not request that the vote be taken right now and look forward to voting a little bit later today on this when the staffs have had a chance to work with it further.
