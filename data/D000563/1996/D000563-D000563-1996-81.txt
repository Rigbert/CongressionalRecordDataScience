Chairman, I thank the gentleman from New York [Mr. Walsh]. I appreciate his concern about the funding of section 515, new construction.  The 515 program has a worthy objective. It is a goal which all of us share in providing multifamily housing in rural areas.  Several years ago, when this subcommittee investigated this program, we found that some developers were ripping off the Federal Government. We proposed to the Committee on Banking and Financial Services some significant reforms in this program. The Committee on Banking and Financial Services passed housing authorization bills which adopted most of what we proposed on a bipartisan basis. Then a new Congress came in. The same thing occurred under the new Congress. The Republican-controlled Banking Subcommittee on Housing, which I believe the gentleman from New York [Mr. Lazio] chairs, passed reform legislation along the lines we have suggested. Again, as in the previous Congress, the bill died in the Senate.  This subcommittee is very frustrated. We want to fund this program. We do not want to waste taxpayers' dollars. If we can pass the reforms suggested in both bills, this program will be funded as it should be. The gentleman from New York is right. We need to meet our obligation here, but to do it in a way that we can do it with a straight face and say we are doing the right thing by taxpayers.  I am pleased that the gentleman intends to speak to the chairman of the Senate Committee on Banking. The opportunity to put this program on track is in their hands, and I would like to see the Senate act on those reforms.
