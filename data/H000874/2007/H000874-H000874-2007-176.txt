Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 643) recognizing September 11 as a day of remembrance, extending sympathies to those who lost their lives on September 11, 2001, and their families, honoring the heroic actions of our Nation's first responders and Armed Forces, and reaffirming the commitment to defending the people of the United States against any and all future challenges.  The Clerk read the title of the resolution.  The text of the resolution is as follows:                              H. Res. 643       Whereas on the morning of September 11, 2001, terrorists      hijacked four civilian aircraft, crashing two of them into      the towers of the World Trade Center in New York City and a      third into the Pentagon outside Washington, D.C.;       Whereas the heroic actions of the passengers and crew      aboard United Flight 93, which ultimately led to the aircraft      crashing into a rural field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania,      prevented the plane from being used as a weapon against      America;       Whereas nearly 3,000 innocent men, women, and children were      murdered in these attacks;       Whereas their tragic loss will never be forgotten by the      people of the United States of America;       Whereas by targeting symbols of American strength and      prosperity, the attacks were intended to assail the      principles, values, and freedoms of the American people, to      intimidate the Nation and its allies, and to weaken the      national resolve;       Whereas the United States remains steadfast in its      determination to defeat, disrupt, and dismantle terrorist      organizations and seeks to harness all elements of national      power, including its military, economic, and diplomatic      might, to do so;       Whereas Congress passed, and the President signed, numerous      laws to assist victims, combat terrorism, protect the      Homeland, and support the members of the Armed Forces who      defend American interests at home and abroad;       Whereas terrorist attacks that have occurred since      September 11, 2001, in Egypt, India, Indonesia, Jordan,      Spain, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and elsewhere, remind all      people of the brutal intentions of the terrorists and the      ever-present threat they pose to the principles of freedom,      justice, and the rule of law;       Whereas the United States has worked cooperatively with the      nations of the free world to confront, disrupt, and punish      terrorists at home and abroad, and remains committed to      building strong and effective counterterrorism alliances;       Whereas immediately following September 11, the United      States Armed Forces moved swiftly against al-Qaeda and the      Taliban regime, which the President and Congress had      identified as enemies of America;       Whereas in doing so, brave servicemen and women left family      and friends in order to defend the Nation; and       Whereas six years later, many servicemen and women remain      abroad, defending the Nation from further terrorist attacks;      Now, therefore, be it       Resolved,  That the House of Representatives--       (1) recognizes September 11 as both a day to remember those      taken from their families, loved ones, and fellow citizens      and a day for Americans to recommit to the Nation and to each      other;       (2) extends its deepest sympathies to the countless      innocent victims of the September 11, 2001, terrorist      attacks, their families, friends, and loved ones;       (3) honors the heroic service, actions and sacrifices of      first responders, law enforcement personnel, State and local      officials, volunteers, and others who aided the innocent      victims and, in so doing, bravely risked their own lives and      health;       (4) expresses thanks and gratitude to the foreign leaders      and citizens of all nations who have assisted and continue to      stand in solidarity with the United States against terrorism      in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist      attacks;       (5) rejects, in the strongest possible terms, any effort to      confuse the war on terrorism with a war on any people or any      faith;       (6) honors the heroic service, actions and the sacrifices      of United States personnel, including members of the United      States Armed Forces, United States intelligence agencies, and      the United States diplomatic service, and their families who      have sacrificed much, including their lives and health, in      defense of their country against terrorists and their      supporters;       (7) remains resolved in its commitment to defeating      terrorists and their supporters who threaten the United      States and to providing the United States Armed Forces,      United States intelligence agencies, and the United States      diplomatic service with the resources and support to do so      effectively and safely; and       (8) reaffirms that House of Representatives honors the      memory of those who lost their lives as a result of the      September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and reaffirms its      commitment to defend the people of the United States in the      face of any and all future challenges.
