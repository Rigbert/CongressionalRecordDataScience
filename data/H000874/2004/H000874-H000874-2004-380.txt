Speaker, I wish to address the House for the purposes of inquiring of the acting majority leader the schedule for the coming week; and I would be glad to yield to my good friend, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Portman), who chairs the leadership committee, or I am not sure of his exact title, but he is my friend and an able Member of this body, and I am glad to yield to him.
