President, I rise today to express my strong support for H.R. 4489, the ``Immigration and Naturalization Service Data Management Improvement Act of 2000.'' Passage of this legislation will repeal Section 110 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 and prevent it from ever being implemented.  Section 110 of the 1996 Immigration law was intended to track individuals who overstay their legally permissible visit in the U.S. However, to accomplish that well-intentioned goal, this law required all foreign travelers or U.S. permanent residents to be individually recorded at ports of entry. In practical effect, the provisions would bring traffic to a halt on the Canadian border for miles.  Those of us who represent states along the Canadian border are well-aware of the close bonds between the U.S. and Canada. The U.S.-Canadian border is the longest continuous open border in the free world and Canadians come into our country freely and easily under current U.S. policy. In Maine, our ties with Canada are particularly deep because many Mainers' extended families live across the border in Canada. Our current border-crossing policy allows these family members to quickly and easily cross the border every day in order to be with a husband, wife, a brother, a sister, cousin or even in-laws as the case may be.  Canada is not only our friend and ally, but our largest trading partner--it is important to maintain and foster our relationship with our neighbor to the North by promoting U.S.-Canadian friendship and trade. The ill-thought out provisions passed as part of the 1996 immigration law would grossly delayall those crossing the Northern border from Canada, and injure the Northern economy as critical trade and travel routes are slowed. In my State of Maine, this new border policy would have the most immediate impact on border communities such as Calais, Houlton, Madawaska, Fort Kent, and Jackman. Businesses in these communities rely on Canadians to cross the border each and every day in order to buy their goods and services. In addition, the impact on critical Maine trade, including lumber and tourism, would extend beyond these communities and reverberate across my State.  The bill we consider today, H.R. 4489, the Immigration and Naturalization Service Data Management Improvement Act of 2000, repeals Section 110 of the Immigration law. In its place, the bill directs the Immigration and Naturalization Service to amass data already collected at entrance and departure points in an electronically searchable manner. The legislation explicitly states no new documentary requirements or data collection can be directed as a result of the passage of this bill, ensuring that INS new database will rely on already available data.  Those of us who represent the northern regions of our country have been working for over four years now to repeal Section 110. With the support of Senate colleagues, the deadline for implementation of the entry/exit control system for land and sea points of entry has been postponed until March 31, 2001. But until now, we have been unable to break the impasse that left Section 110 in place. I salute all the efforts which have yielded this ground breaking agreement today, particularly the hard work of Senator Abraham who has worked tirelessly on this issue. I look forward to passage of H.R. 4489, and a final end to the threat to the economy posed by Section 110 of the 1996 Immigration law.  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.                          ____________________
