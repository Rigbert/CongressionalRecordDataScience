Mr. Speaker, the House passage of H.R. 592 by the large margin of 354-72 is a substantial statement of support for the houses of worship that have done so much for those suffering in the wake of natural disasters like Superstorm Sandy. It is also a strong affirmation of the constitutionality of the bill.                          ____________________
