President, Senator DeWine and I are offering an amendment to reduce some of the burdensome reporting requirements placed on educational institutions by the Hope Scholarship and Lifetime Learning Tax Credits.  These education tax incentives, which Congress created last year, are of great benefit to students and their families. Unfortunately, our attempt to expand educational opportunities has had the unintended effect of imposing a burdensome and costly reporting requirement on our post-secondary schools.  Beginning with tax year 1998, every college, university, and proprietary school will have to provide the IRS with an array of information that will do little, if anything, to assist in tax collection. Not only will these schools have to report Social Security numbers and the amount of qualified tuition and aid for each student, the schools will also have to report to the IRS on the students' attendance status and program level.  But that is not all, and the reporting requirements do not stop there, Mr.President. The schools will also be required to report either a taxpayer ID number or Social Security number for the person who will claim the tax credit--generally a parent or a guardian--for all students who do not claim the tax credit themselves.  This administrative nightmare translates into real money.  The American Council on Education has estimated that this reporting requirement will cost our colleges and universities $115 million in 1998 and $136 million in 1999.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the American Council on Education relating to the results of its cost survey be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                American Council on Education,                                   Washington, DC, April 22, 1998.     Hon. Susan M. Collins,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: Thank you for your leadership in      addressing the reporting requirements imposed on colleges and      universities by the education tax provisions established by      the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997.       The benefits of the Hope and Lifetime Learning tax credits      to individual taxpayers and to the nation's human capital      will be enormous. However, the costs imposed on colleges and      universities to collect and report data to the federal      government on the estimated 25 million individuals who are      eligible for the credits will be exorbitant.       As you may recall, the higher education community formed a      task force comprised of campus officials and staff from nine      associations to analyze and document the full extent of the      burden these regulations pose. Chaired by James E. Morley      Jr., president of the National Association of College and      University Business Officers (NACUBO), this task force asked      institutions to prepare cost estimates for compliance with      the reporting requirements based on a standard template      prepared by NACUBO.       Our initial estimates indicate that the aggregate costs to      colleges and universities of complying with the Taxpayer      Relief Act reporting requirements will be approximately $115      million for tax year 1998 and $136 million for tax year 1999.      The average cost of compliance increases in tax year 1999      because of an increase in the number of students benefiting      from the tax credits.       When broken down on a per student basis, these costs      translate into $3.41 per student record for 1998, and $2.90      per student record for 1999. These costs account for      resources required to obtain student data, file information      returns, integrate student data, respond to questions, and      for 1999, to obtain, process, and maintain information on      individuals certified by students as taxpayers who will claim      a tax credit.       The per student average camouflages the tremendous      variation in compliance costs among the nation's 6,000      institutions of higher education. The per student cost is      estimated to be as low as $1.40 at one research university      and as high as $21.00 at another institution. These      variations are attributable to the number of students      enrolled and the sophistication of campus information      systems. The California Community College system, for      example, which is comprised of 107 colleges and services over      2.4 million students, estimates it will cost $20 million just      to develop a system to comply with the reporting      requirements. Ongoing costs of complying with the      requirements are estimated to be $12.6 million per year.       We will continue to gather information to refine these      estimates in the weeks ahead. Nonetheless, the preliminary      figures highlight the challenges colleges and universities      are confronting as they develop systems to comply with      reporting rewquiremetns introduced by the Taxpayer Relief Act      of 1997.       Thank you again for your leadership and commitment to      reducing this burden. We look forward to continuing to work      closely with you to address this issue.           Sincerely,                                                  Terry W. Hartle,                                           Senioir Vice President.
