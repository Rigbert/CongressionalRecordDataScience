President, I want to take a few minutes to honor the 65th anniversary of the Korean War Armistice Agreement, which brought the active hostilities of the Korean war to an end.  Americans don't talk much about the Korean war today. As a result, too many have forgotten or never knew the history, how Kim Il-sung's forces invaded South Korea in June 1950; how the United Nations Security Council condemned the invasion; how American troops made an amphibious landing at Inchon, driving the North Korean forces back and helping shift the war's momentum; how 3 years later, representatives met in Panmunjom where they established a demilitarized zone and ended active hostilities.  Because this history is so often overlooked, American men and women who served in Korea have so rarely been given the recognition they deserve.  These are Americans who answered the call to take up arms again in a foreign country so soon after World War II, Americans who endured the bitter cold and harsh weather up and down the Peninsula and the lack of adequate food, Americans who gave their lives by the thousands on Korea's far-flung shores in service to their country. All told, more than 36,000 Americans perished in the Korean war, including more than 270 Oregonians and at least seven from Umatilla County, OR.  The Korean war is often called the Forgotten War.  Well, it isn't forgotten by me. It isn't forgotten by the U.S. Senate. I am proud to say that it isn't forgotten by the Oregonians I speak with as I travel around our State.  I have never met a Korean war veteran--or a veteran of any conflict--who walked onto the battlefield seeking personal recognition.  Today I am proud to recognize these brave servicemembers nonetheless.  This year marks the 65th year since the signing of the Korean War Armistice and the end of active hostilities.  As we follow new developments on the Korean Peninsula--and there have been many these past few months--let us reflect on the Americans who fought so bravely and endured so much in service to these United States.  I have always believed that the Federal Government owes these men and women a debt it cannot fully repay. The closest I think we can come is to honor our commitments to them and to do right by their brothers and sisters who continue to wear the uniform.  As we look forward to Veterans Day, let us all take a moment to thank those Korean war veterans still with us and to ensure that their service and their sacrifices are never forgotten.                          ____________________
