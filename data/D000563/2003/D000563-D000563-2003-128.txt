Really, I didn't think about it until August. I heard from two different grocery chains--one based in Chicago and one in St. Louis--about this legislation, and it goes as follows: If you establish a burden on a grocery store or a chain to follow these regulations, it necessarily involves manpower. People will have to keep records and label products, and all of that is part of it.  How much? As the Senator said, and I agree, I cannot quantify it. I don't know how much that is. The point made to me is that the Wal-Marts of the world, which pay rock-bottom wages, with no health benefits, will be able to come up with the manpower at a much lower cost than some of the major grocery store chains, some of which are union-organized, that pay a living wage and health benefits. They say to us, you are once again giving a competitive advantage to the Wal-Marts of the world that pay these low wages, with no benefits, to the disadvantage of grocery store companies who are trying to be good neighbors and good corporate citizens and provide decent wages and benefits.  Has the Senator heard this observation?
