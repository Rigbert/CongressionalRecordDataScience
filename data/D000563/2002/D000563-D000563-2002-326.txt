It is my understanding that the current BLM policy requires the agency to consider activities on lands proposed for special designations, such as Areas of Critical Environmental Concern and Wilderness Study Areas, and, subject to valid existing rights, to avoid approval of proposed actions that could degrade the values of potential special designations. Does the Chairman agree that section 602 does not affect this policy?
