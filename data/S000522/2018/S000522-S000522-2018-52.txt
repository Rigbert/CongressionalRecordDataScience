Mr. Speaker, I just remind everyone this is a total team effort. One of the beauties of the pro-life movement--and I have been in it for 45 years--is that it is filled with incredibly compassionate, selfless people who would do anything to help the weakest and the most vulnerable. So I thank the gentleman for his leadership for all these years.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. Jenkins), who is the famous gentleman who serves on the Appropriations Committee where so many of these battles are engaged.
