 President, I wonder if I might be able to make a few comments.  This amendment is a compromise amendment. I think it is actually a very good amendment. I want to thank the chairman of the committee, the ranking member, and Senator Graham, who participated in a rather lengthy discussion, and this is the result.  The amendment--I will read it. It says:       Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect      existing law or authority relating to the detention of United      States citizens or lawful resident aliens of the United      States or any other persons who are captured or arrested in      the United States.  There is a commitment from both the chairman and the ranking member and Senator Graham that they will defend this amendment in conference. So I hope everyone will vote for it because essentially it just supports present law, whether one supports the broad interpretation of present law, or one supports a more narrow interpretation of present law. There is no change in law.
