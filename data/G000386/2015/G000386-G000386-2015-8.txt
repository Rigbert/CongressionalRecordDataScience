  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  POGO--Project on                                         Government Oversight,                                                December 14, 2015.     Hon. Chuck Grassley,     Hart Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Claire McCaskill,     Hart Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Grassley and Senator McCaskill: The Project On      Government Oversight (POGO) is a nonpartisan independent      watchdog that champions good government reforms. POGO's      investigations into corruption, misconduct, and conflicts of      interest achieve a more effective, accountable, open, and      ethical federal government. Recognizing the vital role that      Inspectors General (IG) play, POGO has investigated and      worked to improve the IG system since 2006. This work      includes multiple reports on the IG system, maintaining an IG      vacancy tracker, and working with Congress to incorporate      needed reforms in the Inspector General Act of 2008. In light      of this work, we are writing to thank you for introducing the      Inspector General Empowerment Act of 2015, and to urge      Congress to quickly pass this important legislation.       Inspectors General can make all the difference when it      comes to creating a better government, but Congress needs to      ensure that IGs have access to all the information they need      to do their job effectively. Federal agencies have begun to      unreasonably challenge IGs' statutory right to access agency      data in attempts to prevent embarrassing events from coming      to light. It is essential that Congress act quickly to pass      the Inspector General Empowerment Act of 2015 to prevent the      overbroad interpretation of restrictions on IG authority from      becoming accepted law, allowing current and future waste,      fraud, and abuse to remain hidden.       In order to serve as the eyes and ears of Congress, an IG      office must have an unrestricted view of the agency it      oversees. This principle is enshrined in Section 6(a)(1) of      the Inspector General Act, which states that each IG office      shall have ``access to all records, reports, audits, reviews,      documents, papers, recommendations, or other material . . .      which relate to programs and operations with respect to which      that Inspector General has responsibilities under this Act.''      It seems crystal clear that ``all'' means all, but some      agencies have fought back against that idea.       The most blatant rejection of ``all means all'' can be      found in the July 2015 opinion by the Department of Justice's      (DOJ) Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) that improperly limits IG      access and caters to agency resistance to necessary      oversight. If left unchallenged, this opinion will allow      agencies' incorrect interpretation of Section 6(a)(1) to      become de facto law. The OLC's opinion states that the      unfettered access afforded by Section     6(a) of the Inspector General Act is superseded by specific      restrictions on the dissemination of Title III, grand jury,      and FCRA information. The OLC concluded, for instance, that      the IG office may not be entitled to obtain these records      when conducting financial audits and other administrative and      civil reviews that are only tangentially related to DOJ's      criminal and law enforcement activities. POGO disagrees with      this interpretation because it rests upon a clear misreading      of the common language Congress made clear in the law.       Congressional leaders on both sides of the aisle have      rightly condemned the OLC's opinion, according to which ``all      records'' does not mean ``all records.'' POGO believes this      OLC opinion makes a mockery of the entire IG system: these      offices cannot possibly be effective watchdogs on behalf of      Congress and the American public if agencies restrict IG      access and force them to negotiate with agency leaders for      access on a case-by-case basis. Agency records provide the      raw materials IG offices need to fulfill their statutory      responsibilities. The very purpose of having an independent      IG is undermined if the office has to seek the agency's      permission in order to carry out its mission. Unless Congress      acts quickly, this OLC opinion will gut the IG system and      prevent meaningful oversight.       While many federal agencies handle records that are highly      sensitive and legitimately withheld from public      dissemination, that does not mean they should be withheld      from IG offices, or by extension from Congress, both of which      offer independent oversight and recommendations to improve      agency operations. Secret agency programs are particularly      susceptible to waste, fraud, and abuse, but IG offices cannot      uncover or correct these problems without access to agency      records. Agency actions that deny access to those records      violate our system of checks and balances, and do so unduly,      as IGs have proven they can responsibly handle sensitive      information.       For example, the DOJ Office of the Inspector General (OIG)      has shown that it can effectively and responsibly oversee the      most sensitive DOJ operations without jeopardizing law      enforcement actions. It has reviewed grand jury materials and      other sensitive records when it examined the FBI's potential      targeting of domestic advocacy groups, the FBI's efforts to      access records of reporters' toll calls during a media leak      probe, the President's Surveillance Program, and the firing      of U.S. Attorneys, among other important and high-profile      cases.       Congress needs to clarify that IG offices must be granted      access to all agency records notwithstanding any other      existing or future law or any other prohibition on      disclosure, including but not limited to: 1) the federal      rules of criminal procedure; 2) Title III; 3) the FCRA; and      4) laws such as the Kate Puzey Act that restrict the      dissemination of personally identifiable information. In      addition, Congress should specify that agencies do not waive      the attorney-client or other common law privileges when      records are turned over to IG offices. The Inspector General      Empowerment Act of 2015 addresses this issue and corrects the      troublesome OLC memo. However, until Congress passes the      bill, that memo can be and has been used to block oversight.       The bill also addresses other improper challenges to IG      access. Under the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection      Act (CMPPA), IGs must get approval from agency leaders in      order to match the computer records of one federal agency      against other federal and non-federal records. The Inspector      General Empowerment Act of 2015 would exempt IG offices from      the CMPPA so they can access records at other agencies      without getting approval from the very officials they are      supposed to oversee. Additionally, under current law, IGs can      only compel testimony from federal employees. This means that      former federal employees, contractors, or grant recipients      can refuse to testify before an IG in the course of an      investigation. This bill would provide IGs with testimonial      subpoena power over these individuals, and allow for fuller      and more effective oversight of federal programs and      agencies.       In the light of the erroneous July OLC opinion, it is      urgent that Congress act now to make sure IGs have the      ability to function as intended. Not correcting this      precedent now will cripple current and future IGs and in turn      limit Congress's and the public's ability to oversee the      executive branch and hold it accountable.           Sincerely,                                                   Danielle Brian,                                               Executive Director.
