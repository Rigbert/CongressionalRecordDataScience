 President, I have spoken in the Senate before about how the rising cost of a college education is putting a higher education--the American dream--out of reach for many middle-class American families.  When I went to college, middle-class families could pay for the public college tuition and fees of their children for less than 5 percent of their income. It stayed that way until 1980. Since then, however, college costs have skyrocketed and middle-class incomes have stagnated. The result is that today it takes almost 9 percent of the average family's income to send one--just one--child to a public college. And, if you go to a private college or university, tuition and fees will eat up 35 percent of your income.  Who can afford that? Not many middle-class families that I know. Many young people today must choose between going heavily into debt or not going to college at all. And, as the debt burden gets heavier and heavier, more and more middle-class kids will not even have that choice. They simply will not be able to go to college.  And, this is happening at a time when we as a Nation can least afford it.  Educating our work force is one of the best investments we as a society can make, and it is one of the best measurements of future economic well-being. According to one study, a more educated population has been responsible for nearly one-third of America's economic growth since the Great Depression. As we prepare to enter the 21st century and as the world economy is increasingly internationally competitive, we must ensure that no American is denied a higher education solely because of the cost.  In fact, this has been a goal of the Federal Government for over a century. From the establishment of the land-grant university system in the late 1800's to the GI bill at the end of World War II to the creation of the Pell Grant and Guaranteed Student Loan Programs in the 1960's, the Federal Government has been committed to seeing a college education within reach of every American. It is time to renew that commitment.  So, today, Mr. President, I am introducing comprehensive legislation to make college more affordable for American families, so that middle-class parents can afford to send their kids to college and middle-class kids can afford to go.  My bill, titled ``Growing the Economy for Tomorrow: Assuring Higher Education is Affordable and Dependable''--Get Ahead, for short--combines numerous proposals to give tax cuts for the cost of college, to encourage families to save for a college education, and to award college scholarships to high school students in the top of their class academically.  For the sake of time, Mr. President, I will not go through all of specific proposals now. Instead, I refer my colleagues to a summary of the legislation.  Mr. President, a college education is the dream of every American family. When I travel around my State of Delaware, I meet with wealthy businessmen, poor welfare mothers, and hundreds of middle-class families. And, they all want the same thing for their kids: a chance to go to college.  They do not need us in Washington to tell them it is becoming harder and harder to get there. They know that. They need us to make it easier for them. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this important legislation to make sure that the American dream of a college education remains within reach of every American.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                       The GET AHEAD Act--Summary              title i--tax incentives for higher education           Subtitle A--Tax Relief for Higher Education Costs     Section 101--Deduction for Higher Education Expenses       An above-the-line tax deduction (available even to those      who do not itemize deductions) would be allowed for the costs      of college tuition and fees as well as interest on college      loans.       In the case of tuition costs, beginning in tax year 1999,      the maximum annual deduction would be $10,000 per year; a      maximum deduction of $5,000 would be available in tax years      1996, 1997, and 1998. The full deduction     would be available to single taxpayers with incomes under      $70,000 and married couples with incomes under $100,000; a      reduced (phased-out) deduction would be available to those      with incomes up to $90,000 (singles) and $120,000 (couples).      The income thresholds would be indexed annually for      inflation.       Interest on student loans would be deductible beginning      with interest payments made in tax year 1996. Interest      payments could be deducted on top of the $10,000 deduction      for payment of college tuition and fees. There would be no      annual maximum and no income limits with regard to the      deductibility of interest on student loans.       Language is included to coordinate this tax deduction with      other education provisions of the tax code--to ensure that      individuals do not receive a double benefit for the same      payments. Specifically, qualified higher education expenses      that could be tax deductible would be reduced by any payments      made from Series EE savings bonds (and excluded from taxable      income), any veterans educational assistance provided by the      federal government, and any other payments from tax-exempt      sources (e.g. employer-provided educational assistance).      Also, tax-free scholarships and tax-excluded funds from      Education Savings Accounts (see section 112) would first be      attributed to room and board costs; the remainder, if any,      would count against tuition and fees and would reduce the      amount that would be tax deductible. However, if tuition and      fees still exceeded $10,000 even after the reductions, the      full tax deduction would be available.     Section 102--Exclusion for Scholarships and Fellowships       College scholarships and fellowship grants would not be      considered income for the purposes of federal income taxes.      This returns the tax treatment of scholarships and      fellowships to their treatment prior to the 1986 Tax Reform      Act (which limited the exclusion of scholarships and      fellowships to that used for tuition and fees).       Scholarships and fellowship grants would be fully      excludable for degree candidates. In the case of non-degree      candidates, individuals would be eligible for a lifetime      exclusion of $10,800--$300 per month for a maximum 36 months.       Language is included to clarify that federal grants for      higher education that are conditioned on future service (such      as National Health Service Corps grants for medical students)      would still be eligible for tax exclusion.       This section would be effective beginning with scholarships      and fellowship grants used in tax year 1996.     Section 103--Permanent Exclusion for Educational Assistance       The tax exclusion for employer-provided educational      assistance would be reinstated retroactively to January 1,      1995. And, the tax exclusion would be made a permanent part      of the tax code.       Subtitle B--Encouraging Savings for Higher Education Costs     Section 111--IRA Distributions Used Without Penalty for          Higher Education Expenses       Funds could be withdrawn from Individual Retirement      Accounts (IRAs) before age 59\1/2\ without being subject to      the 10 percent penalty tax if the funds were used for higher      education tuition and fees. (However, withdrawn funds, if      deductible when contributed to the IRA, would be considered      gross income for the purposes of federal income taxes.)       This section would be effective upon enactment.     Section 112--Education Savings Accounts       This section would create IRA-like accounts--known as      Education Savings Accounts (ESA's)--for the purpose of      encouraging savings for a college education.       Each year, a family could invest up to $2000 per child      under the age of 19 in an ESA. For single taxpayers with      incomes under $70,000 (phased out up to $90,000) and married      couples with incomes under $100,000 (phased out up to      $120,000), the contributions would be tax deductible. (These      income thresholds would be indexed annually for inflation.)      For all taxpayers, the interest in an ESA would accumulate      tax free; the contributions would not be subject to the      federal gift tax; and, the balance in an ESA would not be      treated as an asset or income for the purposes of determining      eligibility for federal means-tested programs.       ESA funds could be withdrawn to meet the higher education      expenses--tuition, fees, books, supplies, equipment, and room      and board--of the beneficiary. Funds withdrawn for other      purposes would be subject to a 10 percent penalty tax and      would be considered income for the purposes of federal income      taxes (to the extent that the funds were tax deductible when      contributed). The penalty tax would not apply in cases of      death or disability of the beneficiary of the ESA and in      cases of unemployment of the contributors.       In addition, when the beneficiary of the account turns age      30 and is not enrolled in college at least half time, any      funds remaining in the ESA would be (1) transferred to      another ESA; (2) donated to an educational institution; or      (3) refunded to the contributors. In the first two cases,      there would be no penalty tax and the money would not be      considered taxable income. In the third case, the penalty tax      would not apply, but the funds would be counted as income to      the extent that the funds were tax deductible when      contributed.       Finally, parents could roll over funds from one child's ESA      to another child's ESA without regard to any taxes, without      regard to the $2000 annual maximum contribution to an ESA,      and without regard to the age 30 requirement noted above.      Funds rolled over would also not be subject to the federal      gift tax.       Language is also included to allow individuals to designate      contributions to an ESA as nondeductible even if such      contributions could be tax deductible. This gives families      the option to build up the principal in an ESA while at a      lower tax rate, rather than having to pay taxes on unspent      ESA funds when the contributors are older and likely in a      higher tax bracket.       Tax deductible contributions to ESAs would be allowed      beginning in tax year 1996.     Section 113--Increase in Income Limits for Savings Bond          Exclusion       For taxpayers with incomes below certain thresholds, the      interest earned on Series EE U.S. Savings Bonds are not      considered taxable income if the withdrawn funds are used to      pay for higher education tuition and fees. This section      increases the income thresholds to allow more Americans to      use the Series EE Savings Bonds for education expenses.       Effective with tax year 1996, the income thresholds would      be the same as the income thresholds for the higher education      tax deduction (see section 101): $70,000 for single taxpayers      (phased out up to $90,000), and $100,000 for couples (phased      out up to $120,000). As with the higher education tax      deduction, these income thresholds would be indexed annually      for inflation.     Section 114--Tax Treatment of State Prepaid Tuition Plans       Several states have established prepaid tuition plans,      where individuals can make advance payments for college      tuition. However, because of the uncertainty of federal tax      law, some states have put their plans on hold and other      states have not gone forward at all. This section clarifies      federal tax law in two respects.       First, state-established trusts or corporations created      exclusively for managing tuition prepayment plans would be      exempt from federal taxes on investment earnings. Second,      the letter-ruling issued by the IRS to Michigan would be      codified: purchasers and beneficiaries of prepaid tuition      plans would be liable for federal income taxes on the      increased value of the investment only at the time the      funds were redeemed, not each year as the ``interest''      accrued.       To be eligible for the tax clarification, a state prepaid      tuition plan must guarantee at the time of purchase that a      certain percentage of costs would be covered at a      participating educational institution, regardless of the      performance of the investment fund. And, it must guarantee      that funds would be refunded in the event of the death or      disability of the beneficiary or in the event the beneficiary      failed to enroll in a participating institution.            title ii--scholarships for academic achievement       Beginning with the high school graduating class of 1997,      the top 5 percent of graduating seniors at each high school      in the United States would be eligible for a $1000 merit      scholarship. If an individual receiving such a scholarship      achieved a 3.0 (``B'') average during his or her first year      of college, a second $1000 scholarship would be awarded.       However, the merit scholarships would be available only to      those students in families with income under $70,000 (single)      and $100,000 (couples). These income thresholds would be      increased annually for inflation.       Funds are authorized (and subject to annual appropriations)      for five years. The first year authorization (fiscal year      1997) is $130 million. In each of the next four years (FY      1998-FY 2001), because the scholarships could be renewed for      a second year, the authorization is $260 million per year.      Total five-year authorization: $1.17 billion.                     title iii--deficit neutrality       To ensure that the ``GET AHEAD'' Act does not increase the      deficit, this title declares it the sense of the Senate that      the costs of the bill should be paid by closing corporate tax      loopholes.                                 ______                                       By
