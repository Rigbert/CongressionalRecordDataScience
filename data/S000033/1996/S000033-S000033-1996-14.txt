 Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, this amendment is substantively the same as an amendment No. 5 in the July 16, 1996, Congressional Record but it incorporates a technical change which I believe makes our intent clearer.  The amendment that I am offering today with the gentleman from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] along with the gentleman from New York [Mr. Nadler] and the gentleman from Florida [Mr. Weldon] touches on an issue of enormous consequence to millions of Americans, especially given the rapid transmission we are experiencing from traditional health insurance to managed care and HMO's. We can all agree on the need to control health care costs. However, we must also ensure that health care decisions which affect our lives and our well-being are made by physicians using medical rationale and who have the best interests of their patients at heart and not by insurance companies who may be putting their drive for profits before the best interests of their patients. Most importantly, Mr. Chairman, we must preserve the fundamental core of successful health care, and, that is, the doctor-patient relationship.  When a patient walks into a doctor's office, he or she must be 100 percent confident that the treatment that is being recommended comes from the doctor's best medical judgment and is not motivated by an insurance company's desire for greater profits.                              {time}  1345  A patient deserves to be told the full truth when going to a doctor and that is what this amendment is all about.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
