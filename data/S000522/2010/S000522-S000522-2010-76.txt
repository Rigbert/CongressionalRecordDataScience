I have introduced a bill which would provide small grant money to fledgling nongovernmental organizations throughout the world.  In my travels to places like Nigeria, I met up with a small nongovernmental organization which was like David versus Goliath. I was trying to get the government there to realize that they have an autistic problem that is estimated to affect about 1 million children in Nigeria alone. Nobody knows how accurate that is, but the best and most well-intentioned people in Nigeria have come to that number.  So we do have a serious spike. What is the trigger? Is it too many vaccines given at one time, you know, where the megadosing that occurs today in that little child can't metabolize and where the body can't deal with it in a way that leads to the child's being safe from those other diseases? Is it thimerosal? For our children and for our young adults who have autism, we need to continue to leave no stone unturned in finding what the trigger is or what the multiple triggers are.  Finally, again, I want to thank Bobbie and Billy Gallagher, who are the two parents in Brick Township who came forward with a stack of papers and who said, Please, will you take this up?  I took it up, and I've enjoyed working closely with friends and colleagues on the other side of the aisle so that we can cure autism now. The sooner the better.
