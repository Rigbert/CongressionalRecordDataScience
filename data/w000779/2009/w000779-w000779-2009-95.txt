President, today I wish to show my appreciation for the dedication and commitment of the Oregon National Guard. They are the best that Oregon has to offer. The best our Nation has to offer. I am honored, this weekend, to personally see off the largest Oregon guard deployment since World War II.  Right now, 2,700 citizen soldiers from across my State are gearing up for a 10-month deployment to Iraq, and I am positive that their actions will bring honor to the United States and to the great State of Oregon.  Despite progress, Iraq remains a dangerous place. But our National Guard soldiers are well-trained, well-led and well-equipped. I know they will do their best to complete their missions and return to their families. I also know that our Nation has done its best to give them the tools they need to do so safely and expediently.  I have been fortunate enough to meet with many of Oregon's citizen soldiers more than once--first in the dust and heat of southern Idaho last summer then in their armories in the days leading up to training at Camp Roberts. I made a promise to see them off when they are deployed and I intend to be there to welcome all of them home after their courageous service is complete.  These are uncertain times--not only in the United States but around the world. It is a world that is once again turning its eyes toward America for leadership and inspiration. Now, more than ever, it is time for America to be strong for those in need.  The Oregon National Guard is the face of that strength. Our men and women in uniform are this country's greatest representatives to the world. While being strong, we must also demonstrate our values through compassion, justice, and integrity.  I realize these soldiers have a difficult road ahead, which will involve both professional and personal struggles. Whether this is their first deployment or their fourth, their dedication and commitment will be tested on a daily basis--but, courage and determination are their hallmarks.  Members of the Oregon National Guard are exactly the kind of soldiers that our Founding Fathers believed could best defend this Nation--volunteer citizen soldiers with roots in the community and a patriotic spirit.  I salute Oregon's great band of citizen soldiers. May God bless them and see each and every one of them home safe.                          ____________________
