President, I want to briefly discuss a GAO report that was released earlier this week to be sure that other Senators are aware of.  The report, entitled ``Global Health: Framework for Infectious Disease Surveillance,'' was commissioned by Senator McConnell and myself, and Senators Frist and Feingold. It investigates the existing global system, or network, of infectious disease surveillance, and will be followed by a second report which analyzes the strengths and weaknesses of this network and make recommendations for strengthening it.  We requested this report in response to a growing concern among public health officials about the inability of many countries to identify and track infectious diseases and respond promptly and effectively to disease outbreaks. In fact, the World Health Assembly determined in 1995 that the existing surveillance networks could not be considered adequate.  By way of background, the term ``surveillance'' covers four types of activities: detecting and reporting diseases; analyzing and confirming reports; responding to epidemics; and reassessing longer-term policies and programs. I will touch on these categories in a bit more detail, as they illustrate the need for reform.  In the detection and reporting phase, local health care providers diagnose diseases and then report the existence of pre-determined ``notifiable'' diseases to national or regional authorities. The accurate diagnosis of patients is obviously crucial, but it can be very difficult as many diseases share symptoms. It is even more difficult in developing countries, where public health professionals have less access to the newest information on diseases.  In the next stage of surveillance, disease patterns are analyzed and reported diseases are confirmed. This process occurs at a regional or national level, and usually involves lab work to confirm a doctor's diagnosis. From the resulting data, a response plan is devised. Officials must determine a number of other factors as well, such as the capability of a doctor to make an accurate diagnosis. Unfortunately, in many developing countries this process can take weeks, while the disease continues to spread.  When an epidemic is identified, various organizations must determine how to contain the disease, how to treat the infected persons, and how to inform the public about the problem without causing panic. Forty-nine percent of internationally significant epidemics occur in complex emergency situations, such as overcrowded refugee camps. Challenges in responding to epidemics are mainly logistical--getting the necessary treatment to those in need.  Finally, in assessing the longer-term health policies and programs, surveillance teams can provide information on disease patterns, health care priorities, and the allocation of resources. However, information from developing countries is often unreliable.  I want to emphasize two points. The first is that all the activities that I have just described are done by what WHO calls a ``network of networks.'' There is, in fact, no global system for infectious disease surveillance. Let me repeat, for anyone who thinks there is some centrally-managed, well-organized global system, there is not. Rather, what exists is a loose network, a patch-work quilt of sorts, involving the UN, non-governmental organizations, national health facilities, military laboratories, and many other organizations, all of which depend upon each other for information, but with no standardized procedures.  The second point is that in countries where a tropical climate fosters many infectious diseases, one also finds the least amount of reliable data. If we as a country, or we as a global community, are committed to eradicating the deadliest diseases, building the capacity for effective surveillance in the developing countries is where we need to focus our attention.  The sequel to this report is due to be released by the GAO in a few months. It will assess the strengths and weaknesses of this loosely-organized surveillance system, and make recommendations for strengthening it. We need tobe able to accurately diagnose diseases, and quickly transmit the information to the global health community.  I urge other Senators to read this first report. This is an issue that has received far too little attention, and which directly affects the health of every American. Any disease, whether HIV/AIDS, malaria, TB, or others as yet unknown, which could infect and kill millions or tens of millions of people, is only an airplane flight away.  Accurate surveillance, which is the first step to an effective response, is critical. Yet today we are relying on a haphazard network of public, private, official, and unofficial components of varying degrees of reliability, patched together over time. It is a lot better than nothing, but the world needs a uniformly reliable, coordinated system with effective procedures that apply the highest standards. I look forward to GAO's next report, and its recommendations for action.                          ____________________
