 President, I want to take this opportunity to make a few comments as a member of the Energy Committee on the energy bill that is on the floor and which will be subject to amendment tomorrow morning. I believe the ethanol amendment will be taken up.  There is an overarching possibility in this energy bill. It can provide the opportunity to properly fix the badly broken energy market, to reduce our consumption of oil, and to increase energy production while protecting our environment and addressing climate change. But at this point, the Energy Policy Act of 2003 is missing much of what is needed for a balanced, comprehensive energy policy for this Nation.  I voted against the bill in the Energy Committee because of what is missing. I look forward to the opportunity to amend this legislation.  First, I believe the bill needs stronger consumer protection to fix our broken energy market and to prevent another energy crisis like the one we experienced in the West.  Second, we must increase the fuel efficiency of our vehicles to reduce the amount of oil we consume, to lessen the amount of carbon dioxide, the No. 1 greenhouse gas released into our atmosphere, and to save families and businesses money at the pump.  Third, we must increase our energy production while protecting our environment. This means not infringing on environmentally sensitive areas such as the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge or the water off the California and Florida coasts.  Fourth, we should address global warming and establish plans to combat climate change.  Fifth, we must encourage the development of new renewable power from solar, from wind, and from geothermal resources instead of continuing to subsidize traditional production from nuclear power, for example.  Three years ago this month, California's energy market began to spiral out of control. In May of 2000, families and businesses in San Diego saw their energy bill soar. The Western energy crisis forced every family and business to pay for more energy. The crisis forced the State of California into a severe budget shortfall. It forced the State's largest utility into bankruptcy and nearly bankrupted the second largest utility. Now, 3 years and $45 billion in cost later, we have learned how the energy market in California was gamed and abused.  In March, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued the ``Final Report on Price Manipulation in Western Markets which confirmed that there was widespread and pervasive fraud and manipulation during the Western energy crisis. The abuse of our energy market was so pervasive and unlawful. Yet this energy bill does not go far enough to prevent another Western energy crisis and to curb illegal Enron-type manipulation.  Remember, this type of fraud and abuse was not limited to just Enron. There was fraud and abuse across the board, according to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. One of the best examples of this illegal behavior is demonstrated by the transcript from Reliant Energy that revealed how their traders intentionally withheld power from the California market in an attempt to increase prices. This is one of the most egregious examples of manipulation, and it is clear and convincing evidence of coordinated schemes to defraud consumers.  Let me read one part of the transcript to demonstrate the greed behind the market abuse by Reliant and its traders.  On June 20, 2000, two Reliant employees had the following conversation that revealed the company withheld power from the California market to drive prices up.       Reliant Operations Manager 1: I don't necessarily foresee      those units being run the remainder of this week. In fact you      will probably see, in fact I know, tomorrow we have all the      units at Coolwater off.  The Coolwater plant is a 526 megawatt plant.       Reliant Plant Operator 2: Really?       Reliant Operations Manager 1: Potentially. Even number      four. More due to some market manipulation attempts on our      part. And so, on number four it probably wouldn't last long.      It would probably be back on the next day, if not the day      after that. Trying to uh. . .       Reliant Plant Operator 2: Trying to shorten supply, uh?      That way the price on demand goes up.       Reliant Operations Manager 1: Well, we'll see.       Reliant Plant Operator 2: I can understand. That's cool.       Reliant Operations Manager 1: We've got some term positions      that, you know, that would benefit.  Six months after this incident, as the Senate Energy Committee was attempting to get to the bottom of why energy prices were soaring in the West, the president and CEO of Reliant testified before Congress that the State of California ``has focused on an inaccurate perception of market manipulation.''  Reliant's president and CEO went on to say, ``We are proud of our contributions to keep generation running to try to meet the demand for power in California. Reliant Energy's plant and technical staffs have worked hard to maximize the performance of our generation.''  These transcripts prove otherwise and reveal the truth about market manipulation in the energy sector.  Yet FERC refused to find and consider all evidence of fraud and manipulation and the State of California was forced to take the commission to court to ensure FERC would carry out its public duty to fully investigate the western energy crisis and punish wrongdoing. Only when the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled FERC had to allow the California parties to collect and submit evidence did we find more instances of pervasive illegal behavior.  After a 100-day discovery period that ended March 3, 2003, the State of California, the California attorney general's office, and the state's largest utilities filed over 3,000 pages of evidence at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to show how fraud and manipulation was pervasive throughout the western energy crisis of 2000-2001. The market abuse was not limited to a few rogue traders at one firm, but was a widespread series of schemes perpetuated by many employees across most companies that supplied and traded in the West.  During their discovery period, the ``California parties'' found the following information:  Details on new specific incidents when energy companies intentionally held their plants offline to drive prices up during 2000 and 2001; new transcripts of conversations between energy company employees revealing an intent to defraud and manipulate the California market; new evidence of document destruction by energy companies to hide details of their behavior in the western energy market; and new evidence laying out possible anti-trust violations by energy companies.  I ask unaminous consent that a copy of the report my office issued when the ``Protective Order'' was lifted by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:   New Evidence That Energy Companies Besides Enron Manipulated the                          Western Energy Market        [Unofficial Report--Office of Senator Dianne Feinstein]       After a 100-day discovery period that ended March 3, 2003,      the State of California, the California Attorney General's      Office, and the state's largest utilities filed over 3,000      pages of evidence at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission      to show how fraud and manipulation was pervasive throughout      the Western Energy Crisis of 2000-2001. The market abuse was      not limited to a few rogue traders at one firm, but was a      widespread series of schemes perpetuated by many employees      across most companies that supplied and traded in the West.     highlights of the information filed by the California parties       (This information from the California Parties was under a      ``Protective Order'' at FERC.)       Details on new specific incidents when energy companies      intentionally held their     plants offline to drive prices up during 2000 and 2001.       New transcripts of conversations between energy company      employees revealing an intent to defraud and manipulate the      California market.       Reliant knew about transcripts proving their employees held      power offline, but the company sat on the evidence for over a      year before turning them over to FERC. (CA Parties brief,      p122, footnote 375/Exhibit CA-218).       New evidence of document destruction by energy companies to      hide details of their behavior in the Western Energy Market.       New evidence laying out possible anti-trust violations by      energy companies.       The filing by the California parties shows that there was      an extensive and coordinated attempt by energy companies to      game the Western market to drive prices up by engaging in the      following:       (1) Withholding of Power--driving up prices by creating      false shortages.       New evidence of Withholding of Power according to the      California parties: (CA Parties brief, p28-31/Exhibit CA-9).       On August 15, 2000 Williams reported that its plant in Long      Beach called Alamitos 7 was unavailable due to NOX      limitations, but AES's real-time logs from that day show the      plant was shut down because Williams directed it to be.       Reliant failed to return its Etiwanda Unit 2 in Rancho      Cucamonga to service for two days after repairs were      completed on January 26, 2001, even though the ISO system was      experiencing continuous Stage 3 emergencies in California.       Redondo Beach Unit 6 power plant was shut down by Williams      and AES April 3-April 6, 2000. Although the ISO was told the      plant was offline due to a boiler tube leak, the plant      records indicate this was a planned shutdown and the leak was      an excuse concocted two days later.       Dynegy shut down its El Segundo Unit 1 plant August 30-     September 3, 2000 for repairs, but the repairs had been done      and the plant was shut down to force prices up.       Mirant held its Pittsburgh Unit 1 plant offline until      October 22, 2000 even though an external tube leak ended      October 20, 2000.       Duke delayed returning Oakland Unit 1 to service after      repairs to a lube oil cooler and a cooling fan in November,      2000 despite ISO-declared emergencies.       During an ISO-declared emergency December 19 and 20, 2000,      Williams declared Redondo Unit 5 a forced outage due to a      boiler tube leak. However, the control operator logs      uncharacteristically put quotation marks around the outage      reason, ``Blr. Tube Leak'' and later, after tests were done,      the logs indicate that no leaks were found.       Reliant delayed reporting the end of an outage at its      Ellwood Unit in Goleta for more than twelve hours during peak      demand in early April 2001.       Between November 19 and December 5, 2000 Dynegy reported      that its El Segundo 1 and 2 units (with a capacity of about      350 MW) were on ``forced outage,'' but these units were      actually shutdown because Dynegy claimed its operating staff      was on vacation. Forced outages should not include vacation      days--especially during ISO emergencies, which occurred on      November 19 and 20.       (2) Bidding to Exercise Market Power--suppliers bid higher      after the California ISO declared emergencies, knowing the      State would need power and be willing to pay any price to get      it.       New evidence of Bidding to Exercise Market Power according      to the California parties:       A Mirant email to eleven traders in July of 2000 reveals      this strategy: ``load is avg above 40 thousand during peak.      So, submit revised supp. Bids and `stick-it to `em!!' '' (CA      Parties brief, p42-43/Exhibit CA-141).       (3) Scheduling of Bogus Load (aka ``Fat Boy'' or ``Inc-     ing'')--suppliers submitted false load schedules to increase      prices.       New evidence of Scheduling Bogus Load according to the      California parties:       A Dynegy trader confirms that Dynegy's load deviation in      August 2000 is ``probably because [the traders] are just      doing some dummy load scheduling.'' (CA Parties brief, p48/     Exhibit CA-202).       A conversation between a Mirant trader and a trader from      Public Service of Colorado reveal a joint effort to engage in      ``Fat Boy.''       The trader from Public Service of Colorado states, ``Why      don't we just do something where we overschedule,      overschedule load and share an upside, dude.''       The Mirant trader responds, ``That's fine.'' (CA Parties      brief, p49/Exhibit CA-204)       A Sempra trader states Sempra should submit ``fake load''      to the day ahead market. (CA Parties brief, p49/Exhibit CA-     71)       A Williams trading strategy is identified as ``scheduling      bogus load.'' (CA Parties brief, p49/Exhibit CA-22).       An internal Powerex memo documents that Powerex entered      into a contract with the explicit purpose of      ``overscheduling'' and ``underscheduling'' and for congestion      manipulation. (CA Parties brief, p49).       (4) Export-Import Games (aka ``Ricochet'' or ``Megawatt      Laundering'')--suppliers exported power out of California and      imported it back into the State in an attempt to sell power      at inflated prices.       New evidence of Export-Import Games according to the      California parties:       Powerex's head trader congratulated its daily traders on      their successful use of strategies to buy-ahead and sell back      real-time. (CA Parties brief, p53/Exhibit CA-40).       Reliant had ``camouflage transactions'' where the company      sold power out of California day-ahead to Arizona and New      Mexico utilities, and bought it back for sale in the real-     time market. (CA Parties brief, p55/Exhibit CA-56).       (5) Congestion Games (aka ``Death Star'')--suppliers      created false congestion and were then paid for relieving      congestion without moving any power.       New evidence of Congestion Games according to the      California parties:       Other names like ``Death Star'' were given to these      schemes: EPMI^Star, CISO^Death, Curious and George, Red and      Green, Hungry and Hippo, James and Dean or Chinook and      Atlantic and SCEM^Loopy. (CA Parties brief, p59/Exhibit CA-     1).       These congestion games were called ``free money.'' (CA      Parties brief, p59/Exhibit CA-145).       A Mirant trader summed up the scheme, ``I mean its just      kind of loop-t-looping but it's making money . . . [laugh].''      (CA Parties brief, p48/Exhibit CA-204).       (6) Double-Selling--suppliers sold reserves, but then      failed to keep those reserves available for the ISO.       (7) Selling of Non-Existent Ancillary Services (aka ``Get      Shorty'')--suppliers sold resources that were either already      committed to other sales or incapable of being provided.       (8) Sharing of Non-Public Generation Outage Information--     the largest suppliers in California shared information from a      company called Industrial Information Resources that provided      sellers detailed, non-public information on daily plant      outages. A one-year subscription to Industrial Information      Resources cost $70,000. Providing multiple competitors the      same, non-public, outage information signals all competitors      to act in a parallel manner.       New evidence of Sharing of Non-Public Information according      to the California parties:       Duke energy traders called Industrial Information Resources      ``the mole.''       For example, Duke trader James Stebbins emailed: ``I just      heard back from the mole. He is reporting that the PV3 will      be coming back on line 6 days earlier than expected. The new      return date is March 3. Good luck and happy selling.'' (CA      Parties brief, p70/Exhibit CA-95 and Exhibit CA-253).       (9) Collusion Among Sellers--sellers were jointly      implementing or facilitating Enron-type trading strategies.       New evidence of Collusion Among Sellers according to the      California parties:       Glendale traders learned manipulation from Enron and Coral      traders. (CA Parties brief, p77/Exhibit CA-105 and Exhibit      CA-1).       Sempra provided Coral with advance information regarding      the status of a plant. (CA Parties brief, p78/Exhibit CA-1).       Transcripts of calls show traders from Public Service of      Colorado and Mirant discussing ``sharing'' or ``splitting''      ``the upside. (CA Parties brief, p79/Exhibit CA-204).       (10) Manipulation of NONOX Emission Market--     sellers manipulated the market for NONOX emissions      in the South Coast Air Quality Management District through a      series of wash trades that created the appearance of a      dramatic price increase that may have been fabricated.       For example, Dynegy, together with AES and others, entered      into a series of trades of NONOX credits in July      and August 2000 by which Dynegy would sell a large quality of      credits and then simultaneously buy back a smaller quantity      of credits at a higher per credit price. (CA Parties brief,      p90-93/Exhibit CA-11).       (11) Wanton Document Destruction--sellers (not just Enron)      flagrantly destroyed documents detailing behavior in the      Western Energy Market.       New evidence of Wanton Document Destruction according to      the California parties:       Mirant--an ex-Mirant employee disclosed that he was      instructed to delete certain files relating to the California      markets from hard drives and that key Mirant executives were      instructed to turn in their laptops so that Mirant could      clear their hard drives. (CA Parties, brief, p129/Exhibit CA-     178).       City of Glendale, California--A Glendale employee, Jack      Dolan, told an ex-Glendale employee, Carl Edginton, that Mr.      Edginton could destroy one of the documents that contained      information about Enron's gaming strategies. (CA Parties      brief, p129-130/Exhibit CA-213).       (12) Negligent Document Destruction--sellers failed to      retain documents detailing behavior in the Western Energy      Market in accordance with FERC rules and the Federal Power      Act.       According to the California parties, new evidence of      Negligent Document Destruction by: Power, Portland General      Electric, Reliant, Bonneville Power Administration, City of      Glendale, Northern California Power Agency. (CA Parties      brief, p130-132).       (13) Traders Did Not Care How High Prices Went--sellers      said that it did not matter how high prices went, as long as      Californians paid and generators made money.       New evidence Traders Did Not Care How High Prices Went in      the filing:       Conversation between two Reliant employees on May 22, 2000:       Kevin: ``Hey, guys, you know when we might follow rules? If      there's some sort of penalty.''       Walter: ``That's right.''       Kevin: ``I would never suggest it, but it seems like the      writing would be on the wall.''       Walter: ``Well, I mean, there's--you know, our position is      if it's a reliability issue, then the reliability comes over      the economics.       Kevin: ``Right.''       Walter: ``So we don't have a problem with that. But it      needs to be a reliability issue. If it's economics, and by      God, that's what rules.''       Kevin: ``You'll let the California rate payers pay.''       Walter: ``That's right. I don't have a problem with that. I      have no guilty conscience about that.''       Kevin: ``All right, man.'' (CA Parties brief, p110-111/     Exhibit CA-239).
