Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her comments.  Mr. Speaker, I know you are being kind on the timing.  In closing, let me say this, Meyer M. Cardin was a good and decent humanbeing. He was beloved by his family, beloved by his friends and his community and by his State. Meyer Cardin was a great American, a great human being, a great dad, a great grandfather, and he will be missed sorely. But the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi) is absolutely correct. His life was a joy and a triumph.                          ____________________[Pages H5711-H5712]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                     HONORING JUDGE MEYER M.
