President, I would like to pay tribute to one of central Vermont's finest community gathering spaces, the Wayside Restaurant. Over the past 90 years, the Wayside has built its reputation around the State of Vermont as a quality establishment where neighbors enjoy a country style breakfast, a quick business lunch, or a well-rounded family dinner. The Wayside represents the needs of the community with affordable and diversely pleasant fare.  In 1918, when Effie Ballou opened the small soup and sandwich restaurant, she never expected it would become what it is today. The Wayside serves around 1,000 customers a day, and with 160 seats, is always filled with loyal customers. Vermonters from all walks of life frequent the Wayside for authentic Vermont cooking. Politicians, professionals, farmers, elderly people, and families all gather here to eat, mingle and enjoy where they can choose a booth or saddle up to the horse shoe diner top.  The Wayside's menu offers more than 200 items, plus an additional list of specials, all new every day. These daily specials are memorized by the true blue patrons who line up at the doors before 6:30 a.m. Unique delights such as fresh native perch, only served in season, is breaded and fried. Traditional Yankee entrees are always accompanied by freshly baked pies, breads and donuts.  One of Vermont's landmark eateries, the Wayside Restaurant sparks community admiration through its history of public service. A major part of the Wayside's success is its history of family ownership. Karen Galfetti and Brian Zecchinelli are second-generation owners and operators. The couple's dedication and hands on approach are what sets the tone of the establishment, aided by their home's location right next to the restaurant. Working together as a family, the Zecchinellis strive to create a comfortable atmosphere and affordable service for the community; as such they represent the heart of working America. Providing excellent benefits for employees, most of whom have been there for decades, the philosophy behind the Wayside reflects the kind of values that strengthen our country. The Zecchinellis' dedication was recognized in 2005, when the U.S. Small Business Administration named them best Family-Owned Small Business of the Year.  Without the Wayside, to invite folks into Vermont, we would be missing not only the chance to connect with our next door neighbors, but the opportunity to support a long-time establishment that has always kept the interests of its customers at the heart of its expansion.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article from the Times Argus detailing their 90 years of success be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                         [From the Times Argus]                           Wayside Turning 90                            (By Susan Allen)       Montpelier/Berlin (literally).--In 1918, the Armistice was      signed, ending World War I.       A legend--Ella Fitzgerald--was born.       A first class postage stamp cost 3 cents.       And, of course, the Boston Red Sox won the World Series.       That same year, Effie Ballou opened The Wayside Restaurant,      straddling the Montpelier/Berlin town line--not the 160-seat      local institution that has become something of a landmark in      Central Vermont, but a small, take-out joint that more      closely resembled a snack bar.       ``In the early days, there were no seats inside the      restaurant,'' said Brian Zecchinelli, who married into the      restaurant business in 1994 when he tied the knot with Karen      Galfetti--whose family bought The Wayside in 1966 from the      Fishes (who bought it from Effie Ballou in 1945).       ``Mrs. Ballou would make some soup at the house, donuts,      bring them down and reheat them,'' Zecchinelli said.       Today's Wayside serves around 1,000 customers a day--more      in the summer, fewer in the winter. Most are locals and many      are regulars who eat there so often they know the day of the      week by the restaurant's regular daily special.       But The Wayside has become more than a place local      Vermonters go for a good, affordable meal (Zecchinelli      recently mailed a letter to lawmakers reminding them they can      eat three meals a day there for about $20).       Many statewide and local politicians make sure there's at      least one Wayside stop on the campaign tour. Zecchinelli said      that's because so many Vermonters from all walks of life can      be found there--plenty of votes to woo.       ``It's just such a cross section of the community eating      here,'' Zecchinelli said. ``Plumbers, lawyers, teachers, bank      presidents . . . the whole mix of customers. You've got rusty      old trucks and shining Mercedes in the parking lot.''       The Wayside was also a hot spot for state workers until      some years ago. That was due, in part, to the employee meal      reimbursement plan that allowed workers to expense meals      eaten outside Montpelier. So, Zecchinelli said, some would      eat at tables on the Berlin side of the restaurant so they      could expense their meal--until an auditor discovered that      while the town line passed through the property, the entire      restaurant was inside the Montpelier city limits. No more      expensing.       Asked what makes the restaurant so special, ``You always      say you have good employees and good customers,'' Zecchinelli      said.       But, he said, the reality is something different. It's the      house. Ballou lived in a house on the hill just behind The      Wayside. When she sold the restaurant to Joseph and Amy Fish      (their son George and his wife Vivian took it over in 1954),      the house went with the deal.       And when the Galfettis bought the restaurant in 1966, they,      in turn, got the house, as did Karen and Brian when they took      over.       ``Since Day One, the house was always with the      restaurant,'' said Brian Zecchinelli. ``So the owners have      always been very hands-on. . . . The fact that the owner has      always been able to skip down to The Wayside to give folks a      hand, be there during hours when you're busiest.       ``If other businesses want to put a house on the property,      go for it,'' he advised.       Brian, who previously worked at Milne Travel and Rock of      Ages, never expected to go into the restaurant business.      Although Karen had also worked elsewhere--E.F. Hutton and Co.      and Smith Barney in Burlington--she knew The Wayside was      probably in her future.       ``It was something I tried and I liked. We've enjoyed it,''      Brian Zecchinelli said. ``We're been so active in this      business that we can tag team each other.''       The Galfettis and Zecchinellis have put seven additions on      the restaurant over the years, and although customers have      urged him to expand, Brian said the current size of 120      tables feels like the number to stay with, ``a comfortable      size.''       He said the best thing about owning The Wayside has been      the customers, who truly respond to good food. ``You're only      as good as your last meal,'' he quipped.       The toughest thing, he noted, has been meeting the bottom      line.       ``The challenge is keeping costs in line so we can continue      to be an affordable place for people to gather,'' he said.      Almost everything is made on site. The kitchen is large and      the smells of freshly baking bread (almost all bread, except      English muffins and rye, are made at the restaurant). Daily      specials include full turkey meals, roast beef, maple-cured      McKenzie ham and more.       On virtually any day of the week, any time of the day, the      parking lot is packed, most of the cars, trucks and      motorcycles carrying Vermont license plates.       Zecchinelli said his favorite moment during his years as      Wayside owner was the Red Sox rally he hosted after the Sox      won the 2004 World Series, noting the last time his team had      won was the year The Wayside opened--1918.       ``We argued whether The Wayside has been the curse or the      Bambino,'' he joked.       The restaurant rolled back prices that day, and more than      3,000 people came in to celebrate, ``mostly Red Sox fans, but      some employees were in Yankee jerseys. That's OK because      we're baseball fans.''       What will happen to The Wayside in the future, one wonders?      It's impossible to know for sure.       But, Zecchinelli pointed out, his son Jay has been working      the register since he was 4.                          ____________________
