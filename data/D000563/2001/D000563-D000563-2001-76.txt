She said in just a few moments exactly what we need to hear as we consider this economic stimulus package.  I believe she has put a finger on it: We are being called on, across America, to rally behind our flag, our President, and our cause, that we should make certain when it comes to the economic stimulus package, we also keep in mind that all America is involved. It is the working families in America paying the payroll taxes into the Social Security trust fund who are funding all we are doing. The money we are spending to defend America against terrorism, the money we are spending to rebuild New York, the money we are spending to help the airline industry, the money we are spending for an economic stimulus all comes out of the Social Security trust fund, and all of that money comes from the payroll workers across America.  When we talk about invigorating this economy and getting it moving forward again, what a difference in approach we have between the two political parties. On the House side, the Republicans came up with a stimulus package which I am afraid doesn't meet the test of encouraging consumer spending, doing it in a timely fashion, and not damaging the economy. Instead, what the House Republican package came up with was, sadly, a great deal of tax relief for the biggest corporations in America. This is profiteering in the name of patriotism.  Consider for a minute that these corporations would receive rebate checks for 15 years' worth of Federal income tax under the stimulus plan supported by the House of Representatives. IBM would receive $1.4 billion from the Social Security trust fund; Ford, $1 billion; General Motors, $833 million. The list goes on and on. Billions and billions of dollars in corporate relief from the House Republican stimulus plan and precious little or nothing for the workers across America.  We know what will get this economy moving again. Give some money to the people who are having a tough time--having just lost their jobs--to keep their families together, and they will spend it. Of course they will. Give the people who just lost their jobs help in paying for health insurance, and they will use that help because they are as frightened as anyone that family members or their children will not be protected with health insurance. Those are the pillars of the Senate Democratic plan for stimulus: That we help those who have just been laid off, who are facing a difficult time.  We also provide tax rebates for 45 million low-income taxpayers who received no rebate earlier this year. People pay payroll taxes, pay into the Social Security trust fund. This time around, we believe they should receive some tax assistance.  We have business tax cuts, as well--a 10-percent bonus appreciation. I heard from businesses across Illinois: Give us some help in depreciating some of the things we purchase and we will purchase more. That can move the economy forward. It is a sensible plan.  We want to extend unemployment benefits an additional 13 weeks in all 50 States. This is not a radical suggestion. This is the course followed by President Bush's father. In the teeth of a recession, he said: We have to stand by the people who have lost their jobs. In America we have 7.5 million Americans who are out of work. We ought to stand by them and any laid off in the near future. We need to expand coverage to the people who do not receive unemployment insurance today.  We also know when it comes to this health insurance, unless we help people buy health insurance once they have lost a job, they will have none; they are not likely to do so. Just do the math. The average unemployment check is $230 a week; the average payment for private health insurance when you have lost your job is $588 a month. It just does not work.  We have quite a contrast between the Republican approach of getting this economy moving forward and the Democratic approach. The Republican approach embodies tax cuts for the wealthy and profitable corporations and nothing for homeland security. I hope I get a moment to get to this issue.  When it comes to tax cuts for the wealthy, by speeding up the rate cuts, the Republican plan would give a new $16,000-a-year tax break to the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans. Those are people making over $1 million a year, receiving $16,000 from the Republican tax stimulus. What a stimulus that is: For citizens making $1 million a year, we want to give you $16,000 more. That is not going to put money back into the economy, not nearly as much as helping the economy by giving the money to the average working family, the middle-income family across America.  When we give every millionaire a check from the Treasury for $16,000, that is money being thrown away that could be used to deal with economic stimulus. That $16,000 goes right out of the Social Security trust fund. Payroll taxes paid by average workers into the Social Security trust fund are being spent to give a $16,000-a-year check to the wealthiest people in America--and to do it for 4 years under the Republican plan.  The Republican plan, in addition, with the accelerated tax cuts, costs $27 billion in 2002--next year--and increases to $121 billion over 10 years. Remember the advice we receive from people: Don't do anything that will hurt us in the long term. They are going to basically eat up any surplus we have in the future to give tax cuts to the wealthiest people in this country. That makes no sense at all.                          ____________________
