Speaker, a number of us have come to the floor today to remember a great American who passed away earlier this month. Hal Bruno made a real difference in people's lives, both by keeping them informed about our world and by serving as an advocate for firefighters and their families.  Hal was ABC News Political Director through the 1980's and 1990's, covering major national events and keeping Americans engaged with their government. He skillfully moderated the vice-presidential debate in 1992 after having covered presidential campaigns since Kennedy ran against Nixon. He had the respect and admiration of leaders from both parties.  As a journalist, Hal made a reputation for himself as a truth-teller, even when the truth was difficult. That began in Chicago, when as a young reporter he uncovered how poor safety standards in the building code had contributed to a fire that claimed 95 lives. He became a respected voice for fire safety, and that experience led him to become a volunteer firefighter himself, which he continued to do for decades.  After retiring from ABC News in 1999, Hal dedicated himself to serving our communities' firefighters and their families. He chaired the National Fallen Firefighters Foundation at a time when we lost so many brave first responders in the September 11 attacks. Hal was a champion for the families of firefighters who lost their lives in service to their communities, and he fought for and won the passage of legislation to provide them survivor benefits.  I know that Hal will be both dearly missed and dearly remembered by many in government, those who turned to him for their news for so many years, and by the families of firefighters on whose behalf he worked so tirelessly.  I join in remembering Hal and celebrating his life. I offer my condolences to his wife Meg and their children and grandchildren.                          ____________________
