Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to Southern California are exceptional. Southern California has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give time and talent to making their communities a better place to live and work. Bob Drake is one of these individuals. On January 8, 2003, Ben will be stepping down as President of the Temecula Valley Winegrower's Association after a year of dedicated service.  The Temecula Valley Winegrowers Association represents 17 wineries and 49 grower members in their efforts to promote the making and growing of quality wine and winegrapes in the Temecula Valley appellation located in Riverside County. During his year as president, Ben has shown exemplary leadership skills as he has guided the association through a period of dynamic growth, vital to the associations' representation and promotion as one of the world's premiere wine and winegrape producing regions.  Ben has represented the association on critical community and political matters, such as land use, beautification efforts, state shipping restrictions and continuing issues dealing with Pierce's Disease and the glass-winger sharpshooter. He has worked diligently to keep open lines of communication with our membership, regional vintner and grower groups and elected officials.  Ben has placed much of his energy and focus on enhancing the recognition of the region as one of quality through educating association members through monthly enology and viticulture seminars. He has made himself available for countless media interviews and community outreach programs. Because of his personal and intensive involvement with association fundraising activities, he is leaving the association in a position of strength and financial stability.  Ben's diligent work as the Temecula Valley Winegrower's Association has contributed unmeasurably to the betterment of Riverside County. His involvement in the community makes me proud to call him a fellow community member, American and friend. In know that all of the residents of Riverside County are grateful for his service and salute him as his term comes to an end. I look forward to working with him in the future for the good of our community.                          ____________________
