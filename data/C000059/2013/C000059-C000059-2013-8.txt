Chairman, again, we're not talking about a helicopter manufacturer that would suffer. It's the combat unit in Afghanistan that would be devastated and unable to fulfill its mission, and if it's not able to fulfill its mission, then we will not have a capable military to take over when the United States leaves in 2014.  I'm not going to defend Russia or their foreign policy and what they're doing in Syria, but we do want Afghanistan to succeed. So I reluctantly must oppose the gentlelady's amendment.  I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro).  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it.
