  I join all Americans in thanking the law enforcement officials who worked around the clock these past two days. It looks like they got their man, and we are grateful for their efforts on our behalf.  It is my understanding that the suspect, a naturalized American citizen, is a native of Pakistan and that he traveled there at some point in the past year. Hopefully the appropriate officials are using this opportunity to exploit as much intelligence as he may have about his overseas connections and any other plots against Americans either here or abroad.  But this is very good news, and again, we want to thank those who work so hard to keep us safe and to protect us from ongoing threats. As I said yesterday, this plot is a reminder to all of us of the need for constant vigilance and to never drop our guard.                           kentucky flooding  I would also like to say a word about the flooding in Kentucky.  Last night Governor Beshear said he would seek a major disaster declaration from the President to help recover from the devastation wrought by a round of weekend storms and collateral flooding, and I will be sending a letter to the President today in support of Kentucky's request for a major disaster declaration which would provide direct Federal logistical support and cost sharing assistance to mitigate the effects of the flooding.  Emergency declarations have been made in 48 counties throughout the Commonwealth, and that number is likely to increase as recovery efforts continue. Tragically, four people have been confirmed dead as a result of flooding in Madison, Barren, Allen, and Lincoln Counties.  My office has been in contact with the Governor's office, and we will do all we can to assist him. It is my understanding that Governor Beshear has spoken with the President about the situation and that FEMA is already working with State authorities in Kentucky to render assistance.  Our prayers are with the victims of the flooding in both the Commonwealth and in her sister State of Tennessee and our gratitude goes out to the first responders and emergency personnel rendering aid to the impacted communities.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
