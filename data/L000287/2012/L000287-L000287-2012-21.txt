I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend and my colleague from California for his commitment, for his dedication, with all of his kind words today.  I think this resolution is saying to all of us that we have come a distance. We've made a lot of progress, and the Members of Congress participated in helping to bring about what I like to call a nonviolent revolution in America, a revolution of values, a revolution of ideas.  It is unreal, it is unbelievable. Just think, a few short years ago, in a place like Selma, Alabama, or Lowndes County, Alabama, between Selma and Montgomery, Lowndes County was more than 80 percent African American. There was not a single registered African American voter in the county. Today there's a biracial county government.  That in a city like Selma, in 1965, only 2.1 percent of African Americans were registered to vote. Today there is a biracial city government.  Or in a State like the State of Mississippi, in 1965, the State had an African American population, voting age population, of more than 450,000, and only about 16,000 were registered to vote. Because of the action of Presidents and Members of Congress, we have changed, and it's my hope and my prayer that every Member of Congress will vote to pass this resolution.  With that, I yield back the balance of my time.
