 That is why, when it became apparent 20 years ago that the U.S. Army's Chemical Depot in Umatilla, OR, would be closing once all the chemical weapons were destroyed, the community leaders gathered all the stakeholders and began the process of planning what to do with the land once the facility closed. The Umatilla Depot straddles two counties, several cities, and historic tribal lands, so there are a lot of folks in my home State who are interested in what happens to the land.  As progress was made in destroying the weapons at Umatilla, the community built common ground and found a genuine consensus. The Federal Government would support it. It gave more than $1 million in assistance. When the facility was listed in the 2005 BRAC recommendations for closure, the Pentagon eventually recognized the group of stakeholders as an official Local Reuse Authority.  Everything appeared on track until last month. That was when, at the eleventh hour, the Pentagon changed the rules. After decades of planning and $1 million in preparation, a lawyer at the Pentagon decided to reinterpret the law and declared that the 2005 BRAC report--which became law when Congress didn't pass a resolution of disapproval--didn't matter. That lawyer decided that the Umatilla Depot would be closed outside of the BRAC authority because the last of the chemical weapons wouldn't be destroyed until after the 6-year limit for completion of BRAC actions. What this lawyer either didn't know or somehow missed is that this was precisely the intention of the BRAC Commission when they put the Umatilla Depot on the closure list.  The BRAC report discusses the fact that the mission of destroying the chemical weapons wouldn't be completed until after the deadline. On page 239 of the report, the Commission found that Secretary Rumsfeld's assertion that the chemical demilitarization mission at Umatilla would be complete by the second quarter of this year was optimistic. The Commission wrote:       An examination of status information for the depot's      mission completion and subsequent closure revealed that dates      may slip beyond the 6-year statutory period for completion of      the BRAC actions.  Therefore, the Commission took the Secretary of Defense's recommendation ``Close Umatilla Chemical Depot, OR'' and changed it to ``On completion of the chemical demilitarization mission in accordance with treaty obligations, close Umatilla Chemical Depot, OR.''  These facts make it clear the Commission did not--as the Pentagon has claimed recently--make a conditional recommendation that the facility only be closed if the chemical demilitarization mission is completed by September of 2011. Rather, the Commission acknowledged that the closure will have to happen when the demilitarization mission is completed even if that is after September of 2011. That decision by the Commission became law.  It is also important to note that the Commission is aware that the demilitarization mission had a deadline of its own. Under the terms of the Chemical Weapons Convention Treaty, Umatilla must complete the mission by April 29, 2012.  UMCD will meet this deadline, if not beat it. The Commission was not giving authority for the mission at UMCD to be one of a never-ending nature. They were simply giving UMCD the additional 8 months provided under the Chemical Weapons Convention.  The depot should be closed under BRAC so the will of the community, in the form of the local reuse authority, and the will of Congress in the BRAC law will be taken into account.  I strongly believe the local community should decide what to do with the land and not somebody who is off in the basement of the Pentagon.  I have spoken with Secretary Panetta about this matter, and he is fully supportive of our efforts.  I wish to also thank Senator Johnson and my good friend from Arizona, Senator McCain, who have also been very helpful--and their staff--in working with us. The Pentagon has to implement the law as it is, not, in my view, as it wants. But since the lawyers at the Pentagon have in recent weeks thought there was some ambiguity, I wished to clarify it for them with the amendment that has been modified with the good counsel of the staff of Senator McCain.  Let me also say, the staff of Senator McCain has been very helpful in saying this would be permissive authority in terms of the Pentagon and that the Senator could join me in a letter making it clear it is important this be moved expeditiously. I hope we can complete this matter at this time.  My amendment, which I offer on behalf of myself and my colleague, Senator Merkley, would allow the Pentagon to follow the BRAC commission's report and close the Umatilla Depot under BRAC.  With that, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The Senator from Arizona.  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, first of all, I wish to thank the Senator from Oregon. This is an issue that needs to be resolved, and it has been a pleasure working with him on not only the behalf of the people of Oregon but also on behalf of the Department of Defense.                           Amendment No. 564  Mr. President, I join the Senator from Oklahoma in supporting the amendment which Senator Coburn had intended to propose. The amendment would have amended Public Law 102-4, the Agent Orange Act of 1991, which I cosponsored, to provide clarity on the factual basis required for the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to make future determinations on the presumption of connection of military service in Vietnam with diseases associated with exposure to the herbicide commonly known as Agent Orange.  Agent Orange was unanticipated and certainly not something that at the time, given the scientific knowledge and information we had, was thought would be detrimental to the health of the men and women who were serving in the Vietnam war. But the fact is, Agent Orange did have a very serious health effect on the men and women who were serving and those who came in contact with it. For years, we delayed compensating our veterans, those who were exposed to Agent Orange.  In 1991, the act was a long overdue answer to questions on the health effects of exposure to Agent Orange, and it directed much deserved compensation to our veterans for certain diseases, including non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and certain cancers.  What has happened, and the reason why I appreciate the Senator fromOklahoma raising this issue, is it has obviously now reached a point where the Secretary of Veterans Affairs has now expanded the eligibility to the point where it is beyond any scientific evidence that compensation would be required.  In 2006, it was found that the evidence linking ischemic heart disease to exposure to herbicides was inadequate or insufficient. Heart disease, as we all know, is the leading cause of death in America today and has been so for decades.  In 2008, they updated their findings based on two epidemiological studies which provided ``statistical'' evidence of a relationship. Still, they categorized the link between ischemic heart disease and exposure to Agent Orange as ``limited or suggestive evidence of an association.'' That already low standard was further qualified with the following statement:       Epidemiologic evidence suggests an association--  Suggests an association--     between exposure to herbicides and the outcome, but a firm      conclusion is limited because chance, bias and confounding      could not be ruled out with confidence.  Despite this doubt, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs decided to grant a new presumption for ischemic heart disease, which according to the Department of Veterans Affairs will cost nearly $31.9 billion over the next 10 years. Similarly, with Parkinson's disease, which was also found to be in the category of ``limited or suggestive evidence,'' a decision was made to grant compensation and benefits based on exposure to Agent Orange, which according to the VA will cost $3.5 billion over the next 10 years.  This process is a risky, hit or miss, and costly way to administer the veterans disability program and resources, which are in scarce supply and which our veterans need and deserve in return for their sacrifice to our Nation.  In its report to the congressionally mandated Veterans' Disability Benefits Commission in 2007, the Institute of Medicine itself found that the ``association'' standard contained in the Agent Orange Act was inadequate and potentially misleading. That report recommended the goal of the presumptive disability decisionmaking process be to ensure compensation for veterans whose diseases are caused by military service and a new primary standard that sufficient evidence to support a determination of presumption would exist when evidence is sufficient to conclude that a causal relationship exists.  The Veterans' Disability Benefits Commission endorsed the need for establishing a new framework for presumptions with more transparent processes, but it failed to take the full step of embracing causality in decisionmaking.  The amendment my colleague from Oklahoma so bravely intended to offer would have achieved the goal identified by the Institute of Medicine to ensure that scientifically based causality is at the heart of the disability determination process.  My vote in favor of the Agent Orange Act of 1991 was a vote to discern facts from rhetoric and even politics and to put the welfare of our veterans above all other considerations, including costs. My support of the Coburn amendment would be no different. It is appropriate to adopt a clearer, stronger standard for the presumption of service-connected disabilities to ensure greater consistency in this process and, in doing so, to help ensure that our Nation's resources are available to provide appropriate compensation and benefits for veterans of wars to come.  Former Secretary of Veterans Affairs, the Honorable Tony Principi, before the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, on September 23, 2010, on this very subject--the subject of presumptive disability decisionmaking--said:       Make no mistake: these decisions do not merely affect those      who may or may not receive presumptive service connections      and their families. The American people watch these decisions      closely, both to ensure that those who have defended our      Nation while in uniform are treated fairly, and to ensure      that those who have been given the responsibility to      administer the program are good stewards of the resources      with which they have been entrusted. If the American people      lose faith in the integrity of our disability benefits      system, veterans and their families will be the ones who      suffer. The surest way for that to happen is for the public      to be convinced that presumptive service connection decisions      are based on anything other than sound scientific advice.  There is no sound scientific advice that indicates that many of these decisions are valid and directly connected to exposure to Agent Orange. I urge the chairman of the committee to look into this issue. We are talking about $31.9 billion and another $3.5 billion which may not be necessary to be spent.  I believe and understand the emotion associated with the issue of Agent Orange because for so many years our Nation neglected--that was not benign neglect, it was neglect--the plight of veterans who were exposed to Agent Orange and the terrible physical problems that ensued as a result of that exposure. But now it is pretty clear that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs has gone way over in the opposite direction in giving presumptive service connection when there is no valid scientific evidence to convince me that kind of illegibility is there.  So I thank my colleague from Oklahoma.  I urge the Senator, the distinguished chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, to look at this issue, look at whether this $31.9 billion, plus $3.5 billion--over $35 billion--over the next 10 years is wisely spent. That does not mean we do not provide disability payments to those who actually have been exposed and need it. But there is a lack of scientific evidence that many of the benefits that are being extended are absolutely warranted.  So I know the Senator from Oklahoma will not be proposing this amendment, and I understand that. But I wish to assure the committee chairman that when we are talking about this kind of money, we need to investigate it very seriously and reach decisions which are in the best interests of our veterans. There are veterans out there who need compensation, and every day, unfortunately, we are having young men and women return from the battlefield who have disabilities as a result of serving our Nation in combat. So I hope the chairman of the committee will look at this issue very seriously.  I yield the floor.
