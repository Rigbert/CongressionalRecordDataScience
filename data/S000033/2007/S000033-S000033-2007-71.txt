 President, the State of Vermont has lost one of its greatest scholars, Raul Hilberg. I wish to honor this remarkable man, the central figure in the founding and establishment of Holocaust studies, not just in the United States, but in the world. It is fitting that he was also a central contributor to the establishment and development of the U.S. Holocaust Museum.  So horrific were the events of the Holocaust that for many years scholars avoided the subject. Not Raul Hilberg. Born in Vienna, Austria, he and his family fled the Anschluss of Hitler and the Nazis to emigrate, first to Cuba, and ultimately to the United States. While in Cuba, he saw the fate of the S.S. St. Louis, a ship full of Jews who had fled Germany seeking asylum. The ship was denied permission to land in Havana, and only after a long voyage from port to port were its 936 Jewish passengers finally allowed to disembark in several European countries.  In the United States, Hilberg served in the Infantry of the U.S. Army. Upon his return to this country he did graduate work at Columbia University, where he received a Ph.D. under the tutelage of Franz Neumann. His doctoral thesis was on the Holocaust: he took careful and copious notes on Nazi documents seized by the U.S. Army, transcribing the information he uncovered on index cards. Then he sat at a small table in his parents' apartment and wrote his thesis on the basis of those cards. That thesis was the kernel of the greatest scholarly work ever written on the Holocaust.  In 1956, Raul Hilberg became an assistant professor of political science at the University of Vermont. He later became professor and chairman of that department. He remained at U.V.M. for the rest of his career until his retirement in 1991, despite many enticements to go to major research universities, sustained in his academic life by his friends Jay Gould, Stan Staron, and Sam Bogorad. He was a great teacher. One of his colleagues remembers attending his course on the Holocaust: ``His words came out in perfectly structured paragraphs, eloquent with a quiet gravity, so compelling that every student in the class was transfixed from the moment Raul began speaking until the bell rang for the end of class.''  In 1961, Raul Hilberg's magisterial ``The Destruction of the European Jews'' was published, but only after rejections from many publishers. Even Yad Vashem rejected the manuscript because some scholars disagreed with Hilberg's perspective. Thereafter revised and updated in succeeding editions, the book was then, and has remained, the most important, the most seminal, work on the Holocaust. It, more than any other scholarly work, was responsible for the creation of what we know today as the field of Holocaust Studies.  The great documentary filmmaker, Claude Lanzmann, spoke recently of his discovery of Hilberg's book, which occurred as he was considering making the film that was to become ``Shoah.'' ``It took me months to get through this formidable, magnificent, monstrous book. Hilberg was a man of details, and that is what I especially liked. The first time he appears in ``Shoah'' he says, `All along, during my work, I never began with the big questions because I feared inadequate answers.''' Lanzmann continues, ``He laid bare the implacable mechanism of what he held to be a bureaucratic process of destruction. From the moment the German bureaucracy made its object, it could only go all the way, as through carried by its own logic.''  Hilberg published other important books, among them ``Perpetrators, Victims, Bystanders'' and a memoir, ``The Politics of Memory.'' He edited ``The Warsaw Diaries of Adam Czerniakov,'' which was translated by his colleague, Stanislaw Staron.  But he was not just a scholar in an archive. As one of the Senate's representatives on the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council, I am very aware of his work in the public sphere, work which richly supplemented his great contributions as an academic scholar. An original member of the President's Commission on the Holocaust, Raul Hilberg, played a central role in the founding of the U.S. Holocaust Museum. He then served on the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council from 1980 through 1988, and further served on the Museum's Academic Committee from its inception through 2005.  His friend, Michael Berenbaum recently wrote this about his involvement with our Nation's great memorial to the ``Shoah'': ``For his work with the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, Hilberg never once accepted remuneration, even when others were paid for their work. He was a consistent, gracious and insisting presence demanding the highest of standards of others and measuring up to them himself.'' In his honor, the museum has established the Raul Hilberg Scholarship.  For his great scholarly and public accomplishments, Raul Hilberg was named a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2005.  An enthralling and inspiring teacher, Raul Hilberg will be missed by many generations of students at the University of Vermont. The absence of his deep knowledge and unsparing honesty leaves the world of Holocaust studies bereft of its presiding genius. And his passing leaves a great loss in the lives of his wife, Gwendolyn and his children, David and Deborah.  Raul Hilberg's work, however, which so carefully details the bureaucracy of annihilation, will live on to serve as a constant reminder of the responsibilities that we have, as citizens and as individuals, for the sufferings of others.                          ____________________
