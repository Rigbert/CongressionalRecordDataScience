Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the Senate bill (S. 1998) to amend title 18, United States Code, to enhance protections relating to the reputation and meaning of the Medal of Honor and other military decorations and awards, and for other purposes.  The Clerk read as follows:                                S. 1998       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Stolen Valor Act of 2005''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Fraudulent claims surrounding the receipt of the Medal      of Honor, the distinguished-service cross, the Navy cross,      the Air Force cross, the Purple Heart, and other decorations      and medals awarded by the President or the Armed Forces of      the United States damage the reputation and meaning of such      decorations and medals.       (2) Federal law enforcement officers have limited ability      to prosecute fraudulent claims of receipt of military      decorations and medals.       (3) Legislative action is necessary to permit law      enforcement officers to protect the reputation and meaning of      military decorations and medals.     SEC. 3.
