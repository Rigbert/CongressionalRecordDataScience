 President, I rise in support of the amendment offered by the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Bingaman. This is a very important amendment that he has offered. Certainly, as we are talking about what the future of our country is going to be, we should be looking at what we are doing to invest in our young children today so they can be economically viable when they graduate from high school and college 15, 20 years from now, making sure that we have the money there for the Head Start Program, Pell grants, early childhood education.  These are important investments in our children, and if we follow through on a massive tax cut at this time, as the Senator from New Mexico has said, in the future we will not have the money to make sure that our kids get the kind of education they need to be viable members of our community. This is a very important amendment.  As we come to the end of this debate about what we are going to do to invest in our future, let's remember that if we put in place a tax cut such as this, we will harm our young children, we will harm Social Security and Medicare and critical programs for women in this country to make sure they don't live in poverty. We will not be able to pay off our debt, a very important issue that is facing us, which we have not left ourselves room for with a massive tax cut of this size.  Most critically, we will not be able to do what we have a responsibility to do, not only as Senators but as parents and as adults in this country, to make sure that those who follow us have the skills they need to make sure this country continues to run well in the future. Investment in Pell grants and in early childhood education, and investment in education, class size reduction, and training of our teachers will make a difference for the future. We have a responsibility to do that.  I thank the Senator from New Mexico for his work on education, and I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.  I thank the Chair.
