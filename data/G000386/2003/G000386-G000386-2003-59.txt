 President, for the leader, I would like to give what is referred to daily as the closing script, if I may.  I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 9 a.m., Monday, November 24. I further ask that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and the Senate then resume consideration of the conference report to accompany H.R. 1, the Medicare modernization bill, provided that the time until 12:30 p.m. be equally divided between the chairman of the Finance Committee or his designee and the minority leader or his designee. I further ask unanimous consent that the cloture vote on the conference report begin at 12:30 p.m. Finally, I ask that the last 10 minutes prior to the vote be allocated to the Democratic leader for 5 minutes, to be followed by the majority leader for 5 minutes.
