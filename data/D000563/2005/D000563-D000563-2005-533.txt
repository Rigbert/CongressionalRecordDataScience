President, I will be very brief.  Understand what this amendment says: No bridge in the highway bill can be built until this bridge in Louisiana is built from non-emergency funds, financed from non-emergency funds. If they take any part of the $60 billion that we have already put in FEMA to put into construction of this bridge, it doesn't count. It has to be nonemergency funds.  So understand that it is slowing down the construction of bridges everywhere until we appropriate more money for financing this bridge in Louisiana.  I yield the floor.
