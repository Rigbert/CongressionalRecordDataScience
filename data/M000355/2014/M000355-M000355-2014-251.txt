 President, I rise today with a heavy heart to report some sad news to my colleagues. John James McGinty III--raised in my hometown of Louisville, KY--succumbed to bone cancer on Friday, January 17, after 73 years of life. Although his wife Elaine passed in 1991, he is survived by his sons Michael and John IV. Mr. McGinty was a veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps who received the Medal of Honor for his exemplary record of valor in the Vietnam War. Our country owes him, as we do all of our veterans, an unimaginable debt of gratitude for his service.  John J. McGinty III was born to John and Eve McGinty on January 21, 1940, in Boston, MA. The family soon moved to Louisville, where John completed grammar school and began high school. The call to serve his country, however, rang more loudly and clearly than the school bell. After a year and a half, he dropped out and enlisted in the Marine Corps Reserves in February 1957.  John enlisted in the regular Marine Corps the following year. He served as a drill instructor and a brig officer until 1966, when he volunteered for duty in Vietnam. In June of that year he took part in Operation Hastings, during which his service to his country would extend above and beyond the typical call of duty. Three days into the operation, McGinty's company, reduced to a strength of 100 men, was ordered to withdraw. On July 18, Sergeant McGinty's platoon was providing rear security for the withdrawal when they were attacked by what was estimated to be 1,000 North Vietnamese soldiers.  Amidst the chaos of the attack, two squads from his platoon were cut off and nearly surrounded. Sergeant McGinty rushed through the jungle under a hail of gunfire to find his men in dire straits--20 were wounded and their medical corpsman had been killed. Showing little regard for his own shrapnel wounds to his leg, back, and left eye, Sergeant McGinty reloaded the wounded men's weapons and, according to his Medal of Honor citation, ``directed their fire upon the enemy.'' When the attackers inched closer and closer to his men, Sergeant McGinty drew his .45-caliber pistol and killed five enemy soldiers at point-blank range. Then, with enemies at all sides and still taking heavy gunfire, he accurately called in naval airstrikes to within 50 yards of his position.  His actions that day were consistent with the highest traditions of the United States Marine Corps, and at a White House ceremony on March 12, 1968, President Lyndon Johnson bestowed upon then-Second Lieutenant McGinty the Medal of Honor.  Although he retired from the Marine Corps as a captain in 1976, Mr. McGinty continued to work to better the lives of America's service men and women. He worked for the Department of Veterans Affairs in various capacities, and along with fellow veterans, made several trips to Iraq and Afghanistan to visit with American troops. He would, however, stop wearing his Medal of Honor after becoming a born-again Christian in the early 1980s. His son Michael McGinty explains, ``He didn't have a problem with the honor.'' Rather, it was the medal's depiction of the Roman goddess Minerva that ran contrary to his deeply held belief that the reason he was still alive is the one true God.  Captain McGinty was modest about his own heroic actions. His son Michael has said, ``My father used to say that he did what any Marine sergeant would have done in that situation.'' There can be no doubt, with his record of valor, however, that CAPT John James McGinty III is indeed a hero, and America has lost a hero with his passing. John's service to his country, both as a U.S. Marine and as a private citizen, is deserving of the highest praise and respect of this body. Thus, I ask my U.S. Senate colleagues to join me in honoring and mourning this fallen soldier with roots in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. All Kentuckians, and all Americans, should be honored that he fought to protect us, and grateful for his service and sacrifice.                          ____________________
