Speaker, on March 8, 2012, I was absent from the House and missed rollcall votes 107 through 110.  Had I been present for rollcall 107, on agreeing to the Peters amendment to H.R. 3606, to increase American job creation and economic growth by improving access to the public capital markets for emerging growth companies, I would have voted ``aye.''  Had I been present for rollcall 108, on agreeing to the Capps amendment to H.R. 3606, to increase American job creation and economic growth by improving access to the public capital markets for emerging growth companies, I would have voted ``aye.''  Had I been present for rollcall 109, on the motion to recommit with instructions H.R. 3606, to increase American job creation and economic growth by improving access to the public capital markets for emerging growth companies, I would have voted ``aye.''  Had I been present for rollcall 110, on passage of H.R. 3606, to increase American job creation and economic growth by improving access to the public capital markets for emerging growth companies, I would have voted ``aye.''              Authorizing the Clerk to Correct Engrossment
