 Mr. Manager McCOLLUM. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.  The attachments to Mr. Holmes' declaration is the proof of the subpoena being issued to Betty Currie in January, on January 22, 1998, along with service in the Jones case on January 27, 1998, and a copy of the supplemental witness list, including the name of Betty Currie, which was served on January 23, 1998. And in his declaration, Mr. Holmes explains that Ms. Currie was subpoenaed because of testimony given by President Clinton in his deposition and because of reliable information which the attorneys had received to this effect--that Ms. Currie was an instrumental person in facilitating Monica Lewinsky's meetings with the President and central to their ``cover story,'' as Mr. Holmes refers to it. He explicitly denies that any ``Washington Post'' article played any part in the decision of the Jones attorneys to subpoena Ms. Currie.  And in the third and final piece of new evidence that we ask you to take in and accept is a declaration and accompanying documents with regard to a telephone conversation showing that a conversation occurred on December 6 for 56 minutes between the President and Ms. Lewinsky, which we believe that is what it shows. Obviously, the phone records show the phone records. And they state what they are. But we suggest to you that that is relevant information because it confirms what we think the testimony in the record otherwise would lead you to believe.  At this point in time, having given you an overview and having given you this amount of new evidence, I want to turn the microphone over and yield to my colleague, Mr. Bryant, the rest of the time.  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes Mr. Manager Bryant.  Mr. Manager BRYANT. Mr. Chief Justice, may I inquire as to our time remaining?  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Just under 90 minutes.  Mr. Manager BRYANT. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.  Distinguished Senators, a recent letter from Manager Hyde to Senator Daschle stated that it has always been the position of the House managersthat a trial with the benefit of relevant witnesses is in the best interest of the Senate and the American people. The defense attorneys for the President, as well as others in this body, have publicly stated that they do not want witnesses.  Through the question-and-answer session that we have just participated in over the last few days, some in this body have made it clear that they would prefer a few sharply focused witnesses limited only to the most relevant witnesses. We heard this. And as a result of our submission this morning, you will see that we have proposed three witnesses.  Now, as background, we have brought this down from some 15 witnesses that we initially thought we would like to call. We eliminated, obviously, many witnesses that we would still like to call. But with respect for this body, and certainly the sensitivity that we feel, we heard that three witnesses would be probably the best situation.  I think from, again, the tone of the questions, the directness of many of the questions, we did get that message clearly. And from these three witnesses we feel that we have the broadest coverage of the two articles of impeachment.  Within the obstruction article, there are in essence seven so-called counts, seven instances that we allege. And with these three witnesses, we managed to cover six of those seven, with the one that we don't quite cover being the tampering with Betty Currie. As you will note she is not on that list. But, again, bringing this down to three, we had to eliminate, again, some witnesses we would have preferred to call.  Also, based on what we have read and what we have heard, it is clear that a very few have already determined that even assuming the truth of the articles of impeachment--the perjury and obstruction of justice--that they are insufficient to convict this President of high crimes and misdemeanors. Since each of you, as Senators, must consider this matter and vote your own conscience with impartial justice, that is apparently your individual decision, although with all due respect, I would suggest a premature decision before all the proof and all the arguments are made.  One example of not having heard a complete case is Ms. Lewinsky. She is probably the most relevant witness, that is, aside from the President himself who so far has indicated through his counsel that he will not testify; and I might add also has not answered the questions that at least some Senators sent to the White House for his answering, based on his attorney's statement that he would be willing to answer questions.  So with that aside, Ms. Lewinsky is probably the most important witness left. And wouldn't you at least like to see and hear from her on this? As the triers of fact, wouldn't you want to observe the demeanor of Ms. Lewinsky and test her credibility--as I say, look into the eyes and test the credibility of these witnesses? Compare her version of the testimony to the contested events. And remember, the President's attorneys, in numerous ways, in their vigorous defense of the President, have challenged Ms. Lewinsky's version of the facts.  I believe the majority of other Senators have not yet reached a final determination, and it is to you now that I make this further proposition. If there is one witness you and the American people honestly do need to hear, it is Ms. Lewinsky. As you probably read in the newspapers, her lawyers don't want her to testify. They are good lawyers, and they don't want to have her out here.  And despite the protestations of the White House and their attorneys during the House hearings that they wanted to hear fact witnesses, we now know absolutely and without a doubt the White House does not want to hear Ms. Lewinsky--does not want you to hear Ms. Lewinsky. And Ms. Lewinsky, if the truth be known, probably does not want to come in here and testify.  These are not our witnesses. We didn't get this case in a brown envelope. We sort of didn't have any choice in selecting the witnesses. The witnesses are all out there--basically White House employees, friends of the White House, or former employees. These are not going to be our friends if they come in and testify. They are not going to be sympathetic to us, although we can anticipate that they would tell the truth. And that certainly would be our belief with Ms. Lewinsky if she were called.  We believe she understands her responsibility, despite any feelings that she might have about the President, or the job that he is doing as President, that she understands the responsibility to tell the truth.  And Senators, she does have a story to tell. And given the link that she has, that common thread that she has in most of the charges of these articles of impeachment, I would suggest that she should be permitted to testify.  I would go further to say that a closure of this case is somehow necessary, and without the direct presentation by Ms. Lewinsky, we all--political and public--would be denied the complete picture that she should be able to give us to better sort this out. As Manager Graham said yesterday, please don't leave us all hanging for the answers we so dearly need.  Is this good, is it bad or is it ugly? We managers believe that it is bad, ugly and illegal. We all like to talk about the Constitution, and it is a great document. The opportunity to confront witnesses is present in that Constitution, and it can be argued that this principle of confrontation of witnesses against you should apply to these proceedings. While we realize that confrontational right is one that belongs to the criminal defendant in the Constitution, in this case apparently any right to confront Ms. Lewinsky and other witnesses is being waived by the President and his lawyers since they don't want to call witnesses in these proceedings.  Isn't it time, though, for the rest of us to make that choice that we do want to see and hear some witnesses? Her testimony, in particular, would be extraordinarily enlightening in resolving factual disputes about the very charges for which we ask you to convict the President of the United States for the felonies of perjury and obstruction of justice. These particular charges go to the very heart of our cobranch of government, the Judiciary. And Members of the Senate, in terms of the impact on our judicial system in the search for truth, there is no difference between a person lying, which is perjury, and a person paying another person to lie, which is bribery. The bribery is in the Constitution and the perjury is not specifically mentioned.  In terms of this proposition of proportionality, is the 106th Senate prepared to have as its record of sexual harassment laws that perjury about sex is not illegal? After all, that is what this whole proportionality argument is about, that if it is about sex it is OK to lie. Because Senator Bumpers said that upwards of 80 percent of his divorce cases from his Arkansas practice of law involve lying, that does not legitimize perjury, nor should it provide any authority for this Senate to somehow legitimize perjury if it is just about sex.  We allege that the President, in a reasoned and in a calculated manner, prevented Paula Jones from obtaining truthful testimony and evidence that might have helped her lawsuit. At the time the President attempted his coverup efforts, he, obviously, felt the disclosure of that information in the Paula Jones case would be material and helpful to her. The President not only committed himself to illegal actions, but he enlisted others to assist, some knowingly, and others, perhaps, unknowingly.  Ms. Lewinsky is one of these who, interestingly enough, might fit into both categories of knowing and unknowingly at different times. She would be able to share with this Senate the so-called tone and tenor of her conversations with the President. Who else can do that but she or the President?  This tone and tenor and observing her demeanor and listening to her talk about that filing of the affidavit and those things, and how the President talked to her and how she read what he said and exactly what he did say, these are all very important, because as we know in Washington, and so many other places where there is a lot of power and prestige and so forth, there are actions that can be prompted without even a direct specific order. Things can get done even without it being said just by the tone and tenor, the gestures, the appearance and so forth ofcertain things. Often these direct words, as I said, are not necessary. And Ms. Lewinsky can tell you about some of these occasions.  An appropriate examination--and an appropriate cross-examination, I might add; let's don't limit the White House attorneys here--of Ms. Lewinsky on the factual disputes of the affidavit and their cover story, wouldn't that be nice to hear? The concealment of gifts--what really happened there and the job search--why did she get the job within 48 hours of the affidavit, after months of unsuccess? Wouldn't it be nice to hear Ms. Lewinsky's version of this when it is so important to the overall case of obstruction of justice?  These are just a few examples where the Senate could be helped by her testimony, and it very well could be dispositive, and it is even possible that she could help the President in some ways. But I assure you that she is an impressive young lady, and I suspect that she still very much does admire the President and the work that he is doing for this country. Yet, she would be a person who in all likelihood would be forthcoming.  If you have not made up your mind, and, indeed, if you have further interest in resolving many of the facts here, I do commend Ms. Lewinsky for your consideration. It would be my intent to lead her through direct examination, the perjury charge, as it is alleged with the President, by having her simply affirm those provisions of her written testimony which are the ones that are generally referred to as salacious, without specifically mentioning those words.  On the more complicated obstruction of justice, the pattern of obstruction of justice which does not involve these salacious details and matters, they will be addressed more specifically. It would be my intent for immediate clarification and to dissolve discrepancies and different inferences that have been drawn by House managers and defense counsel for the President, to ask her about the December 28 transfer of Ms. Lewinsky's gifts from the President--transfer to Ms. Currie, particularly the cellular telephone call that has been put into issue by the defense team, about her conversation with the President and her offer to allow him to review this false affidavit before she submitted it to her lawyer and eventually to the court, and his comment that he didn't need to review it because he had seen 15 others just like it. Wouldn't you like to know what are we talking about--15 others? Fifteen drafts or 15 other type of affidavits in other cases?  She would also be asked about her job interviews and her discussions with the President about these job interviews over a period of time, which are very important, her discussions with Vernon Jordan, and specifically why she felt that the interview that she did with Revlon the day after she signed the affidavit, her impression that it went poorly, whereas we heard--not testimony, but statements in the presentation of White House lawyers that, in fact, it didn't go poorly, it went very well, but she felt it went so poorly that she went immediately out to call Vernon Jordan. Why? Why not hear her come in and tell us why she did that?  There will, of course, be other matters of record that she can clarify, and certainly being available to the White House defense team she will be vigorously cross-examined. I am sure that might also clarify other matters.  It is my feeling that a fair and comprehensive examination without interruption could be conducted of Ms. Lewinsky in 2 to 4 hours, and depending on the length of cross-examination by White House attorneys, we may not need any redirect examination.  While defense counsel for the President and others for the President--I heard it so many times, I am not sure exactly who said this so I don't want to attribute to defense counsel, and maybe they haven't even said it, but there has been word out of the White House that if we call one witness, we might as well settle into a siege here in the Senate; we will be here for months and months and months. I suggest that is an outrageous statement, that we will need that amount of time to pursue this case if witnesses are called.  We are confident that that, basically in its best case, is an attempt to discourage you from calling witnesses; and in its worst case, unfortunately, is a veiled threat that they will be dilatory and drag this out for months and months if the Senate would allow.  House managers are establishing a good-faith effort to cut our witnesses, as I said, down to three people, and to commit to reasonable times of examination with the assurance that we will finish this as quickly as we can and we will hope and perhaps the Senate their defense team.  Witnesses can be called and a fair trial could be accomplished if all concerned would agree. Would the Senate consider requesting the President's defense team to also select 3 or fewer witnesses in an effort to move this process along? And we think, too, that the depositions, while they are important, if they are solely for the purpose of discovery, I ask, why would the White House need to discover what Vernon Jordan has to say, what Betty Currie has to say, or Sidney Blumenthal, or John Podesta--any of these witnesses? They would have to take Monica Lewinsky's deposition, but any other discovery deposition, it seems to me, they have complete access to already.  As I close, I want to leave you with some words that have been of some comfort to me, and I think we have all needed some comfort at times during these proceedings. It is a very short quote of the opening remarks of Judiciary Committee Chairman Peter Rodino in 1974. Again, in part, he says:       We know that the very real security of this Nation lies in      the integrity of its institutions and the informed confidence      of its people.  He talked about the Nixon hearings.       We will conduct our deliberations in that spirit. It has      been said that our country, troubled by too many crises in      recent years, is too tired to consider this one. In the first      year of the Republic, Thomas Paine wrote, ``Those who expect      to reap the blessings of freedom must, like men, undergo the      fatigue of supporting it.''  Back to Rodino:       Now for almost 200 years, Americans have undergone the      stress of preserving their freedom and the Constitution that      protects it. It is now our turn.  Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, I respectfully ask you to permit the House managers to call these 3 named witnesses and add this additional evidence. I thank you. I yield to Mr. Manager Hutchinson.  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes Mr. Manager Hutchinson.  Mr. Manager HUTCHINSON. Mr. Chief Justice, ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, my responsibility is to address the testimony of Vernon Jordan and the need to call him as a witness in this case.  Before I go into the details of that, let me just reflect for a moment on the Senate trial process. I said many days ago that I had confidence in the United States Senate, and I thought that at this particular juncture it might be good if I reassured you that I still had confidence in the United States Senate. When I think about the trial process that we are going through, I have to compliment you on the fact that you have structured a bipartisan process. I think that is important because you gave this process credibility. So you did the right thing, and I, for one, am pleased with what you were able to accomplish in that endeavor.  Now, whenever you achieve a bipartisan process, you have to make compromises along the way. And the result is a format that is not particularly helpful to the trial managers, the House managers, who wish to call witnesses. We have struggled through that. But notwithstanding the present difficulty, I still compliment you and thank you for what you have done in achieving that bipartisan consensus. I think back to that meeting that I had early on, and some other managers, with the bipartisan group of Senators from this body--and I now look at some from both sides of the aisle--and I went in there with this high-minded thought that we could make a case for witnesses because of what the other managers have described as the tone and demeanor of witnesses. Well, that was quickly brushed aside by them saying, ``No, no, no, we want to hear about what conflicts exist in the testimony; just tell us what the conflicts are because that is a strong case for calling witnesses.'' Well, that threw me back on my heels. So I went back and, as you know, in the question and answer session I addressed the question of conflicts. I think we did a good job of outlining the conflicts between various witnesses.  Well, then I was informed that, ``We really are not as interested in the conflicts because the conflicts exist in the current transcript. Therefore, really, we want to know what new information and what dynamic these witnesses can add.'' That threw me back for a curve. So we looked at this again and we tried to make a case.  I'm going to show you what new dynamics and questions can be asked. Ultimately, when you take the depositions, many of those questions are going to be answered. So you come back full circle to where we started in the beginning--that ultimately I hope witnesses are called so you can evaluate their credibility, determine their demeanor, and assess the truth in this case. I think that is important. I know people talk about me as being a former Federal prosecutor. Actually, at one time, I confess, I represented a defendant in a murder case. This gentleman was charged with murder, and the prosecution in Logan County, Arkansas --near Senator Bumpers' hometown--decided they wanted to handle one of the key witnesses by deposition, as that person was out of State. I objected and objected, because I thought that witness ought to be in the courtroom. The judge overruled me and said, ``You can go take the deposition and the defense counsel will be there to cross-examination.'' So we traipsed off to the other State and took this witness' deposition, and she made a lousy witness. I said she would not be believed for anything because of the way she appeared. Well, we brought the transcript back to the courtroom. The prosecution, over my objection, put the transcript into the record and, all of a sudden, that cold transcript was believable --particularly when they had it read by another witness that didn't look anything like the original lady. My client was convicted, but that case was reversed in the Arkansas supreme court because the court said it was important that the jury look into the eyes of the witness, see the demeanor of that witness and determine the credibility.  So ultimately, we come back to that same point--that somehow you are going to have to resolve the conflicts. I know of only one way to do it. We have tried to be extraordinarily helpful and cooperative with the United States Senate. I came in with this idea that we were going to present this case with 14 or 15 witnesses. Clearly, that is off the table. We have narrowed this down to 3 witnesses; that is tough to decide, but we believe that represents the basic heart of the obstruction of justice case and gets to at least 6 of the 7 elements, so that you can evaluate that. But we want to assist you, clearly, in getting to the truth, but also to bring this matter to a conclusion fairly and as expeditiously as possible.  Now, let's look to Mr. Vernon Jordan. Should he be called as a witness in this case? His testimony goes to the heart of one of the elements of obstruction of justice--that is, the job search and the false affidavit, and the interconnection between those. I have tried, during my presentation of this case, to present portions of his testimony--excerpts, if you will, from his testimony. But you will see that he has testified 5 times before the Federal grand jury. I have read all of this. I am not going to ask for a show of hands, but how many of you have read all of this? And so you have had to rely upon a trial--an ordeal by lawyers, rather than a trial by witnesses because I have had to present the testimony of Vernon Jordan in excerpt fashion with limited quotes here and there--as the defense counsel has done likewise. That makes it difficult because the problem is, one, you are hearing it from her, but, second, it is not a story, it is excerpts, and there is no way you can assess the truth because of that.  If you look at the times that Mr. Jordan has testified before the grand jury: March 3, 1998; March 5, 1998; May 28, and June 9; the last time he ever testified was June 9, 1998--let's look at what has happened since then, since Mr. Jordan last testified before the grand jury. I believe these charts are in front of you.  July 22, Ms. Currie testified before the grand jury. So any of the facts we gain from Ms. Currie were not utilized in the last examination of Vernon Jordan.  August 6, what happened on that date? Ms. Lewinsky testified before the grand jury and she revealed some new facts during that time that Mr. Jordan has never had an opportunity to explain, respond to, or answer. I will go into that. One of them is about disposing of notes. The second one is about drafting the affidavit. And, of course, by that time the DNA on the dress had been revealed.  Then the next thing that happened was the President's revelation to the Nation that this relationship did exist. And then he testified before the grand jury. All of the facts revealed from those instances were not revealed at the time Vernon Jordan last testified before the grand jury.  Obviously, any lawyer would understand there are naturally questions that arise from each of those incidents that could be posed to Mr. Jordan. Why has that not been done? Quite frankly, I have talked to, as I mentioned the other day, the attorney for Mr. Jordan. I have not talked to Mr. Jordan personally. I think that clearly the Senate does not want us to do that until we get past this next hurdle. But those are the things that need to be resolved.  Let me address briefly three areas of conflicts and testimony between Mr. Jordan and Ms. Lewinsky that point up other areas of questioning that would be appropriate that he should have the opportunity to explain.  I have been accused of being harsh to Mr. Jordan, and I don't mean to be that way. There have been certain things that have been stated by witnesses in this case that ought to be explained, that ought to be questioned of Mr. Jordan. But we need to have good answers to these questions. We need to know those answers.  The first conflict--I will get to that--is between Mr. Jordan's testimony and Ms. Lewinsky's testimony about whether Mr. Jordan knew the true nature of the relationship with the President.  In Mr. Jordan's testimony of May 28, he was asked a question, ``You're saying no one to your recollection ever suggested or alleged a sexual relationship prior to the 18th of January between Monica Lewinsky and the President.'' The answer: ``That is correct.''  That was on May 28. Ms. Lewinsky was asked the same series of questions months later--in August of 1998--and she indicated, she testified, ``And I remarked that I really didn't look at him as the President''--that, ``I saw him more as a man and reacted to him more as a man and got angry at him like a man and just a regular person. Mr. Jordan asked me what I got angry at the President about. So I told him when he doesn't call me enough or see me enough.''  Another statement:       And so after we had the conversation I was just talking      about with Mr. Jordan, he said to me, ``Well, you know what      your problem is,'' and I said, ``What?'' He said, ``Don't      deny it,'' and he said, ``You're in love. That's what your      problem is.''  This is Monica Lewinsky referring to what Mr. Jordan had said.  So clearly those are relevant questions that need to be readdressed to Mr. Jordan because they were raised by Ms. Lewinsky in subsequent testimony that have never been asked to him in that fashion.  There is a conflict in the testimony between Mr. Jordan and Ms. Lewinsky about whether the subpoena was discussed at the December 22 meeting. Mr. Jordan testified in March that, ``We did not talk about the subpoena. She wanted to know about her job. That was the purpose of her coming.'' And the question was, ``Anything beyond that?'' The answer was, ``No.''  And that is March 6 of 1998. Ms. Lewinsky testified contrary.  Let's turn our attention then to December 22, which is the day she met with Frank Carter. ``And I think you said you were going to meet with Mr. Jordan.'' Answer: ``So I came to see Mr. Jordan earlier, and I also wanted to find out if he had in fact told the President that I had been subpoenaed.''  That was her testimony which is in direct conflict--that the subpoena was discussed on the same day that she went to see Mr. Carter about the representation.  Where is the relevance in this?  If you recall, Mr. Jordan said it didn't take an Einstein to figure out that, whenever you combine whenever she got the subpoena, that it changed the circumstances.  Here you have three problems. You have a job search, you have a witnessin court, and if you combine that with the knowledge of a relationship, those are three dynamite issues combining together that should cause anyone--not just one change of circumstances but it elevates it to a higher level of danger because of the correlation between each of those three separate facts--each of these conflicts, and the testimony of Monica Lewinsky goes to those key fundamental issues. And Mr. Jordan has never been asked sufficiently about those areas.  The third conflict--this is key--is the testimony of Monica Lewinsky. Mr. Jordan testified that he never talked to Ms. Lewinsky about Linda Tripp. That is his March 5, 1998, testimony. But Ms. Lewinsky testifies in her August 6 testimony about a meeting with Mr. Jordan on December 31.  This is the third exhibit. I will read that:       And I met Mr. Jordan for breakfast on . . . the morning of      [December] 31st, at the Park Hyatt Hotel. And in the course      of the conversation I told him that I had had this friend,      Linda Tripp . . . and I was a little bit concerned because      she had spent the night at my home a few times and I      thought--I told Mr. Jordan, I said, well, maybe she's heard      some--you know--I mean, maybe she saw some notes lying      around. And Mr. Jordan said, ``Notes from the President to      you?'' And I said, ``No, notes from me to the President.''      And he said, ``Go home and make sure they're not there.''  This is Ms. Lewinsky's testimony of August 6 before the grand jury.  And before anything is said, I am not accusing anyone of anything. But let me tell you, it would be significant if Mr. Jordan is asked a question if that is a true statement and he says yes. It is significant to the case. If he says no, that is significant because there is a clear conflict in the testimony of Ms. Lewinsky. And her testimony goes to the heart of the issue. If he says, ``I don't remember,'' which is a third alternative--by the way, I hate giving these prospective witnesses all my questions--but if he says, ``I don't remember,'' that does not put the issue in dispute with Ms. Lewinsky and establishes really her recollection of the incident.  So I could go through more. I could go through more conflict with Ms. Lewinsky about whether Mr. Jordan saw the unsigned draft copy of her affidavit, a key issue in this case. Ms. Lewinsky testifies one way. Mr. Jordan did not have the benefit of Ms. Lewinsky's testimony when he was asked earlier in the grand jury. So that needs to be addressed with him.  There is a conflict with Ms. Lewinsky on whether they discussed the contents of the affidavit--not just whether they saw the signed affidavit, but whether the contents were discussed. The question to Mr. Jordan was, ``Did you ever discuss with Ms. Lewinsky what she was going to include in the affidavit?'' Answer: ``I was not Ms. Lewinsky's lawyer. The answer to that is no.''  But he goes on and elaborates on that. Ms. Lewinsky testified that she and Jordan did have a conversation about deleting a certain sentence in the affidavit and reworking that.  That is what I just covered on the contents of the affidavit.  Let me just go to one other on the conflict where the affidavit was discussed at their last meeting. Mr. Jordan testified in March that she came into the office:       She gave me a tie. I said, ``Monica, I am really busy,      thank you.'' And she thanked me, and she is gone.  ``Any subsequent conversation?'' The answer: ``No.''  Ms. Lewinsky's testimony is:       I stopped in to see him for five minutes to thank him for      giving me the job, and I gave him a tie.  She further testified,       I believe I showed him a copy of the affidavit.  Clear conflict, very important, once again showing a connection between the job, the false affidavit, and, of course, if you tie in the other aspect about the relationship, it gets very significant and something that needs to be further inquired about.  So there are some of the conflicts between the testimony, and an area that we need to inquire of Mr. Jordan about.  The notes to the President that Ms. Lewinsky said she had a conversation with him about, that has never been addressed to Mr. Jordan whatsoever.  The December 19 meeting we need to explore more with Mr. Jordan. This is the meeting when Ms. Lewinsky was subpoenaed. She called Mr. Jordan. He says, ``Come over.'' She goes over there to meet with Mr. Jordan, and during that meeting, according to the telephone logs, Mr. Jordan received a call from the President of the United States. Mr. Jordan has testified that he told the President that Ms. Lewinsky got subpoenaed.  That appears to be exactly during the meeting--the conversation he is having with Ms. Lewinsky.  I think appropriate questions to Mr. Jordan are: Did you excuse Ms. Lewinsky from the meeting? Did you have a private conversation with the President about the subject that you were talking to Ms. Lewinsky about? And when you renewed your conversation with Ms. Lewinsky, did you in fact tell her about your conversation with the President? If Ms. Lewinsky was not told about that conversation, I think there is some significance there, that things were going on that people were compartmentalizing and not sharing with the other interested parties, and I think that is significant and that needs to be explored. His involvement with reviewing the affidavit needs to be developed, and the conflicts, his knowledge of the nature of the relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.  So all of these need to be further explored. There are a number of unanswered questions.  One final area. I obviously have a number, but I don't want to belabor this point. There was testimony I mentioned about Mr. Isikoff and how Betty Currie felt compelled to go see Mr. Jordan about Mr. Isikoff inquiring about the courier records on the gifts from Ms. Lewinsky to the President. There is some indication that that information might have been shared with Mr. Frank Carter because Ms. Lewinsky testified that she received a page from Mr. Carter, her attorney, about the Isikoff call, the Isikoff request. How did that information get to Mr. Carter? I think there are some legitimate questions that should be asked there.  So we would respectfully ask the Senate to permit us to call Mr. Jordan as a witness, to depose him. But, further, we hope we will be able to call him so that you can evaluate the conflicts that I am sure exist now, that very likely will exist later on as well. The story needs to be told. The truth should be determined. Justice should be accomplished. That is done not through lawyers up here talking, it is not done through transcripts, but through witnesses. Edmund Burke said that to fail to hear the evidence is to fail to hear the cause. I know that you have transcripts, but I would contend to you that to fail to hear these witnesses is in essence to fail to hear the cause.                                 Recess
