President, I rise today to introduce legislation that would help local communities coordinate services for juvenile offenders who are leaving the juvenile justice system and returning to their communities. This provision was included in the Robb amendment to S. 254, the Violent and Repeat Juvenile Offender Accountability and Rehabilitation Act of 1999, which was unfortunately tabled earlier this week.  The problem of mental illness plagues an alarming number of youth, who too often find themselves caught up in the juvenile justice system. While overall crime rates in this country have been in decline for the past few years, we have seen alarming increases in the number of serious and violent crimes committed by minors. Each year, more than two million youngsters under the age of 18 are arrested. What's more, statistics show that thirty percent of these young people will commit another crime within a year of their initial arrest.  Often, society views these young people, who have turned to crime at such an early age, as a ``lost cause'' or simply beyond hope of rehabilitation. The said fact that often gets overlooked is that many of these youngsters are battling with a serious emotional or mental disorder that winds up manifesting itself in criminal behavior. We cannot condone this behavior, yet, we as a society have failed to dedicate the resources necessary to bring these children back from the edge of self-destruction.  The legislation I am introducing today would help local agencies to coordinate the array of mental health, substance abuse, vocational, and education services a youngster may need to successfully transition back into the mainstream. Once a youth has been through the juvenile or criminal justice system, we need to do all we can to prevent a similar incident. If these children have been identified as having a mental or emotional disorder, they need to have access to appropriate treatment and services while they are incarcerated, but perhaps more imperatively when they leave incarceration. Turning these young people out on the street with no services to facilitate their transition does not help these children and does not help society as a whole.  Studies have found the rate of mental disorder is two to three times higher among the juvenile offender population than among youth in the general population. According to a 1994 Department of Justice study, 73 percent of juvenile offenders reported mental health problems and 57 percent reported past treatment for their condition. In addition, it is estimated that over 60 percent of youth in the juvenile justice system have substance abuse disorders, compared to 22 percent in the general population.  In an effort to bring desperately needed mental health services to this terribly underserved population, my legislation would authorize the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), in collaboration with the Departments of Justice and Education, to administer acompetitive grant program that responds to the array of social and educational needs of children who are leaving the juvenile justice system.  These cooperative ``wrap-around services'' would enable juvenile justice agencies to work together with educational and health agencies to provide transitional services for youth who have had contact with the juvenile justice system, in order to decrease the likelihood that these young people will commit additional criminal offenses.  These services, which would be targeted toward youth offenders who have serious emotional disturbances or are at risk of developing such disturbances, could include diagnostic and evaluation services, substance abuse treatment, outpatient mental health care, medication management, intensive home-based therapy, intensive day treatment services, respite care, and therapeutic foster care.  I think it is important for my colleagues to note that this proposal is modeled after existing programs with a proven record of success. For instance, my home state of Rhode Island is one of four states (the others include California, Wisconsin, and Virginia) that has sought to target teens who have been diagnosed with a serious emotional disturbance and provide them with the services they need to get back on track.  The Rhode Island Department of Youth and Families last year initiated a statewide program called ``Project Hope'', for youth ages 12 to 18 with serious emotional disturbances who are in the process of transitioning from the Rhode Island Training School back into their communities. The goal of the partnership is to develop a single, community-based system of care for these children to reduce the likelihood that they will re-offend. The program brings a core set of services to these young people that includes health care, substance abuse treatment, educational/vocational services, domestic violence and abuse support groups, recreational programs, and day care services. A key component in the program's strategy is to engage young people and their families in the planning and implementation of these transition services.  A similar program that has been in operation in Milwaukee, Wisconsin since 1994 has reported a 40 percent decline in the number of felonies committed and a 30% decrease in misdemeanors after providing comprehensive services to children with serious emotional disorders for one year.  This legislation would provide states with the resources and flexibility to start filing a critical service gap for youngsters who are leaving the juvenile justice system and re-entering their communities. The provisions of adequate transitional and aftercare services to prevent recidivism is essential to reducing the societal costs associated with juvenile delinquency, promoting teen health, and fostering safe communities.  I am pleased to introduce this legislation today. The provisions outlined in this bill will help community agencies to coordinate services, which will prevent these troubled juveniles from committing additional crimes and falling into a life on the fringes of society. It is in our best interest to take responsibility for these teens instead of turning our backs on them at such a critical stage.                                 ______                                       By
