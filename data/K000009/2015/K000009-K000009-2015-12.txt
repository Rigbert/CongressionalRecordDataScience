Speaker, I thank the gentleman very much.  I would just like to say that one of the features I like best about John Boehner is that he wanted to be Speaker of the House. He didn't want to be President. He didn't want to head over to the other body. He didn't want a Supreme Court nomination.  He really loved this House, and that matters. That matters to all of us who continue to serve, and that matters to the historical record.  We appreciate all of the substance that he has given. Whether you agreed with him on issues or not, he definitely was a man of the House.
