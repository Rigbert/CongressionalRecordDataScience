Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Meek) for her willingness to yield to me, and I thank the gentleman from Ohio (Chairman Boehner) for yielding to me.  Mr. Chairman, I rise to enter a colloquy with the distinguished gentleman from Ohio (Chairman Boehner). First, I would like to thank the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Meek), as I said, for being willing to yield me time. I would also like to thank the gentleman from Ohio (Chairman Boehner) for his outstanding leadership on the committee, along with the gentleman from California (Mr. George Miller), who has worked so hard to bring a good bill to the floor.  The education of our children should be our top priority, which is why we are especially pleased that this bill is truly the result of a bipartisan effort. During the debate, we have discussed at great length the need for standards and improved achievement. However, many of our schools do not have access to research-based reading programs developed by NICHD. This bill includes report language that discusses research-based reading programs. But I do not feel we are doing enough to make sure that our teachers have access to this innovative research.  Mr. Chairman, at this time I would like to have a colloquy with the distinguished gentlewoman from Kentucky (Mrs. Northup), my colleague on the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services and Education of the Committee on Appropriations, who shares my concern and interest in this area.
