Chairman, it is with great concern for veterans, seniors, the poor and our environment that I rise in opposition to the VA, HUD and Independent Agencies Appropriation bill for fiscal year 1996.  This bill before us is an ill-conceived, mean-spirited attack on the most vulnerable citizens in America. While those may sound like harsh words, here are the harsh figures; a 50-percent reduction in funding to fight homelessness, $400 million less for section 8 operating costs and a $1.2 billion cut in modernization funds for public housing. For veterans, there is $250 million less than what the VA said is necessary to maintain the current service level and quality for medical care and $500 million less in administrative and construction costs. The EPA budget is cut by a third, resulting in no new cleanups and no funding for the safe drinking water loan fund.  Under this bill, Rhode Island would lose $7.7 million in rehabilitation and repair funds and $2 million that maintains 10,401 public housing units. In addition, our State, which last year assisted 4,910 people who came to emergency and domestic violence shelters, will lose nearly $2.6 million needed to assist these people. Ironically, if this bill passes, more people will be homeless and need this type of help.  I am also afraid that the news for Rhode Island's veterans is equally discouraging. While some programs nationwide have been increased, veterans in southeastern Rhode Island will again wait for needed improvements. In 1990 the VA bought a building to consolidate VA services in Rhode Island. Now, that building is unoccupied and our vets are waiting for the promised consolidation. Unfortunately, because this consolidation is not funded, the Government will continue to pay rent in downtown Providence, instead of cutting costs and consolidating the VA offices as planned.  Lastly, I am disappointed with what this bill does to our environment. This bill contains language that would limit the EPA's authority to enforce major environmental laws such as the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and the Safe Drinking Act. With the inclusion of this language, the Republican leadership has essentially gutted the last 25 years of environmental progress.  It will become harder for organizations in my State to continue the job of cleaning up our environment and protecting our health when virtually all funding to do so will be diminished. In fact, Rhode Island would lose $2.4 million compared to the President's proposal to finance wastewater projects, $9 million for loans to provide safe drinking water, and $674,000 to address polluted runoff. The loss of crucial funding to financing clean water infrastructure threatens both the protection of public health in Rhode Island and industries like shellfishing, boating, and tourism that are dependent on clean water.  While I understand the need to reduce the deficit, I do not believe we should place a disproportionate share on the backs of those who can least afford it. Unfortunately, that is what the Republicans have done in this bill. And this is not the first time. Just 4 months ago, the rescission bill attacked low income and elderly people by cutting money for section 8, rental assistance and homeownership initiatives. H.R. 2009 marks the second time this year that our poor, elderly, and disabled have been asked to make sacrifices in the name of deficit reduction. These sacrifices seem much higher than what other people have been asked to contribute.  I would like my colleagues to ask themselves why these cuts are so severe. Why have we decided to continue to invest less and less for those who have no roof over their head? Well, my colleagues, one answer is the space station. Some may argue that housing programs need reform, and therefore, they should be cut. But Mr. Chairman, if the same logic holds, why should we spend billions on a space station with innumerable design changes, cost increases, and failures?  Mr. Speaker, this bill's priorities are wrong and I see no reason to support it. I ask my colleagues to join me in opposing this misguided legislation.                          ____________________
