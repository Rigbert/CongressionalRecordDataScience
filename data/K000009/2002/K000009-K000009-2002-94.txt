Speaker, I am pleased to recognize a momentous occasion soon to be celebrated by Holy Trinity Lutheran Church in Toledo, Ohio. On June 11, 2002, the church will have achieved its 100th year. A special anniversary celebration commemorating this milestone will be held on Sunday, June 9, 2002, when the bishop of the Northwest Ohio Synod E.L.C.A. will conduct a centennial church service.  Soon after its 1902 inception, Dr. G. Neiffer was installed as the church's first pastor in 1904. Having outgrown its initial site, the present building's cornerstone was laid in 1924, followed by a 1949 groundbreaking. In 1951, Pastor C.A. Hackenberg formally dedicated the church. Through the years it has grown to meet the needs of its congregation, so that the church facilities include an education wing, a multi-purpose gymnasium, and a day care center. Youth and senior activities, intergenerational services, small group ministries, and retreats serve today's active membership.  Holy Trinity Lutheran Church's mission states the church is ``committed to follow Christ's command to be fishers of men and to feed His sheep so that Christ may be alive in the lives of all.'' Living this calling, Holy Trinity's faithful have maintained a consistent Christian presence in the neighborhood and our community, seeking to live the Gospels and Christ's teachings so that all are made whole. At the same time, the church has evolved with an ever-changing society over the century, so that it has remained a vibrant and integral part of the lives of its congregants and our community.  For the members of Holy Trinity Lutheran Church both past and present, this anniversary will be a time of introspection, remembrance, and reflection. But even as its members look back across a century of worship, good works, and communion, I know that they will also look forward to a new century fulfilling its mission to ensure ``that Christ may be alive in the lives of all.''
