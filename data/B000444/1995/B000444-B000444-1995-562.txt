 President, there are many things I do not like about this Republican budget. But, one of the most outrageous parts of this proposal is the increased burden it would put on college students.  Currently, students who take out loans to go to college do not have to pay interest on those loans while they are in school. The Federal Government pays it for them. This is known as the in-school interest subsidy. And, it has been a fundamental part of the student loan program since its inception 30 years ago. Without this protection--if the interest were to accumulate while an individual is in school--the cost would simply be prohibitive for many families.  But, that is just what is about to happen. The Republican budget in the Senate would end the interest subsidy for graduate and professional students. That is bad enough. But the House-passed budget is even worse. it would end the interest subsidy for all students.  This comes at a time when a higher education is increasingly important and at a time when the cost of that education is increasingly expensive. Studies show that a person with a college degree earns about $12,000 more each year than a person with only a high school degree. The unemployment rate for college graduates is 3 percent; for those with a high school diploma, it is 6 percent; and for those who are high school dropouts, the unemployment rate is 12 percent. And, yet, getting to college--opening up that door to economic opportunity--has become harder. During the 1980's, the cost of attending college rose 45 percent, while disposable income rose only 15 percent.  Mr. President, we are not talking about deadbeats. We are not talking about those who default on their loans. We are talking about middle class students from hard-working middle class families. The average annual family income for those students who borrow money to go to college is $35,000. These are middle class students who have to borrow money to get to college, who work hard to get ahead, who are playing by the rules and just want a fair shot. The Republicans are turning their backs on these young people by raising the costs of college loans.  The fact of the matter is this is a tax increase on college students. Already, for too many college students, when they graduate, they are handed not only a diploma but also a big IOU. This Republican budget makes the IOU even bigger. For example, a medical student could see his monthly loan repayment increase by more than $200 per month. A typical graduate student could easily see his or her loan increase by $5000.  Already, few young doctors who have to borrow money to attend medical school can afford to be primary care doctors in underserved rural and urban areas. Already, few young lawyers who have to borrow money to attend law school can afford to be public defenders. Already, it is hard for graduate students to pursue degrees in math and science--something we need desperately in this country for the Twenty-First Century--because, unlike doctors and lawyers, they do not have very many high-paying job alternatives. And, already, there are thousands upon thousands of undergraduate students who want to be policemen and teachers--but cannot because their loan repayment is too high. By removing the in-school interest subsidy, the Republican budget would only make it worse.  Frankly, we should be moving in the opposite direction--making college more affordable. Higher education is clearly an investment in our country's future, and it is without a doubt in the national interest. We should encourage parents to provide a college education to their children by changing the tax laws to make it easier for them. I am cosponsor of a bill to allow Americans who send their kids to college to deduct up to $10,000 of the cost of that education from their taxes. That is a real investment. That is a real tax cut. That is a real benefit to the Nation and to middle class families.  I disagree with some of my Democratic colleagues who argue that we should not cut taxes. We should. But, we should not cut taxes as proposed by the House Republicans--where the cuts overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy. [[Page S7117]] We need and we can afford--in fact, I would argue that we cannot afford not to provide--a tax cut targeted to middle-class families for the cost of an education.  This budget does not do that. It fails to provide relief for families who pay for their kids to go to college, and it punishes those who must borrow to go to college. The Republican budget, instead of making a college education more affordable, makes a college education less affordable.  Mr. President, from the establishment of the land-grant university system in the late 1800's to the GI bill at the end of World War II to the creation of the Pell Grant and Guaranteed Student Loan programs in the 1960's, the Federal Government has been committed to seeing that young people desiring to go to college would not be turned away because of the cost. It was a national goal to see a college education within reach of every American.  And, no matter who you talk to--black or white, rich or poor--every American family has the same goal: that their children will go to college. It was my dad's dream for his children, and it was my dream for my children. It is the dream of the richest businessperson and the poorest welfare mother. It is the dream of every American parent. We have not always reached the dream. But, we have always tried, and we have never turned our backs. We should not now. But, I am afraid that the Republicans are about to.  Balancing the budget is important, and it is important for our children. But, balancing the budget for future generations will be counterproductive if in the process we slash the programs like education that are an investment in our future.                          ____________________
