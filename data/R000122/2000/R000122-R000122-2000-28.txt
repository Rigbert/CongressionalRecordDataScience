President, I rise today to acknowledge the 26th anniversary of the Turkish invasion and occupation of Cyprus. Twenty-six years ago today, Turkey seized on a period of political unrest in predominantly Greek Cyprus and invaded its shores. Landing on the north coast of Cyprus with 6,000 troops and 40 tanks, nearly 40 percent of the island was in Turkish control in less than a month, displacing 200,000 Greek Cypriots from their homes. Today, there are still more than 1,600 Greek Cypriots who remain unaccounted for, serving as silent reminders of the unlawful invasion. Turkey continues to defy the international community and United Nations' Resolutions with its policy towards Cyprus, keeping more than 30,000 troops in the north of the island.  I believe that if we want to see future progress in resolving the injustices of a divided Cyprus, the United States, European and international organizations must put further pressure on the government in Ankara. It is Turkey's military and financial backing that provides the leverage for the Turkish Cypriot leadership and its unwillingness to make any compromises. Late last year, the European Union accepted Turkey as a candidate for admission into the 15-nation economic bloc. The EU has indicated that resolution on the Cyprus matter is a key condition to Turkey's membership, and it has outlined specific economic and humanitarian standards that must be accomplished. One such condition is an end to restrictions on the human rights of Greek Cypriots living in the occupied northen region. I was pleased to cosponsor my colleague Senator Snowe's Concurrent Resolution 9 to bring attention to this issue.  Greece and Turkey are critical members of the NATO alliance and have both been key allies to the United States, supporting our operations in the Balkans and no-fly zones over Iraq. We know the two nations can work together in times of crisis. Last fall, following a massive earthquake in Turkey, Greece was among the first to send aid. Greek rescue teams helped pull Turkish victims from the rubble. Then Greece endured its own deadly quake and Turkey was quick to respond, saving many Greek lives. These examples of bilateral cooperation should also be employed by Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders to demilitarize the island and establish a unified Cyprus with constitutional guarantees for all Cypriots regardless of ethnicity.  A new round of proximity talks began on July 5, 2000 between Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders in Geneva, Switzerland. These talks recessed on July 12 but will resume again in early August. Little information has been available due to the mutual observance of a press blackout. However, I hope that these talks will initiate commitments by both sides to come to an agreement.  In the past few years we have seen remarkable progress on seemingly intractable international conflicts. Northern Ireland is closer to peace than any time in history and whatever the outcome of the current Middle East Summit, just the fact that Prime Minister Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat have been talking for nine days is of great historic significance. I believe the people of Cyprus want and deserve the same opportunity. This year, the Senate version of the FY01 Foreign Operations Bill again appropriates $15 million to reduce tensions, promote peace and cooperation between the two communities. However, I think we can do more. It is my hope that my colleagues and the Administration will commit to actively assisting the parties in resolving the situation in Cyprus. Then we can commemorate the reunification rather then the division of this Nation.                          ____________________
