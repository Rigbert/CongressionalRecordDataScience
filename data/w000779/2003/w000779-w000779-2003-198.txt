President, of course, the debate throughout the day has been about the wise use of taxpayers' money. Yesterday in the Wall Street Journal, there was an article entitled ``USAID Defends Secret Bids to Rebuild Iraq.'' At the same time, there was an article in the Washington Post entitled ``Contracts to Rebuild Iraq Go to Chosen Few.'' ``No Bidding War on Contracts in Iraq.''  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that these two articles be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:              [From the Wall Street Journal, Apr. 2, 2003]     The Assault on Iraq--USAID Defends Secret Bids To Rebuild Iraqnational security is cited as reason few firms knew of $1.7 billion in                                contracts                           (By Neil King Jr.)       Washington.--Amid worries that preparations aren't moving      as fast as hoped, a top procurement official defended the      government's decision to approach only a handful     of U.S. companies to help rebuild postwar Iraq.       The U.S. Agency for International Development chose to put      out the bids in secret to a limited number of companies under      an exception that allows agencies to by-pass the usual      competitive bidding for national security reasons, said      Timothy Beans, the agency's chief of procurement.       ``Anytime you are in wartime condition you don't have the      four or five months to go out on the street for the kind of      competition you'd like,'' Mr. Beans said.       USAID began approaching preselected bidders for postwar      Iraq work as early as late January, when the possibility of      going to war with Iraq was still being hotly debated at the      United Nations. Requests for proposals went out for four      contracts in mid-February, with two more early last month.      Altogether, the work--including rebuilding highways and      bridges and rehabilitating Iraq's school system--is expected      to cost at least $1.7 billion.       Similar exceptions were made for reconstruction after the      recent antiterror campaign in Afghanistan and in the mid-     1990s after the war in Bosnia, Mr. Beans said. He conceded      that except for those three emergencies the restricted      contracting procedures are unusual.       USAID officials said last week that as many as six contract      awards would be announced soon, but final decisions may now      be put off until next week. Some companies competing for the      contracts say they are receiving conflicting signals over the      length and ambitiousness of the work.       Plans last month outlined an aggressive rebuilding      campaign, including sweeping changes to Iraq's education and      health systems, that would nonetheless last only 12 months.      Some U.S. officials now concede that any meaningful work will      take much longer than a year, but others in the      administration are wary of moving forward on anything that      would suggest a prolonged U.S. occupation of Iraq.       The uncertainty over how to proceed also reflects mounting      unease over the U.S.-led military campaign, which has so far      offered scant evidence that average Iraqis are ready to      embrace American control of their country.       Reconstruction officials within the administration had      planned to use the southern city of Basra as a test case for      the U.S. rebuilding effort. Iraq's second-largest city has a      dominant Shiite population that has long been at odds with      Saddam Hussein. But continued fighting there, and signs that      the local population might be less receptive than some      predicted, have put those plans on hold.       Competition for the big infrastructure-rebuilding contract,      valued at $600 million, was limited to seven large U.S.      engineering companies, several of which have now either been      dropped from the running or formed teams with other bidders.      People involved in the bidding say the lead competitors are      Bechtel Corp. and Parsons Corp, which has taken on      Halliburton Co.'s Kellogg Brown & Root as a subcontractor.      Halliburton announced Monday that its KBR division won't seek      to be the prime contractor for rebuilding Iraq's      infrastructure, but ``remains a potential subcontractor for      this important work.''       The administration's postwar plans for Iraq have stirred      charges in Europe that all major rebuilding work will go to      U.S. concerns. While none of the contracts will go to foreign      companies, those companies will be eligible to fill in as      subcontractors, Mr. Beans said.                                  ____               Contracts To Rebuild Iraq Go to Chosen Few                          (By Jackie Spinner)       KBR, the company the U.S. government picked this week to      put out oil-field fires in Iraq, has a long history of      working for the military on big projects in foreign hot      spots. The former Kellogg Brown & Root--a subsidiary of      Houston-based energy services firm Halliburton Co., which      Vice President Cheney headed from 1995 until 2000--developed      a contingency plan for extinguishing the fires as part of a      10-year Pentagon logistics contract it was awarded in 2001      through a competitive bid, company officials said. So when      the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers needed a firm to douse fires      ignited by retreating Iraqi forces, the company was already      on the ground in Kuwait. ``KBR have been over there, and they      had an existing contract with the Army,'' said Scott      Saunders, a spokesman for the Corps of Engineers. ``Because      of that and because of that need to snuff those fires      quickly, KBR was sole-sourced.'' The work is being      subcontracted to Boots & Coots International Well Control      Inc. and Wild Well Control Inc.       The latest contract was awarded under a waiver the Bush      administration granted in January allowing government      agencies to handpick companies for Iraqi reconstruction      contracts. The U.S. Agency for International Development is      handling the bulk of the contracts. KBR is also on the short      list of companies the USAID invited to bid for the prime      contract to rebuild Iraq's infrastructure after the war,      including highways, bridges, airports and government      buildings. The others include Fluor Corp., Washington Group      Inc., Bechtel Group, Louis Berger Group and Parsons Corp.      That contract, for at least $900 million, could be awarded as      soon as today. The government is proposing to spend $2.4      billion on humanitarian aid and reconstruction in Iraq.       Halliburton plans to put KBR and another subsidiary into      bankruptcy protection this summer as part of a plan to settle      outstanding asbestos-related claims for about $4 billion. But      KBR's government operations aren't part of that plan,      Halliburton said.       Some government contract experts said the latest KBR award      shows how companies with long-standing ties to the military      get dibs on new work. The company has been building ships,      mess halls and toilets at base camps around the world for six      decades, originally as Brown & Root. Over the past decade it      has won contracts to provide logical support to troops, most      recently in Somalia, Haiti and the Balkans.       But the experts said the problem is that not putting the      contracts out for bid allows critics to question the fairness      of the process and whether the most politically connected      companies have an edge in getting the awards.       ``The administration has made potential use of shortcuts      and exceptions that let it put literally billions of taxpayer      dollars in the hands of selected contractors,'' said Charles      Tiefer, a law professor at the University of Baltimore and      the author of a casebook on government contracting.      ``Naturally, a large credibility gap looms between the      administration's plausible excuses that tight deadlines and      exceptional security needs compelled it to forgo the usual      competitive safeguards and the critics' observations that it      is awfully convenient for juicy plums to land in the lap of      the vice president's former company.''       William H. Carroll, a government contract lawyer who also      teaches at American University's Washington College of Law,      said there is justification for getting the contracts out as      soon as possible. But he said it could come at a price.       ``Because of the intense nature of the need to do things      quickly, the work may not be as well defined, and the fact      that there isn't a competitor putting pressure on price,      these are probably going to be expensive contracts,'' Carroll      said. ``I don't think there's an evil intent. But our      procurement process relies on competition to determine what      is a fair and reasonable price.''       The General Accounting Office found in September 2000 that      the U.S. Army had not done enough to contain costs associated      with KBR's $2.2 billion work providing logistical and      engineering support in the Balkans.       Officials ``frequently have simply accepted the level of      services the contractor provided without questioning whether      they could be provided more efficiently or less frequently      and at lower cost,'' the report said. The company and the      Pentagon disputed the findings, which did not question the      quality of the work KBR had performed.       The Corps of Engineers said the value of the KBR contract      in Iraq will depend on the scope and number of fires it will      have to extinguish during and after a war that has not yet      ended. So far there are seven oil fires burning in Iraq.      Steven L. Schooner, co-director of the Government Procurement      Law Program at George Washington University's law school,      said KBR's track record is not in question.       ``They have won the hearts and minds and stomachs of the      military,'' he said. ``They have done a fabulous job, and our      troops are better off for it.''       Schooner said the Cheney connection to Halliburton should      not be an issue. But, he said, the non-competitive nature of      awarding the Iraqi reconstruction contracts has made it one.       ``Had these contracts not been awarded in a secretive      manner it would be easier to cut off the questions earlier,''      he said.
