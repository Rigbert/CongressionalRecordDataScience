President, the purpose of the two of us coming to the floor today is to make it clear that we want this month of August to be a month of significant transition in the Senate; to move us from a do-nothing Senate to actually take up issues that people across America care about.  We wrote a letter to Senator Frist which said schedule stem cell research and give us a date certain to let us move forward. As the Senator said, let us move forward on this debate on Iraq. Let us move forward on help paying college tuition costs, particularly for working families. Let's do something about energy costs and gasoline prices. All of these things I think fit into an agenda that is timely and important for the American people.  I ask the Senator from Nevada the following question: Did he notice this morning on the front page of the Washington Post that the chief of police in the District of Columbia noted that since July 1 there have been 13 murders in our capital city? And in that period of time, 12 days, 13 murders have created such a stir and concern that he has declared it is a time of criminal emergency in the Nation's capital because of the murder rate.  I ask the Senator from Nevada if he is aware of the fact that in the last 3 days in the capital of Iraq, in Baghdad, 100 people have been murdered in 3 days? Is he aware of the fact that just a few months ago, former Iraq Prime Minister Ayad Allawi said: If this is not civil war, then God knows what is.  I ask the Senator from Nevada, are we going to see the end of the Senate debate on Iraq come down to cut-and-run versus stay-the-course? Is that as good as it gets in the Senate, the most deliberative body in our Government? Is that the end of the conversation on Iraq for this year as far as our agenda is concerned?
