 President, I rise to introduce, together with my colleague and friend Senator Kyl, the Emergency Judicial Relief Act of 2011.  This bill would create a total of ten District judgeships in five courts across the country that are facing true emergency situations.  I want to thank our cosponsors, Senators Cornyn, Klobuchar, Boxer, McCain, Hutchison, and Franken, for working with Senator Kyl and me on this bill.  As a member of the Senate, I take very seriously our duty to ensure that the Nation's Federal courts have the resources they need to administer justice for the American people. Our Federal courts bear responsibility for adjudicating criminal cases, deciding civil rights and employment cases, and resolving commercial disputes between companies. When our courts become overburdened, we leave crime victims and criminal defendants in limbo and civil litigants without resolution to their problems.  In the Eastern District of California, the need for additional judges is acute. This District, which extends over 87,000 miles and encompasses California's Central Valley, faces far and away the worst caseload crisis in the Nation.  The District is home to more than eight million Californians, but it has only 6 active District Judges. For three decades, the District's population has been steadily growing, but the size of the Court has been unchanged. Congress has not created a permanent judgeship in the Eastern District since 1978 and the only temporary judgeship created was allowed to expire and never renewed despite repeated attempts by myself and Senator Leahy.  The result is unacceptable. As of December 31, 2010, the District was managing 1,133 weighted filings per authorized judgeship, a caseload that is not only the highest in the Nation, but also 300 weighted filings per judge higher than any other District Court in the country and almost three times the threshold at which the Judicial Conference recommends additional judgeships.  For everyday life, what this means is that individuals and businesses must wait months, or even years to have their disputes resolved. According to the most recent statistics, criminal felony cases remained pending in this court for a median of 12.7 months; and more than 10 percent of all civil cases were taking more than 3 years from the date of filing to be decided.  The delay is not for lack of effort. As Judge Lawrence O'Neill testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2009, the Eastern District's judges are among the most productive in the Nation, and the court is utilizing every resource currently at its disposal. The caseloads are simply unmanageable.  U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts has publicly remarked on the problems in the District; so has Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy; and the Judicial Conference of the United States has formally called on Congress to create more judgeships here.  The Emergency Judicial Relief Act of 2011 would provide a narrow, targeted solution.  The bill would create new judgeships in five Districts across the country where the need is most staggering, four in the Eastern District of California, two in the District of Arizona; two in the Western District of Texas; one in the Southern District of Texas; and one in the District of Minnesota. Additionally, the bill would convert a temporary judgeship in the District of Arizona and one in the Central District of California to permanent status. The bill would be offset by raising civil filing fees $10, from $350 to $360.  Let me be clear. California needs far more judgeships than this bill would create, and I will work with my colleagues to create those badly needed judgeships.  In the meantime, this bill is a narrow, emergency measure to provide relief in the handful of Districts that need it the very most.  I urge my colleagues to work with me to pass this commonsense, good government bill.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1014       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
