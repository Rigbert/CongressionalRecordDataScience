Mr. Speaker, we are still waiting to see the details of how the Republicans will cut $270 billion from Medicare. The Ways and Means Committee held one--only one--hearing. Even after that hearing, we do not know how they will cut Medicare. We do not have a bill.  It is a shame and disgrace that we are shut out of the process, and the details are carefully guarded from us. This is an affront--not just to Democrats, not just to Members of Congress, but to our senior citizens and the American people.  Mr. Speaker, it was Robert Frost who said, ``When you build a wall, who are you trying to fence out?''  So I ask, Why is there only one hearing on this very important plan? What do my colleagues have to hide?  Do not hide the plan. Hold hearings. Let the American people be a part of this process.                          ____________________
