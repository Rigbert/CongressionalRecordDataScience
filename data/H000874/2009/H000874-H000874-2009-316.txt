 Twenty thousand votes is a quantifiable criteria. What, for those of you who are new, is not as quantifiable is the real measure of the man.  Twenty thousand votes, a conscientious Member. But the real measure ofBill Young, which Americans would have observed had they been with him during each of those votes, is the decency of Bill Young, is the collegiality of Bill Young, of his inclination to reach across the aisle, reach across ideology, reach across and say, How can we do this together?  Bill Young is an example for us all of how to treat one another and how to engage in this process, though we may have differences, in a way that built a better institution, not tore it down.  That is why those 20,000 votes are deserving of so much respect, because the character with which they were cast and the character that characterize and continues to characterize the gentleman from Florida's service.  Bill Young, we are in your debt. You have served your country well, and we look forward to years of service with you, my friend. Thank you.
