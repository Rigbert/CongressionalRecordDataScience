 President, the State of Delaware lost one of its most remarkable citizens on September 10, with the passing of Nathan Wexler at the age of 97.  I first met Nate many years ago during one of my early campaigns, when he showed up in my campaign headquarters offering to volunteer. From that day forward, though he had retired from his dry cleaning business and was at an age when most folks are ready to slow down, Nate was one of our most active volunteers.  A talented artist, Nate began a second career as a professional sign painter. Indeed, one of the staples of our campaign's offices was a large sign that he painted many years ago. I have had several campaigns, and severalcampaign headquarters, but Nate's sign remains, a reminder of his commitment as well as his friendship.  But for all of Nate's artistic talent, his most enduring characteristic was his love of people, and his ability to inspire loyalty and affection from everyone he came in contact with.  Many of the volunteers on my campaigns have been young people, full of idealism and eager to learn. They have often been young enough to be Nate's grandchildren or even great-grandchildren. But Nate always relished their idealism. He tried to see people and events through their eyes and learn from that point of view, and he gently shared his experience and wisdom. It was remarkable to see the affection and respect he engendered in those idealistic kids.  My family and I were privileged to spend time with Nate in settings away from the political arena, and those occasions were simply a delight. They were times rich with humor and wit, as well as wisdom. Our conversations were filled with insight, not just into the past and present, but looking far into the future at the challenges our Nation and world will face. Nate knew that he would never face those challenges, but that his great grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren would.  Nate Wexler leaves behind a large family and friends of all ages and from all walks of life. He will be missed tremendously, but he lives on in all of us who were fortunate enough to know and to learn from him.                          ____________________
