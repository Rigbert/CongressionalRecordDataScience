 President, I ask to have printed in the Record finalist essays written by Vermont High School students as part of the Fourth Annual State of the Union Essay contest conducted by my office. These 7 finalists were selected from over 380 entries.  The essays follow:    Raihan Kabir, South Burlington High School, Grade 12 (Finalist)       How a country collects and allocates its resources takes      precedence in outlining the foundation of equality and      general welfare. We as individuals rely on a revenue of both      incomes and loans, which makes for a crude economic model of      spending. This holds true for our government. As the nation      dives deeper into debt and countries around the world      experience protests and riots over austerity measures, it is      clear that additional tax dollars are necessary to reduce      debt, support society, and give rise to the economy.       Tax increases will put the definition of taxation back into      its actuality. The United States tax rates are theoretically      graduated by income level, meaning that lower income ranges      pay a lower rate than higher income ranges. However, those in      a higher tax bracket often have more deductions to further      equalize their effective rate with that of the middle or      lower brackets. A decline in tax rates for the most wealthy      is a disproportionate advantage for the already financially      capable members of our society, which further instigates the      income disparities that threaten our democratic ideals. The      top percent of Americans possesses more wealth than the      entire bottom 90 percent; the 400 wealthiest Americans have a      greater combined net worth than the entire bottom 150      million; and yet, everyone is paying a similar effective      rate. Not everyone is currently contributing their fair share      to society, and living in a nation with the largest amount of      debt in the world, this matter of fact is unacceptable. Tax      increases will make the theory of taxes a reality and restore      economic equality.       Though our current fiscal path is unstable, increasing      taxes will reduce national debt and put us on the right track      back to recovery. With a 16 trillion dollar debt that is      rising at the rate of 6 billion dollars a day (4 million      dollars every minute), every family in America would owe      about $50,000 to various countries around the world if the      burden trickled down to the general public. When the      government needs money, it sells treasury bills (similar to      savings bonds) to investors, who cash them in after an      average of ten years for the original amount plus interest.      Though a certain amount of debt is arguably helpful for the      economy, consistently high deficits force the government to      offer higher, more appealing interest rates; investors      eventually realize that the country is unlikely to pay back      the money it borrows and they stop lending, which crushes the      economy, as most recently witnessed in Greece. Our current      national debt is greater than the economies of the United      Kingdom, Australia, and China, combined. Stopping this      vicious economic cycle requires less foreign-reliance and      more self-sustenance, which is feasible if and only if we      increase taxes.       Tax increases will ensure the funding and availability of      certain social programs and necessary expenditures on      infrastructure without the need to excessively issue bonds.      Taxes currently fund public services of insurance, such as      Social Security and Medicare, of welfare, such as the Pell      Grant and Food Stamp programs, and of infrastructure, such as      the scholastic and interstate highway systems. Nobel laureate      of economics Paul Krugman affirms a current necessity for      increased taxes in his following statement:       [Regarding] proposals to raise the age of Medicare      eligibility to 67 . . . outlays would fall only by $125      billion over the next decade . . . and even when fully phased      in, this partial dismantling of Medicare would reduce the      deficit only about a third as much as could be achieved with      higher taxes on the very rich . . . don't believe anyone who      claims otherwise.       Taxes pay for important programs that go unpaid by spending      cuts. The Bureau of Economic Statistics reports that the      average standard of living, determined by comparing adjusted      incomes and poverty rates, has increased in years with a      higher annual budget and decreased in years on the contrary.      According to the New York Times and the Board of Economic      Advisors, there is a direct correlation between the amount of      money provided to the government in the national budget and      the quality of life in the United States, as determined by      the rate of poverty. This makes logical sense; our standard      of life escalates as we make fiscal contributions to society.      Yet we continue to have the lowest tax rate in the world.      Taxes are imposed so that roads get fixed, so we get an      education, and so people don't invade our country. Taxes are      imposed to protect our rights. The government imposes taxes      on us for our own benefit, and by raising them, we will      improve the living conditions and quality of life in America.       Tax increases will lead to economic growth and prosperity.      In 1990 and again in 1993, President Clinton enacted deficit-     reduction legislation that raised taxes for high income      taxpayers; as a result, economic growth and job creation were      strong. Within this period of a sensational economy, capital      gain rates were cut, and there was a 20% increase in job      availability for a total of 21 million new jobs. However,      after the Bush Tax Cuts of 2001 and the Bush Recession, job      growth lagged behind GDP growth, there was 0% net job growth,      and with continuous population growth, there were record high      unemployment rates. Tax increases have helped society and the      economy in the past, and they will help again.       In any case of regulatory action, the value to be upheld is      the quality of life. By reducing debt, supporting society,      and giving rise to the economy, the nation will better ensure      a standard of well-being for its citizens. The government of      these United States is to assure life, liberty, health, and      happiness, in our pursuit of the American dream. Lincoln said      it best in his Gettysburg Address: ``that government of the      people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from      the earth.'' The prioritization of tax increases over      spending cuts is essential to future policy in the United      States of America to sustain the American public. Fiona Higgins, Champlain Valley Union High School, Grade 12 (Finalist)       There are many issues facing the United States. Personally,      I believe one of the most critical domestic issues is      reproductive rights.       Every step back to pre-Roe v. Wade is sensationalized in      the media, and rightfully so. The issue is much more far      reaching than pro-life versus pro-choice; it is both a human      rights issue and an economic issue.       Firstly, it is a human rights issue. It is a matter of      women having control over their own decisions, their bodies,      and their lives. Western women strive to liberate women who      they view as oppressed, but these same western women don't      realize that their freedoms are also disappearing. Women and      men alike have the right to decide what happens to their      bodies. Restricting access to contraception and health      services violates this human right for both genders.       Secondly, it is an economic issue. Children cost money.      When parents cannot support their family, they are prone to      apply for welfare and other government programs that were put      in place to help low-income families. These programs are      needed, but the federal government could decrease the need      and the cost of these programs if it focused on education and      access to contraception. In low-income neighborhoods, people      are often not able to access contraception. This takes     away lower-income women's autonomy as well as perpetuating      the cycle of poverty. If there were more accessible systems      in place, these systems (rather than chance) would help      families plan for the future, and allow them to decide to      have children (rather than chance). In addition, a decreased      level of government spending would curb the growth of the      debt, which would aid the struggling economy.       A woman rarely thinks to herself, ``I'd like to have an      abortion instead of using contraceptives this time.'' That is      lunatic. Abortions happen out of necessity. If they were      illegal or severely restricted, women would still get them,      but the procedures would be unsafe and deadly. If members of      Congress truly want to protect the unborn and create a      diminished welfare-dependent state, they must focus on      education and accessibility; this strategy will also lower      government spending in the long run.       Instead of going backwards, the United States should be      moving forwards. Members of Congress must recognize that      women have an inalienable right to privacy with regard to      their bodies, a right that we should not have to fight for.      Education and access to contraceptives needs to be more      widespread, thereby improving our dire economic situation and      our quality of life.           Owen Deffner, Thetford Academy, Grade 7 (Finalist)       2013, America has had quite a year, with many ups and      downs. Everything from the government shut down, to what I'd      call: an official economic recovery. We have witnessed a      terrible civil war in Syria where tremendous bloodshed has      occured. America has hosted many natural disasters too,      everything from intensely cold temperatures to violent      tornadoes. In these tragic times America has stepped up its      game and delivered, helping our neighbors when they are      struggling. This is the America that our allies look up to;      the friendly, hospitable, welcoming America that we all      contribute to every single day. Let's keep that good,      positive America in our hearts this year.       11 million people are in America illegally. These people      have come to this great nation in search of a better life.      These people are trying to achieve the American dream.      Immigrants are trying to send money home to their family in      another country, some are trying to provide for their family      here in the US. All the while they are constantly worried      that our government will deport them back to their home      country. This is not right, it's not okay that we don't      welcome them into our nation. I want the path to citizenship      easier for them so that they can get what they wanted to get      by coming here. Let's be a bit more hospitable to people who      are just trying to help their family.       Our status on the issue of the environment is not looking      up. America has the great opportunity to help lead the fight      against climate change. America must set high standards      concerning the environment so that other countries will      follow to help reduce the risk of the world's surface covered      in water. Inside America to confront this issue head on we      need to educate Americans on what is okay and not okay to      recycle and how to compost or break down food into soil for      our farms and gardens. This is a plan that will work and that      we must initiate this year.       Our country is very behind on a major issue. America's      education system is well behind many other well developed      global powers. We need to fix that issue from the bottom up      starting in our pre and elementary schools, with more      emphasis on math and science. At higher levels, more      affordable college and university opportunities for the lower      and middle-class. We need to invest more time and education      in our education and we need to now!       All of these ideas I am proposing are simple and should be      easy to carry out with a bit of willingness from both      parties. I am not asking to overhaul anything just some easy      doable requests that all of us can help to accomplish.      America should look to the future, to the next generation      growing into adulthood. Let's get back on track for these      young men and women who have high hopes for themselves and      their country.     Emily Martin, Vergennes Union High School, Grade 10 (Finalist)       The United States of America is an amazing country to call      home. However, in the modern day we as a nation face problems      that challenge our ingenuity and integrity. The world today      is one of war, whether that is physical, or political. We      struggle to find resources to continue on living the way we      have for as long as we can remember, yet forget that the      earth which we walk on is a fragile one. The United States is      no exception. We often find ourselves between a rock and a      hard place; dealing with complex issues such as health care      for all, or additional billions of dollars in debt; the      Continuation of fighting a war which is not ours, or      withdrawing our troops and allowing innocent people to face      an uncertain future. Spend billions in foreign oil to keep      companies in business, or convert to clean energy and watch      the economy crumble. The list of hard choices goes on and on.      The reality is, we no longer live in a time when decisions      are cut and dry and each decision resonates into our future      with force.       As a nation, we face an increasingly unpredictable future,      and without reassurance of our outcome, fear can cause      bitterness and ignorance. Education, the economy, politics,      and the fate of an ever-changing climate put an enormous      amount of stress on us a people. There is no certain cure for      the issues we deal with a nation, but the first step towards      solution and unification. As a country, it's time that we put      aside our grudges, opinions, and preferences and work as a      whole to support America's path towards growth, safety,      security and stability. The United States of America has been      a country that others look to as a role model and to some as      a beacon of freedom and safety. We have more than ourselves      to work for; there are millions of people around the world      who rely on our help and support. We need to shed the selfish      shells, and work as a people, not as a political party or      organization. Whether you are a Republican, Democrat, and      Libertarian it doesn't matter, because America is your home,      and at the end of the day we all have to learn to coexist and      benefit from each other's support. This is how we will help      to secure America's future, America's education, industry and      healthcare. Unification is the first step towards solution.       If we need reminding of the impact of dissention and      fracturing of our political system, the Civil War looms in      the hearts and from the pages of our history, when compromise      not only failed, but conversation stopped. The State of the      Nation in America is painful obvious even to the young people      and the children. If we don't remember how to talk to each      other, work together and accomplish the majority rule      established as a framework in the US Constitution, we stand      to lose more than a budget. We stand to lose our democracy.     Nick Majeski, Woodstock Union High School, Grade 11 (Finalist)              Bribes from Fast Food: A State of Corruption       In the year 2014, the union is majorly corrupt; the country      is run by a capitalist nightmare of over-powerful healthcare,      tobacco, and food industries. From their very beginnings at      the turn of twentieth century, the fast food industry has      steadily become more and more powerful and influential.      Spawning from this growth in influence, the union has      steadily declined into a state of corruption at the hands of      the fast industry, with these major food chains bribing      government workers in high positions.       Government agencies controlling food, such as the FDA,      USDA, and EPA may have been created with good intentions, but      when a higher up does not believe they are being paid enough      money for their job, they are known to be tempted to accept      bribes and submit to being the puppets of fast food      corporations, looking to exploit their power to lower the      standards of their products. An article on Naturalnews.com      explained how, in a survey given to workers at the FDA and      USDA, one fourth of the survey takers admitted to have      changed policies for corporate gain. On one hand this is not      morally right both in the way that our government officials--     who were elected by the people--are accepting bribes, and      also that they are changing policies allowing even less      healthy food that causes diseases--more money to health care;      another corrupt industry in the United States.       Corrupt FDA, USDA, and EPA fat-cats obviously do not want      to break their ties with fast food puppeteers; this brings      more corruption directly into the government organizations      themselves. In the Naturalnews.com article the writer      explains that many innocent workers at organizations like the      FDA and USDA are demoted or even fired for trying to do their      job and not keeping their mouths shut about corruption they      have witnessed. The higher-ups in charge of these huge      organizations influence immoral decisions that bring dirty      money to their own pockets; they change state standards to      very low standards and do not require food companies to tell      customers when the food was made, processed or cooked.       Despite all this--mostly widely known information--this      corruption is still going on and growing. According to      Fastfoodnationhonorsproject.weebly.com ties between congress      and fast food are too strong to vote against certain      policies. This means that the way to lower corruption in the      food industry would have to be to take direct action.       Despite knowledge of corruption being well known in      America- Supersize Me is a mainstream movie- there is not      very much motivation to stop bribes from the food industry.      This is a problem that should not only be addressed, but      worked towards solving as well.         Holly Thayer, Milton High School, Grade 12 (Finalist)       My fellow Americans, I stand here before you to evaluate      the state of our great nation. Over the past year our economy      has risen as the Gross National Product increased 4.1% in the      third quarter, and the National Deficit went down $1.8      Billion. As of November, the national unemployment rate has      dropped to 7% and personal income has risen, proving that our      nation is moving out of the recession, and America is once      again becoming a nation of economic growth and wealth.       2013 saw an increase in revolutions around the world, from      Syria to Egypt, many countries around the world are      experiencing the same revolution the United States and our      ancestors endured in order to gain our individual freedoms.      Through the government and all of our national forces, we      must work together to give aid in the form of resources and      money, to assist the new governments that are the result of      these revolutions, and ensure that there is smooth turn over      of     power. The United States must also create a coalition of our      allies, along with the United Nations, to create an agreement      that delegates the responsibilities and costs of helping      these nations form new governments, and ensures that the re-     created states are not intruding on an individual's human      rights.       The production of Genetically Modified Organisms, GMOs,      that are then placed in processed foods or on crops and used      as an insecticide, have created a serious health risk for      myself, and all my fellow Americans. It has been proven that      GMOs can lead to serious health issues and impose high health      risks. We must work together with the agricultural farmers      and corporations that use GMO's to research the other options      that these businesses have in order to ensure plant safety,      without endangering the public health at the same time. Then      we must create a grant program that would give states and      localities money to allocate to farmers and organizations      that agree to not use GMOs. For companies that still use      GMOs, we must toughen the regulations on the use of them,      through only allowing a regulated amount to be present in      foods, and make it mandatory that this presence is labeled on      every package of a product.       Educated masses lead to innovations and improvements in      every aspect of life. Currently, around 30% of Americans have      obtained a college degree. In order to have an educated      citizenry, we need to make federal aid for students planning      on going to college more available. To do this, we need to      restructure the system that is used to disperse federal      financial aid. If we create a formula, based on family      income, and reduce the importance and use of merit based      scholarships, while increasing the use of incentive programs,      then allocate the money based on this system, we could      effectively make financial aid more available and abundant,      and therefore increase the percentage of Americans who have a      college degree, creating an educated citizenry.       Thank you, God Bless America.    Delaney Spink, South Burlington High School, Grade 12 (Finalist)       I can't claim to know a lot about politics. In fact, I make      a point to stay as uninvolved in it as possible. In a      nutshell, all I know is that Obama is our president, and that      I should never bring up politics with my grandfather, unless      I'm willing to spend the next three or four hours listening      to him denounce every decision our government has made since      the 1920's. When our class was told we had to write this      essay, my first thought was, ``I have no idea what the state      of our union is. How am I supposed to write about how to fix      it?''       I'd bet that every single other student in my classroom was      having the same thought, save the one or two kids that are      really into politics, and, as we all know, are going to win      this competition. This got me thinking, and I've come to a      conclusion. The problem with our country is that not enough      young people know what the problem is. Ironic, isn't it?       When I think of our government, I think of old white men.      Now, I know this is a very stereotypical generalization that      I'm making. Women are getting involved, and, hey, our      president is black. We seem to be doing better, based on the      limited information that I have. But, whether they're diverse      or not, the people making decisions for our country are old.      This isn't entirely a bad thing; older people have more      experience, confidence, and knowledge. All I'm saying is that      that wisdom needs to be balanced with the fresh perspectives      of our country's younger generations. Younger people need to      start getting more excited about politics, myself included.      We need to start looking at it as an exciting opportunity to      change what we think should be changed, instead of as a      boring subject that our uncles argue about over Thanksgiving      dinner.       Now, I know there are probably many kids out there that are      interested in politics. That's great, but I also know that      the vast majority of kids, like myself, are simply      uninterested. The solution lies with us, and we need to      motivate ourselves. It can't come from the adults. If this      essay somehow makes it to anyone important, please don't take      this as a sign that you need to launch a national ``Politics      are Cool, Yo!'' campaign. It won't work. It needs to be      started by the kids. We need to start clubs, be in our school      governments, or even just watch the news.       I don't have a perfect solution, seeing as I am, for now,      one of the aforementioned uninterested students. But, I know      this: If politics can become more accessible to young people      in any way, shape, or form, we will take notice, and,      eventually, get involved. It's our country too. We want to be      just as involved as Grandpa Bill and Senator Sanders. One of      us just needs to lead the way.                          ____________________
