We campaigned the same year, I for reelection, he for the Senate. I have always been very proud of him.  When historians look back, they will see he did a great service for the Senate today in trying to put a lot of things in perspective. I will speak longer at a another time. I am doing this at the concurrence of the leader showing his usual courtesy. I will not exceed that. I will speak at a later time.  I appreciate my friend and also appreciate my friend from Tennessee.  I yield the floor.
