 And for several months, I was encouraged to see bipartisan talks approaching agreement on a bipartisan bill.  Somewhere along the line, those talks got off course, leading to Democrats pulling away from bipartisan efforts, a party-line vote in committee and the Democrat leadership's stateddesire to bring a bill to the floor that had, in effect, bipartisan opposition. So last week I raised concerns with the Dodd bill, but I also told the President and our friends across the aisle that this bill is not unfixable.  It is important for the country and taxpayer that we get this right, that we put them before politics. That is why I was disappointed to read that Senate Democrats are refusing to drop the $50 billion bailout fund--a fund that the Treasury Secretary himself opposes--unless Republicans pay a price for taking it out. This is exactly what Americans don't like about Washington: when one side tries to ``get'' something for doing what they should have done in the first place. If everyone agrees it should be dropped, then it should be dropped. And if Senate Democrats think it should stay, then they should explain why they think the Treasury Secretary was wrong when he said that this bailout fund ``would create expectations that the government would step in to protect shareholders and creditors from losses.''  Both sides have expressed a willingness to make the changes needed to ensure without any doubt that this bill won't put taxpayers on the hook for future bailouts of Wall Street banks. So why don't we just do that?  I am heartened to hear that bipartisan talks have resumed in earnest, and in my view, the progress we have seen over the past few days is proof that I was right to raise concerns about this bill when I did. As I said, the best way to get a bill with the credibility of bipartisan support is to allow bipartisan talks to continue. Let us fix the bill and have a bipartisan reform.  I yield the floor.
