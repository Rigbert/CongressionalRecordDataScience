 President, let me just say at this point that I appreciate the remarks of my colleague from California, Senator Boxer, about how difficult this has been, to bring people together to compromise on a very difficult and serious issue. In fact, I have heard some of my colleagues on the other side say that this debate is about politics. I say, if this is just about politics, it would be simply an amendment to repeal the rider. This is not about politics. This is about policy. This is about putting in place a timber salvage rider that works, that keeps people working, that uses our timber at its highest economic value, but leaving people in the process. That is what my constituents are so angry about.
