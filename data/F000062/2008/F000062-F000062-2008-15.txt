 President, I rise today to express my support for the legislation approving the United States--India Nuclear Cooperation Agreement.  While I have concerns about this agreement's impact on the nuclear nonproliferation regime and the speed with which it has come to the floor for a vote, I have come to the conclusion that it is in the best interests of the United States and our relationship with India and, with vigorous oversight, will help strengthen our nuclear nonproliferation efforts.  This agreement has wide bipartisan support.
