Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. Rangel) for yielding me this time.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Democratic substitute. The Republican bill is not the way to go. It is going to take the country down the wrong road.  This whole thing is unbelievable. It is unreal. In my 15 years in Congress, I have never seen such a thing. We are now debating the first part of a $2 trillion tax bill, and we are doing it before we have a budget. $2 trillion is a lot of money, especially when it is based on an unreliable 10-year forecast. There are no assurances. There are no guarantees.  What if we are wrong? What if the surplus does not happen? The administration, the Republicans, somebody, somebody is not telling the whole story. They need to be honest with the American people, honest about the true cost of the bill, honest about what will happen if the surplus does not materialize, honest about what will happen to Social Security, to Medicare and other priorities. It is time to tell the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth.  The Republicans are playing with the numbers. It is deceptive. It is a sham. It is a shame. We should be paying down the debt, saving Social Security and Medicare, taking care of the basic human needs of all of our people.  The Republican bill is not right for America. It is not fair, and it is not just. I urge all of my colleagues to vote against it and vote for the Democrat substitute.
