Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding time.  Why would our colleagues Gary Condit  and Mr. Geren and Mr. Moran, Mr. Clinger, Mr. Portman, and this [[Page H352]] Member, and 100 Members of this Congress on both sides of the aisle, join together in a posse, if you will, and indicate that they would work very hard for some kind of bipartisan bill to deal with unfunded mandates and call ourselves the Unfunded Mandates Caucus?  I credit them in regards to their leadership, more especially Mr. Condit, who has persevered on this issue, and now we are about to achieve something that I think will be real progress.  I will tell you why: The cost of Federal regulations today is more than $400 billion annually. That is more than the deficit. The Federal Government now has 122,000 regulatory personnel. The Federal Register has grown from 55,000 pages to 70,000. And in 105 counties in Kansas, every county board meeting that meets, every time during their budget considerations half of their expenditures must go to some form of Federal mandate. Some may be needed, many more are not. And many are silly and counterproductive and destroy the one element, the one issue, that is most important of all, and that is the faith and confidence of the American people in their Government.  There are some that say we need more hearings. My word, we have had hearings for 3 years. Mr. Condit and I wrote the then majority leadership of the appropriate committee, asked for hearings, were denied, had a hearing, had a bill reported, does not do enough. This bill does.  I will tell you why hearings have been held. Every school board, every county board, every city council, every country commission, every cooperative board, every business up and down Main Street, every Member in this Congress has had to go to bat on behalf of a community or a county or an individual or a business.  Those hearings have been held. Let's pass this bill.
