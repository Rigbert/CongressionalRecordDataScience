 President, if I may respond, since I am not the author but only the cosponsor, I do not want to take the liberty of suggesting what the Senator from Arizona meant, but that is my understanding. It is my understanding that the words as drafted now in paragraph 5--and I apologize. I am searching for the language--say each of the threats are self-evidently covered by present NATO doctrine: ``Re-emergence of hegemonic power confronting Europe,'' i.e., Russia. That is part of our existing doctrine today. ``Rogue states and non-state actors possessing nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons and the means to deliver theseweapons by ballistic or cruise missiles,'' et cetera. That, as I read paragraph 10, is contemplated within the ``serious economic, social and political difficulties.'' It says, ``including ethnic rivalries and territorial disputes'' but not limited to those two items.  No. 3, ``Threats of a wider nature, including the disruption of the flow of vital resources'' obviously would affect the economic security and the stability of the NATO nations. No. 4, ``Conflict in the North Atlantic stemming from ethnic and religious enmity.'' That is covered. So as I said----
