President, reserving the right to object, and I shall not, but I would also remind everybody that the distinguished Democratic leader has said he had no objection to going to--this is a court of appeals judge--Thomas Griffith, of Utah, to be U.S. circuit judge for the District of Columbia circuit. While Mr. Griffith is one I would vote against, for reasons I have already stated, from the nose count I have, he would easily be confirmed.  I would also note that I have total agreement with the distinguished senior Senator from Nevada, who said he would be willing to do this in a relatively short time. I just mention that because I would not want anybody to think this is a person being held up, even though some of us object to him.
