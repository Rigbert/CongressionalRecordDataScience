 President, I rise in support of the conference report to accompany the fiscal year 1998 Labor, HHS, and Education appropriations bills, but I am also sadly disappointed in the actions of the other body concerning my amendment to clarify the family violence option.  The conference report before us today in the result of a bipartisan effort that focused on the priorities important to American families; education, a safe work place, biomedical research and disease prevention, child care, Headstart, and low-income energy assistance. I was proud to work with my colleagues in producing this conference report. I want to thank Chairman Specter and Senator Harkin for their willingness to work with all of us in negotiating a final bill with the other body. I also want to thank both of them for including many of my priorities in this final legislation.  I am pleased that we were able to increase our commitment to the Older Americans Act programs, breast and cervical cancer research, heart disease prevention, literacy, child care, Headstart, and maintain a strong Federal role in education. I know that in a balanced budget framework meeting these priorities was a difficult task and am grateful for the leadership shown by Senators Specter and Harkin.  While I worked to ensure the enactment of important increases in our investment in our future, I am sadly disappointed that this final conference report does not include my amendment to protect victims of domestic violence and abuse from the harsh punitive requirements called for in welfare reform. Despite a 98 to 1 vote in the Senate, Republicans on the conference committee from the other body, refused to help victims of family violence from continued abuse. This is a big loss that will come back and haunt us as the States begin full implementation of their welfare reform plans.  The Republicans in the other body seemed more concerned about grossly incorrect statements made by thechairman of the House Ways and Means Committee and the chairman of the Subcommittee on Human Resources. It was interesting to see that the chairman of the Human Resources Subcommittee felt it necessary to attend the final conference meeting to ensure that there was no further effort to give States the flexibility that they need to truly help those victims of domestic violence.  In a letter to the conferees, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee concluded that the way to break the cycle of violence was to improve the self esteem of moms; this could only be accomplished through work. This statement in itself explains the difficulty I have had in getting this amendment enacted into law. There appear to be some Members of Congress who firmly believe that domestic violence is the fault of the woman.  I will ask that this letter be printed in the Record so that the American public can see how some Members of Congress view family violence and abuse.  While I am disappointed in the lack of consensus on my amendment, I am pleased to report that as a result of the courage shown by the Senate and the public debate conducted on my amendment, the chairman of the Human Resources Subcommittee in the other body has pledged his support for hearings on this important initiative. I am also inserting a copy of his letter to me stating his intention to hold these hearings. I intend to hold him to this commitment and am hopeful that hearings will be held early in 1998. Depending upon the status of these hearings, I intend on maintaining my strategy of offering this amendment to each and every appropriate legislative vehicle. I will not give up until this amendment is adopted. The stakes are simply too high. The lives of too many women and children are at stake.  I ask unanimous consent that the letters to which I referred be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                      Committee on Ways and Means,                                     House of Representatives,                               Washington, DC, September 26, 1997.     Hon. John Edward Porter,     Chairman, Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services,          and Education, Washington, DC.       Dear John: We want to draw your attention to a provision      added to the Labor, HHS, and Education appropriations bill in      the Senate that we strongly oppose. Senator Murray and      several others offered a floor amendment concerning domestic      violence that received nearly unanimous support.      Unfortunately, this amendment does not, as claimed      ``clarify'' a provision of last year's historic welfare      reform bill but instead would have the effect of gutting the      reform.       As nearly as we can tell, every Member of Congress and      virtually every American citizen abhors domestic violence.      Every level of government already has strong laws, including      criminal laws, designed to deal with the perpetrators of      domestic violence. Moreover, in the last decade or so, the      nation has made significant progress both in increasing      awareness of this serious problem and inventing both civic      and governmental responses to the problem.       But fighting domestic violence by adopting a national      policy of exempting welfare mothers, who may have been      abused, from the work requirements and time limits of welfare      reform is not a wise policy. First, we cannot understand how      keeping mothers dependent on welfare can help them achieve      independence from an abusive partner. There may be some      exceptions to the rule, but in the vast majority of cases      women who can support themselves and their children have a      much better chance of escaping an abusive relationship. In      recent years, Congress has enacted generous non-welfare      benefits including tax credits, expanded health coverage; and      more day care, all of which are designed to help women with      children become self-supporting. The domestic violence trap      can only be broken when mothers improve their self-esteem      through work. Thus, exempting these mothers from the work      requirements and time limits seems to be precisely the wrong      thing to do.       Second, states already can exempt 75 percent of their      caseload from the work requirement in the first year. Even      when the work requirement is fully implemented in 2002,      states will still be able to exempt half of their caseload.      If in some special circumstances a mother involved in an      abusive relationship would be helped by being temporarily      exempted from the work requirement, states have plenty of      room under existing law to provide the exemption. Similarly,      the 5-year limitation on benefits is drafted so that states      can exempt up to 20 percent of their caseload from the      requirement.       Thus, under current law, states already enjoy a great deal      of flexibility that can be used to address the needs of      individual mothers. To allow states to ignore all cases in      which abuse is involved is to invite them to destroy both the      work requirement and the time limit. We have seen numerous      claims that the original welfare reform bill intended to      allow states to exempt these cases without counting them      against the ceiling on work and time limit exemptions. As the      authors of the original bill and the bill finally enacted by      Congress and signed by the President, we want to clear up      this myth. Such exemptions were never intended. Indeed, every      time they have been proposed, we have fought them. Given the      widespread and widely recognized success of the welfare      reform bill, we believe a change of this magnitude would be      exceptionally destructive--especially when the justification      for making the change is so weak.       Finally, House and Senate rules prohibit legislating      appropriation bills. We all know that when there is      bipartisan agreement and the committee of jurisdiction agrees      with an authorization provision, we tend to overlook these      rules. But we are informing you in the most direct terms that      we strongly oppose this Senate action. If there is any doubt      about whether this provision will be removed from the      conference report, we would like to be informed at the      earliest moment so we can take this issue to the House and      Senate Leadership.       Thanks for your personal help and the help of your staff on      this issue.           Sincerely,     E. Clay Shaw, Jr.,       Chairman, Subcommittee on Human Resources.     Bill Archer,       Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means.                                  ____         House of Representatives, Committee on Ways and Means,            Subcommittee on Human Resources                                 Washington, DC, October 29, 1997.     Hon. Patty Murray,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.     Hon. Arlen Specter,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Murray and Specter: I am writing to you about      the Murray/Wellstone amendment concerning domestic violence      to the FY 1998 Labor, HHS and Education appropriations bill.       As nearly as I can tell, every Member of Congress and      virtually every American citizen abhors domestic violence.      Every level of government already has strong laws, including      criminal laws, designed to deal with the perpetrators of      domestic violence. Moreover, in the last decade or so, the      nation has made significant progress both in increasing      awareness of this serious problem and inventing both civic      and governmental responses to the problem.       The Murray/Wellstone amendment continues this tradition of      both drawing attention to the issue of domestic violence and      creating special conditions for those who have been abused.      Nonetheless, there are several procedural and substantive      reasons why this proposal should not be included in the      Labor, HHS appropriations bill. First, the provision violates      House rules against legislating on an appropriations bill.      Second, it is against regular order to make such significant      changes without committee input. Finally, the Ways and Means      Committee has never had a hearing on the Murray/Wellstone      amendment, so it is unclear whether this change is needed or      what its unanticipated consequences might be.       It is also important to note that, while the Murray/     Wellstone amendment would allow states to exempt an unlimited      number of victims of domestic violence from the welfare      reform law's time limits and work requirements, current law      already exempts 70 percent of the caseload from work      requirements and 20 percent from the 5-year time limit.      States already have the discretion to include any or all      victims of domestic violence under these exemptions.       Each of these factors argues against including the Murray/     Wellstone amendment in the bill currently before the      conference committee. However, as Chairman of the      Subcommittee on Human Resources of the Committee on Ways and      Means, I am offering to convene a subcommittee hearing on      this topic early in the next session, provided that the      Murray/Wellstone amendment is withdrawn from consideration by      the Labor, HHS conference committee. I would expect and look      forward to your appearing as the first witnesses at this      hearing.       I appreciate your consideration of this offer, and look      forward to your response.           Sincerely,                                                     E. Clay Shaw,                                                         Chairman.
