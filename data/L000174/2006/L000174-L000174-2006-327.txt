President, as the Burlington, VT, Boys and Girls Club prepares to begin an ambitious capital fundraising campaign this summer, I am proud to give my strong support to this important organization. As a longtime supporter of this organization in Vermont and across the country, I wish them the best of success in their efforts, and I commend them for striving to continually improve their organization and Vermont's communities.  Through this campaign, the Burlington Boys and Girls Club plans to strengthen its resources with the addition of high-speed Internet access at the club, as well as a multimedia center where members can become proficient in current technology. This is a critical component of success for young people in our increasingly technological society. The club will also reinforce its dedication to creativity through the addition of a visual and performing arts space where members will be able to pursue their artistic expression. These are just a few of the admirable goals set out for this campaign, and I am confident they will be achieved.  The Boys and Girls Clubs around the country are a leading example of how the support and care of our young people benefits American society, one boy and one girl at a time. The Boys and Girls Clubs have proven that when we show our young people that we care about them and that we care about their futures, they respond with positive and constructive actions in their communities.  We also know the Boys and Girls Clubs provide a healthy alternative for many young people and oftentimes prevent them from being drawn into gangs, drug abuse, and other crime. The clubs instill leadership qualities, respect, and thoughtfulness in participants through programs that include art, athletics, help with schoolwork, technology, life skills, training in resistance to drugs and alcohol, and community service. In providing these valuable programs during critical development periods when young people are most vulnerable, the Boys and Girls Clubs fill a void and reduce the opportunity to succumb to negative influences. The Boys and Girls Clubs represent the best of what communities can do to improve the lives of their young people.  I know firsthand how well Boys and Girls Clubs work and what topnotch organizations they are. When I was a prosecutor in Vermont, I was convinced of the great need for Boys and Girls Clubs because we rarely encountered children from these kinds of programs. In fact, after I became a U.S. Senator, a police chief was such a big fan that he asked me to help fund a Boys and Girls Club in his district rather than helping him pay for a couple more police officers.  Over the years, I have worked with other members of the Senate to make sure the Boys and Girls Clubs around the country have the funding necessary to carry out their mission. Since 1998, we have worked to steadily increase Federal funding for the Boys and Girls clubs each year. This year, as the chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Specter and I have recommended $80 million in funding to help keep this organization a strong and vital part of their communities, from coast to coast. As a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, I look forward to seeing that these funds are appropriated for this important work.  Represented in all 50 States, the 3,700 branches of the Boys and Girls Club reach more than 4.4 million young people. The Boys and Girls Club of Burlington alone serves more than 1,400 young people each year. Through continued funding, Boys and Girls Clubs around the country will serve 6 million young people by January of 2007. The growth of these clubs across our country has been a true success story, and I am proud to work to ensure the Federal Government's continued support.  As the Burlington Boys and Girls Club kicks off its capital campaign, I commend all of Vermont's Boys and Girls Clubs, along with all of the other clubs across our Nation, for the important work they do to help our young citizens become exceptional adults.                          ____________________
