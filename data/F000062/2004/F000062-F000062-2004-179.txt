 President, I rise today to introduce a bill with Senators Domenici, Boxer, and Dayton to allow youth service and conservation corps to partner with public land management agencies to restore and protect public lands threatened by severe fire. I have dubbed this public-private partnership the Healthy Forests Youth Conservation Corps.  Last year, I authored a similar provision that was included in the Senate version of the Healthy Forest legislation. Unfortunately, this provision was stripped out of the bill before it was signed into law.  First, this bill aims to help Federal, State, and local governments implement priority projects using the cost-saving resources of youth corps.  It is estimated that youth corps generate $1.60 in immediate benefits for every dollar in costs. This figure is important given the great need and cost associated with fighting fires.  Every year, land management agencies are charged with conserving, protecting, and maintaining millions of acres of public land. This is a daunting task that requires an incredible amount of human and material resources.  For instance, the Federal Government, alone, is responsible for overseeing 689 million acres of this land. Last year, five Federal agencies reported spending $1.6 billion in 2002 on fire fighting suppression efforts--a whopping $300 million more than the previous record. To fight those fires, 28,000 fire and support personnel were activated--the maximum civilian resources available in the Forest Service on top of the 600 Army troops, and 950 foreign firefighters who joined in the effort.  As an example of what can happen in one State, consider last year's catastrophic wildfires in southern California. Before they were contained, the deadly fires of last fall scorched a total of 738,158 acres, killed 23 people, and destroyed approximately 3,626 homes and thousands of other structures--amounting to the most costly and devastating fire ever to hit California. The insurance payouts alone will cost more than $3 billion, with public expenditures to fight the fires and recover from them running into the hundreds of millions of dollars.  And those statistics make no mention of the resources expended to fight fires in other States.  I want to prevent this type of catastrophe in the future. That is why I was an ardent supporter of the Healthy Forest Restoration Act that was signed into law last year.  I also believe that we must use every resource at our disposal to meet this challenge. In my opinion, youth service and conversation corps can play a significant role in reducing the physical and financial strain that public land management agencies bear and help protect our Nation's public lands from wildfires.  Secondly, this bill allows young people, particularly those youth who are people of color, low income, or are at high risk of dropping out of school, to integrate themselves into their communities and to learn skills that could lead to jobs or a greater interest in higher education in the future.  I have seen firsthand the benefits that youth corps bring to their communities and the difference that the work can make in the lives of at-risk youth.  In 1983, I founded the first urban youth corps as mayor of San Francisco, and during that time I saw a great improvement in the quality of life of the corps members and of the city itself.  When we first began the program, we ran it on a million-dollar budget employing 36 disadvantaged young people ranging in age between 18 and 23 years old who needed some direction, wanted a challenge, and wanted to make themselves socially useful.  That first year, we paid corps members $3.35 an hour to repair bathrooms in affordable housing for senior citizens and ex-offenders, build a park in Hunter's Point, clear scotch broom from the Twin Peaks hillside, and fix up Alcatraz Island. And in the 21 years since the program began, it has grown into a multisite, multifaceted agency that engages more than 500 young adults annually who have completed over 3.5 million hours of community service.  It has given thousands of corps members a sense of personal pride, helped to connect them with their community and see for themselves that hard work pays off.  I started the San Francisco Conservation Corps to help young people break out of the cycle of poverty and crime and improve their job skills by giving them guidance and support through labor-intensive activities.  For this same reason, I am introducing this bill with the hope that the success of the San Francisco Conservation Corps can be duplicated nationwide.  Specifically, this bill does the following: It authorizes the Agriculture and Interior Secretaries to enter into contracts or cooperative agreements with existing State, local, and nonprofit youth conservation corps to carry out land management initiatives on public lands.  It directs the Secretaries to give priority for projects that will reduce hazardous fuels on public land, restore land located in near municipal watersheds and municipal waters supplies, rehabilitate land affected or altered by fire, assess lands afflicted or imminently threatened by disease or insect infestation, work to address windthrown land or at high risk of reburn, provide emergency assistance and disaster relief to communities.  It allows the Secretaries to grant, at their discretion, noncompetitive hiring status for corps alumni for future Federal hiring.  It authorizes $25 million for the alliance for fiscal year 2005-fiscal year 2009.  I know this program will not take all of the burden off public land management agencies as they work to protect and restore public lands, and I know this program will not reach every disadvantaged young person in need of guidance and support. But it is a start and I urge my colleagues to join me in my efforts.                                 ______                                       By
