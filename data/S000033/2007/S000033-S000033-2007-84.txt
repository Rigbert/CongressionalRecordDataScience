 President, let me conclude by applauding Majority Leader Harry Reid, Chairman Kent Conrad, and Senators Schumer, Dorgan, and Boxer for publicly expressing their opposition to the Nussle nomination.  The bottom line is today the economy is doing very well if you are in the top 1 percent, if you are a millionaire or a billionaire. But if you are in themiddle class, if you are a working person, the likelihood is you work longer hours for lower wages.  We need a change in economic policy. We need an OMB Director who can advise the President about the reality of the vast majority of the people, and not just the very wealthiest people in our country.  I yield the floor.
