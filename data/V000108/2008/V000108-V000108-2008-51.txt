The church, which has seen tremendous growth and progress since its humble beginning, will be celebrating this exceptional milestone with festivities beginning on Friday, June 6, and continuing through Sunday, June 8, 2008. The theme for this extraordinary event is ``Anchored in Faith: Yesterday, Today, and Forever.''  The celebration of First Baptist Church's 100th anniversary, ``Dedicated to the Glory of God and the Service of Man,'' will begin on Friday, June 6, 2008, with a banquet at the Genesis Convention Center in Gary, Indiana, and will continue on Saturday, June 7, with a community event featuring vendors, a petting zoo, and a museum dedicated to the history of the church. Finally, on Sunday, June 8, a very special worship service will take place, followed by a musical concert featuring the First Baptist choirs, former musicians and soloists, and other special guests.  From its modest beginnings, First Baptist Church has emerged as a pillar of the Gary community. Although First Baptist, the oldest African-American congregation in the City of Gary, has seen immense growth, not only in the size of its congregation but also in the depth of the services and programs available to its members, the clergy and congregation have remained dedicated to the fundamental ideal of serving God by serving each other.  Only 2 years after the City of Gary, Indiana, was founded, three individuals, Raymond Rankins, Samuel Duncan, and Samuel Clay, realizing the need for a church of their own in Gary, called upon Dr. Elijah John Fisher, pastor of Olivet Baptist Church in Chicago, for assistance in making this dream a reality. Through their efforts, First Baptist emerged in Gary, with the first services being held in the home of Mr. Rankins. Soon after, membership in the church began to increase, and the first house of worship was constructed at 1617 Washington Street in Gary. After various reconstructions and relocations First Baptist finally settled in its current location at 626 West 21st Avenue in 1955, under the leadership of the Reverend Dr. Robert E. Penn, who served as pastor for more than 20 years. During his tenure, Reverend Penn was focused on being involved in the community, resulting in the creation of a foreign missionary project, a college scholarship fund, and a housing development program. Reverend Penn's vision has continued through today, and he continues to resonate as a shining example of selfless service and unwavering commitment to the community.  Since taking over as pastor on March 30, 1996, the Reverend Dr. Bennie T. Henson, Sr., has continued to spearhead projects aimed at improving not only the church but the community as well. Under Reverend Henson's direction, the Images of Hope initiative was created, which is designed to improve the human condition of the needy and underserved people of Gary. During his tenure, the congregation of First Baptist also witnessed the emergence of Saturday Night Alive, an alternative worship service, and Friday Night Out, a community movie night. In addition, numerous advances have been made during this time in the area of technology, allowing the congregation and the community access to First Baptist Church via the Internet.  Madam Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring and congratulating the Reverend Dr. Bennie T. Henson, Sr., and First Baptist Church of Gary on their 100th anniversary. Throughout the years, the clergy and members of First Baptist Church have dedicated themselves to providing spirituality and guidance through their service to their community. Their constant dedication and commitment is worthy of our deepest admiration.                          ____________________
