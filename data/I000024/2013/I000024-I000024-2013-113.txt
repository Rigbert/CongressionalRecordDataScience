President, I wish to quote from the letter I just submitted for the Record, and I ask my colleagues to listen to the quote. These are two ladies who are spouses of servicemen. They said:       There is no such thing as a person-less war. Our military      cannot afford for Americans to forget that wars and battles      and military strikes are fought by troops, that troops are      people, and that those people have families. In our military      communities this summer we couldn't even afford to pay      Federal employees for a five-day work week. Military families      can't get doctors' appointments and can't get counseling      services needed to grapple with the problems we already have,      problems largely created by almost 12 years of war. Today      clinic hours are being slashed--along with pretty much every      other service military families need. Walking around our      communities lately, it doesn't look like we can afford much      of anything--and certainly not a whole new war.  I am still quoting now these wives of our military men:       And maybe someday we will be able to fight whole wars      without using a single human, but today, in 2013, we can't      have a surgical strike without someone saying where to drop      the bombs or where to aim those missiles. And those planes      that drop the bombs? The destroyers that carry the missiles?      They have pilots, captains, and crews. All humans. Even the      ``unmanned'' drones have human pilots, and the psychological      wear and tear on them is staggering. Planes take off from      airfields in foreign lands and from aircraft carriers, both      of which are staffed by thousands of American somebodies,      just like those destroyer ships. At every turn in a military      operation you will find people. Intel analysts, linguists,      flight crews, and cooks. Even war plans . . . rely on      thousands of people who will be pulled to a new duty, which      causes reshuffling far and wide in the military community.      And this, most definitely, affects our military families.  Again, that is a quote from two of the wives of our current servicemen. I hope all of my colleagues will read this letter. I hope they understand that the decisions we make this week about whether to go to war in Syria have a human dimension.  If we expect the brave men and women in our military to go to foreign lands and risk their lives on our behalf, we have a moral obligation to ensure that they and their families have the support and the resources that are required. Sequestration has already inflicted severe damage on our military, and we are now only a couple of weeks from another $52 billion being slashed from an already devastated military budget.  I have been clear that I don't support the President's call for military action in Syria. He still hasn't presented Congress and the American people with a plan for what he wants to accomplish, how he intends to accomplish it, or how he intends to pay for it. Will the President pay for this operation with more furloughs and by grounding more squadrons again? The CNO has already come forward and stated that if operations against Syria extend into October, he won't be able to afford it and will likely require supplemental funding from Congress.  Furthermore, the President hasn't told us how a strike in Syria fits into a broader strategy for the Middle East. What we decide to do is not just about Syria. It is bigger than that. This is about the growing threat from Iran, stability in the Middle East, and our commitment to Israel and allies and our ability to respond to other contingencies that are there.  I recall knowing what was going to happen. This is 4\1/2\ years ago, back when President Obama was first elected, his first election. I knew that when he came out with his first budget, he was going to do something devastating to the military. So I put myself into Afghanistan, knowing, with the tanks going back and forth, that I would be able to get the interest and the attention of the American people, and it worked. So in that very first budget 4\1/2\ years ago, he did away with the early fifth-generation bomber then, the F-22; did away with our future combat system--the first ground capability increase in about 50 years; did away with our lift capacity, the C-17. Then, the worst thing, which I hope doesn't turn out to create the worst problem for America, he did away with the ground-based operation in Poland. That was just the first budget. That was 4\1/2\ years ago. Since that time, in his extended budget, he has taken $487 billion out of the military, and with sequestration it will be another $\1/2\ trillion. This just can't happen.  It is not just me who is saying this. People would expect it more from me. I am the ranking member on the Senate Armed Services Committee. I have gone there and worked with these guys and noticed the problems they have. I would suggest that not just me but Admiral Winnefeld, who is the second highest military guy, the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said:       There could be, for the first time in my career-- An      admiral speaking now, the second highest person in our      military--       instances where we may be asked to respond to a crisis and      we will have to say we cannot.  And then we go to the very top person, General Dempsey, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who said, ``Our military force is so degraded, so unready, it would be immoral to use force.''  I only say this because we are going to be facing this, and I would be opposed to this even with my amendment to postpone the sequestration of the military for 1 year. However, if that passes, I will still oppose this taking place. I don't think many people in America realize what has happened to our military under the Obama administration.  Well, I have just stated what has happened. This is certainly not a time when we would use force in Syria. Keep in mind that General Dempsey said it would be immoral to use force, we are so degraded, and that is exactly what we will be voting on in the next couple of days.  With that, I yield the floor.                          ____________________
