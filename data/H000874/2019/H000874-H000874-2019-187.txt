Speaker, I wrote the gentleman a letter. Did he believe that that ad that I complained about and that I thought was so egregious, so disgusting, does he agree with me that that ad totally misrepresented what socialism is? It deluded the American people. It was a big lie. Does the gentleman agree with me?                              {time}  1130
