Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time, and I thank him so very much for bringing up this important amendment.  I think it is important for the membership to know this does not involve any new money but merely a reallocation of funds within the Food and Drug Administration itself. So this is a very, very worthy amendment.  We have had to try to fight in this bill and the bill last year to try to get more attention to the approval of generic drugs, which so many Americans obviously need. They are a lot less expensive. I can remember when Claude Pepper used to stand on this floor trying to get generic drug incentives put into the law.  So I want to thank the gentleman from Ohio, as always, taking the leadership on health questions and certainly trying to get medicine to people who need it. In my neighborhood, there are many citizens who make a choice between food and medicine every weekend when they shop at the local supermarket. This will help families like them.  We need to get FDA working more quickly. And I am so happy that the gentleman from the Committee on Energy and Commerce has brought this to our attention and has given us additional drive to get additional generic drugs approved. So I fully support his amendment. It is within the budget resolution and within our allocation, and I would urge the membership to support him.
