  To date, 17 people have confirmed anthrax infections, four of whom died from inhalation anthrax. This toll, though tragic, could have grown exponentially if the perpetrators had used a more sophisticated delivery system.  Despite anthrax's and other agents' potential for weaponization, our government does not keep track of who possesses them. No special certification is required to possess these agents. Nor are background checks conducted on the laboratory personnel who handle or have access to these agents.  This situation must change.  The legislation I am introducing expands upon the antiterrorism bill Congress passed and the President signed just days ago. That bill prohibited an individual from possessing anthrax or other potential weapons of bioterror unless the individual could show legitimate purpose for holding the substance once caught. This standard of ``legitimate purpose;' is not defined, and will put the burden on courts and law enforcement to determine what a ``legitimate purpose'' is.  The fact is that current law still does not adequately prevent individual possession of these dangerous agents.  During a hearing in the Technology and Terrorism Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee yesterday, it became clear to those of us on the committee that law enforcement does not know who has anthrax, where it is stored, or what is being done with it.  When asked if domestic laboratories were the source of the anthrax sent to Senator Daschle's office, the FBI witness said the FBI didn't know.  When asked how many labs in the United States handle anthrax or are capable of developing the highly refined anthrax used in the Daschle letter, the FBI answered again that it did not know.  When asked how many labs in the United States handle anthrax or are capable of devlopoing the highly refined anthrax used in the Daschle letter, the FBI answered again that it did not know.  And the same goes for more than three dozen other dangerous agents like small pox, ebola virus, and ricin.  Under our legislation, no individual could possess any of these dangerous agents, period.  Any medical or research lab wishing to possess or use these dangerous agents must first be certified by the United States Department of Health and Human Services.  Individuals in those labs who handle or who have access to these agents must undergo background checks, and the labs themselves must institute strict safety precautions.  And every single research lab, medical office, or other entity wishing to possess any one of these 40 some agents ruled dangerous by the CDC must demonstrate to the Secretary a legitimate purpose for that possession.  The purpose of the legislation is to assure that law enforcement and public health officials know much more about who has these agents, where and how they are stored, and what is being done with them.  Right now, we do not have this information.  Moreover, the bill will make it harder for terrorists to get access to these agents by requiring background checks and assuring that labs possessing these agents have adequately security safeguards.  I can think of no legitimate reason why an ordinary person needs to possess his or her personal cache of anthrax, small pox, or ebola virus.  According to the calculations of some experts, biological weapons are pound for pound potentially more lethal even than thermonuclear weapons.  For instance, a 1993 report by the U.S. Congressional Office of Technology Assessment estimated that between 130,000 and 3 million deaths could follow the aerosolized release of 100 keg of anthrax spores upwind of the Washington, DC area--lethally matching or exceeding that of a hydrogen bomb.  It is time to acknowledge that we live in a world where the government must take responsibility in protecting the public from those who would misuse these materials. No longer can we stand by and let the balance tip towards free possession of dangerous, even deadly, biological agents.  I urge my colleagues to support this bill                                 ______                                       By Mr. Feingold:  S. 1664. A bill to require country of origin labeling of raw agricultural forms of ginseng, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.  Mr. Feingold. Madam President, I rise today to introduce legislation that addresses the increased amount of smuggled and mis-labeled ginseng entering this country.  This legislation is similar to a bill that I introduced in the last Congress, but is strengthened with a number of provisions based on the suggestions from ginseng growers and the Ginseng Board of Wisconsin.  In addition to proposing a refined process of country-of-origin labeling for ginseng products, my new legislation closes a loophole in the regulations governing dietary supplements, where producers of products other than ginseng are currently advertising them as a type of ginseng.  In order to coordinate the efforts to eliminate the practice of ginseng smuggling, this legislation also requires the Department of Justice, EPA, and other Federal agencies to coordinate their efforts to crack down on smuggled ginseng, which often contains pesticides that are banned for use in the United States.  Chinese and Native American cultures have used ginseng for thousandsof years for herbal and medicinal purposes.  In America, ginseng is experiencing a newfound popularity, and I am proud to say that my home State of Wisconsin is playing a central role in ginseng's resurgence.  Wisconsin produces 97 percent of the ginseng grown in the United States, and 85 percent of the country's ginseng is grown in Marathon County.  The ginseng industry is a economic boon to Marathon County, as well as an example of the high quality for which Wisconsin's agriculture industry is known.  Wisconsin ginseng commands a premium price in world markets because it is of the highest quality and because it has a lower pesticide and chemical content.  With a huge market for this high-quality ginseng overseas, and growing popularity for the ancient root here at home, Wisconsin's ginseng industry should have a prosperous future ahead.  Unfortunately, the outlook for ginseng farmers is marred by a serious problem--smuggled and mislabed ginseng. Wisconsin ginseng is considered so superior to ginseng grown abroad that smugglers will go to great lengths to label ginseng grown in Canada or Asia as ``Wisconsin-grown.''  Here's how the switch takes place: Smugglers take Asian or Canadian-growing ginseng and ship it to plants in China, allegedly to have the ginseng sorted into various grades.  Whle the sorting process is itself a legitimate part of distributing ginseng, smugglers often use it as a ruse to switch Wisconsin ginseng with the Asian or Canadian ginseng considered inferior by consumers.  The smugglers know that while Chinese-grown ginseng has a retail of about $5-$6 per pound, while Wisconsin-grown ginseng is valued at roughly $16-$20 per pound.  To make matters even tougher for Wisconsin's ginseng farmers, there is no accurate way of testing ginseng to determine where it was grown, other than testing for pesticides that are legal in Canada and China but are banned in the United States.  And in some cases, smugglers can even find ways around the pesticide tests. Last year, a ConsumerLab.com study confirmed that much of the ginseng sold in the U.S. contained harmful chemicals and metals, such as lead and arsenic.  That is because the majority of ginseng sold in the U.S originates from countries with lower pesticide standards, so it's vitally important that consumers know which ginseng is really grown in Wisconsin.  Some domestic and foreign countries are also labeling certain products as ginseng when they are in fact a distinctly different product. Due to a loophole in the regulations governing dietary supplements, products other than ginseng are currently advertising themselves as a type of ginseng. For example, some products claim to include a product known as ``Siberian Ginseng,'' which is actually Eleutherococcus, a bush that is a distinctly different product from ginseng.  Ginseng is a root, not a bush, and consumers have the right to know that when they reach for a high quality ginseng product, they are buying just that--gingseng, not some ground up bush.  For the sake of ginseng farmers and consumers, the U.S. Senate must crack down on smuggled and mislabeled ginseng.  Without adequate labeling, consumers have no way of knowing the most basic information about the ginseng they purchase, where it was grown, what quality or grade it is, or whether it contains dangerous pesticides.  My legislation proposes some common sense steps to address two of the challenges facing the ginseng industry, and none of these proposals costs the taxpayers a dime.  The first section requires mandatory country of origin labeling at the port of entry, to prevent the practice of mixing foreign ginseng with domestic ginseng. This would allow buyers of ginseng to more easily prevent foreign companies from mixing foreign produced ginseng with ginseng produced in America. The country of origin labeling is a simple but effective way to enable consumers to make an informed decision.  This legislation also closes a loophole in U.S. law that allows products other than ginseng to advertise themselves as a type of ginseng. Under my proposal, when a consumer purchases a product labeled as containing ginseng, they will know what they are buying.  This legislation also requires the Department of Justice, EPA, and other Federal agencies to coordinate their efforts to crack down on smuggled ginseng, which often contains pesticides that are banned for use in the United States. The lax enforcement of smuggled ginseng also puts our producers on an unfair playing field. The mixing of superior Wisconsin ginseng with lower quality foreign ginseng root penalizes the grower and eliminates the incentive to provide the consumer with a superior product.  We must give ginseng growers the support they deserve by implementing these common sense reforms that also help consumers make informed choices about the ginseng that they consume.  We must ensure when ginseng consumers reach for a quality ginseng product, such as Wisconsin grown ginseng, that they are getting the real thing, not a cheap imitation.                                 ______                                       By
