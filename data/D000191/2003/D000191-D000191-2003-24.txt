Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time. I am pleased we are taking up this bill today. For too many years the needs of the Coast Guard were neglected as we failed year after year to pass authorizing bills, and the amount of funds to the Coast Guard for their mission were inadequate.  Their mission, of course, today, is even more difficult than it was then; but I think that this bill is beginning to recognize the need for more funds, the need for better housing allowances, the need of fulfilling that expanded mission. So I am pleased to stand in general support of the bill before the House.                              {time}  1600  I mean, the Coast Guard is crucial to my District. I represent more than halfthe Oregon coast, difficult port entrances, still an active fishing fleet and pleasure boats, and the Coast Guard is called upon many times to conduct rescues at the risk of their own life and also to do fisheries enforcement, drug interdiction and now, of course, the whole new emphasis on homeland security and all the problems in that.  There are two issues where I would raise concerns. The first, I will have an amendment on later, and that is the potential that the Coast Guard museum, which I support the idea of a Coast Guard museum, could be sited on property taken by eminent domain, and I think Congress should speak clearly on that issue, and I will have an amendment on that later.  The other is something I have raised with the Commandant in hearings, and it is just a general note of concern to other Members of Congress. I feel that the Coast Guard is doing an excellent job in its mission of homeland security, but the one place where I would fault them is as our lead negotiator with the International Maritime Organization.  The International Maritime Organization works by consensus, and often I feel rather than us setting down a hard marker and saying, this is where the rest of the world has to go on shipping, crew certification and safety issues, the Coast Guard gets much too involved in bargaining. We should lead by example with world standards. It is not enough to say, well, we always have port/State control issues where we can board these ships once they get here. No, we do not want those ships on the ocean at all. We do not want ships out there where we do not know who the owners are. We do not want ships out there where we do not know who the crews are, and we do not want ships out there when we do not know what the cargoes are.  Those are extraordinary threats both to the safety, the environment as with the New Carissa incident in my district. We had a totally incompetent foreign skipper, who did everything in defiance of good practice and managed to put his ship on the beach, spilling a tremendous amount of bunker fuel, causing an environmental disaster, and the ship is still there. He skipped out of the country before we could put him in jail unfortunately, but I do not think he will be coming back, but there are other skippers like that out there, not to say there are not many good ones.  But we need better crew certification requirements. We cannot have these paper schools that issue certificates. That is what we have got today. We are allowing to say, well, these schools exist in the Philippines. There is no one that goes around to certify that the schools exist, certify the curriculum, certify people have gone through the curriculum. We do not know who the crew members are. We do not have noncounterfeitable ID cards. We do not have a way of knowing better what the cargo is.  The Coast Guard is just starting to work on these things, and they are not taking the toughest position they could in the International Maritime Organization to secure our borders, our security and our safety, and I just want to urge them to redouble their efforts and set a higher standard to protect the homeland of the United States of America.
