 President, I oppose the Vitter amendment No. 4273. Most homes mapped into the mandatory coverage areas will only see limited increases in their premium rates.  Homes or properties mapped into the higher risk areas should pay higher rates to match the reality of higher risk. Out-of-date maps that have vastly underclassified risk need to be updated, and delay in requiring property owners to pay their full freight is an extension of the inadvertent subsidies provided by inaccurate maps.  I urge my colleagues to join Senator Dodd and me in opposing the Vitter amendment.  I ask for the yeas and nays.
