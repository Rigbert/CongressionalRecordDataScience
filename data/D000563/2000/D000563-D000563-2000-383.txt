President, I ask for a clarification from the Chair.  It is my understanding that the Republican side of the aisle was given 45 minutes in morning business, and they were to complete that at 10:15. But they started a little late, and now it is after 10:25. I want a clarification that the Democratic side, in morning business, will be given the entire 45 minutes allocated.
