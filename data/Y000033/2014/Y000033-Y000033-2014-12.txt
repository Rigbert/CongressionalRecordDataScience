Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise in strong support and congratulate Congressmen Jared Huffman and Doug LaMalfa. This is a good piece of legislation, and I have to go back through history a little bit.  Being originally from California 63 years ago, I remember Trinity County as one of the richer counties when we had a timber industry, and Weaverville was one of the largest timber cities in the country, but it is no longer. It is really a very poor county because of the management of Federal lands and how they do not manage them.  Again, I compliment the two Congressmen for working on this legislation, and I urge the passage of the bill.  I yield back the balance of my time.
