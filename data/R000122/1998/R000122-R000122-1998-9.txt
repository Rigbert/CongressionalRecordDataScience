President, I rise today to speak on an issue which affects many of our nation's air travelers. I am pleased to offer an amendment to the Senate's Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) reauthorization bill which requires the Secretary of Transportation to implement regulations that ensure airline passengers are more aware of the true corporate identity of the airline on which they are flying.  I am pleased that the managers of the FAA reauthorization legislation have agreed to accept my amendment to their bill. I believe this amendment will go a long way to ensure that airline passengers are better informed.  As you know, Mr. President, following the deregulation of the airline industry in the late 1970's, major airlines began to enter into cooperative agreements with smaller airlines to offer air transportation service to smaller, underserved areas. Common in such agreements is the practice of ``code-sharing,'' where the smaller independent airlines use the name and identification code of the larger airline. For example, for a two-leg ``code-shared'' flight, where a large air carrier operates one leg and a smaller commutercarrier operates the other, air service for both flight segments is listed under the same identification code. As such, consumers purchasing ``code-shared'' air service are frequently unaware of the actual corporate identity of the smaller commuter airline on which they are flying.  Mr. President, this lack of disclosure can cause consumers to be completely unaware of the true identity of their transporting air carrier, and therefore, lessen a consumer's ability to make the most informed transportation decision.  Mr. President, under current law, U.S. air carrier ticket agents are required to verbally indicate to consumers the corporate identity of the airline they are flying on, when a ticket is purchased.  However, in practice, Mr. President, these verbal disclosure rules are difficult to enforce. Furthermore, the rules are not applied universally because they do not cover travel agents, who sell a majority of the airline tickets issued in the United States.  As a result, Mr. President, consumers are often surprised to discover that a segment of their flight, although listed under the ``code'' or name of a large air carrier, could be serviced by a different airline.  Now, Mr. President, I do not mean to suggest that smaller commuter airlines are not safe, nor, do I mean to diminish the valuable service ``code-sharing'' arrangements bring to many smaller and rural areas in the nation. Rather, I want to help ensure that consumers are aware of the true identity of the airline they are scheduled to fly on.  For these reasons, I offered this amendment to require stronger airline ticketing disclosure rules, an issue the Department of Transportation recently considered.  Indeed, in 1994, the Department of Transportation proposed a rule to require that at the time of sale, travel or airline ticket agents provide consumers with written notification of each airline's corporate name that participate in ``code-sharing'' agreements. The Department asserted such steps would help to ensure that a consumer had a complete understanding of the transportation they were purchasing. However, to date, the Department has not issued a final rule on this matter.  Mr. President, the Department of Transportation was on the right track, and we need to encourage the DOT to follow through and implement better ticketing disclosure regulations to help better inform consumers. My amendment is simple and straightforward, and does just that. It requires the DOT to implement regulations 90 days after enactment of this bill requiring improved written and oral notification of the corporate name of ``code-sharing'' airlines. Such requirements would inform consumers of the identity of the air transportation carrier actually providing service, and thereby allow consumers to make more informed purchasing decisions. My amendment also grants the DOT flexibility in this process, and allows the Department to choose the method it deems most appropriate to achieve this goal.  Mr. President, the basis for my amendment is also straightforward: Just four years ago, a constituent of mine, Ms. Pauline Josefson, of Warwick, Rhode Island died in a commuter airline crash. The airline she flew on was listed under a major carrier's identification code.  Ms. Josefson had every reason to assume that the air service she had purchased was that of the major carrier, as her airline tickets indicated. However, she was flying on a plane piloted by an individual who had been repeatedly criticized by other airlines for poor performance and flying ability. If the little known airline's actual corporate name had been disclosed when the ticket was purchased, Ms. Josefson would have had an opportunity to make a fully informed travel decision.  I share the concerns of the Josefson family and others that airline consumers deserve greater disclosure. That is why I have offered this amendment today, Mr. President, which is supported by the Aviation Consumer Action Project, a non-profit organization dedicated to the safety and protection of the flying public, and I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support for this amendment be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                 Aviation Consumer                                               Action Project,                                               September 24, 1998.     Re: legislation requiring airline disclosure of code sharing          arrangements to consumers.     Senator Jack Reed,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Reed: In response to your request for our      comments concerning your draft legislation on code sharing      disclosure, the Aviation Consumer Action Project supports      such a measure as necessary to curb a common deceptive      marketing practice by airlines which is not permitted in      other industries.       General Motors cannot sell you a Cadillac then deliver a      Toyota or even a Mercedes without first informing the      customer. Only the airlines are except from state and local      consumer protection and deceptive advertising laws and even      most federal labeling laws. The U.S. DOT is the exclusive      agency protecting aviation consumers since the enactment of      the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978.       Airlines, using techniques known as ``code sharing'' and      ``wet leases'', are now allowed to sell consumers tickets on      other airlines as though they were their own. So for example,      someone booking a flight on a U.S. carrier to Warsaw, Poland      may actually be flying from New York to London on an American      carrier and then to Poland on Lod Airlines (the Polish      national carrier) at both a higher cost than if tickets were      separately booked and with what most would regard as a lower      level of safety and service. Similarly, many airlines use      prop commuter airplanes that they do not own or operate with      a U.S. carrier brand name like ``Delta Connection''. After      the recent crash of Swissair 111 which killed all on board,      it was disclosed that 53 of the passengers were actually      Delta passengers, flying under an apparently undisclosed code      sharing agreement. Such marketing arrangements are inherently      deceptive and should be prohibited, unless disclosed in      advance to the airline passenger. The consumer can then      decide whether to purchase the ticket or call another      airline.       The consumer notice should be in the form as proposed by      the U.S. DOT in 1995 which was never acted upon, i.e.      ``IMPORTANT NOTICE: Service between XYZ City and ABC City      will be operated by Jane Doe Airlines'', and in advertising      airlines should be required to identify the carrier(s) that      will actually provide the service by corporate name.
