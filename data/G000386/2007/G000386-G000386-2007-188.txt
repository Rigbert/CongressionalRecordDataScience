 President, I thank the chairman of the committee for his kind words, and my kind words go to reemphasize the close working relationship over a period of 6 years, now going into the seventh year, he and I have had being leaders of both the Republican and Democratic members of the Finance Committee. I thank him very much for continuing that working relationship while he was chairman a few years ago and now chairman again. That is why this committee produces legislation that eventually gets to the President. I thank the Senator very much.
