 President, today the Senate will immediately resume consideration of the Hatch disclosure amendment to the campaign finance reform legislation. There will be up to 30 minutes of debate, with the vote to occur shortly after 9:30 a.m. Additional amendments will be offered throughout this day. It is hoped that some time on each amendment can be yielded back to accommodate all Senators who intend to offer their amendments. Senators will be notified as votes are scheduled, and also as a reminder votes will occur during tomorrow's session.  Mr. President, I see Senator Hatch is present to discuss his amendment.                          ____________________
