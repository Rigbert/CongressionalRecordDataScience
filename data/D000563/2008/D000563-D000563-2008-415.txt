President, I have just learned of the death in Iraq of an extraordinarily brave woman from my State of Illinois who died this week in a bombing in the Sadr City section of Baghdad. Nicole Suveges was a civilian assigned to the 3rd Brigade Combat Team for the 4th Infantry Division.  She was a political scientist from Illinois and a doctoral student at Johns Hopkins University. She was participating in a program that embeds academics into military units to help personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan navigate difficult local environments.  She chose to go to Iraq for her employer, BAE Systems, because she was interested in learning how people make the transition from an authoritarian society to freedom; that was the focus of her doctoral dissertation. She hoped she might use her knowledge to help Iraqis develop the habits and institutions of democracy.  When she died in a bombing on Tuesday, she was helping local officials mediate disputes in Sadr City. Also killed in the blast were two U.S. soldiers and a State Department Foreign Service Officer.  Iraq was not the first war zone Nicole had worked in. She served as an Army Reservist in Bosnia in the 1990s.  Nicole graduated from the University of Illinois in Chicago in 1992. She was 38 years old. She was one of more than 180 American civilians to die in the war in Iraq. Their deaths are in addition to the 4,113 members of the U.S. military who have lost their lives in Iraq.  Nicole Suveges represented what is best about America. She used her considerable courage and knowledge to try to help heal a badly scarred nation and help Iraqis create for themselves a freer, more secure future. Her death is a loss to Iraq, to America, and to the world.  We extend our condolences to her husband and family, and her friends and colleagues. I ask unanimous consent that a CNN account of Nicole Suveges' life and work be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                   American Grad Student Dies in Iraq       An American graduate student who went to Iraq to find ways      to help ordinary citizens persevere in a transitioning      government was one of two American civilians killed in a Sadr      City bombing.       Nicole Suveges' a married political scientist from      Illinois, was part of a program that embeds academics into      military units to help personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan      navigate the local environment, according to her employer,      BAE Systems.       Suveges, who started her tour with Human Terrain System in      April, had been assigned to support the 3rd Brigade Combat      Team for the 4th Infantry Division in ``political, cultural,      and tribal engagements,'' a statement from the program said.       She was one of four Americans to die in the Sadr City      bombing Tuesday. Two U.S. soldiers and a State Department      employee, Steven Farley, who worked with the provincial      reconstruction team, also were killed in the blast.       ``Nicole was a leading academic who studied for years on      how to improve conditions for others,'' Doug Belair,      president of BAE's Technology Solutions & Services, said in a      written statement. ``She came to us to give freely of herself      in an effort to make a better world.''       Suveges was the second BAE employee to die in a combat zone      this year. Michael V. Bhatia, 31, a social scientist from      Medway, Massachusetts, died in a roadside bombing May 7 in      Afghanistan, BAE said.       Scott Fazekas, BAE's director of communications, said      Suveges and Bhatia were among three dozen social scientists      hired by the company and its subcontractors to support the      program.       The Johns Hopkins University graduate student was also      working toward a doctorate in political science with an      emphasis on international relations. The focus of her      dissertation was on the transition from an authoritarian      regime to democracy and how it affects ordinary citizens, the      university said.       ``Nicole was committed to using her learning and experience      to make the world a better place, especially for people who      have suffered through war and conflict,'' William R.     Brody, president of the university, said in a message      Wednesday to the campus community. ``She exemplifies all that      we seek to do at Johns Hopkins: to use knowledge for the good      of humanity.''       Mark Blyth, Suveges' primary faculty adviser, said that      when Suveges came to Johns Hopkins, she planned to write her      Ph.D. dissertation on how ideas move across borders from      society to society, exploring how radical Islamic ideas      filtered through Western European mosques.       After the outbreak of the Iraq war, Suveges decided to      shift her focus to the experience of ordinary citizens under      a transitional government, said Blyth, a topic that had      interested Suveges since her experience in Bosnia with the      SFOR/NATO Combined Joint Psychological Operations Task Force.       ``She was a very bright, engaging, sweet person, very      intellectually curious,'' Blyth said Wednesday.       BAE said Suveges' experience, which included a tour in Iraq      as a civilian contractor and a stint in Bosnia in the 1990s      as an Army reservist, made her especially valuable in efforts      to improve the lives of Iraqis.       A Human Terrain System statement said Suveges and others      were attending a meeting of the District Advisory Council on      Tuesday to elect a new chairman.       The officials were helping mediate disputes among the Sadr      City leadership and ``facilitate the development of a more      representative local government,'' the statement said.       The attack was blamed on a Shiite insurgent cell.       Suveges graduated from the University of Illinois at      Chicago in 1992 and received a master's degree in political      science from George Washington University in 1998.       She had delivered papers to international relations      organizations and served as a graduate teaching assistant,      the company said.       At Johns Hopkins, she was managing editor for the Review of      International Political Economy, the university said.       Maj. Mike Kenfield, spokesman for the Army's training and      doctrine command, said that the program was credited for      ``reductions in non-lethal operations'' and that there had      been talk about expanding the purview of the team to outside      Iraq and Afghanistan.                          ____________________
