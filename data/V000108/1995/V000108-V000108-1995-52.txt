Speaker, I am pleased to take part in this Special Order on Black History Month to recognize the achievements and contributions that African-Americans have made to our country. I would like to thank Congressman Louis Stokes and Congressman Donald M. Payne for organizing this opportunity to applaud the accomplishments of the African-American culture. Since 1976, the month of February has been celebrated as Black History Month. But the origins date back to 1926 when Dr. Carter G. Woodson had the vision to set aside a week in the month of February to celebrate the accomplishments and heritage of African-Americans.  Indeed, it would be foolish not to recognize such a large part of our heritage. On the national scene, the contributions that African-Americans have made to our society are innumerable. Through literature, we have been blessed with the powerful writings of Maya Angelou, W.E.B. DuBois, and Alice Walker. We all have received joy from listening to the stirring melodies of Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin and Duke Ellington.  While all of these are important contributions, what I find to be of equal importance are those of people who are in our own community: The men and women who live down the street, attend the same church with you, or whose children play with your own. These men and women have performed extraordinary acts of bravery and selflessness that should make us all proud. Indeed, Alonzo Swann, a World War II veteran from Northwest Indiana, was just awarded the Navy Cross for showing extraordinary bravery in the face of Japanese Kamikaze attacks.  The theme for Black History Month this year is ``Reflections on 1895: Douglass, Dubois and Washington.'' In keeping with the dedication to education and political involvement these men supported, Ms. Patricia Harris, Supervisor of the Gary Community School Corporation's Staff Development Center, sponsored several events that helped to educate the citizens of Gary about the accomplishments of African-Americans in Northwest Indiana. Among these events was a presentation by Quentin P. Smith, telling about his experiences during World War II as a member of the Tuskegee Airmen, a special cadet program established to train black aviators. Smith, a resident of Gary and member of the 477th Bombardment Group, recounted his experience as one of 101 airmen who protested segregated officers club facilities at Freemen Field in Seymour, Indiana and were consequently threatened with court martial. An independent commission of inquiry, appointed by President Truman, exonerated the airmen and ordered integration of the club. In addition to Mr. Smith, Ms. Dharthula Millender spoke about the origins of the City of Gary and the crucial role that African-Americans had in forming the city. In the city's first census, African-Americans numbered 100 of the first 334 people in the area. Ms. Millender also pointed out that as Northwest Indiana's steel mills grew, steelworkers were recruited from all over the U.S. and in many European countries. The result was that, from its beginning, the people of Gary had an appreciation for its multi-ethnic community.  The goal of these programs is to teach Gary's parents and children about their community's history. I commend Patricia Harris and the staff of the Staff Development Center for taking the initiative to make the teachings of Black History Month extend throughout the rest of the year. By having our children learn about a part of their culture, we can help ignorance give way to understanding and realize that we all are created equal. In closing, I commend and thank all of the people of Northwest Indiana, who in their own special way have brought special meaning to this month. Again, I would like to thank my distinguished colleagues, Congressmen Stokes and Payne, for giving the U.S. House of Representatives this special opportunity to celebrate Black History Month.                          ____________________
