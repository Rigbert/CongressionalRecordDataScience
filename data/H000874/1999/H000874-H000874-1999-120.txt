Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman from New York for yielding me this time.  I came here in 1981. We had a $749 billion tax cut on the floor, and the rhetoric I heard was the same. The people need to keep their money.                              {time}  1115  We do not need all the money. We need to downsize government. And so we passed a $749 billion tax cut and wequadrupled the debt on our children and on our grandchildren, because we did not pay our bills.  Ronald Reagan and George Bush asked for more spending in those 12 years than the Congress appropriated.  My friend says that we want to have people keep the money. That would be very nice. But guess what? The trigger which does not affect the middle class, the trigger that does not affect the middle class is that trigger which says the capital gains tax, the estate tax, and the other taxes that go to our most wealthy citizens will not be affected if the debt goes up, because they are locked in. It is only the little guys who will be adversely affected if the debt goes up.  Situation normal.  The same old same old or, as Ronald Reagan said in that famous debate, here we go again; on the road to more and more debt, not saving Social Security, not making sure that Medicare is there for those in the future.  I would say to my colleagues that debt that they talk about paying down is all Social Security. Why? Because the trillion dollars that they use for the debt relief is the on-budget operating surplus. No money for defense, no money to stabilize and keep secure our economy.  Here we go again. We did it in 1981 and quadrupled our deficit. Let us not do it again to our children and grandchildren.
