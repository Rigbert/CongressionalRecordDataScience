President, I will take the same amount of time as the Senator from Georgia just did.  There is no surplus. UNICEF has already been cut $10 million and will be cut more under this. The Korean Economic Development Organization, KEDO, is not funded. We are going to try to have the authorization for it, but it will not be funded. Our own Secretary of Defense tells us, if it is not, we face very, very serious problems in North Korea.  The fact of the matter is, there is no surplus. This money has to come from somewhere. It will come from further cuts in UNICEF. It will come from the inability to fund KEDO. It will come from a number of those other areas.  Mr. President, I understand that in an election year nobody wants to somehow seem to be weak on drugs. I understand that even if we, no matter how much we demonstrate so much of this money has, in all administrations, gone into the pockets of corrupt individuals, no matter how much we want to say we have other security interests, too, like avoiding nuclear capabilities in North Korea, that somehow having already raised substantially the amount of money in this budget for narcotics way above anything else, we may even raise it more. Let us just go vote. I yield back my time.  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.
