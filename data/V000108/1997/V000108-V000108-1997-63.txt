Speaker, it is my pleasure to take this opportunity to congratulate 20 students from four Hammond, IN, high schools for winning the national robotics competition, FIRST [For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology], held at Walt Disney World's Epcot Center on April 10 through 12, 1997. Sponsored by Beatty Machine Manufacturing Co., Team Hammond entered 1 of 156 robots from 30 States and Puerto Rico, which resulted in 113 operating robots at the nationals. Beatty Machine's Team Hammond won the elimination matches to capture the first place national title.  Members of Beatty Machine's Team Hammond include: Karl Fink, Tara Hasting, Laurie Michnal, April Roque, and Steve Wiant, of George Rogers Clark High School; Jim Ferguson, Dave Mohamed, Ebony Townsend, Kris Vankleek, and Owen Wels, of Gavit High School; Matt Jakubczyk, John Ly, Nicholas Piatek, James Severa, and Jeff Spector, of Hammond High School; and Wendy Camancho, Amber Lahners, Natalie Payonk, Danelle Rivera, and Chris Sikich, of Morton High School.  The employees of Beatty Machine and its sister corporation, Bemcor, worked in conjunction with Team Hammond to design and build the winning robot during an intense 6-week period. The 116-pound remote-controlled robot worked to place inner tubes on a central post during 2-minute competitions. After winning the Midwest-Regional championship in March, Team Hammond was courted aggressively at the national competition by such Fortune 500 competitors as Motorola, Delco Electronics Corp., and Procter and Gamble. However, Team Hammond succeeded in eliminating the competition, some of which budgeted as much as $500,000 for this year's entry. In addition to winning the first place title, the team was awarded the Honeywell Leadership in Control Award. This honor is awarded by a panel of distinguished judges to the team, which demonstrates leadership in the application of electronic control systems. According to a FIRST spokesperson, ``Beatty Machine had a very, very strong team and good strategy.''  In honor of their accomplishments, Team Hammond was awarded special recognition through a joint resolution in the Indiana State Senate and House of Representatives on April 25, 1997, and also met with Indiana Governor, Frank O'Bannon, in April. In addition, the team was featured on ESPN's 1-hour special covering the national competition on Saturday, August 23, 1997. The team expects appearances on other television shows, as well as a visit to the White House later this year.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in congratulating the Beatty Machine Team Hammond students on their outstanding accomplishments in the field of science and technology. I would also like to commend the employees of Beatty Machine for the leadership they have taken in the education of our community's youth. All involved in this project should be proud of the hard work and dedication they have put forth to succeed and achieve.                          ____________________
