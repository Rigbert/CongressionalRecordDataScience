 President, I come to the floor to talk about one of the great humanitarian crises facing our planet, and that is the horrific war in Yemen.  In March of 2015, under the leadership of Muhammad bin Salman, who was then the Saudi Defense Minister and is now, of course, the Crown Prince, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates intervened in Yemen's ongoing civil war. As a result of the Saudi-UAE intervention, Yemen is now experiencing the worst humanitarian disaster in the world.  According to the United Nations, Yemen is at risk of the most severe famine in more than 100 years, with some 14 million people facing starvation. In one of the poorest countries on Earth, as a result of this terrible war, according to the Save the Children organization, some 85,000 Yemeni children have already starved to death over the last several years, and millions more face starvation if the war continues.  Further, Yemen is currently experiencing the worst cholera outbreak in the world, with there being as many as 10,000 new cases each week, according to the World Health Organization. This is a disease that is spread by infected water that causes severe diarrhea and dehydration and will only accelerate the death rate. The cholera outbreak has occurred because Saudi bombs have destroyed Yemen's water infrastructure and because people there are no longer able to access clean water.  Last week, New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof wrote an article, which I urge all Members to read, that describes his recent visit to Yemen.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the New York Times article, ``Your Tax Dollars Help Starve Children.''  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, Dec. 7, 2018]             Opinion--Your Tax Dollars Help Starve Children                         (By Nicholas Kristof)       Aden, Yemen.--He is an 8-year-old boy who is starving and      has limbs like sticks, but Yaqoob Walid doesn't cry or      complain. He gazes stolidly ahead, tuning out everything, for      in late stages of starvation the human body focuses every      calorie simply on keeping the organs functioning.       Yaqoob arrived unconscious at Al Sadaqa Hospital here,      weighing just over 30 pounds. He has suffered complications,      and doctors say that it is unclear he will survive and that      if he does he may suffer permanent brain damage.       Some 85,000 children may have already died here in Yemen,      and 12 million more people may be on the brink of starvation,      casualties in part of the three-year-old American-backed      Saudi war in Yemen. United Nations officials and aid experts      warn that this could become the worst famine the world has      seen in a generation.       ``The risk of a major catastrophe is very high,'' Mark      Lowcock, the United Nations humanitarian chief, told me. ``In      the worst case, what we have in Yemen now has the potential      to be worse than anything any professional in this field has      seen during their working lives.''       Both the Obama and Trump administrations have supported the      Saudi war in Yemen with a military partnership, arms sales,      intelligence sharing and until recently air-to-air refueling.      The United States is thus complicit in what some human rights      experts believe are war crimes.       The bottom line: Our tax dollars are going to starve      children.       I fell in love with Yemen's beauty and friendliness on my      first visit, in 2002, but this enchanting country is now in      convulsions. When people hear an airplane today in much of      Yemen, they flinch and wonder if they are about to be bombed,      and I had interviews interrupted by automatic weapons fire      overhead.       After witnessing the human toll and interviewing officials      on both sides, including the president of the Houthi rebels      who control much of Yemen, I find the American and Saudi role      in this conflict to be unconscionable. The Houthis are      repressive and untrustworthy, but this is not a reason to      bomb and starve Yemeni children.       What is most infuriating is that the hunger is caused not      by drought or extreme weather, but by cynical and failed      policies in Riyadh and Washington. The starvation does     not seem to be an accidental byproduct of war, but rather a      weapon in it. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates,      backed by the United States, are trying to inflict pain to      gain leverage over and destabilize the Houthi rebels. The      reason: The Houthis are allied with Iran.       The governments of Saudi Arabia and the United States don't      want you to see pictures like Yaqoob's or reflect on the      suffering in Yemen. The Saudis impose a partial blockade on      Houthi areas, banning commercial flights and barring      journalists from special United Nations planes there. I've      been trying for more than two years to get through the Saudi      blockade, and I finally was able to by tagging onto Lowcock's      United Nations delegation.       After a major famine, there is always soul-searching about      how the world could have allowed this to happen. What's      needed this time is not soul-searching a few years from now,      but action today to end the war and prevent a cataclysm.       The problem in Yemen is not so much a shortage of food as      it is an economic collapse--GDP has fallen in half since the      war started--that has left people unable to afford food.       Yaqoob was especially vulnerable. He is the second of eight      children in a poor household with a father who has mental      health problems and can't work steadily. Moreover, the      father, like many Yemenis, chews qat--a narcotic leaf that is      very widely used in Yemen and offers an easy high. This      consumes about $1 a day, reducing the budget available for      food. The family sold some land to pay for Yaqoob's care, so      its situation is now even more precarious.       A few rooms down from Yaqoob was Fawaz Abdullah, 18 months      old, his skin mottled and discolored with sores. Fawaz is so      malnourished that he has never been able to walk or say more      than ``Ma'' or ``Ba.''       Fawaz's mother, Ruqaya Saleh, explained that life fell      apart after her home in the port city of Hudaydah was      destroyed by a bomb (probably an American one, as many are).      Her family fled to Aden, and her husband is struggling to      find occasional work as a day laborer.       ``I used to be able to buy whatever I wanted, including      meat and fish,'' she told me. Since fleeing, she said, war-     induced poverty has meant that she hasn't been able to buy a      single fish or egg--and that is why Fawaz suffers severe      protein deficiency.       ``They asked me to buy milk for Fawaz, but we can't afford      it now,'' she said.       We think of war casualties as men with their legs blown      off. But in Yemen the most common war casualties are children      like Fawaz who suffer malnutrition.       Some will die. Even the survivors may suffer lifelong brain      damage. A majority of Yemen children are now believed to be      physically stunted from malnutrition (46 percent were stunted      even before the war), and physical stunting is frequently      accompanied by diminished brain development.       ``These children are the future of Yemen,'' Dr. Aida      Hussein, a nutrition specialist, told me, looking at Fawaz.      ``He will be stunted. How will he do in school?''       The war and lack of health care facilities have also led to      outbreaks of deadly diseases like diphtheria and cholera.      Half of the country's clinics and hospitals are closed.       In the capital, Sana, I met a child who was suffering both      malnutrition and cholera. The boy was Saddam Hussein (he was      named for the Iraqi leader), eight years old, and the parents      repeat the mantra I hear from everyone: Life is much worse      now because of the war.       ``We don't know what we will eat tomorrow,'' Saddam's      mother told me.       Yemen began to disintegrate in the aftermath of the Arab      Spring, and then the Houthis, a traditional clan in the      north, swept down on Sana and seized much of the country. The      Houthis follow Zaydi Islam, which is related to the Shiite      branch dominant in Iran, and the Saudis and some Americans      see them as Iranian stooges.       In some ways, the Houthis have been successful. They have      imposed order and crushed Al Qaeda and the Islamic State in      the parts of Yemen they control, and in Sana I felt secure      and didn't fear kidnapping.       However, the Houthis operate a police state and are hostile      to uncovered women, gays and anyone bold enough to criticize      them. They recruit child soldiers from the age of about 12      (the Saudi- and American-backed forces wait until boys are      about 15), interfere with food aid, and have engaged in      torture and attacks on civilians.       Still, the civilian loss of life has overwhelmingly been      caused not by the Houthis but by Saudi Arabia, the United      Arab Emirates and America, through both bombings and      starvation. It's ridiculous for the Trump administration to      be exploring naming the Houthis a terrorist organization. And      while the Houthis are allies of Iran, I think the Saudis      exaggerate when they suggest that the Houthis are Iranian      pawns.       The foreign minister on the Houthi side is Hisham Sharaf      Abdalla, a congenial American-educated official.       ``I love the U.S.,'' Mr. Sharaf told me. ``We look to the      U.S. as the only force that can stop this war.''       Peace talks are now beginning in Sweden--few people expect      them to solve the crisis soon--and he insisted that his side      was eager to reach a peace deal and improve relations with      America.       After our conversation, he brought me over to his desk and      showed me his assault rifle and two handguns. ``When I was in      the U.S., I was a member of the N.R.A.,'' he told me. ``I      would like to have an N.R.A. chapter in Yemen.''       Mr. Sharaf talks a good game but is not himself a Houthi,      just an ally, so I wondered if he was a figurehead trotted      out to impress foreigners. Later I interviewed a man whose      power is unquestioned: Muhammad Ali al-Houthi, the president      of the Supreme Revolutionary Committee. As his name      signifies, he is a member of the Houthi clan.       An aide picked me up and ferried me to him, for President      Houthi changes locations daily to avoid being bombed by the      Saudis.       President Houthi, a large, confident man with a traditional      dagger at his belly, was friendly to me but also suspicious      of the United States and full of conspiracy theories. He      suggested that Washington was secretly arming Al Qaeda and      that the United States was calling the shots for Saudi Arabia      in Yemen, at the behest of Israel.       Still, he said that he wanted peace and that although the      Houthis have fired missiles at Saudi Arabia, his side would      pose no threat to Saudi Arabia if the Saudis would only end      their assault on Yemen.       ``There's no need for enmity with the United States,'' he      told me in Arabic, and that seemed a message he wanted me to      convey to Washington and the American people.       I asked President Houthi about the sarkha, the group's      slogan: ``God is great! Death to America! Death to Israel!      Curses on the Jews! Victory to Islam!'' That didn't seem so      friendly, I said.       ``It's nothing against the American people,'' he replied.      ``It's directed toward the system.''       When I asked about Saudi and American suggestions that the      Houthis are Iranian pawns, he laughed.       ``That's just propaganda,'' he said. ``I ask you: Have you      ever seen one Iranian in Yemen? Do we speak Farsi?'' This was      all a trick, he said, analogous to the allegations of weapons      of mass destruction used to justify war with Iraq.       While the Houthis are called ``rebels,'' they clearly rule      their territory. In contrast, the Saudi- and American-backed      ``internationally recognized government'' of Yemen is a shell      that controls almost no territory--hence it is based in      Riyadh. The ``president'' of this exile government, Abdu      Rabbu Mansour Hadi, is said to be gravely ill, and when he is      gone it will be even more difficult to sustain the fiction      that this is a real government.       More broadly, I don't see any hint of a Saudi or American      strategy. There's little sign that bombing and starvation      will actually dislodge the Houthis, while the Saudi military      action and resulting chaos has benefited the Yemeni branches      of Al Qaeda and the Islamic State. In that sense, America's      conduct in Yemen has hurt our own national security.       In one sign of the ineffectiveness of the Western-backed      government, the hunger is now as severe in its areas as in      the rebel-held north. I saw worse starvation in Aden, the      lovely seaside city in the south that is nominally run by the      internationally recognized government, than in Houthi-     controlled Sana.       And while I felt reasonably secure in Houthi-controlled      areas, I was perpetually nervous in Aden. Abductions and      murders occur regularly there, and my guesthouse offered not      a mint on the pillow, but a bulletproof vest; at night, sleep      was interrupted by nearby fighting among unknown gunmen.       What limited order exists in Aden is provided by soldiers      from the United Arab Emirates and allied militias, and I      worry that the U.A.E. is getting fed up with the war and may      pull them out without alternative arrangements for security.      If that happens, Aden may soon plunge into Somalia-like      chaos.       Mohamed Zemam, the governor of the central bank, believes      that there are ways to shore up the economy and prevent      starvation. But he cautions that the risk of another Somalia      is real, and he estimates that there may be two million      Yemenis in one fighting force or another.       ``What they have is the way of the gun,'' he said. ``If we      don't solve that, we will have problems for 100 years.''       Another danger is that the Saudi coalition will press ahead      so that fighting closes the port of Hudaydah, through which      most food and fuel come.       I stopped in Saudi Arabia to speak to senior officials      there about Yemen, and we had some tough exchanges. I showed      them photos on my phone of starving children, and they said      that this was unfortunate and undesired. ``We are not      devils,'' one said indignantly. They insisted that they would      welcome peace--but that they must confront the Houthis.       ``The most important thing for us is national security,''      the Saudi ambassador to Yemen, Mohammed Al-Jabir, told me.      Dr. Abdullah Al Rabeeah, an adviser to the royal court and      director of a fund that provides aid to Yemen, told me that      Saudis don't want to see hunger in Yemen but added: ``We will      continue to do what it takes to fight terrorism. It's not an      easy decision.''       Saudi and U.A.E. officials note that they provide an      enormous amount of humanitarian aid to Yemen. This is true,      and it mitigates the suffering there. But it's difficult to      give the Saudis much credit for relieving the suffering of a      country that they are bombing and starving.       To avert a catastrophe in Yemen, the world needs to provide      more humanitarian aid. But above all, the war has to end.       ``You're not going to solve this long-term until the war is      ended,'' said David Beasley, the executive director of the      World Food Program. ``It's a man-made problem, and it needs a      man-made solution.''       That solution will entail strong American backing for a      difficult United Nations-backed peace process involving      Yemeni factions and outsiders, aiming for a measure of power      sharing. This diplomatic process requires engaging the      Houthis, not just bombing them. It also means a cease-fire      and pressure on all sides to ensure humanitarian access and      the passage of food and fuel. The best leverage America has      to make the Saudis part of the solution is to suspend arms      sales to Riyadh so long as the Saudis continue the war.       In conference rooms in Riyadh and Washington, officials      simply don't fathom the human toll of their policies.       In a makeshift camp for displaced people in Aden, I met a      couple who lost two daughters--Bayan, 11, and Bonyan, 8--in a      bombing in a crowded market.       ``I heard the bomb and I went running after them,'' the      dad, Ahmed Abdullah, told me with an ache in his voice.      ``They were dead. One had her skull burst open, and the other      had no arms or legs left.''       He told me that the family then fled, and he married off a      15-year-old daughter so that someone else would be      responsible for feeding her. This is common: The share of      girls married by age 18 has increased from 50 percent before      the war to two-thirds today, according to Unicef.       Another son died of fever when the family could not afford      to take the boy to a hospital. There are several other      children, and none of them are going to school any more; a      10-year-old daughter, Baraa, who is next in line to be      married, couldn't tell me what seven plus eight equals.       A bit hesitantly, I told Ahmed that I thought that my      country, America, had probably provided the bomb that had      killed his daughters. He was not angry, just resigned.       ``I am not an educated person,'' he told me earnestly. ``I      am a simple parent.'' And then he offered more wisdom than I      heard from the sophisticated policy architects in America and      Saudi Arabia: ``My message is that I want the war to stop.''
