Bob was recently honored by the Burlington Business Association, BBA, for his contributions not only to the local economy through the success of Leunig's but also because of his commitment to community service.  Originally from Waterbury, CT, Bob has been a resident of Chittenden County for over 45 years, first arriving in the area to attend my own alma mater, St. Michael's College. Bob first came to Leunig's as a bartender, rose to the post of manager, and today is a coowner of one of Church Street's most successful restaurants. Marcelle and I enjoy seeing and talking with Bob when we are in Burlington.  Bob's contributions to the greater Burlington community are not limitedto providing great cuisine at Leunig's; he has been engaged in the community for decades, hosting regular fundraisers that support a wide range of services, from monthly dinners with proceeds that benefit various local support programs to hosting an annual fashion show to benefit the Breast Care Center at Fletcher Allen Hospital. Bob has been an exemplary model of what good business really is: economically successfully, and community-minded.  Bob's dedication to the Burlington community is well documented, and the honor bestowed upon him by the BBA is wholly merited. In recognition of his work, I ask that an article published in the Burlington Free Press on April 4, 2013, ``Leunig's co-owner honored,'' be printed in the Congressional Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From The Burlington Free Press, Apr. 4, 2013]                       Leunig's Co-owner Honored       Bob Conlon has spent half his life at Leunig's Bistro--from      substitute bartender to co-owner. A certain sensibility, and      a couple of tasks, follow him through every position.       ``We're all in the service industry,'' Conlon, 63, said.      ``We feed people, we cheer them up. Plunge the toilets and      mop the floors.''       Conlon will be honored tonight by the Burlington Business      Association. The BBA's 35th dinner and annual meeting will be      held at the Hilton Burlington.       The honoree, a fixture on Church Street for more than 30      years, will be attending his first BBA dinner, Conlon said      Monday morning over coffee in the bistro's dining room.       ``I always thought of that dinner as for the important      people,'' he said. ``My social life is working.''       Conlon's work at Leunig's includes a variety of community      service efforts, including an annual fashion show/fundraiser      for the Breast Care Center at Fletcher Allen Health Care, and      monthly dinners with a portion of proceeds to benefit local      social service groups.       ``They have long tradition of doing good for a broad range      of community groups,'' said Rita Markley, executive director      of COTS.       Tim Halvorson is a past recipient of the award Conlon will      receive; indeed, the award is named for Halvorson. He is a      board member of the Burlington Business Association who will      introduce Conlon at the dinner. Conlon follows in a line of      honorees who are committed to helping and enriching the      greater community, Halvorson said.       ``We thought that Bob represents, through the way they      handle things at Leunig's, a great example of a small      business that gives back,'' Halvorson said. ``Between breast      cancer and City Arts and COTS, they give tens of thousands of      dollars back to the community. It's a business that uses its      popularity and location as a vehicle for good.''       Conlon arrived in Chittenden County 45 years ago from      Waterbury, Conn., the son of a restaurant waiter who worked      as a busboy as a kid. He was a theater major at St. Michael's      College. These days, his acting takes place at the Leunig's      bar--his costume is well-dressed restauranteur--and on the      Church Street Marketplace.       Last summer, Conlon's costume came to include hard hats,      worn by him and his staff (and sometimes customers) as a nod      to marketplace construction.       ``You have a role to play,'' Conlon said, a part in which      his social life plays out at work. ``You have brief      conversations with people--cheerful and fun.''       He tries always to be in a good mood, Conlon said. If he's      feeling bad he steers away from the question, What do I want?      and asks instead, What does my wife want? What does my      daughter want? What do my staff and customers want? Conlon      said.       ``If you can make other people happy, you end up being      happy,'' he said.       Conlon started working at Leunig's when he was 32, after a      short stint as co-owner of a failed restaurant. The business,      Carburs Rib-it Room, was in the space now occupied by      Marilyn's, a clothing store.       ``If everything were perfect, it would've taken us 20 years      to get up to zero,'' Conlon said of the failed business.       He got out after two years and joined Leunig's as a      substitute bartender. ``I always liked waiting on      customers,'' he said. ``I got to hang out with a lot of good      people--artists, business people, college professors,      students, cops.''       He tended bar until about 10 years ago, when he became      manager. The move to manager from bartender came about, in      part, because managers came and went with frequency, Conlon      said.       ``Every time you get a new boss it's very insecure,''      Conlon said. ``Your employment is dependent on the sanity of      your supervisor. So be the supervisor.''       He started as well to purchase ownership shares in the      business from Leunig's owner, Robert Fuller, intending with      his business partner, chef Donnell Collins, to become a 50-50      owner of the restaurant. Conlon expects the deal will be      finalized May 1, he said.       ``Isn't that America?'' Conlon said. ``Isn't that what      everybody should do? Get a job, do your best at it, and don't      pass up opportunities. It's an honorable profession. If      you're good at it, you can live a good life.''                          ____________________
