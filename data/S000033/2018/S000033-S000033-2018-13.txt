 President today, I would like to recognize an extraordinary Vermonter, Enid Wonnacott, on her more than 30 years as executive director of the Northeast Organic Farming Association of Vermont, NOFA-VT. For three decades, Enid has worked tirelessly to build the organic agriculture movement and develop a sustainable, resilient, and accessible food system in our State of Vermont and across the United States.  During Enid's tenure at NOFA-VT, Vermont has grown from 50 organic farms to more than 700, and many of those farmers, as well as countless consumers and agricultural advocates, have benefitted greatly from technical assistance and training provided by NOFA-VT under Enid's guidance.  Recognizing that those farmers need good market opportunities to be viable businesses, Enid helped foster the growth of farmers' markets, community supported agriculture, and initiatives for institutions to procure locally grown food. She helped develop Vermont's farm-to-school program that provides students with healthy food and connects them to local agriculture through educational programming. I especially appreciate Enid's long-held belief, which I share, that healthy local food should be accessible to all people regardless of income, and I applaud NOFA-VT's efforts to make good food affordable through subsidized farmers' market coupons, CSA shares, and more.   Enid has worked on many Federal and State policies to promote sustainable agriculture. She was instrumental in developing Federal organic standards and was an early advocate for agricultural systems whereby farmers enhance the quality of the soil and environment while they also produce healthy food. Enid has been mentor to many agriculture and food system leaders throughout the State and region and has served on the Vermont Sustainable Agriculture Council. It should come as no surprise to anyone who knows her, Enid received the Vermont Agriculture Hall of Fame Award this year for her many contributions to our State.  Of course, Enid did not do these things alone. First, she has an excellent and committed staff, but perhaps even more important, she has the unwavering support of her husband Harry Frank and their wonderful children, Lila and Eli. Her family is a large part of Enid's success, including the countless hours they spent working alongside her at NOFA events, more than a few of which involved staffing a portable, wood-fired pizza hearth.  I am not only enormously grateful for al of Enid's many contributions over the years, but I am also proud to count her as a good friend. At a time when there is a growing recognition of the profound impact agriculture and food have on our health and the health of the planet, it is heartening to know that we have people like Enid Wonnacott fighting for a more environmentally sound and fundamentally just food system.                          ____________________
