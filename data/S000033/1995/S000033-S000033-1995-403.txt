 Chairman, let me conclude by just saying this: The truth is there is not a heck of a lot of difference of opinion on this issue.  [[Page H986]] The strength of the bill that is coming before us is it says, provide information, information, objective information to the Members of Congress so they can assess the benefits of a particular piece of legislation. If we spend a billion dollars and we get minimal results, it is a bad piece of legislation. If we spend $1 billion and we save $5 billion, you would not disagree with me that it is a good piece of legislation.  All that this amendment does is to try to make objective that process. If I present to you a bill and I say trust me this is going to save huge amounts of money, you are probably not going to trust me, you will think that I just want to get the amendment through for a dozen different reasons.  But if I say, ``Hey, the objective CBO people who have done the costs associated with it have also done the benefits associated with it,'' I hope and expect that you would look at it and you would say, ``You know what, it is a good investment for a billion dollars.''  So what this does is it takes away the partisanship, it takes away the politics, and asks for an objective analysis so that all of us could make a good cost-benefit analysis. I would very much hope that my friends would support this legislation.
