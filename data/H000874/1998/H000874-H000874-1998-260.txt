Speaker, I know on this side of the aisle, we join all of our colleagues on that side of the aisle. All of us, in losing a colleague, share the sadness and share the concern for our colleague's family.  Mr. Speaker, another one of our colleagues is grieving this day as well, as many probably know. The family of the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cardin) lost their son, 30 years of age, last night and buried him this afternoon. So as we pray for our colleague and for the Schiff family, if we could remember the Cardin family as well, I know they would appreciate it. I thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Gingrich) for yielding.
