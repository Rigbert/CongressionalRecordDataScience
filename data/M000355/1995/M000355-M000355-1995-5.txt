 President, my amendment will permit us to protect the flag and the Constitution. My amendment will make flag desecration illegal in three instances:  First, when an individual desecrates a flag with the intent to incite patriotic Americans to imminent violence;  Second, when someone steals a flag belonging to the U.S. Government and desecrates it; and  Third, when someone steals a flag displayed on Federal property and desecrates it.  This amendment differs significantly from previous statutes struck down by the Supreme Court and would be upheld by the Supreme Court, according to the CRS, and a number of other constitutional scholars.  I revere the flag like every Senator, for the history it represents and the values it symbolizes. But let us not constrict freedom in the name of protecting the flag. After all, freedom is the American way of life that the flag embodies. Let us not give flag-burners--the misfits who hate America and the freedom we cherish--more attention than they deserve. Do not let those who dishonor the flag cause us to tamper with the freedom that has made America the Nation we love and the envy of the world.  I urge a vote for my amendment.
