Speaker, today I voted Yes on final passage of H.R. 1917, when I intended to vote No. The bill would delay compliance with an EPA regulation which would reduce toxic emissions produced in the manufacturing of brick and clay ceramic tiles until all judicial review has been completed. The manufacturing of brick and clay tiles can emit toxics such as mercury and arsenic, both of which cause severe harm to human health. There is no need for this legislation; the law already allows judges to postpone regulations from taking effect. Under the bill, companies that make brick and clay tiles could continually file law suits, regardless of the merits, in effect killing the regulation. Further delaying the regulations means continuing to expose Americans to deadly toxic air pollution.                          ____________________
