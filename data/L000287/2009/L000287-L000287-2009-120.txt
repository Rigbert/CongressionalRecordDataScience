Madam Speaker, I rise today to introduce the Highway Trust Fund Fairness Act of 2009. I urge all of my colleagues to support this common-sense legislation.  This year, Congress is tasked with the much larger mission of reauthorizing the country's surface transportation programs to meet the needs of a constantly-evolving highway and transit system. Later this year, we will have to really look at ways to make the Highway Trust Fund more solvent, but in the meantime, we can make smaller changes that would help ease the burden.  The Highway Trust Fund Fairness Act does just that. It allows the Highway Trust Fund to be treated like other federal trust funds by allowing refunds and credits through the General Fund. The bill will also allow the Highway Trust Fund to accrue interest on its balance. These are very basic, common-sense changes that will save money in the long-run.  In 1962, President John F. Kennedy created National Transportation Week. He recognized that transportation was fast becoming one of the most sensitive and important issues facing our nation. It affects every person, every day. How do you get to and from school and work safely and efficiently every day? How do you visit family, friends, and loved ones?  When I was first elected to Congress, I served on what was then the Public Works and Transportation Committee. It is now the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee chaired by my good friend and colleague Mr. Oberstar. I went on to eventually serve on the Ways and Means Committee where I chair the Oversight Subcommittee. Although wedon't work directly on transportation issues in this Committee, we do have the opportunity to deal with how our nation's infrastructure is funded.  The Highway Trust Fund was established in 1956 to provide a dedicated source of federal support for highways and transit programs across the country. Unfortunately, the Highway Trust Fund's balance continues to diminish every year. First and foremost, the Highway Trust Fund is financed primarily through fuel taxes. Combined with high gas prices last year and greener living, people are driving less. This means there is less money going into the Trust Fund. Second, the projects funded out of the Trust Fund are more costly. Consequently fewer initiatives can be funded from the Trust Fund.  As you can see, Madam Speaker, since National Transportation Week was first created, our Nation's transportation and infrastructure has become much more complex--as has our economy. Jobs are created where there is good connectivity--roads, trains, bridges, public transit, walkable, bikable streets and communities. Before we tackle these larger issues, we can start with the basics. I urge all of my colleagues to support this very simple legislation.                          ____________________
