Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Iwould say to the gentleman that how much should the threshold be? If it is not 50 percent, should it be 40 percent? Should it be 30 percent? Should it be 20 percent? There are people who are elected to Congress who raise 95 percent of their money outside of their congressional districts. Is that what American people out there expect from their candidates? I do not think so.  I would point out to the gentleman that there are people who run for public office who are not from an area. The gentleman is correct. You do not have to have residency requirements as a requirement to run for congressional office, many of whom move into a congressional district and raise 95 percent of their money from outside of the district and a local candidate is not given the opportunity to get elected within the congressional district in which they reside, because they do not have the resources.  But I would say if there is a problem with a self-funded rich candidate running for such a seat, and I would say that that is a problem for any of our seats if someone of such wealth decides to run, in that case the party can add funds to the race. I would also accept a perfecting amendment that would waive this rule at a certain threshold of funds, say $100,000 is thrown in by a wealthy candidate.  But I would say that whatever district that a Member of Congress represents, he or she represents, if a wealthy candidate decides to run, you are in trouble under existing campaign law and will continue to be in trouble in the future.                              {time}  2300
