 Our 100-percent subsidy plan will allow employers who are offering a drug benefit at least as generous as the standard benefit to receive the full value of the standard benefit.  Again, our policy targets dollars where they might do the most good. And an employer subsidy recognizes the value of employer-sponsored retiree drug benefits.  In closing, I will simply say something I said when I started. In the next 3 or 4 days, there will be a lot of debate on this subject. It is very important to have a lot of debate on this subject.  You are going to find strong advocates for plans where the advocates have great faith in Government-run price programs versus whether or not you ought to have competition from the private sector. Remember, CBO says that a Government-run program is going to raise the price of prescription drugs. The alternative is to have competition. The Congressional Budget Office says that is going to reduce the price of prescription drugs.  We should be in the business of having public policy that is going to give seniors the best medical care, including prescription drugs, based on the least cost to the Government, as well as the least cost to the senior citizen.  I yield the floor and I thank my colleagues.
