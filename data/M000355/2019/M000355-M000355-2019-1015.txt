 Deputy Sheriff Dustin Watkins was responding to a routine call on Tuesday evening when he was shot and needed to be airlifted to a hospital. Fortunately, we heard yesterday afternoon that Deputy Watkins is in stable condition. I understand that last night he was able to sit up for the first time--all good news.  With Sheriff Randy Waters, I wish to extend sincere thanks to the doctors, nurses, and hospital staff who are caring for this brave Kentuckian and will support his recovery. My best wishes go out to Deputy Watkins, his family, and his colleagues. We thank them for their service to our Commonwealth as we are reminded once again of the sacrifices they make every day to keep us safe.                          ____________________
