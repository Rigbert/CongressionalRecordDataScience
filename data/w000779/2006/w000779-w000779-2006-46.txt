President, first of all, I thank the distinguished Senator from Arizona for working with me on this issue for many months now. Colleagues know that I stood in this spot for almost 5 hours a few months ago to try to put together a bipartisan effort to save taxpayers billions of dollars. I believe we have done that.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the official score that Senator Kyl and I have now received from the Congressional Budget Office, which the Congressional Budget Office has now officially informed us that over the next 10 years, the taxpayers will save $9 billion  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:       Estimated budgetary impact of Kyl-Wyden amendment to      prohibit the suspension of royalties under certain      circumstances, to clarify authority to impose price      thresholds for certain leases, to limit the eligibility of      certain lessees for new leases, and to restrict the transfer      of certain leases--Amendment No. 4806.
