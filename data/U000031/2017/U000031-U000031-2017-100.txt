Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, this bill, H.R. 2122, was introduced by the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. McKinley), and it authorizes the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC, upon request, to extend by 6 years the time period during which construction must commence on the Jennings Randolph Hydroelectric Project, which is located on the North Branch of the Potomac River in Garrett County, Maryland, and Mineral County, West Virginia. Additionally, FERC may reinstate the construction license if it has expired.  A similar bill passed under suspension in the 114th Congress, so I hope that we can pass it again today.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  Ms. DeGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2122, a bill to extend the deadline for commencement of construction of a hydroelectric project involving the Jennings Randolph Dam, sponsored by my Energy and Commerce Committee colleague, Mr. McKinley.  In March 2012, FERC licensed the construction of a hydroelectric facility at the Army Corps' Jennings Randolph Dam located on the Potomac River's North Branch in Maryland and West Virginia. The licensee for the Jennings Randolph Dam project was not able to commence construction by the already-extended deadline of April 2016. The bill would authorize FERC to extend for 6 years the date by which the licensee is required to commence construction.  FERC has no objections to this legislation, and similar legislation passed the House by a 418-2 vote during the 114th Congress. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting H.R. 2122, and I reserve the balance of my time.
