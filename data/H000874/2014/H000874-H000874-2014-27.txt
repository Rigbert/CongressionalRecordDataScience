Rogers and Senator McConnell, who did indicate early on that an omnibus would be the preferable alternative.  The problem, as the gentleman well knows, with the CR, it gives a very limited ability of agencies, particularly the Department of Defense, at a critical time, to plan as they would like. General Dempsey and General Odierno and others have mentioned that, so I am hopeful that we will be able to work together to accomplish that objective.  There are three others. There is no mention of a tax extenders bill. As the gentleman knows, the Senate is addressing that.  Does the gentleman have any idea, again, given the fact that we have essentially 3 weeks left to go and a few days, and cooperation is going to be essential if we get our work done, where we are going on tax extenders?  I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY of California. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I had just met with our chairman of Ways and Means and he has been working in the other House with the chair on the Senate, and nothing has been finalized yet.  As you know, we had passed many of those bills permanently out of this House. Negotiations are still going on with the Senate, but it is our intention to have that done before the end of the year as well.
