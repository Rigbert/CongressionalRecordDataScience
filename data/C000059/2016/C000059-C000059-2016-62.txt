Chairman, right now we are spending $80 million a year in this appropriation bill. It will double to $160 million in 4 years to store horses that we are presently doing. Also, as the gentleman is aware, we are concerned not just about the health of the herds--some of these herds are in very poor health--but also about the health of the range. Some areas are way overutilized.  So we need to work with the gentleman to find out a way to deal with this problem because we just can't continue to ignore this issue. It is a growing problem.  I was just over in Death Valley. We have in some cases irreversible environmental damage that is being done by wild burros in Death Valley. So I look forward to working with the gentleman to resolve this problem.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
