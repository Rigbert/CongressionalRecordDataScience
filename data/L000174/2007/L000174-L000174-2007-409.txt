President, I would like to share with my colleagues in the Senate the accomplishments of several Vermont entrepreneurs.  Each June, the Small Business Administration honors the best and brightest of each State's small business community. The entrepreneurial spirit in Vermont breeds many successful small businesses, and today I would like to congratulate the 2007 Vermont Small Business Person of the Year,Jack Glaser, president and cofounder of MBF Bioscience in Williston. Jack is one of the Green Mountain State's wonderful success stories, a University of Vermont graduate who worked with his family, especially his father, Dr. Edmund M. Glaser, to create and grow a successful business in Vermont.  It gives me great pleasure to congratulate Jack and everyone at MBF Bioscience. I ask unanimous consent that a Burlington Free Press article about Jack and the other 2007 Small Business Champions of the Year in Vermont be printed in the Record to commemorate their achievements.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record.
