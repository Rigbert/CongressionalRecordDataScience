Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 584, a noncontroversial bill to transfer the Fairport National Fish Hatchery to the State of Iowa.  This facility is an important component of Iowa's fish hatchery system. The State has operated this hatchery with their own funds since 1973, and it is one of three warm-water facilities within the State's program. The Fairport facility fills the need for several fish, including large-mouth bass, blue gills, and channel catfish. These fish are utilized throughout the State as part of their fisheries resources program.  While the Iowa Department of Natural Resources wants to modernize the upgrade this facility, they cannot justify the expense of these improvements as long as the Federal Government holds title to this property.  H.R. 584 was introduced by our distinguished colleague from Iowa, Jim Leach It is strongly supported by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which indicated by letter that the Service has ``no present, or foreseeable need for a hatchery at this site and recognizes the importance of this facility to the fishery resources program of the State of Iowa.''  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and I compliment the gentleman from Iowa for his outstanding leadership in this matter.
