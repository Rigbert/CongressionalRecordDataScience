 President, this week, for the 73rd year, our nation will commemorate National Business Women's Week. Since it was first observed in 1928, the event has been sponsored by Business and Professional Women, (BPW)/USA as a national tribute to all working women. It has helped increase awareness of the continuing challenges that working women face, and has highlighted their many successes that have strengthened our nation.  With well over 60 million women in the American labor force, including more than 70 percent of women with children, and an increasing percentage of women who help care for an elderly relative, the issues that challenge working women must be priorities for all of us, from balancing responsibilities within our own families to our debates on national and, indeed, multinational policy. And, as has been the case for all of the 73 years that we've had National Business Women's Week, we start from a position where there is good news and bad news; we've come a long way, and we have a long way to go.  In 1999, there were nine million women-owned firms, representing 38 percent of all American businesses, a 103 percent increase in just over 10 years; and the rate of growth for women-owned businesses in America is nearly three times faster than the overall rate. Women-owned businesses are also as financially secure and credit-worthy as other firms, and, in fact, are more likely to stay in business.  Yet, even with that powerful place in our economy, women entrepreneurs still have lower levels of available credit than their male counterparts. And as for employees, women still face a wage gap; for every dollar earned by men in 1998, women earned an average of 73 cents. The gap is even wider for women of color, and it gets worse as the workers get older, presumably progressing in their careers.  In the highest echelons of the business world, the Fortune 500, the good news is that the number of women corporate officers has increased by 37 percent over the past five years; the bad news is that the total number of women officers is still alarmingly low. The number of women in the highest officer positions, like CEO, president and high-ranking vice presidencies, has increased by 113 percent since 1995, but that still translates into just 114 women in those jobs, or about five percent of top office holders.  We've seen similar progress, with corresponding long ways to go, in women working in government and higher education. In my State last year, we elected our first woman Governor--a Governor, I might add, who is also a small business owner. While we rightly celebrate her victory, she was just the 11th of 12 American women ever to have been elected to that office outright. Here in the Senate, we have seen progress--with a record 13 women currently serving as U.S. Senators--but we still cannot call it success. And in academia, too, although some numbers are getting better, some problems persist, including what the American Association of University Professors described as substantial disparities in salary, rank and tenure.  And so, as we approach National Business Women's Week, we have some work to do. Achieving equity on the job is a process, and it proceeds not on an isolated track but with almost constant overlap with policies that affect home and family life, from providing adequate health care to combating domestic violence, from meeting the needs of our young children to responding to the needs of our aging parents. As a national interest, work and family exist in partnership.  We celebrate the progress and contributions of working women in America, recognizing that our prosperity--as well as the full expression of our values and national character--depend upon women having the opportunity to participate fully in our economic life. We are not there, but we are inspired by the women who continue to lead the way, and during National Business Women's Week, we are reminded to honor their uniquely valuable contributions to the strength of our economy and our society, and to the promise of our future.                          ____________________
