Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 861, and in so doing, feel inclined to paraphrase Daniel Webster, who, in defending Dartmouth College, noted that ``It may be small, but there are those who love it.''  Nothing could be more true with this bill, as H.R. 861 makes a truly technical correction of the most noncontroversial nature. It simply corrects section 10 of title 9 of the United States Code, which is a typographical flaw that has long evaded detection.  This section enumerates several grounds for vacating an arbitrator's award, with each ground beginning with the word ``where.'' The fifth clause of section 10, however, is obviously not a ground for vacating an award, but rather, the beginning of a new sentence. This bill corrects this error.  However small this change may be, through the years this bill, which has come to be known as ``the comma bill,'' has engendered great affection.                              {time}  1130  Some may try to diminish the importance of this bill, but one should never underestimate the importance of a comma.  To paraphrase the late Everett Dirksen, a comma here, a comma there, and pretty soon you have got a full sentence.  Let us be honest with ourselves, when used properly, a comma can be devastatingly effective. For those, especially school children, who think that grammar and punctuation do not matter and tune themselves out during English class, today's action shows clearly that it does.  Thankfully, not every grammar mistake, not every misplaced comma takes an act of Congress to correct, but this particular section of the United States Code does.  This bill has been passed by each of the past two Congresses, only to be held hostage by unrelated issues in the other body.  To my colleagues here and on the other side of the Capitol who have previously loaded up this bill with unrelated legislation, I say free the comma, and I urge my colleagues to pass H.R. 861.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
