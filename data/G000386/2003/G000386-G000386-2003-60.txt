 President, tomorrow morning we will resume debate on the Medicare modernization conference report. Under the previous order, there will be approximately 3\1/2\ hours of debate prior to the cloture vote on the conference report which is locked in to occur at 12:30 p.m. The cloture vote on the conference report will be the first vote of the day. It is my hope and expectation that cloture will be successful. This issue deserves an up-or-down vote. I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to allow this process to move forward.                          ____________________
