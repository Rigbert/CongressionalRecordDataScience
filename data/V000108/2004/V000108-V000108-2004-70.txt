Speaker, it is with great honor and pleasure that I stand before you to recognize the National Alternative Fuels Training Consortium and Ivy Tech State College Northwest as they join together for the second National Alternative Fuel Vehicle (AFV) Day Odyssey. They, along with other community leaders, will come together on Friday, April 2, 2004, at the Westfield Shoppingtown in Merrillville, Indiana, to explore alternatives to powering cars and trucks with fuels besides gasoline and diesel throughout many locations all across northwest Indiana.  The National AFV Day Odyssey began in 2002. The first event reached more than 17,000 people at 51 sites nationwide. This event will explore the environmental needs for AFV in our country, and local participants will learn of alternative fuel options to protect the future of not only northwest Indiana but the rest of the Nation as well. The National Alternative Fuels Training Consortium and Ivy Tech State College Northwest will be educating participants on how alternative fuel and advanced-technology vehicles rely on domestic fuels such as propane and natural gas to provide power for vehicles, which in turn help protect our environment.  The mission of the National AFV Day Odyssey is as follows: ``To strengthen our Nation's energy security, to preserve our Nation's energy independence, to improve our Nation's air quality, to support our national expertise and technological advancement, to offer wider choices and opportunities for American drivers, and to spread the exciting news that advanced-technology and alternative fuel vehicles are a positive choice for transportation.'' The mission and goals of National AFV Day are vital to the protection of our environment and for the future generations of our country and the world.  Mr. Speaker, at this time, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in recognizing and paying tribute to the National Alternative Fuels Training Consortium and Ivy Tech State College Northwest as they strive to provide the tools and education for protecting our local, as well as national, interests in securing both the future of our environment and our Nation's energy independence.                          ____________________
