 2189. A bill to establish grants to improve and study the National Domestic Violence Hotline; to the Committee on the Judiciary.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2189       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Domestic Violence      Connections Campaign Act of 2004''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds the following:       (1) More than 500 men and women call the National Domestic      Violence Hotline every day to get immediate, informed, and      confidential assistance to help deal with family violence.       (2) The National Domestic Violence Hotline service is      available, toll-free, 24 hours a day and 7 days a week, with      bilingual staff, access to translators in 150 languages, and      a TTY line for the hearing-impaired.       (3) With access to over 5,000 shelters and service      providers across the United States, Puerto Rico, Alaska,      Hawaii, and the United States Virgin Islands, the National      Domestic Violence Hotline provides crisis intervention and      immediately connects callers with sources of help in their      local community.       (4) The National Domestic Violence Hotline, which was      created by the Violence Against Women Act and is located in      Austin, Texas, answered its first call on February 21, 1996,      and answered its one millionth call on August 4, 2003.       (5) Approximately 60 percent of the callers indicate that      calling the Hotline is their first attempt to address a      domestic violence situation and that they have not called the      police or any other support services.       (6) Between 2000 and 2003, there was a 27 percent increase      in call volume.       (7) Due to high call volume and limited resources,      approximately 26,000 calls to the Hotline went unanswered in      2002 due to long hold times or busy signals.       (8) Widespread demand for the Hotline service continues.      The Department of Justice reported that over 18,000 acts of      violence were committed by intimate partners in the United      States each day during 2001. An average of 3 women are      murdered every day in this Country by their husbands or      boyfriends.       (9) Working with outdated telephone and computer equipment      creates many challenges for the National Domestic Violence      Hotline.       (10) Improving technology infrastructure at the National      Domestic Violence Hotline and training advocates, volunteers,      and other staff on upgraded technology will drastically      increase the Hotline's ability to answer more calls quickly      and effectively.       (11) Partnerships between the public sector and the private      sector are an effective way of providing necessary technology      improvements to the National Domestic Violence Hotline.       (12) The Connections Campaign is a project that unites      nonprofit organizations, major corporations, and Federal      agencies to launch a major new initiative to help ensure that      the National Domestic Violence Hotline can answer every call      with upgraded, proficient, and sophisticated technology      tools.

(b) Application.--Each organization desiring to receive a      grant under this section shall submit an application to the      Attorney General, at such time, in such manner, and      accompanied by such additional information as the Attorney      General, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and      Human Services and the National Domestic Violence Hotline,      may reasonably require.
