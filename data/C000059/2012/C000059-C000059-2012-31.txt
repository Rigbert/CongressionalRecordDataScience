Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to a dear friend of mine, Laura Froehlich. Laura passed away on Wednesday, August 1, 2012. As a pillar of the Moreno Valley and Riverside County military communities, her sudden passing was a shock to all and she will be dearly missed.  Laura served honorably in the Air Force and began volunteering in 1985 through the Moreno Valley Military Affairs Committee, which she eventually chaired. March Air Reserve Base (MARB) was and still is heavily used by Marines from nearby Twentynine Palms and Camp Pendleton bases. As increasing numbers of troops began to flow through the MARB facilities in the buildup to Operation Iraqi Freedom, Laura wanted to ensure that the troops leaving and returning from war received a timely farewell and warm welcome, a far cry from the public indifference and occasional contempt experienced by veterans returning from Vietnam, such as her father. She had organized a similar effort during the Persian Gulf War of 1991.  With the help of her team of more than 100 volunteers, she transformed MARB's austere Hangar 385 into a welcoming center where troops could relax and enjoy good food and entertainment during their 6-8-day layovers. Her motto was, ``When they come to March, they're taken care of.''  Laura, fondly known as the ``Flag Mama'' because of her patriotic attire, made it a point to be present for the arrival and departure of virtually every MARB flight carrying troops to and from the Central Command Area of Responsibility. She even purchased a motor home to park in the lot near the hangar so she could go quickly between home and the base. At the end of 2008, Laura had individually greeted more than 200,000 men and women on 4,000 flights. When the troops saw ``Miss Laura'' at the base to shake their hands and give them a hug, it was how they knew they were home.  Regardless of the recognition she received, Laura remained humble and modest. Upon returning home to California from the Pentagonin Washington, DC after accepting the Spirit of Hope Award in 2009, she remarked:       I keep getting thanked for something I shouldn't be getting      thanked for . . . What I and my awesome group of volunteers      do, we do it because it's the right thing to do. The men and      women who put their life on the line every day for my      freedom, for my grandkids to play safe in my backyard,      they're the ones that deserve to be thanked.  It is hard to imagine that Laura had any free time in addition to her tireless work at MARB yet she always found time to serve the community in other ways. She worked with many aid agencies including the Veterans of Foreign Wars and the Salvation Army, and was the longtime coordinator of Moreno Valley's Fourth of July Parade, the ``Trees for Troops'' campaign, and the Annual Family Day picnic at March Air Reserve Base for all the military services, including 500 Navy Reservists who drill at Navy Operational Support Center Moreno Valley.  Laura is survived by her husband Larry, daughter Laurice (Don) Souron, and two granddaughters, Laural Hite and Taylor Hite.  Laura will always be remembered for her incredible work ethic, generosity, contributions to the community and love of family. Her dedication to our men and women in uniform, family, and community is a testament to a life lived well and a legacy that will continue. I extend my condolences to Laura's family and friends; although Laura may be gone, the light and goodness she brought to the world remain and will never be forgotten.                          ____________________
