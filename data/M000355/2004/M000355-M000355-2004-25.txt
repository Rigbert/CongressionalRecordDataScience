 president, the year was 1980. Inflation was 13 percent, mortgage rates were hitting 15 percent, unemployment was 7.1 percent, and the economy was suffering its fourth year of recession in 10 years.  The Soviet Union was on the march in Afghanistan, its puppets were leading insurgents in Central America and South Africa, and U.S. Embassy officials were being held as hostages in Iran.  ``Stagflation'' and ``malaise'' were the new words of the American lexicon.  Then the Reagan revolution swept across this Nation and into this town. And while Ronald Reagan was the leader, he was not alone. Across this broad Nation, ordinary people came to this city with similar vision and they helped President Reagan accomplish extraordinary things.  One of these ordinary people was a young businessman from Ponca City, OK. At the tender age of 31, Don Nickles was the youngest Republican ever elected to the U.S. Senate.  But while he might have been young, it didn't take long for the Senate to discover that this young man--a former janitor who worked his way through college--was wise beyond his years and as solid as the Rock of Gibraltar.  Freedom has had no greater defender than Don Nickles. He has been a strong proponent of the free enterprise system. On budget, tax, debt matters--in fact on almost every conceivable question of fiscal policy, Don Nickles was dead on target.  He was absolutely committed to the bedrock Republican principles of cutting taxes, reducing the size of the Government, and slaying the budget deficit leviathan.  And to these seemingly insurmountable goals, he brought a relentless yet cheerful determination.  He has served this Nation and the people of Oklahoma so very well, with distinction and unwavering courage.  Too often, public servants come to Washington to drain the swamp until they see it as a hot tub. Not Don Nickles. He changed Washington rather than letting Washington change him.  When he came to the Senate, he wanted to rein in Government so people could keep their hard-earned dollars, and when he leaves now, his belief is the same today as it was when he placed his hand on the Bible.  That is the way it was then and now, and every day of his almost quarter of a century of Senate service. And he still looks like he is 31.  Back then, he fought to eliminate the inheritance tax on spouses and now he works to eliminate the inheritance tax altogether.  Back then he fought natural gas price controls which contributed to our energy crisis and now he fights price controls on prescription drugs.  Back then he fought the windfall profits tax and now he fights to ease the tax on profits and wages of businesses and families alike.  Mr. President, there isn't a Member of this body who doesn't respect Don Nickles as a man of strong conviction, character, and deep faith.  I think there is good reason why he is seen that way. When the Founding Fathers designed the Senate to be one of the central pillars of American democracy, I think Don Nickles is exactly the sort of citizen legislator they envisioned.  He has been a strong but happy warrior, and used the rules of this body to bring honor to the Senate and good service to our country. He loves the Senate and it showed every time he spoke. And we grew to love him in that process.  Through it all, he has never forgotten where he came from, or the people who put him here 24 years ago, or those who supported him, especially his wonderful wife, Linda and his four children.  He will be remembered as the ``keeper of the conservative flame,'' and like Ronald Reagan, should enjoy the legacy of freedom and economic prosperity he has created for all Americans in the years to come.                            peter fitzgerald  Mr. President, I rise today to bid farewell to the Senator from Illinois.  Peter Fitzgerald came to the Senate 6 years ago already a champion. He was the first Republican to win a Senate seat in Illinois in 20 years. He was the only Republican challenger to defeat an incumbent nationwide that year. And upon his arrival 6 years ago, he was the youngest member of the U.S. Senate. So expectations for this new Senator were high.  Senator Fitzgerald exceeded those expectations. From the beginning, he fought to cut wasteful Government spending, fraud at the public till, and mismanagement of the people's money. He led the fight against the recent corporate scandals that damaged our economy.  Senator Fitzgerald has been a leader in bringing government into cyberspace by sponsoring successful bills to allow farmers to work with the Agriculture Department online. He has also been a champion for improving child nutrition, by making it possible for consumers to use food stamps to make purchases online. He has focused on consumer safety by requiring stricter standards for child car seats and car safety features.  Illinois, where Senator Fitzgerald was born and raised, is the State thatsent Abraham Lincoln to the White House. Abraham Lincoln was one of America's greatest Presidents, and the first President of the Republican Party. The great State of Illinois is known as ``The Land of Lincoln.''  But I am a little jealous of Illinois's claim on this great American. Abraham Lincoln was born in a log cabin in Hodgenville, KY, my home State, and we Kentuckians like to think of him as one of our own.  I have welcomed Senator Fitzgerald to my home State before, and he is welcome again in the Bluegrass State anytime, especially Hodgenville.  Senator Fitzgerald had a long career of public service even before joining this body, and I have no doubt he will continue to serve the people of Illinois when he returns to the Prairie State. Most of all, he will enjoy the company of his wife, Nina, and their young son, Jake.  Because Senator Fitzgerald is a passionate Chicago Cubs fan, I suspect Jake will be going to a lot more games. The Senate's loss is Jake's gain, and a gain for the Fitzgerald family and the people of Illinois. I thank the Senator from Illinois for his service to his State, the Land of Lincoln, and to the Nation.                        ben nighthorse campbell  Mr. President, I rise today to bid farewell to the Olympian from Colorado.  Forty years ago, Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell carried the American flag in the opening ceremonies of the Olympic Games in Tokyo, Japan. He was the captain of the U.S. judo team and already a Gold Medalist in the 1963 Pan-American Games. For most men, that would be accomplishment enough for a lifetime. But for Ben Nighthorse Campbell, it was only the beginning.  Every one of us who has been privileged to serve in the Senate knows that we will never again see anyone quite like Ben Nighthorse Campbell. He is probably the only Senator equally comfortable driving a truck or a Harley-Davidson motorcycle. He has been both a Democrat and a Republican, although he is now a Republican, and I remind the President that wisdom blooms with age.  In 1995, Senator Campbell heroically subdued and handcuffed a man who had assaulted the late Senator Strom Thurmond in the Capitol subway. I suspect many Senators became a little more inclined to vote for his amendments after that.  Senator Campbell has consistently fought to reduce the burden the Federal Government places on American families by cutting taxes and spending. Hailing from the home of the Rocky Mountains, he has led the Republican Party in preserving our environment. He was instrumental in establishing the National Museum of the American Indian on the National Mall, which opened this fall. He is the only Native-American Indian Senator currently serving, and only the eighth in the history of Congress.  And the Senate is not the only exclusive club in which he claims membership. He also is on the Council of 44 Chiefs for the Northern Cheyenne Tribe of Lame Deer, Montana.  Senator Campbell is an honest, straightforward man who likes simple pleasures. He served his country with the U.S. Air Force in the Korean War. He and his wife of over 35 years, Linda, have two children and three grandchildren.  He has designed award-winning jewelry and trained champion quarter horses. And being from Kentucky, the horse capital of the world, he has my special appreciation for that. I have welcomed him to my home State before, and he is welcome again in the Bluegrass State anytime.  In 2001, Senator Campbell rode a motorcycle specially designed in red, white, and blue in the Inaugural Parade. I, for one, would not be surprised to see him ride that bike all the way from here to his hometown of Ignacio, CO, now that his 12 years with us draws to a close. It has been an honor to share this Chamber with him, and I salute his service, tenacity, and integrity.  But most of all I salute his courage. He stood tall as one of 100, and he stood just as tall alone.                            ernest hollings
