President, I ask unanimous consent that the CBO cost estimate regarding S. 627 be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                    S. 627--Faster FOIA Act of 2011       S. 627 would establish a commission to identify methods for      reducing delays in processing requests under the Freedom of      Information Act (FOIA). The commission also would investigate      a recent increase in the number of exemptions from FOIA that      federal agencies have issued to prevent the release of      information. The 12-member commission would have one year to      report its findings and recommendations to the Congress.      Members would be appointed within 60 days of enactment of the      legislation and would serve without pay but would be      reimbursed for travel expenses. The commission would      terminate 30 days after submitting its final report. The      National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) would      provide support to the commission, and the General Services      Administration would administer any travel expenses.       Assuming appropriation of the necessary amounts, CBO      estimates that implementing S. 627 would cost about $1      million, mostly in fiscal year 2012. That estimate includes      the cost of preparing the report and paying the salaries and      expenses of 10 employees provided by NARA. Enacting the      legislation would not affect direct spending or revenues;      therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply.       S. 627 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector      mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and      would not affect the budgets of state, local, or tribal      governments.       The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Matthew      Pickford. This estimate was approved by Theresa Gullo, Deputy      Assistant Director for Budget Analysis.                                  ____                                                    April 8, 2011.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has      prepared the enclosed cost estimate for S. 627, the Faster      FOIA Act of 2011.       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be      pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Matthew      Pickford, who can be reached at 226-2860.           Sincerely,                                             Douglas W. Elmendorf.       Enclosure.                          ____________________
