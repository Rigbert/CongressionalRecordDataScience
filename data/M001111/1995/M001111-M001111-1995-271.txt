 President, I rise today in opposition to S. 565. The bill before the Senate claims to promote fairness, but I believe it is actually far from fair to consumers in my home State of Washington and throughout this Nation.  I will leave it to the lawyers here to discuss the legal intricacies of the bill. However, I want to raise some very serious, commonsense problems I have with this legislation.  First, I am deeply concerned about the bill's potential to disproportionately harm women.  I am amazed that the bill before us treats a corporate executive's loss of salary as more important and deserving of compensation than the loss of such priceless assets as the ability to bear children, the senses of sight and touch, the love of a parent or husband, and the ability to move freely--unhindered by disability, disfigurement, or lifelong pain.  Certainly, this body must believe that raising a family, and having children should not be seen as unimportant in our legal system.  S. 565 would eliminate joint and several liability for noneconomic losses. And, by making noneconomic damages more difficult to recover, it would impair a woman's ability to recover her full damage award.  It is unfair to require only the victims of noneconomic losses--such as a woman who has lost the ability to bear children, or a child disabled in his youth--to bear the burden of pulling all the defendants who caused them harm into court.  Joint and several liability allows injured victims to receive full compensation, and leaves it to the guilty defendants to divide the damages appropriately among themselves. It seems to me much fairer to place this burden with the guilty parties, than with those who are injured.  The singling out of noneconomic losses for adverse treatment will prevent women from being fully and fairly compensated. This is especially objectionable because women have been the victims of many of our Nation's most severe drug and medical device disasters--DES, Dalkon shield and Copper-7 IUD's, and silicon breast implants are just three examples.  I have met with many women from my home State of Washington whose lives have been devastated by these products. Their stories are tragic. Their lives have been changed dramatically. They deserve a system of laws that treats them fairly.  Mr. President, mandating a nationwide cap on punitive damages also seems ill-conceived in light of the number of dangerous products that have been marketed primarily to women in this country.  S. 565 establishes a cap on punitive damages of three times a person's economic injury or $250,000, whichever is greater.  We should not forget in our rush to make changes in this Congress that the purpose of punitive damages is to deter bad behavior by making it impossible to calculate the risk of engaging in such behavior. Under S. 565's cap, I fear wrongdoers will find it more cost effective to continue marketing their dangerous products rather than removing them from the marketplace.  Even Senator Snowe's amendment to change the cap on punitive damages to two times compensatory damages does not remedy the unfairness of this cap. Although, Senator Snowe's amendment includes noneconomic damages within the formula for punitive damages, it does not acknowledge the important role of punitive damages in deterring and punishing outrageous misconduct.  Last year, Senator Kohl introduced an amendment to the product liability bill that, unfortunately, was not adopted. He sought to incorporate more fairness in this legislation by restricting the ability of Federal courts to sanction secrecy in cases affecting public health and safety. I was proud to join him as a cosponsor of his antisecrecy amendment last year, and look forward to joining him again when he raises the issue in this Congress.  The settlement of the Stern case in 1985 by Dow Corning is a great example of why such a change is necessary. As a result of a secret settlement agreement, Dow Corning was able to hide its decade-old knowledge of the serious health problems its silicon breast implants could cause for 6 additional years. [[Page S6250]]   The damaging information did not become public until the FDA launched a breast cancer implant investigation in 1992. In the meantime, nearly 10,000 women received breast implants every month, and countless women were harmed.  Mr. President, this bill would not only disproportionately harm women, it would also deprive injured consumers in my home State of Washington of rights they currently have.  This is significant because Washington has one of the most conservative tort law schemes in the Nation. This bill would reduce the statute of limitations in my home State of Washington from 3 years to 2 years. Injured consumers would have less time in which to file lawsuits when they are harmed by dangerous products. The bill also would reduce the number of situations in which product sellers can be held liable in Washington State. And the bill would abolish joint and several liability for noneconomic damages currently available in Washington when the injured person has not contributed to her injury.  As the Seattle Times editorialized just last week:       Recent polls show that the great majority of Americans      oppose restricting the right of individuals to hold      manufacturers and medical workers accountable for their      injurious act.       The National Conference of State Legislatures opposes      having Congress federalize an area of law that has been the      exclusive domain of state lawmakers for 200 years. And state      judges are coming out against federal statutes that would      tamper with century-old jurisprudence developed in state      courts.       The rush to impose federal rules on tort claims runs      counter to the Republican philosophy of giving more power to      the states. Surely, this is one area where state judges and      legislators are better suited to determine what's needed in      their communities.       The Washington Legislature, for example, passed a      comprehensive tort-reform law in 1986. Many other states have      done so in the past decade, Yet, voters in some places, such      as Arizona and Michigan, have turned down tort reform      initiatives. Why should Congress now force those voters to      live with legal changes they rejected at the polls. * * *  I ask unanimous consent to have the editorial printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Seattle Times, Apr. 30, 1995]                Federal Tort Reform Usurps States Rights       The only parties pushing for tort reform seems to be big      businesses, doctors intent on curbing medical malpractice      lawsuits, and lawmakers who receive financial contributions      from those lobbies.       Recent polls show that the great majority of Americans      oppose restricting the right of individuals to hold      manufacturers and medical workers accountable for their      injurious acts.       The National Conference of State Legislatures oppose having      Congress federalize an area of law that has been the      exclusive domain of state lawmakers for 200 years. And state      judges are coming out against federal statutes that would      tamper with century-old jurisprudence developed in state      courts.       The rush to impose federal rules on tort claims runs      counter to the Republican philosophy of giving more power to      the states. Surely, this is one area where state judges and      legislators are better suited to determine what's needed in      their communities.       The Washington Legislature, for example, passed a      comprehensive tort-reform law in 1986. Many other states have      done so in the past decade. Yet, voters in some places, such      as Arizona and Michigan, have turned down tort reform      initiatives. Why should Congress now force those voters to      live with legal changes they rejected at the polls?       The Senate product-liability bill, sponsored by Sen. Slade      Gorton, though more limited than the House legislation, is      still an unnecessary federal intrusion into state law.       The Senate bill does not include the House's onerous      ``loser pays'' rule that would prevent individuals and small      businesses from filing legitimate lawsuits for fear of having      to pay legal fees for the opposing side. But like the House      bill, it would cap punitive damages in dangerous-product      cases to $250,000 or three times the economic loss, whichever      is greater.       The change might make sense if it created a uniform rule      across all 50 states. But it won't. Washington law does not      allow punitive damage awards at all, so the proposed federal      standard won't apply here.       Other provisions of the Senate bill, however, will affect      Washington residents. One provision would make it harder for      people injured by defective products to collect for ``pain      and suffering.'' The bill places limits on lawsuits by      individuals, yet places no such limits on businesses.       Tort reform will not unclog the court systems. Though      businesses routinely complain about the litigation explosion,      tort claims account for only 9 percent of all civil suits,      and product-liability cases make up only 4 percent of tort      claims. The real problem is with companies suing each other--     a phenomenon completely unaddressed by the proposed      legislation.       But this isn't about clearing up court dockets or improving      the way judges and juries handle tort claims. It is about      reducing the financial exposure of manufacturers even when      there are serious proven injuries. If states believe      protection is needed for businesses, they are free to enact      tort reform without congressional interference.
