  I had planned on introducing this bill as an amendment to the pipeline safety bill but I understand that the chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Senator Murkowski and the ranking member of that committee, Senator Bingaman, would be amendable to scheduling a hearing on this bill before the end of the month, if the legislation is introduced as a stand-alone bill rather than as an amendment to the pipeline safety bill.  After the hearing, I intend to exercise my right under the rules of the committee to ask that the chairman put this bill on the schedule for mark-up.
