 Since 2001, I say to Senator Brown, the richest 1 percent of Americans received $565 billion in tax breaks. In 2010 alone, the most wealthy 1 percent of Americans are scheduled to receive an additional $108 billion in tax breaks. That is point No. 1.  Point No. 2--let me be a little political here. In the Presidential election of 2008, one of the candidates said that it was a good idea to tax health care benefits. That candidate--Senator McCain--lost the election. The other candidate said it was a bad idea to tax health care benefits. That was Barack Obama; he won the election.  Let me quote from what then-Senator Obama said when he was running for President. On September 12, 2008, he said:       I can make a firm pledge, under my plan no family making      less than $250,000 will see their taxes increase, not your      income taxes, not your payroll taxes, not your capital      gains taxes, not any taxes. My opponent, Senator McCain,      cannot make that pledge and here is why. For the first      time in American history--  This is Senator Obama speaking about Senator McCain's plan.       For the first time in American history, he, Senator McCain,      wants to tax your health benefits. Apparently, Senator McCain      doesn't think it's enough that your health premiums have      doubled. He thinks you should have to pay taxes on them, too.      That's his idea of change.  I agree with what Senator Obama said in 2008. I disagree with what Senator McCain said then. Right now, we are in a position to follow through on what Senator Obama said at that point and make sure the middle class of this country does not pay taxes on their health benefits.
