 If I could concede to the Senator from Arizona that, if he is going to add the crimes he has mentioned--I happen to think they are currently covered by the bill before us, but if there is need for some clarification in that regard, I think we could work on it--but would the Senator be kind enough to address that basic issue? Are you saying if a person, currently on a student visa, is failing a class, drops the class, no longer is a full-time student and is therefore out of compliance with the student visa, that person by virtue of dropping that class has now disqualified himself from legalization under the bill that is before us?
