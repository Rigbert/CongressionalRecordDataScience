President, I rise today to introduce, with Senators Leahy, Feinstein and Torricelli, legislation dealing with the three-judge panel that appoints independent counsels.  In the last few days, we have heard a flurry of speeches about the appointment of an independent counsel and about the grasp that the Attorney General has on her job. Recently some Members of Congress have suggested that we should open an investigation on the Attorney General because of herdecision not to seek the appointment of an independent counsel.  This is a new high in the efforts to politicize the independent counsel statute and a new low in bullying tactics.  And, Mr. President, these tactics have worked insofar as their goal was to politicize this issue. Many Americans now view this statute as just another political football. Here in Congress, we toss about calls for an independent counsel. We threaten to minutely examine every act of the Attorney General in her efforts to carry out her duties under the statute.  Meanwhile, one of the most important institutions to the operation of the independent counsel statute goes unexamined. The three-judge panel that appoints and oversees the independent counsels wields enormous power. And it has tainted itself through close connections to partisan politics and through the appointment of special counsels who are likewise partisans.  This panel seems to operate free of any genuine scrutiny. It plays one of the most important roles in the administration of the statute. And it is the most in need of some oversight.  The last time an independent counsel was appointed, we all saw just how embroiled that three-judge panel is in partisan politics. The head of that panel, the Republican-appointed David Sentelle, had lunch with two Republican Senators just a few weeks before he appointed an independent counsel who was a Republican Justice Department official and who had just recently publicly contemplated running for the Senate as a Republican. As a result of this incident, five former presidents of the American Bar Association issued a letter rebuking Judge Sentelle for his actions.  A recent article in the Legal Times noted:     In fact, with the appointment of independent counsel[s]      handled by a highly secretive three-judge panel, named by the      chief judge of the United States, it could be argued that one      partisan system has simply been supplanted by another.  Let me explain what the panel currently does and how that contributes to the failings of the statute.  The first flaw in the statute is in the appointment terms of the judges who sit on this special panel. Currently, three judges are appointed to the panel by the Chief Justice of the United States. The judges are appointed to the division for 2-year terms.  But David Sentelle is now serving his third 2-year term. Judge John D. Butzner, Jr., is in the middle of his fourth 2-year term. And Judge Peter T. Fay is in the midst of his second 2-year term.  In short, some judges are becoming entrenched in the independent counsel process.  A second flaw in the judges' panel is in its consistent failure to issue any rules of procedure and practice. In 1994, when we reauthorized the act, Congress called on the panel to promulgate rules of procedure for practice before it, clarify available avenues of appellate review, and undertake to catalog and preserve independent counsel reports and make public versions accessible upon request.  They have not done so. Only recently, the panel issued some draft rules of procedure dealing with attorney fee applications, but in 3 years they do seem to have not otherwise complied with Congress's request.  This special division is like a magician's hat: independent counsels emerge from it. But we do not know how. Are there any criteria used by the panel to appoint an independent counsel? Does the panel make any effort to assure that the person it appoints is actually independent? How does someone get this job--a job with a virtually unlimited budget and a stunning array of powers?  We do not know because the Court will not tell us, even though we asked them to 3 years ago.  We need to do a few things about this panel. The legislation I introduce today is intended to remove any taint of partisan politics from this panel. It requires that judges on the panel serve no more than two, 2-year terms. This will ensure that no one judge gets entrenched in appointing independent counsels. And it assures that the division does not get politicized. In addition, it is consistent with current law. Why have 2-year terms if the judges just stay on as long as they want? The 2-year term was clearly inserted with the view that judges would not stay on the division forever.  In addition to limiting judges on the panel to 4 years, the measure I introduce requires that the division promulgate the very rules that we asked them to issue 3 years ago.  The special division should not be a mysterious black box. People who practice before it should know the rules. Attorney fee applications are the most common things the Division has to deal with, but this provision also requires that the Special Division have rules governing the appointment of an independent counsel. We should know what criteria and what procedure they use to assure that the independent counsel is indeed independent and qualified.  Mr. President, I hope we can all agree that this measure is vitally needed. It is simply aimed at improving the operation of the independent counsel statute not tearing it down. It's goal is to take some partisan politics out of the system and to put a little more independence back into the statute.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 581       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. LIMITATION ON PERIODS OF SERVICE THAT A JUDGE MAY                    SERVE ON THE DIVISION TO APPOINT INDEPENDENT                    COUNSELS.

(2) Effective date.--The amendments made by this subsection      shall take effect on the date of enactment of this Act and      shall apply to any judge or justice serving on such date on      the division to appoint independent counsels of the United      States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
