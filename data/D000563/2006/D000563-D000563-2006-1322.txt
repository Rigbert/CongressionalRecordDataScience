President, let us understand where we are at this moment. In the colloquy with Senator Kyl, I raised an element of his amendment which we, I think, generally agreed needs to be clarified. I hope we can work toward clarification.  The Senator from Pennsylvania, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has asked whether we can now take up amendments which both sides agree would be constructive, moving us toward our goal of final passage, on a bipartisan basis, asking the Senator from Arizona, would you please set your amendment aside, perhaps to work on the subject of your colloquy a few moments ago, and then you will be back in the queue.  We are not only prepared, incidentally, on the Democratic side to entertain the four amendments which have been spelled out by the Senator from Pennsylvania, we are also prepared to debate and vote on at least three other amendments, the Lieberman-Brownback asylum, an Allard amendment 3213, and a Nelson amendment 3220.  So the argument among some that we are stopping the amendment process is not true. At this point, the Senator from Arizona is stopping the amendment process because his amendment, which is not quite in the shape itmight be in, or wants to be in, is going to be first or nothing else. I hope that is not where we are going to end this.
