Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to a dear friend of mine, Arloene Watts. Arloene passed away on Monday, August 5, 2013. A resident of Corona for over half a century, she was a pillar of the community and will be deeply missed.  Arloene was born August 13, 1922 in Carson, Oregon, before moving with her family to Minnesota. Arloene grew up on the family farm, where her work ethic and values were formed. In 1941, she moved to Auburn, California to attend school at Sierra College. She and her husband, Ed, were married shortly thereafter in 1943. In 1957, the pair packed up and moved to a small town in Southern California--Corona. Arolene began her community work almost immediately, taking on roles with the Girl Scouts and Boys Scouts of America, and in parent-teacher groups.  Arloene's passion for service took shape early, and she became a champion for the development of women's rights in business throughout the community. With experience in personal finance and secretarial training, Arloene started her own business, an employment agency, in 1963. During a time when less than four percent of American businesses were owned by women, Arloene became a pioneer. Her knack for career planning led the business to become very successful, eventually leading to its sale in 1990 after having Arloene at the helm for 27 years. She continued to pave the way for women in the community over the years, becoming the first woman to serve as Corona Planning Commissioner. In addition, she earned a spot by appointment on the Temescal Valley-El Cerrito Community Plan Advisory Committee. Her continued interest in business development within the city led her to become actively involved in the Corona Chamber of Commerce, becoming its first female president in 1974.  It is hard to imagine that Arloene would have any free time on her hands, yet she always found time for her community. She served as Trustee of Circle City Hospital, Director of the local YMCA, and Executive Director of Corona-Norco United Way. In addition, Arloene was President of Soroptimist International of Corona, and President of the Women's Improvement Club. She was also a dedicated member of the Corona-Norco Unified School District's Partner in Education Program and the Inland Empire Better Business Bureau. It is no surprise that Arolene was the recipient of numerous community awards including Corona Citizen of the Year, Award of Merit-Chamber of Commerce, Distinguished Citizen of the Year-Corona Jaycees, Outstanding Citizen-Riverside County Board of Supervisors, Distinguished Citizen of the Year-Boy Scouts, Woman of the Year-73rd Assembly District, YMCA Ira D. Calvert Distinguished Service Award, and the Women of Distinction Award for her achievements in helping advance the status of women in Corona.  Arloene is survived by the love of her life, her husband, and their three children: son, Edwin, of Massachusetts, and two daughters, Michelle, of Corona, and LaJune Hughes, of Oklahoma.  On Tuesday, August 13, 2013, what would have been her 91st birthday, a memorial honoring Arloene's extraordinary life was held. Arloene will always be remembered for her incredible work ethic, generosity, advancement of women, contributions to the community and love of family. Her dedication to her work and community are a testament to a life lived well and a legacy that will continue. I extend my condolences to Arloene's family and friends; although Arloene may be gone, the light and goodness she brought to the world remain and will never be forgotten.                          ____________________
