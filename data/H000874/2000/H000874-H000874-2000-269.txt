Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time.  Mr. Speaker, I regret when we debate serious issues, somebody can stand up and make a comment that clearly is not true, and there is not the opportunity to give and take.  The gentleman from Florida (Mr. Canady) is a bright man. The gentleman is well educated. To say that my agreement prohibits no abortions is absolutely, on its face, ludicrous; it prevents all late-term abortions.  Does it have any exception? Yes. The gentleman presumably is a well-educated individual that knows the Constitution of the United States and knows the constitutional edicts from the Supreme Court. The gentleman knows his bill is not constitutional; that is the irony of the gentleman's contention.  In fact, the Hoyer-Greenwood alternative is the only alternative that prevents abortions. Joe Scheidler of the Right to Life Committee, I say to the gentleman, says not of myself, not of the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Greenwood), not to any of the other cosponsors, Joe Scheidler says your bill will not stop one abortion.  Why? The gentleman pretends he is not even listening; perhaps this is not important to him.
