Speaker, I am pleased to recognize the Reverend Dr. John Roberts of Toledo for his 40 years of service in Jesus Christ. Our community will join his congregation in celebration of this milestone on April 3, 2005.  Born in Bryant, Mississippi on March 9, 1927 to George and Melvina Roberts, John E. Roberts came to Toledo, Ohio in 1944. Here he attended Libbey and Scott High Schools. When Indiana Avenue Baptist Church was organized in 1946 he was there, and has been active in the church ever since. Prior to his ordination in 1964, Pastor Roberts served his church as custodian, Sunday school teacher, choir member, Trustee Board Secretary, and Deacon. After receiving his ordination, Pastor Roberts preached his first service at the church he helped to organize on the 3rd Sunday of January 1965. Even while Pastor, he pursued his Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Religious Education degrees in 1975, his Master of Theology in 1984, and his Doctorate in Biblical Theology in 1985. All of this, in addition to working a second job in order to contribute to the financing of the church structure. Pastor Roberts truly has led his congregation by example, and he acknowledges that his achievements were obtained under the guidance of the Holy Spirit.  Pastor Roberts' tenure at Indiana Avenue Baptist Church has been most noteworthy. Under his leadership, the Christian Board of Education was organized and so were the Junior Church, Couples Fellowship, Singles Fellowship, Widows Fellowship, Recreation Department, Youth Department and Young Adult Department. He has ministered, counseled, taught and led a congregation numbering in the thousands. It has been noted that Pastor Roberts ``has opened the eyes of many who were stumbling in spiritual darkness and led them to the light through the study of the Word of God.'' His theological mastery is complemented by an extraordinary sense of humor and good nature that lifts the spirits of all people whom he encounters. He is a man of God walking among all the people.  A strong and much respected community leader, Pastor Roberts is also an active participant in the Toledo Public Schools PTA, International Ministerial Alliance, Baptist Ministers Conference, and NAACP Lifetime Member. He has also served on the Boards of the Urban League, the J. Frank Troy Senior Citizens Center, and the Frederick Douglass Community Center and served on the Interracial Coalition Committee and the co-chaired the Alcohol and Substance Abuse Task Force Council. His opinion and counsel are highly valued, and he has been asked by civic leaders both past and present to serve on many special commissions.  Despite his community and church commitments, Pastor Roberts' first devotion is to his wife and family. He credits much of his success to his wife, Bernice, to whom he has been married for 55 years. Together they have raised three sons and have five grandchildren.  It is impossible to characterize the life of so great a man into a few short lines of a Record entry. Perhaps no finer tribute may be made than that of the belief of those who know him best that Pastor Roberts is ``a man sent by God to lift men's faith, hope, and love.''                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Page E765]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                TRIBUTE TO THE REVEREND DR.
