President, I am pleased to submit a Senate Concurrent Resolution recognizing and honoring the 50th anniversary of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. An identical resolution is being introduced in the House by my distinguished colleague, Representative Northup.  As you know I am an ardent supporter of biomedical research and the National Institutes of Health. In this century, great strides have been made in the control of such killer infectious diseases such as polio, rubella, measles, cholera, typhoid fever, and diphtheria. Small pox has been eradicated. We continue to benefit from the development of new drugs and vaccines that contribute enormously to the betterment of the public health.  At the forefront of these advances stands the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. NIAID began as the National Microbiological Institute, formed through the union of the Rocky Mountain Laboratory, the Biologics Control Laboratory, the Division of Infectious Diseases, and the Division of Tropical Disease of the NIH. In 1955, Congress renamed the Institute as the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, recognizing the need for a coordinated scientific research program on infectious, allergic, and immunologic diseases.  Research supported by the Institute has led to important advances, including: the development of vaccines against infectious diseases such as meningitis, hepatitis A, whopping cough and the rotavirus diarrhea; new treatments to fight against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); and novel interventions to treat childhood asthma.  However, despite significant progress, infectious diseases remain the world's leading cause of death, and the third leading cause of death in the United States, and immune-mediated diseases continue to exact a considerable toll. NIAID-supported research will continue to provide the necessary tools to develop diagnostic tests, new and improved treatments, vaccines, and other means to combat the microbial threats of today and those of the future, and to address diseases of the immune system.  I am submitting this resolution today to demonstrate the support of the United States Senate for the NIAID, the NIH and all of the dedicated professionals who have devoted their lives to improving the quality of the nation's health.                          ____________________
