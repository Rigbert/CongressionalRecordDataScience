President, I rise to join Senator Wyden in introducing a bill that will ban the sale of certain novelty lighters that children can mistake for toys, often with tragic consequences for themselves and their families.  In Arkansas in 2007, two boys, ages 15 months and 2 years, died when the toddler accidentally started a fire with a lighter shaped like a motorcycle. In Oregon, in 2000, a fire started with a dolphin-shaped lighter left one child dead and another brain-damaged. In North Carolina, a 6-year-old boy was badly burned by a lighter shaped like a cell phone.  Sadly, the U.S. Fire Administration has other stories of the hazards presented by novelty lighters. When you learn that one looks like a rubber duck toy, and actually quacks, you can imagine the potential for harm.  As a co-chair of the Congressional Fire Services Caucus, I am proud to note that last year, my home State of Maine became the first State to outlaw the sale of novelty lighters.  Maine's pioneering law stems from a tragic 2007 incident in a Livermore, Maine, grocery store. While his mother was buying sandwiches, 6-year-old Shane St. Pierre picked up what appeared to be a toy flashlight in the form of a baseball bat. When he flicked the switch, a flame shot out and burned his face. Shane's dad, Norm St. Pierre, a fire chief in nearby West Paris, began advocating for the novelty-lighter ban that became Maine law in March 2008.  The Maine State Fire Marshal's office supported that legislation, and anational ban has the support of the Congressional Fire Services Institute, the National State Fire Marshals Association, and the National Volunteer Fire Council.  The bill is straightforward. It treats novelty lighters manufactured after January 1, 1980, as banned hazardous substances unless the Consumer Product Safety Commission determines a particular lighter has antique or significant artistic value. Otherwise, sale of lighters with toy-like appearance, special audio or visual features, or other attributes that would appeal to children under 10 would be banned.  The novelty lighters targeted in this legislation serve no functional need. But they are liable to attract the notice and curiosity of children, whose play can too easily turn into a scene of horror and death. The sale of lighters that look like animals, cartoon characters, food, toys, or other objects is simply irresponsible and an invitation to tragedy.  I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this simple measure that can save children from disfigurement and death.                                 ______                                       By
