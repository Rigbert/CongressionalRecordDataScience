Chairman, what happened to the Federalists in the Congress? We were going to empower the States. This is the most extraordinary preemption of local and State laws in my 11 years in the Congress.  This is unbelievable. We heard horror stories from people from States that do not have a regular land use process. Those States should adopt a land use process. Those local jurisdictions should adopt a land use process, and it should be regular. It should have process of appeal and litigation through their States. But not the Federal Government.  Do we want the Federal Government wading into every single local land use dispute? Peep shows next to schools, liquor stores next to high schools? I think not.  I do not think the people on that side of the aisle really believe that. They are playing here to an audience of special interests, very well-funded special interests. This is horrible legislation for small town America. It is horrible legislation for our States and States' rights. Reject this legislation.
