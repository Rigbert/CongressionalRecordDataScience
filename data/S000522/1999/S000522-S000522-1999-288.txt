Mr. Speaker, I want to call my colleagues' attention to the incisive commentary on the moral and religious dimensions of the horrific tragedy in Littleton, Colorado by Charles W. Colson, who many believe is one of the greatest Christian leaders in the world.  The senseless killings at the Columbine High School are a direct challenge to human decency and powerfully underscore the consequences that can occur when the value of human life is eroded by our society and culture.  Below is the full text of Mr. Colson's analysis of the killings, with a special emphasis on the heroism and courage of Cassie Bernall, who was gunned down, point blank, for merely professing her faith in God publicly.                 [BreakPoint Commentary, Apr. 26, 1999]                          Littleton's Martyrs                         (By Charles W. Colson)       It was a test all of us would hope to pass, but none of us      really wants to take. A masked gunman points his weapon at a      Christian and asks, ``Do you believe in God?'' She knows that      if she says ``yes,'' she'll pay with her life. But      unfaithfulness to her Lord is unthinkable.       So, with what would be her last words, she calmly answers      ``yes, I believe in God.''       What makes this story remarkable is that the gunman was no      communist thug, nor was the martyr a Chinese pastor. As you      may have guessed, the event I'm describing took place last      Tuesday in Littleton, Colorado.       As the Washington Post reported, the two students who shot      13 people, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, did not choose      their victims at random--they were acting out of a      kaleidoscope of ugly prejudices.       Media coverage has centered on the killers' hostility      toward racial minorities and athletes, but there was another      group the pair hated every bit as much, if not more:      Christians. And, there were plenty of them to hate at      Columbine High School. According to some accounts eight      Christians--four Evangelicals and four Catholics--were      killed.       Among them was Cassie Bernall. And it was Cassie who made      the dramatic decision I've just described--fitting for a      person whose favorite movie was ``Braveheart,'' in which the      hero dies a martyr's death.       Cassie was a 17-year-old junior with long blond hair, hair      she wanted to cut off and have made into wigs for cancer      patients who had lost their hair through chemotherapy. She      was active in her youth group at Westpool's Community Church      and was known for carrying a Bible to school.       Cassie was in the school library reading her Bible when the      two young killers burst in. According to witnesses, one of      the killers pointed his gun at Cassie and asked, ``do you      believe in God?'' Cassie paused and then answered, ``Yes, I      believe in God.'' ``Why?'' the gunman asked. Cassie did not      have a chance to respond; the gunman had already shot her      dead.       As her classmate Mickie Cain told Larry King on CNN, ``She      completely stood up for God. When the killers asked her if      there was anyone who had faith in Christ, she spoke up and      they shot her for it.''       Cassie's martyrdom was even more remarkable when you      consider that just a few years ago she had dabbled in the      occult, including witchcraft. She had embraced the same      darkness and nihilism that drove her killers to such      despicable acts. But two years ago, Cassie dedicated her life      to Christ, and turned her life around. Her friend, Craig      Moon, called her a ``light for Christ.''       Well, this ``light for Christ'' became a rare American      martyr of the 20th Century. According to the Boston Globe, on      the night of her death, Cassie's brother Chris found a poem      Cassie had written just two days prior to her death. It read:     Now I have given up on everything else     I have found it to be the only way     To really know Christ and to experience     The mighty power that brought     Him back to life again, and to find     Out what it means to suffer and to     Die with him. So, whatever it takes     I will be one who lives in the fresh     Newness of life of those who are     Alive from the dead.       The best way all of us can honor Cassie's memory is to      embrace that same courageous commitment to our faith. For      example, we should stand up to our kids when they want to      play violent video games. We should be willing to stand up to      community ridicule when we oppose access to Internet      pornography at the local library.       For the families of these young martyrs, I can only offer      deep personal sympathy and the hope that they might take      strength from the words Jesus spoke to the woman who honored      Him by pouring ointment on His head. ``Wherever this gospel      is preached in the whole world, what she has done will be      told in memory of her'' (Matthew 26:13).       ``Well done, good and faithful servant. Now enter into the      joy of your Lord'' (Matthew 25:23).                               ____________________
