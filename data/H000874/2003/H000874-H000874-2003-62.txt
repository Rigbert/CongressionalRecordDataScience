Because, as I said, we have not had the opportunity to be included in the conference.  On the Medicare prescription drug, the gentleman mentioned the Medicare bill in response to my question. Can he tell me the status of the Medicare conference, and can he tell me whether or not he expects that bill to be on the floor prior to the November 7 target date for adjournment?  Mr. DeLAY. A lot of people are working very hard to try to get that very complicated piece of legislation put together. The chairman of the conference continues to work with the various parties interested in reaching a compromise by the end of this session.  There have been several bipartisan, informal meetings since last week. I expect that there will be a few more before the end of this week. Hopefully, these meetings will produce a draft product that all the members of the conference can review at the next formal conference meeting. I would anticipate that that would start happening, probably next week or so.  We really think it is important to improve and strengthen Medicare and provide the kind of health care that seniors need before we adjourn in this session. A lot of people are working very hard to accomplish that.
