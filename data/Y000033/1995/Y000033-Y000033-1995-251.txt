Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, this amendment would provide for the sale of oil. The volume of oil currently produced on Federal lands in Alaska is very minimal. This amendment in fact would really look to the future if something were to occur on Federal lands in Alaska. I want to stress again, this oil that we are talking about is on State lands. It is our oil.  Very frankly, I do not see any harm in the amendment. I have one question to ask the author of the amendment, because after reading the amendment the only thing is, when does this kick in? When does that royalty oil kick in, if I may ask the gentleman from Washington?
