Mr. Speaker, the gentleman is correct. Some Members are interested in offering amendments to H.R. 39 who would be unable to participate this afternoon. Therefore, it is my intent to ask that the Committee rise after conclusion of general debate and, if I may continue, with my understanding with my good friend, the gentleman from California, that eventually this bill will pass this House to get over to the Senate after we consider all amendments that are to be offered. We must proceed, because this has been sunsetted now for 1\1/2\ years, so we would like to get it done.
