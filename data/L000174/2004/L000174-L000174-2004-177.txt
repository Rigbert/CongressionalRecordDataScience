President, earlier today I discussed my concerns about the nomination of William Myers to a lifetime job as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Before we vote on the motion of Republican Senators to invoke cloture on this nomination, I would like to highlight a few things.  This nomination was reported out of the Judiciary Committee on April Fool's Day over the objections of every single Democratic member of the committee.  The Republican majority has failed to bring this nomination up for a vote during the past 4 months, knowing that Mr. Myers is strongly opposed by the widest coalition of citizen groups that have ever opposed a circuit court nominee in U.S. history. Suddenly last Friday, Republicans filed their cloture motion to end a debate that had not even begun about why President Bush nominated such an anti-environment activist for a judgeship. They set debate for a time they knew few were scheduled to be here on such short notice. It seems that they are afraid of a robust and thorough debate on the merits, or lack of merit, of this nomination but they are eager to try to create a political issue out of it.  I do not think it is too skeptical to suggest that Republicans are bringing this nomination up now only to try to politicize the judicial nominations issue further in advance of the Presidential nominating conventions. Thisis the partisan game plan proposed by the rightwing editorial page of the Washington Times and White House and rightwing advocacy groups such as the Committee for Justice. The White House and its Republican friends in this body should stop playing politics with these lifetime jobs as judges. Stop playing politics with our courts. Stop proposing extremists for our Federal bench. Stop trying to remake the Federal judiciary from an independent branch of Government into just another wing of the Republican Party.  We have stopped only a handful of this President's most extreme judicial nominees, even though Republicans blocked more than 60 of President Clinton's judicial nominees from getting an up-or-down vote. Republicans blocked nearly 10 times as many of President Clinton's moderate and well-qualified judicial nominees. Democrats have been judicious and sought to check only the worst nominations President Bush has proposed. This nomination is one of the most controversial and divisive, and the worst choice in terms of environmental protections and policy. It is so obvious he was chosen with the hope that he will continue to help roll back protections for clean water, clean air, and endangered ecosystems from the judicial bench.  Mr. Myers was picked to be a lifetime-appointed judge because for most of his working life he has been a strident opponent of environmental laws. The nomination of this industry lobbyist who has barely been inside a courtroom exemplifies the revolving door between corporate interests and the Bush administration. It is no wonder that his confirmation is opposed by more than 180 environmental, tribal, labor, civil rights, disability rights, women's rights and other citizen groups. I ask unanimous consent to have a list of those opposing this nomination printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:   Letters of Opposition to the Nomination of William G.
