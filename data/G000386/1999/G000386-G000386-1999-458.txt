 President, for the leader, I would like to give this information. It is for all Senators. The Senate will be in a period of morning business until 2 p.m. Following morning business, the Senate may begin consideration of S. 531, a bill to authorize a congressional gold medal for Rosa Parks. If this legislation is cleared for action, a vote will occur at 5:30 p.m. We will notify all Senators of an exact voting schedule when that information becomes available.  Also, Senators may expect to consider any legislative or executive items cleared for action.  The majority leader would like to, again, remind all Senators that there will be no session of the Senate Friday, April 23. He thanks all of our colleagues for their attention.                          ____________________
