 Speaker, today I recognize the outstanding work done by participants in my Student Congressional Town Meeting held this summer. These participants were part of a group of high school students from around Vermont who testified about the concerns they have as teenagers, and about what they would like to see government do regarding these concerns.  I am asking that these statements be printed in the Congressional Record, as I believe that the views of these young persons will benefit my colleagues.On Behalf of Ethan Casavant and Jaime Santerre--Regarding Education in                       Vermont Prisons, May 7, 2001       Jamie Santerre. Ethan and I visited the Chittenden Regional      Correctional facility.       Ethan Casavant. We spoke with Mary Tripp, a teacher at the      facility, one of three. There is her and John Long, who are      both full-time teachers, and there is one who is based on      independent study and special ed. I don't remember her name,      though.       Jamie Santerre. The facility was built in the late 1970s.      In the 1980s, the facility had an open library, where people      who went there could only, get their GEDS. And the classes      that they have now, which are like math, social studies, art,      English and science, they started in 1998, where anyone under      22 without a high school diploma had to attend in an attempt      to get their high school diploma.       Ethan Casavant. Just to touch up on that a little bit,,      even if, say, you are 16 years old and you drop out of high      school and end up going to the prison system, you have to go      back to the schools to graduate or get your diploma. They      won't let you just get off of it or get out of it. But,      anyway, the classes are Monday through Friday, like any other      school. There is independent study and regular class, like      three, four people to a class. There is three classrooms, an      art room, and one with science and social studies, that you      can't do labs or like chemistry or physics or anything like      that, because they can't trust the inmates with any of those      materials. The materials are also supplied to them for free      so that they can, you know, use them all and learn just like      anybody else. They have a library that they can use. For      resources, they have some computers, but they don't have      Internet access for safety reasons, or any of that. Anything      they need to download off the Net, the teachers do before the      classes and go over it. The Vermont Correctional Facilities      school system are the only schools in the state that require      literacy competency before you graduate. Any other high      school, you don't have to be fully literate to graduate. And      Mary Trip, the teacher we talked to, said that about 20      percent of the population of the inmates attend class      regularly. And if you get the diploma from their high school,      you have just as good a chance of getting a job as you would      from graduating from any other school. You know, you might      just not like it for personal satisfaction.                                  ____                                     On Behalf of Derek Wong, Drew Arnold, Tericia Savaglio, and Alex   Whittelseui Regarding Broadcasting Executions to the Public, May 7,                                   2001       Alex Whittelseui. We are from Rice High School, obviously,      and our topic was the issue of the morality and ethical      viewpoint of broadcasting executions to the public, because      we felt it was important, because the upcoming execution of      Timothy McVeigh is actually going to be televised and shown      on a closed-circuit in the Oklahoma City area. And we feel      that that is not going to make justice, it is more going to      just make--how do I say this?--just make it worse, because of      the fact that it's going to almost glorify what Timothy      McVeigh did, and how he is going to die a martyr. And we just      feel it shouldn't be shown on TV, and that it is just wrong      to do that.       Theresa Savaglio. To begin with, a little bit of background      on the execution. He is dying by lethal injection, which is a      series of three shots. First he is given a sedative. They are      using sodium pentetate. And then they are going to inject      pancurium bromide to stop his respiration, and then finally      potassium chloride to stop the beating of his heart. That is      actually one of the most common forms of capital punishment,      because it is the least painful. According to Amnesty      International, they believe that any form of execution      violates basic human rights, which are stated in the      Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and which the United      Nations adopted this declaration in 1948. And so they believe      that, since we are a member of the United Nations, we should      also use this and ban executions. They think that any person      sent to death should be able to appeal to a higher court,      which we do allow. And Timothy McVeigh's execution is going      to be the first capital punishment case for the federal      government in, I believe, maybe 38 years. So it is a pretty      big issue. Amnesty also believes that, no matter what reason      the government uses to execute their prisoners in its      custody, and no matter the form of execution, the death      penalty can't be separated from human rights, because you are      taking this person's life from them. And another interesting      aspect of this is that the cost of executing a person and the      process to lead up to that is more expensive than life      imprisonment, because of all the appeals and court costs.       Congressman Sanders. Okay.       Alex Whittelseui. From a pool of randomly picked 2,621,      1,494 people said that they would not view the execution--     which is 57 percent--and 1,127 said they would. And that is      just kind of to throw out the fact that most Americans would      not want to watch this execution.       Derrick Wong. Those who said they would not watch the      execution said that they could not draw anything from seeing      a death on television. And they said that an execution on TV      would only act as entertainment for our society, which then      becomes a pity. People against televised executions are      concerned for the condemned's feelings, and of his or her      family's feelings as well. They say that it is bad enough      that a person has to die for their actions, and that      televising it would not have a positive effect. Some say that      Phil Donahue wants the execution to be televised because it      is his sad attempt to be on primetime television, and those      opposed are concerned with the issue of ethics and the      morals. There is a huge controversial issue of whether the      televised execution of Timothy McVeigh, which is coming up on      May 16th, and there is a lot of arguments that his execution      should be televised, even among those who oppose capital      punishment. Even Timothy McVeigh wants his execution to be      televised, because he hopes that he will become a martyr for      the people with the same intentions as him, getting revenge      against the government. Ashcroft approved a closed-circuit      televising of the execution for the 250 to 300 survivors and      families of the deceased, but there be no public viewing to      the general population. Anti-death penalty activist, Sister      Helen Prejean, said that the execution could happen, but she      is against it. However, she does not feel it should be      televised, and she is the author of Dead Man Walking, and      believes that criminals being put to death would just grow if      you have it televised. She is aware of assertions that the      executions are good for the families of the killer's victims,      but says that she does not believe that, and that she has      watched the victim's families going through this, watching      the person die, waiting for them to die, and being promised      it was going to give them closure, and coming out with an      empty chair at their dining table, but it hasn't done      anything to bring back the life of their loved ones.      Execution have been behind closed doors since the 1930s, and      in a quote by Richard Tietzer, he supports televising      executions because it used to be very public and not done      behind prison walls, meaning the more people that know about      the death penalty, the better they are going to be able to      judge it, and the whole process is carried out in the      people's name and they should know if those acting in their      name are doing so carefully and humanely. Some view the media      as vultures descending on the execution in Oklahoma City to      feed on McVeigh's infamy. 1,400 journalists have registered      for credentials with the Bureau of Prisons to cover the May      16 execution, at Terre Haute, Indiana, with more reporters in      Oklahoma City. The media wants to feed off the fact that      there hasn't been a federal execution since 1963. Walter      Genic, a journalist professor from southern Illinois, at the      University of Carbondale, said that McVeigh's execution is      going to be another media orgasm. It is sensationalist lust.      And the general feeling from a mother of a daughter who was      murdered said that she doesn't feel that it is appropriate to      execute someone, especially being televised, because it      doesn't do anything except show that this person is dying,      and you know that they're dying from witnesses there.       Drew Arnold. There were 23 electrocution executions      recorded between 1983 and 1999 in Jackson, Georgia. They were      aired on a New York radio program on WNYC, and they said that      it was their journalistic responsibility to air the      executions. VPR decided not to air them, because, just      because it exists doesn't mean it has to be made public. And      people don't need to see their taxes at work killing      prisoners.                               ____________________
