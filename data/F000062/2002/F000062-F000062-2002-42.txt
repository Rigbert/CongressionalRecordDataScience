Farnsworth and the Farnsworth family on the 75th anniversary of the invention of the electric television.  It was on September 7, 1927, while working in his small, cramped laboratory at 202 Green Street in San Francisco, that Philo Farnsworth conducted the first successful experiments that form the basis for today's television. Upon completing the very first transmission of an electronic image, Farnsworth sent a telegram to his investors that simply said, ``The Damn Thing Works.''  Farnsworth first conceptualized these ideas one summer day while tilling a potato field on his family's farm. Riding atop the horse driven plow, the 14 year-old Farnsworth was struck by the crisscrossed patterns in the field. Like the furrows in the field front of him, Farnsworth believed he could separate a picture into lines and reassemble them elsewhere.  In 1930, Farnsworth obtained the patents for his invention, which employs a magnetically deflected electron beam inside a cathode ray tube to transmit a picture. All forms of video in use in the world today, including computer displays, trace their origins to Farnsworth's patents and this seminal event 75 years ago.  When Farnsworth died at the age of 64 in 1971, he held more than 300 U.S. and foreign patents. In September 1983, he was one of four inventors honored by the U.S. Postal Service with a stamp bearing his portrait. My home State of California has recognized his invention of the electronic television by placing a State historical marker memorializing the event in front of his former lab in San Francisco. In addition, the mayor of San Francisco, Willie Brown, recently issued a proclamation making September 7, 2002, Philo Taylor Farnsworth Day in that city.  Before I conclude today, I also want to recognize the important contributions of Elma ``Pem'' Farnsworth, now 94 years of age and the only living witness to this historic 1927 event. Mrs. Farnsworth, a talented scientist in her own right, worked closely with her husband on many of his inventions. Often called ``The Mother of the Television,'' Mrs. Farnsworth now spends her retirement days residing in Fort Wayne, IN, working tirelessly to ensure that the legacy of Philo Farnsworth's inventions will live on.                          ____________________
