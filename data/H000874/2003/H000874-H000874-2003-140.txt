Speaker, reclaiming my time if that, as the gentleman posits, is the disagreement, then I would say to the leader that I think I can in the next 96 hours get my side of the aisle to agree with his side of the aisle to pass that as a permanent extension. The problem we have is not between our bodies on that issue as I said. I think my party would join. These are folks who make between $10- and $26,000 who are trying to support their children, put them into school, get them through and make them good citizens. We want to help that, my colleague wants to help that, but we are not doing it. We are not doing it because there is a disagreement between the two bodies.  I think it is incorrect to characterize our side of the aisle as wanting this to expire. What we want to do is pass, and if there is disagreement between the bodies, we at least want to take one step, even if we cannot take five steps, because that one step will help those families. I would be glad to yield to the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Rules.                              {time}  1545
