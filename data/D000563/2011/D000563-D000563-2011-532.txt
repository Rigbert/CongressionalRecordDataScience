That is why if you are a success as a Congressman or Senator or as an elected official, you really have to rely on the people who work for you, who time and again will represent you. Their approach, their sense of caring, their promptness, their courtesy will reflect on you.  If you are lucky--really lucky--you will have some extraordinary people working for you who cover you with glory every single day--even when you don't know it.  I started in politics and was lucky to have two early mentors. As a college student, the Senator who held this seat, Paul Douglas, inspired me to take an interest in government. Later, there was a man he introduced me to, Paul Simon, whom I succeeded in the Senate. I spent more time with Paul Simon, and he truly was my mentor. I inherited many of my good habits from him.  I also inherited something else. I inherited one of his biggest fans and hardest workers, who came on my staff. Her name is Betty Hamilton. She first had her brush with public service in 1984 when she volunteered to work on the Senate campaign of Paul Simon. Paul had a way of bringing out the best in people and bringing the best people into politics. Betty sure fit the bill.  In that first campaign, Betty used to pull her two toddlers, Will and Ben, in a little wagon as she walked door-to-door in her neighborhood, knocking on doors and dropping campaign literature for Paul Simon. She was part of an army of volunteers who helped Paul score an upset victory in a very tough year, politically. Later, she signed on as volunteer coordinator and office manager for Paul Simon's reelection campaign.  After that election, Betty joined my staff when I was still in the House of Representatives. She has been with me ever since.  Betty works in casework. It sounds simple and routine, but it is not. Most of her work is with senior citizens. If an older person in southern Illinois calls my office because they are having a problem with Social Security or Medicare or some other Federal program or agency, Betty most often takes that call.  The people she works with often have no place else to turn. They can't afford lawyers. They just need someone who cares and who is competent. Maybe they have been incorrectly denied Medicare or disability payments or some other benefits they are entitled to, and they have tried but cannot cut through the bureaucracy to resolve their problems. Many of them are desperate. Some have spent every penny they have ever saved and have nothing left. They are on the verge sometimes of even losing their homes.  Betty Hamilton listens to them and she gets to work making phone calls, writing letters, sending e-mails, trying to make the wheels of government turn the way they should. She is an advocate for fairness and good government.  Over the years, Betty has talked with more than 8,000 people in Illinois. They are the lucky ones. She has saved hundreds of people from losing their homes. She has given them hope.  I go back on Fridays to Springfield, and I usually have a couple of thank-yous on my desk, and they always relate to staffers who have done a good job. Usually Betty's name is on them. I can't count the number of people who have written me about the work she has done. They say: Thank you for helping me. I greatly appreciate it. It is good to be able to pay my bills and take care of my kids, and a special thanks to Betty Hamilton.  I know Betty worries some nights about the people she tried to help. She has come in on many Saturdays to write one more letter or make one more call she thinks might help. Just last week she helped someone in my State collect $31,000 in disability payments that had been incorrectly denied them.  Like most people who grew up in St. Louis, Betty is a die-hard St. Louis Cardinals baseball fan. So she knows what I mean when I say I consider Betty Hamilton the Stan Musial of casework. Like Stan the Man, who played for the Cardinals for 22 years, she has worked for me for two decades. Like him, she is a modest person, and like Stan Musial, Betty has compiled a long and consistent record of success that is likely to remain unbroken for a very long time.  Betty didn't take to government initially. She has a master's degree in horticulture. Four years ago, she and her husband John, then retired from the State of Illinois, decided they would buy a farm near Springfield where they could raise produce--some of the best green beans and tomatoes you ever tasted. You could find them at the Springfield Farmers' Market downtown on Wednesdays and Saturdays. I know, I have seen them there the last two Saturdays. Don't miss their stand; it is the best. That is where I am going to be able to see her from now on.  Betty is retiring from my office, and I will miss her. More importantly, the people who have had her fine public service will miss her too. We are going to miss her greatly.                          ____________________
