 We have sought time. I recognize this amendment may not be one of your priorities. It is a huge amendment for many States that have very high costs, and I have presented it in the past. It has been unanimously adopted by this body in the budget bill. I offered a separate amendment which was an authorization for $850 million, which passed the Senate and is now in the House. There is no number from the President in the budget. That is why I am submitting it at this time.
