President, I rise today to engage the Senator from Missouri, Mr. Bond, the Chairman of the VA/HUD Subcommittee, in a colloquy.  Senator Bond, you and I and the other members of the Northeast delegation have been working, for over a year now, to ensure that Maine and the Northeast have their needs from the January 1998 Ice Storm which devastated much of New England and upstate New York addressed.
