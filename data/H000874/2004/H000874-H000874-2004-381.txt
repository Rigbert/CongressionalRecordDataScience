Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the information he has provided us.  This is the first time at least that I have heard of the consideration of the Iraqi resolution next week. I understand the timing of that and the date on which that effort began. Because I have just heard about this and have not had an opportunity to talk to our ranking members on either the foreign affairs committee or on the defense committee, can the gentleman inform me as to whether or not this resolution has been put together in a bipartisan way, with participation by the minority? The reason I ask the gentleman that is I think all of us want to ensure that we are united on it.  I have not seen the statement so I do not know what it is, but clearly we are, I think, all proud of the actions of our Armed Forces; and they carried out their mission in an extraordinarily effective, efficient, and courageous manner. We are all proud of our men and women in uniform for what they have done. We are all pleased, as well, that Saddam Hussein has been captured and is in custody and no longer at least poses a personal threat; but I am sure my friend from Ohio agrees that hopefully this statement will be one which is reached in a bipartisan way and we can have overwhelmingly bipartisan support of.  I certainly, as one who supported, as my colleague knows, the effort in Iraq and supported the funding for that effort, want to be able to support it. I have not seen it, but I am hopeful that we do this in a bipartisan way.  I would be glad to yield to my friend to comment on this issue.
