Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this rule and the irresponsible way the Republican leadership has decided to deal with our Nation's finances. The Constitution gives Congress the power of the purse. This is one of our most fundamental and basic responsibilities. It is essential that we meet it. We are now 39 days into the new fiscal year, yet only 2 of 13 spending bills have been signed into law.  Today, instead of moving the process along, we will again dawdle over unrelated issues such as the Istook gag amendment, which has nothing to do with the budget, and is unconstitutional and un-American.  Since they cannot get this legislation enacted because of its demerits, Mr. Istook and his supporters are willing to shut this government down in order to shut the American people up.  The Istook language says it's okay to speak if you follow ``generally accepted accounting principles,'' subject yourself to a Federal audit, assume the presumption of guilt and hold yourself out to harassing lawsuits by individuals acting as private attorney generals.  I urge my colleagues to vote against the rule. I represents everything bad in a closed and autocratic system.  Mr. McINTOSH. Mr. Speaker, I would like to clarify a concern raised in the past by some Members about the scope of the exclusion for loans in the Istook-McIntosh-Ehrlich provision to end welfare for lobbyists. As you know loans made by the government are expressly excluded from the definition of grant in the bill. Some Members of Congress have expressed concern about whether this exclusion touches on those who service or administer such loans. The sponsors of the bill intended this exclusion for loans to include compensation paid to those who provide services related to the making and administering of loans. I hope that this clarifies any confusion and resolves those concerns.
