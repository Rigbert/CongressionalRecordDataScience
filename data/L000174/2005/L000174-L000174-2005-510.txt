President, I am glad to hear the distinguished leader say nominees deserve an up-or-down vote. Of course, he and other Republicans assured that 61 of the judicial nominees of President Clinton were not given a vote. They were subjected to pocket filibusters--61. In fact, this nomination is a measure of the double standards used by Republicans in connection with judicial vacancies. During President Clinton's Presidency, Senate Republicans said the 11th and 12th judgeships to the D.C. Circuit were not to be filled, that we did not need those seats. They had argued since 1995 that the caseload of the D.C. Circuit did not justify a full complement of the court. Indeed, at a hearing in 1995, Republicans called Chief Judge Laurence H. Silberman of the circuit to testify against proceeding to fill vacancies on the D.C. Circuit. Republicans have argued for years this circuit's caseload per judge is one of the lightest in the country. In a May 9, 2000, letter, Judge Silberman argued that the D.C. Circuit's caseloads had continued to decline from 1995 to 2000, and he opposed confirmation of additional Clinton nominees. In fact, the D.C. Circuit caseload has continued to decline and in 2004 was lighter than it was in 1999 when Senate Republicans pocket filibustered two highly qualified and moderate nominees by President Clinton to vacancies on that circuit.  Now with the confirmation of Janice Rogers Brown to the court last week, there are 10 confirmed, active judges on the D.C. Circuit, which is what Republicans have always maintained is the most that circuit should have. Now, of course, we find we have another one.  With all the self-righteous talk from the other side of the aisle about their new-found ``principle'' that ever judicial nominee is entitled to an up-or-down vote, the facts are that the nominations of Allen Snyder and Elena Kagan to the D.C. Circuit were pocket filibustered by those same Senate Republicans in 1999 and 2000. Ms. Kagan is now Dean of the Harvard Law School. Qualified? Undoubtably. One of the most qualified people to be nominated to that court in the 31 years I have been in the Senate. Was she given consideration in a Republican-led Senate? Not on your life. She was filibustered by Republicans. Likewise, the nomination of Allen Snyder, former clerk to Chief Justice Rehnquist and a highly respected partner in a prominent D.C. law firm, was pocket filibustered by Senate Republicans. When one of Mr. Synder's partners, John Roberts, was nominated to the same court by President Bush, he was, of course, unanimously supported by Senate Republicans. Senate Republicans played a cruel joke on Mr. Snyder when they allowed him a hearing but then went on to refuse to list him for a vote by the Judiciary Committee or the Senate.  I recall that in September 2000, Senator Sessions explained that Clinton nominees Allen Snyder and Elena Kagan were blocked: ``Because the circuit had a caseload about one-fourth the average caseload per judge. And the chief circuit judge said 10 judges was enough, instead of 12. And I actually thought that was too many. I thought 10 was too many.'' So this Republican Senator joined in the pocket filibuster of these two nominees.  Well, the D.C. Circuit's caseload per judge is lower now than it was during the Clinton administration, but suddenly with a Republican President, Republican Senators say we need to fill those seats. It is a bit hypocritical. Let us see whether the votes of Republican Senators this time will be based on the same rationale they gave in inflicting pocket filibusters on Clinton nominees.  Last week we witnessed a Republican Senator--who had voted against the confirmation of a Clinton judicial recess appointment and had explained his vote as representing his opposition to recess appointments reverse himself to vote for a Bush judicial recess appointment.  Last week, we witnessed dozens of Republican Senators--who voted against confirmation of Ronnie White of Missouri in 1999 and had explained their vote as compelled by the opposition of his home-state Senators--reverse themselves and vote in favor of Justice Janice Rogers Brown and ignore the strong, consistent and well- founded opposition of her two home-state Senators.  Ronnie White, now the first African American to be chief justice of the Supreme Court of Missouri, was turned down by a double standard used by Republicans. I wonder whether the many Republicans Senators who delayed and opposed the confirmation of Merrick Garland in 1996 and 1997 and pocket filibustered the nominations of Allen Snyder and Elena Kagan in 1999 and 2000 will vote against a nominee to the D.C. Circuit because the caseload of the circuit does not justify more judges. We will see if Republican Senators again abandon their earlier rationale.  It is sometimes embarrassing, I think, to some of my friends on the other side to be reminded of all the rationales they used in pocket filibustering President Clinton's nominees, when now all of a sudden those same rationales are out the window when a Republican nominates a judge.  In addition, as I explained yesterday, my opposition to this particular nominee, Mr. Griffith, is because he did not follow the law. His decision to practice law without a license for a good part of his career should be disqualifying. He has not honored the rule of law by first practiced law illegally in the District of Columbia for several years and then in Utah for several years without even bothering to fulfill his obligation to become a member of the Utah bar. In this regard he appears to think he is above the law. This is not the kind of nominee who should be entrusted with a lifetime appointment to a Federal court and, least of all, to such an important court as the D.C. Circuit, which is entrusted with protecting the rights of all Americans. He may be a fine gentleman, but what a standard. We turn down a partner in a prestigious law firm because he was nominated by a Democrat, and we turn down a woman highly qualified who becomes the dean of the Harvard Law School, but she committed a sin of having been nominated by a Democratic President. When a Republican nominates somebody for the same seat and he practiced law illegally for 7 years, well, all is forgiven. This is the wrong nomination for this court, and I will vote against it.  I think it is another in a series of inappropriate nominations the President has made to the same court. Of course, the takeover of this court is now complete. It becomes an arm of the Republican Party. Mr. Griffith is the third nominee from President Bush to be considered by the Senate. If he is confirmed with those 11 judges, a majority of 7 judges will be appointed by Republican Presidents, but interestingly enough, they have turned this court into an arm of the Republican Party by using some of the worst double standards we have seen. Instead of having a balanced court where we have nominees of both parties, the Republicans in the Senate filibustered, pocket filibustered judge after judge nominated by a Democratic President.  The D.C. Circuit is an especially important court in our Nation's judicial system for its broad caseload coveringissues as varied as reviews of federal regulation on the environment, workplace safety, telecommunications, consumer protection, and other critical statutory and constitutional rights. The White House has rejected all Democratic efforts to work together on consensus nominees for this court and refused to engage in consultation. I wish the President would work to unite the country instead of dividing it. But he has divided the Senate and the American people with several of his judicial nominees. It is unfortunate for the judiciary, the Senate, and the Nation. The President's unilateral approach is totally unnecessary and unlike his predecessors'.  I have been here with six Presidents. Five before this Senate always consulted with both parties on judges they sought to unite rather than divide.  This is the first President who has not.  To reiterate, I oppose the nomination of Thomas Griffith to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Mr. Griffith's decision to practice law without a license for a good part of his career should be disqualifying. Mr. Griffith has foregone at least 10 opportunities to take the bar in Utah, and has continued to refuse during the pendency of his nomination. In this regard he appears to think he is above the law. That is not the kind of person who should be entrusted with a lifetime appointment to a Federal court and, least of all, to such an important court as the D.C. Circuit, which is entrusted with protecting the rights of all Americans. This is the wrong nomination for this court and I will vote against it.  Given the fact that the Supreme Court routinely reviews fewer than 100 cases per year, the circuit courts, like the D.C. Circuit, end up as the courts of last resort for nearly 30,000 cases each year. These cases affect the interpretation of the Constitution as well as statutes intended by Congress to protect the rights of all Americans, such as the right to equal protection of the laws and the right to privacy. The D.C. Circuit in particular is an especially important court in our Nation's judicial system because Congress has vested it with exclusive or special jurisdiction over cases involving many environmental, civil rights, consumer protection, and workplace statutes. For example, the D.C. Circuit has exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction in cases involving the National Labor Relations Board, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Federal Election Commission, and the Federal Communications Commission. The D.C. Circuit is entrusted with interpreting the Americans with Disability Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the Environmental Protection Agency, and has primary responsibility for ruling on the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, Superfund, the Clean Water Act, and the Clean Air Act. It is crucial that this court retain its independence.  The White House has rejected all Democratic efforts to work together on consensus nominees for this court and refused to engage in consultation. That is too bad and totally unnecessary. This is another in a series of inappropriate nominations this President has made to this court. Last week, Senate Republicans voted in lockstep to confirm Janice Rogers Brown to this court. The takeover of this court is now complete. Mr. Griffith is the third nominee for this court from President Bush to be considered by the Senate. If he is confirmed the 11 judges on the court will include a majority of seven judges appointed by Republican Presidents.  At Mr. Griffith's hearing last March, I noted that unlike the many anonymous Republican holds and pocket filibusters that kept more than 60 of President Clinton's moderate and qualified judicial nominees from moving forward, the concerns about Mr. Griffith were no secret. Unlike the Republicans' pocket filibusters of Allen Snyder and Elena Kagan, who were each denied consideration and an up or down vote when nominated to the D.C. Circuit, Mr. Griffith knows full well that I think he has not honored the rule of law by his practicing law in Utah for 5 years without ever bothering to fulfill his obligation to become a member of the Utah bar.  By one count, Mr. Griffith has so far foregone 10 opportunities to take the Utah bar exam while applying for and maintaining his position as general counsel at BYU. He is about to forego an eleventh. This conscious and continuous disregard of basic legal obligations is not consistent with the respect for law we should demand of lifetime appointments to the Federal courts. He has yet to satisfactorily explain why he obstinately insists on refusing to do what hundreds of lawyers do twice a year in Utah and thousands of lawyers do around the country: apply for and take the State bar exam and qualify to become a member of the State bar in order to legally practice law.  He has testified that he has obtained a Utah driver's license and pays Utah State taxes, but he is not a member of the bar despite admitting practicing law there since 2000. This is not Mr. Griffith's first or only bar problem. Mr. Griffith was less than forthcoming with us on questions related to his repeated failures to maintain his D.C. bar membership and his failures to pay his annual dues on time not just once, not twice, but in 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001. He was twice suspended for his failures, including one suspension that lasted for 3 years.  As was reported last summer in the Washington Post, and confirmed through committee investigation, Mr. Griffith has spent the last 5 years as the general counsel to BYU. In all that time he has not been licensed to practice law in Utah, nor has he followed through on any serious effort to become licensed. He has hidden behind a curtain of shifting explanations, thrown up smokescreens of letters from various personal friends and political allies, and refused to acknowledge what we all know to be true: Mr. Griffith should have taken the bar. I ask unanimous consent that the relevant Washington Post articles be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, Nov. 17, 2004] Court Nominee Gave False Data, Text Shows; Law License Was Suspended                           Despite Early Denial                         (By Carol D. Leonnig)       Thomas B. Griffith, President Bush's nominee to the U.S.      Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit,      appeared to provide inaccurate information to Utah bar      officials about his legal work and lapses in obtaining law      licenses over the past year, according to documents released      yesterday at his nomination hearing.       Griffith's nomination has been stalled for months over      concerns that he failed to maintain a valid license for three      years while he practiced law in the District and Utah, and      that he did not obtain a Utah license after taking a job as      general counsel for Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah.      Even as Griffith defended his record yesterday, the new      documents added to that controversy.       They show Griffith reported to Utah state bar officials      last year that his law license had never been suspended. It      had been suspended from 1998 to 2001. He also told the state      bar that he relied on his D.C. license to practice law in      Utah. But at yesterday's hearing, Griffith testified that he      had practiced law in Utah by relying on associations with      licensed attorneys there.       Senate Judiciary Chairman Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), a      longtime friend of Griffith's who pledged to ``do everything      in my power'' to help him win confirmation, scheduled      yesterday's hearing for the middle of a lame-duck session and      was the sole committee member present to question Griffith.      Democrats said they were surprised Hatch proceeded despite      the slim chances of the Senate approving Griffith in the      remaining days before Congress adjourns and the objections to      the nominee.       ``We're going to do our very best to get you confirmed      before the end of the session,'' Hatch told Griffith, before      acknowledging: ``It'll be miraculous if we do.''       Senator Russell Feingold (D-Wis.) asked that Griffith's      application and letters to the Utah bar be released at      yesterday's hearing.       The Washington Post reported this summer that Griffith's      D.C. license had been suspended because he did not pay bar      dues from 1998 to 2001, a lapse that prevented Griffith from      obtaining a reciprocal law license in Utah after he took the      Brigham Young job. Griffith applied late last year to take      the bar exam to obtain a Utah license but never sat for the      January 2004 test.       Last month, the American Bar Association gave Griffith the      lowest passing grade for a judicial nominee, a ``qualified''      rating. A large minority of the review committee voted ``not      qualified.''       Yesterday, in his first public comments on the matter,      Griffith said he ``deeply regrets'' his failure to make sure      that his law firm paid his dues so he could keep a valid      District law license. ``I bear full responsibility for what      happened,'' he said. ``I should not have relied on others.''       Griffith added that because his license was suspended for      administrative reasons, he     never considered it a true suspension or disciplinary matter,      and did not report it to Utah officials. ``The thought never      crossed my mind that it was related,'' he said.       Griffith also defended his decision not to obtain a Utah      law license since becoming general counsel at Brigham Young,      Hatch's alma mater, in the summer of 2000.       ``It was always my understanding that in-house counsel need      not be licensed,'' he said, as long as he worked with lawyers      who did have valid Utah state licenses when he dispensed      advice on state matters. He said he has been ``meticulous''      in limiting his work by collaborating with the four lawyers      he supervises in his office.       In the newly released licensing application to the Utah      state bar, however, Griffith answered ``yes'' to a question      on whether he practiced law in Utah. He reported that he did      so as general counsel for Brigham Young, relying on his D.C.      law license.       In April 2003, the documents show, Griffith wrote a letter      seeking advice from the Utah bar on how he could obtain a      state license. Griffith said he had erred in assuming that a      new state rule might help him get a reciprocal license. The      bar's general counsel, Katherine A. Fox, wrote back the next      month urging him to apply to take the bar exam and warning      him to work with licensed colleagues in the meantime.       ``It is unfortunate that you anticipated relying on the      rule without having an understanding of the restrictions it      imposed,'' she wrote.                                  ____               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 30, 2004]Appeals Nominee Gets Low Grade; ABA Cites Licensing Lapses in Granting                            `Qualified' Rating                         (By Carol D. Leonning)       The American Bar Association yesterday gave President      Bush's choice for a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the      District of Columbia the lowest possible passing grade for      judicial nominees, and sources said a Republican Senate      chairman was expected to schedule a hearing next week on his      nomination.       Thomas B. Griffith, who failed to obtain a law license in      Utah or keep a current license in the District during parts      of the past six years, received a slight majority from his      peers after an unusually long, three-month investigation.      Under the ABA's system, that means at least eight of the 15      members on the review panel rated him ``qualified'' for a      seat on the court, and at least six rated him ``not      qualified.''       The national lawyers group, which also offers a higher      rating of ``well qualified,'' evaluates judicial nominees for      the Senate.       Others have received the same rating and been appointed to      the federal judiciary. Of the 10 Bush administration appeals      court nominees who received the same rating, six were      confirmed to the bench. In President Bill Clinton's second      term, two of the five appellate court nominees who received      that rating were confirmed.       Griffith has declined to discuss his pending nomination.       A spokeswoman for Senate Judiciary Chairman Orrin G. Hatch      (R-Utah) declined to say whether he plans to hold a      nomination hearing for Griffith, but committee sources said      they expect Hatch to announce today that he will schedule a      hearing for Oct. 7. Hatch has campaigned for Griffith's      confirmation, telling senators it is personally important      that the White House nominee, a friend who hails from Hatch's      home state, join the bench.       ``The chairman is pretty committed to this nominee and has      a high impression of Mr. Griffith,'' said Hatch spokeswoman      Margarita Tapia.       Griffith failed to renew his law license in Washington for      three years while he was a lawyer based in the District from      1998 to 2000, as counsel to the U.S. Senate and a partner in      the firm of Wiley Rein and Fielding. He said the licensing      dues were not paid because of an oversight by his firm's      staff.       But that lapse subsequently prevented Griffith from      receiving a law license in Utah when he took a job as general      counsel for Brigham Young University in August 2000. Griffith      said he discovered his D.C. license had expired in 2001. The      Utah Bar told Griffith that after so many years without a      valid license, the only way he could obtain a Utah license      was to take the Utah bar exam. Griffith applied to sit for      the arduous test but never took it, bar officials said.       Opponents of Griffith's nomination said yesterday that the      low rating and the lateness of the Senate session should      prevent him from getting a hearing.       Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, (D-Vt.) who this month said      Griffith's nomination was on ``life support,'' said yesterday      that he was surprised the White House and Hatch continue to      press for a nominee with ``not exactly a confidence-inspiring      rating.''       ``This is a nominee who has been suspended from one legal      jurisdiction and who apparently continues to this day to      engage in the unauthorized practice of law in another,'' he      said.       Thomas Z. Hayward Jr., a Chicago lawyer with Bell, Boyd &      Lloyd and chairman of the ABA standing committee on judicial      nominations, acknowledged this is ``one of the more      difficult'' nominee investigations for the bar. He said that      after Griffith's license lapses were reported in The      Washington Post in June and a preliminary investigation was      conducted in July, committee members appeared ``very closely      split'' about whether Griffith met the minimum qualifications      for an appellate judgeship.       Hayward said he then ordered a supplemental investigation      ``to be fair to the nominee.'' About 40 more people with      direct knowledge of Griffith, his licensing lapses in the      District and Utah, and his career were interviewed.       People can respectfully disagree, but we have probably done      more investigation into the questions raised by this      nomination than anybody else, including the White House, the      FBI and the two sides of the [Senate] Judiciary Committee,''      Hayward said.
