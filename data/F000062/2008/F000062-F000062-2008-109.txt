 President, I would like to commend the distinguished Senator from Florida. I have watched him over these months, and no one has tried harder than he to move toward a solution with respect to the Florida situation. He has told me on several occasions that never before have as many people voted in an election as did in Florida. I think the Senator mentioned some 2 million people voting in some primary election. It is inconceivable to you, and therefore to us, I believe, to have a convention where Florida is not represented. Of course, the same comments would go for the great State of Michigan.  I just want the Senator to know that I am very appreciative of the efforts he has made to try to settle the situation. I only wish they could have been successful. I do not believe the door is closed. I think the more the people of this country understand how important Florida and Michigan are to the democratic process, there will be strong support to reach some accommodation.  I thank the Senator for all he has done.  (The remarks of Mrs. Feinstein pertaining to the submission of S. Res. 504 are located in today's Record under ``Submission of Concurrent and Senate Resolutions.'')  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). The Senator from North Dakota.
