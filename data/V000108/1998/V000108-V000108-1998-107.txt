Speaker, it is my pleasure to commend Lake County Public Library (LCPL) volunteers during National Library Week and National Volunteer Week. The LCPL honored its volunteers on Sunday, April 19, 1998, during the Friends of the Lake County Public Library annual meeting, which was held at the library in Merrillville, Indiana. Two individuals, Helen Goodman and Frank Peterson, earned special recognition for their outstanding service to the library.  Helen Goodman, of Crown Point, Indiana, has volunteered at the Lake County Public Library since 1986. An assistant in the library's Indiana Room Helen researches and locates materials for library patrons on such topics as genealogy. In addition to her daily responsibilities of sorting and reshelving materials, Helen takes the initiative to offer personal assistance to patrons who are in need of specific information. Helen is prompt, reliable, and so dedicated to serving patrons, the library's Reference Department has considered naming her an ``Honorary Reference Librarian''. Helen also volunteers in the Friends of the LCPL Book Sale Room, where she helps patrons select and purchase used materials. In addition, Helen is a loyal participant in all library programming, including book discussion group, as she thrives on the exchange of ideas through reading and research. Helen also displays her dedication to public service by working at the Veterans Administration (VA) several days a week. A VA volunteer since 1988, Helen assists disabled veterans with transportation needs by determining their eligibility and availability for assistance programs, as well as coordinating travel schedules. Helen also recruits other volunteers to help disabled veterans when necessary, and she is invaluable in maintaining quality patient care for the service.  Frank Peterson, a native of Portage, Indiana, has been a volunteer at the Lake County Public Library for 5 years. Frank assists the library's Book Coordinator by moving boxes of donated books for sorting, selecting, and shelving in the Book Sale Room. He works at least 2 hours each Tuesday morning and sometimes on Thursdays, re-arranging the books and encyclopedias, clearing the shelves of books for new selections, and organizing the Book Sale Room for the public. In addition, the library considers Frank to be its one-man publicity department, as he promotes the Book Sale Room to area newspapers and places advertisements for book donations. Frank has also taken the initiative to arrange for the distribution to underprivileged libraries and school districts in other states the library's excess books. Despite his ongoing battle with lung cancer, Frank continues to pursue his commitment to volunteerism through his service to the Lake County Public Library, as well as the Porter County Public Library book sale.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in commending Helen Goodman, Frank Peterson, and all the other volunteers at the Lake County Public Library for their outstanding service to their community. Their commitment to assisting others in the pursuit of knowledge has proven invaluable to the citizens of Indiana's First Congressional District.                          ____________________
