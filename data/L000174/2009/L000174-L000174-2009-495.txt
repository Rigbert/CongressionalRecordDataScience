As he said, we first knew each other when we were much younger and prosecutors.  I will just take a moment. When Marcelle and I first came here in January 1975 with three young children--Kevin, Alicia, and Mark--we never thought we would be here this long. I have enjoyed every moment of it. But especially, I have served with hundreds and hundreds of Senators, both Republican and Democratic Senators. I have enjoyed my relationship with every single one of the men and women with whom I have had the privilege to serve.  We have often said we are the conscience of the Nation--the Senate. Only 100 of us have the privilege to serve here at any given time to represent a great and wonderful Nation of 300 million people. It is a privilege, and it is an honor.  I thank my colleagues for this tribute. This is something I will long remember.  I yield the floor.
