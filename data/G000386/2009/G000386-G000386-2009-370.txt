 President, I am going to tell the Senator from New Jersey that I agree with him totally on part of the money that is in this $87 billion. He is absolutely right on his argument for $10.8 billion of the money that is in there. That is the money we have had the CBO say is going to be spent for Medicaid for the unemployed. But what about the other $75 billion or $76 billion? We don't apologize for it somehow. It is a slush fund to States.  There is no rationale for that part of the money to go out under the same circumstances as the result of the recession--the fact that people are going to need more medical care. I ask him to consider that the Senator is right for a small part of this $87 billion--$10.8 billion of it--but wrong about the remaining amount of it. So that is why I have my amendment as a matter of fairness for money being distributed to the States, unrelated to unemployment, or medical care that is needed because of unemployment.  I want to spend my few minutes telling you what States benefit: Alabama, $41 million; Alaska, $45 million; Arizona, $58 million; Arkansas, $99 million; District of Columbia, $43 million; Georgia, $31 million; Idaho, $16 million; Indiana, $29 million; Iowa, $128 million; Kansas, $61 million; Kentucky, $92 million; Louisiana, $158 million; Maine, $23 million; Maryland, $1 million; Mississippi, $102 million; Missouri, $51 million; Montana, $25 million; Nebraska, $52 million; New Hampshire, $22 million; New Mexico, $86 million; North Carolina, $54 million; North Dakota, $25 million; Ohio, $78 million; Oklahoma, $86 million; Oregon, $4 million; South Carolina, $47 million; South Dakota, $24 million; Tennessee, $32 million; Texas, $547 million; Utah, $59 million; Vermont, $2 million; West Virginia, $86 million; Wisconsin, $55 million; Wyoming, $13 million.  I think what we are talking about here is a matter of fairness for those States--for the portion of the FMAP that doesn't need to be needed except for medical care for the unemployed. The part going to States under the FMAP formula needs a more fair distribution.  I will yield back my time.
