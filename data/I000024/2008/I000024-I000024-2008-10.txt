This study provides the Secretary of Defense an independent assessment of a space-based interceptor element of our missile defense system. I think we all agree that a layered missile defense capability provides us with the best defense against ballistic missile delivered weapons of mass destruction as well as a defense against attacks against our satellites which have become so necessary to what we do militarily and economically.  This study will be an independent investigation into the technical feasibility and cost effectiveness of incorporating a space-based layer to our ballistic missile defense system. The study is neither a procurement program nor an attempt to weaponize space. It could lead to the development of new technologies and concepts that would provide the United States, our allies and our deployed forces protection from the threat of rapidly proliferating ballistic missile technology, as well as the rising threat of attacks on our vulnerable national security space systems.  As Senator Kyl stated, last year 120 foreign ballistic missiles were launched. North Korea, Iran, and China remain likely suspects in ballistic missile proliferation and China has proven its ability to attack satellites. Recent Russian aggression in Georgia and reports on the state of China's military raise concerns about accidental or unauthorized launches of ICBMs.  The threat exists. It is important to do these studies now in order to develop the technologies and the defenses we need. Waiting until our Nation or our allies are attacked is too late. Wishing away the threat, as some in this Congress would have us do, is not a solution.  I thank my colleagues for this important move to ensure the safety of our Nation. Having the knowledge gleaned from this study will allow us to decide on the next step, should it be necessary.                          ____________________
