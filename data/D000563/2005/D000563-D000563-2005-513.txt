President, I rise today to honor the late William A. Koch for his contributions to preserving the memory and legacy of President Abraham Lincoln's early life.  Mr. Koch was a man of vision, integrity, and generosity. Born in Santa Claus, IN, Mr. Koch worked throughout his life to establish the Lincoln Boyhood National Memorial in order to secure a place to preserve the legacy of Lincoln's years in Indiana.  William Koch headed the effort to incorporate the Nancy Hanks State Memorial into the National Park Service and led a campaign for the passage of a bill to establish the Lincoln Boyhood National Memorial. Mr. Koch's efforts were so integral to the passage of the bill that he was invited to witness its signing by President Kennedy on February 19, 1962.  Today, visitors from across the country travel to Indiana where the Visitor Center and Living History Farm reveal the importance of Lincoln's Indiana years in his development from boyhood to the man he became. Without the dedication of William Koch, the preservation of Lincoln's early life would have been greatly diminished. Mr. Koch is survived by his wife Patricia Koch and his children, who now carry on his mission.  I am grateful for the achievements of Mr. William A. Koch and his contributions to this Nation. Through his relentless dedication, Mr. Koch has helped preserve the legacy of President Abraham Lincoln for future generations.                          ____________________[Page S11657]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                        HONORING WILLIAM A.
