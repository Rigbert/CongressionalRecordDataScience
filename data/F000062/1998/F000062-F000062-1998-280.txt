 I must say, Mr. President, that one of the most interesting letters to me is one from the CATO Institute, dated February 6.  They attach to their letter a very interesting article from Science magazine which really casts major doubts on the conclusions drawn from the Dolly experiment.  The letter says that the new information indicates that there is no need to rush legislation, and it can be accorded the time and deliberation appropriate to legislate that can have a lasting impact on biological research in this country.  The article from Science magazine questions whether Dolly originated from adult cell DNA. Interesting. And it suggests that she might have resulted from the cloning of an embryonic cell. ``Scientists have cloned embryonic cells for years, and those activities have raised no public concern. The last sentence in the first paragraph of the Science news article sums up the significance of the new information. If Dolly isn't the product of DNA from a mature cell, `it would mean that human cloning, which for most conceivable purposes would start with adult cells, is not the immediate threat some worry about.' ''  And CATO goes on and says:       With this new information in hand, there appears to be no      need to rush legislation, and at a minimum there is ample      time for hearings with knowledgeable and respected      scientists, ethicists, theologians, and others testifying      about the proposed legislation and its ramifications.  The CATO letter continues,       Many scientists, including the Director of the NIH, worry      that hastily drafted and loosely drawn legislation directed      against cloning will foreclose research that promises new      drugs and the capacity to replace or repair nerves, skin, and      muscle lost to injury or disease. The information from      Science indicates that legislative haste is not necessary.  I ask unanimous consent that the CATO letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                               Cato Institute,                                 Washington, DC, February 6, 1998.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: As you are well aware, the uproar      over Dolly and the perils that many people see in the      possibility of human cloning have resulted in the      introduction of legislation to prohibit research into human      cloning. A letter and news article from this week's Science      magazine (enclosed) cast doubt on the conclusions drawn from      Dolly. The new information indicates that there is no need to      rush legislation and that it can be accorded the time and      deliberation appropriate to legislation that can have a      lasting impact on biological research in this country.       Few biological results have excited as much attention as      the announcement of Dolly's birth eleven months ago. Dolly      was important and surprising because, it was claimed, she was      produced from the DNA of an adult sheep.       Mammalian life begins with a ``totipotent'' fertilized egg      that can multiply and differentiate into all the diverse      types of cells--skin, nerves, bones, muscle, etc.--that make      up a mature animal. As cells differentiate into specialized      cells, they lose the capacity to carry out the functions of      other cell types; they are no longer totipotent. A skin cell      cannot produce a nerve, bone, or muscle cell, for example.       Dolly was a surprise because she was, apparently, the      product of DNA from a differentiated, specialized cell from      the udder of a mature sheep. The DNA was introduced into a      DNA-less egg, and the egg was implanted into the uterus of a      sheep where it developed into Dolly.       Dolly, at the time the experiment was announced last year,      appeared to open up the possibility of human cloning. In      theory, DNA could be taken from a woman or man and inserted      into a DNA-less egg, and the egg, which now contained the      genetic information from the donor, could be introduced into      the uterus of a woman. If a child resulted from the process,      she or he would be genetically identical to the woman or man      from whom the DNA came.       The enclosed letter from Science questions whether Dolly      originated from adult cell DNA, and it suggests that she      might have resulted from the cloning of an embryonic cell.      Scientists have clonsed embryonic cells for years, and those      activities have raised no public concerns. The last sentence      of the first paragraph of the Science news article sums up      the significance of the new information. If Dolly isn't the      product of DNA from a mature cell, ``it would mean that human      cloning, which for most conceivable purposes would start with      adult cells, is not the immediate threat some worry about.''       With this new information in hand, there appears to be no      need to rush legislation. At a minimum, there is ample time      for hearings with knowledgeable and respected scientists,      ethicists, theologians, and others testifying about the      proposed legislation and its ramifications.       Human cloning, if it is ever accomplished, will offer the      promise of a child to love and cherish to couples who      otherwise would be childless. Although cloning has been      greeted very negatively, it is also true that negative     reactions met almost every advance in human reproduction      technologies--artificial insemination, in vitro      fertilization, ``fertility drugs,'' prenatal diagnoses. Those      technologies became accepted when they gave healthy children      to couples that otherwise would have been childless.       Many scientists, including the Director of the National      Institutes of Health, worry that hastily drafted and loosely      drawn legislation directed against cloning will foreclose      research that promises new drugs and the capacity to replace      or repair nerves, skin, and muscle lost to injury or disease.      The information from Science indicates that legislative haste      is not necessary.       I will be happy to talk with you or your staff and to      provide additional information.           Sincerely,                                              Michael Gough, Ph.D.
