Mr. Speaker, House Concurrent Resolution 131 is a resolution that recognizes the importance of our oceans and the fact that 1998 has been internationally declared the ``Year of the Ocean.''  As the Congressman for all Alaska, I am keenly aware of how vital the oceans are to my constituents. With the largest coastline in the Nation of 6,640 miles, Alaskan waters contain some of the richest and most valuable fishing grounds in the world. Many Alaskan towns are connected to the rest of the State only by watercraft, and many Alaskan Natives depend on fish and marine mammals for their subsistence.  I strongly support efforts to focus attention on these bodies of water, which comprise nearly three-quarters of the Earth's surface. While remarkably we know little about many of the ocean's resources, in the future we are likely to grow increasingly dependent on the energy, food, and mineral resources that exist there.  During the past 3 years, the Subcommittee on Fisheries Conservation, Wildlife and Oceans has conducted valuable hearings on the importance of our fishery resources, the ocean disposal of radioactive materials, the impact of offshore mineral production, and the need to update nautical charts. In fact, we have been successful in convincing the appropriators that accurate charts are essential to the maritime community and that adequate funding is necessary.  The United States has always been a fishing nation, and these resources have provided protein to millions of Americans. It is crucial that our world's fisheries be properly managed and that effective conservation measures be enforced. By focusing attention on this issue, House Concurrent Resolution 131 serves an important purpose. I compliment the authors for highlighting the need to promote sound stewardship of the oceans and their living marine resources.  I urge my colleagues to support House Concurrent Resolution 131.
