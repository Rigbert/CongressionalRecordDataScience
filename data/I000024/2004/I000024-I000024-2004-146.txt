President, I rise today to honor Marianne Lamont Horinko who currently serves as the Assistant Administrator of the Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response at the Environmental Protection Agency. Marianne has served our Nation in that post since October 1, 2001, and just a few weeks from now will return to private life and to spend more time with her family.  As Assistant Administrator of OSWER, Marianne demonstrated outstanding leadership and has met the unprecedented challenges of a post September 11th America. Ms. Horinko realized the incredible challenges that lay before her just one month after the horrific attacks of that day. Immediately upon assuming office, Marianne refocused the traditional missions of OSWER from waste management and related reclamation work of contaminated sites to emergency response of historic proportions. She led the clean-up effort at Ground Zero in New York City and the Pentagon, a mission that no one could have contemplated before then and still haunts us today.  While managing the emergency response of the September 11th destruction, Congress itself was the victim of a cowardly anthrax biological attack. Facing yet another unprecedented event, Marianne led the emergency response and clean up effort not of a Superfund site, but of the Senate office buildings, and ensured that the Capitol community was safe from harm and helping Congress return to doing the work for the Nation.  In 2003, as National Program manager, Ms. Horinko oversaw EPA's response to the Columbia Space Shuttle Disaster. Again, Marianne charted a new course for OSWER and crafted the groundbreaking National Approach to Response.  Marianne has accepted challenge after challenge head on as Assistant Administrator of OSWER, and assumed responsibility when called upon. Not only did she exceed expectation in that role, but she also performed as acting administrator of the entire Environmental Protection Agency after the resignation of Governor Whitman.  Marianne has brought dynamic new approaches to environmental protection using partnerships, flexibility and innovation to create environmental improvements rather than the old command and control systems of the past. The Brownfields program, signed into law by President Bush in 2002, is just one of the many ways that Marianne's results-based leadership led to environmental protection.  Marianne Lamont Horinko proved to be one of the most diligent, dynamic, and outstanding leaders in the history of the Environmental Protection Agency. We thank her for her service to our Nation, and wish her all the best in her future pursuits.                          ____________________
