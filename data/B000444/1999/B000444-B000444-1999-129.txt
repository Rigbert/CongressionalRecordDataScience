 President, regarding that, I point out to my friend that the ability to do that is in direct proportion to the lack of a MIRV'd capability on the part of other countries--that is, other countries being able to put multi-reentry nuclear missiles on a vehicle to fire at us.  All of the technology and testimony from all sources has indicated that for countries that don't have that capability now to be able to move to that capability, which requires them to have a much lighter physics package, or nuclear package on top of a missile--it must be lighter, and it must have a boost capacity--in order for them to develop that, they will have to have testing which is detectable beyond anybody's doubt.  So I make the point that the ability to establish a credible missile defense is directly dependent upon the ability of us to keep other nations from developing the ability to have MIRV'd reentry vehicles.  I yield 10 minutes now to my friend from Minnesota.
