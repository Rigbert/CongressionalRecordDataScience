You asked a critical question because this settlement does not deal with those that originated mortgages. It only deals with those mortgages that were held in the secondary market. And so it doesn't claw black to the perpetrators of the scheme, and that's why I'm saying this is an important first step.  We also need, in every city, as we had during the savings and loan crisis, strike forces of FBI agents. There were maybe 55 agents working on this. We tried to boost that number to 200. During the S&L crisis we had 1,000. We need accounting and forensic experts to piece together what happened in community after community.  Congressman, in my area there were liars loans that were targeted to senior citizens and the disabled.
