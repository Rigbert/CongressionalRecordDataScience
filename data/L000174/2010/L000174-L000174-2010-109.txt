President, today, I am introducing bipartisan legislation to add military veterans to the list of groups eligible to receive excess property donations from the Federal Government. The sacrifices that members of our armed forces make every day for us and our country cannot be overstated, and I welcome any opportunity to recognize their services. While this bill is a small token, it is another effort to give back to our military veterans. I encourage the Senate to act swiftly and pass this bill.  The FOR VETS Act will enable military veterans to receive surplus goods donations through the Federal Government's property distribution program. The types of property donated through this program include computers, trucks, snowmobiles, home appliances, and electronics. These are items that would be of good use to our military veterans, and which they should have the opportunity to claim.  The administrator of General Services oversees this property distribution program, which currently donates property to medical institutions, providers of assistance to the homeless, universities, and child care facilities, among others. Given the surplus of available goods, military veterans' groups are simply being added into this pool of recipients for goods that might otherwise go unused.  I am pleased to be joined by the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee Ranking Member, Senator Collins, in sponsoring this legislation. This is a bipartisan effort, as legislation to support our veterans should always be, and I hope Congress will come together to promptly send this legislation to the President to be signed into law.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3794       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
