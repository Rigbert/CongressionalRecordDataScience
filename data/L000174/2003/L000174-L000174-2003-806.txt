President, I rise today to introduce the First Responders Partnership Grant Act of 2003. I thank the Democratic Leader, Senator Daschle, and Assistant Democratic Leader, Senator Reid, for joining me as original cosponsors of this legislation that will supply our nation's first responders with the support they so desperately need to protect homeland security and prevent and respond to acts of terrorism.  I want to begin by thanking each of our Nation's brave firefighters, emergency rescuers, law enforcement officers, and other first responder personnel for the jobs they do for the American public day in and day out. Our public safety officers are often the first to respond to any crime or emergency situation. On September 11, the Nation saw that the first on the scene at the World Trade Center were the heroic firefighters, police officers and emergency personnel of New York City. These real-life heroes, many of whom gave the ultimate sacrifice, remind us of how important it is to support our State and local public safety partners.  But while we ask our Nation's first responders to defend us as never before on the front lines against the dark menace of domestic terrorism, we have failed to supply them with the Federal support they need and deserve to protect us, as we expect and need them to protect us.  Since March 12, 2002, the Federal Homeland Security Advisory System has kept State and local first responders on Yellow Alert, an ``elevated'' threat level declared when there is a significant risk of terrorist attacks, requiring increased surveillance of critical locations. On top of this, from September 10 to September 24 last year, Attorney General Ashcroft declared our country at Orange Threat level, a ``high'' condition indicating a high probability of a terrorist attack and when additional precautions by first responders are necessary at public events. Only hours ago, in fact, counterterrorism officials warned that the threat of terrorist attacks on U.S. soil is at a higher level than in previous months due to the possibility of impending military action against Iraq. Debate has already begun at the new Department of Homeland Defense on whether to put out an alert warning or to actually raise the national threat level to Orange again.  Counties, cities and towns in my home state of Vermont and across the U.S. find themselves overwhelmed by increasing homeland security costs required by the Federal government. Indeed, the National Governors Association estimates that states incurred around $7 billion in security costs over the past year alone. As a result, the national threat alerts and other Federal homeland security requirements have become unfunded Federal mandates on our State and local governments. Rutland County Sheriff R.J. Elrick, President of the Vermont Sheriffs' Association, recently wrote to me, ``We are in dire need of financial support to keep our personnel trained and equipped to meet the challenges here at home as we continue our vigilant commitment to fight terrorism.''  I will ask unanimous consent to place after my remarks in the Record the letter from the Vermont Sheriffs' Association, as well as letters from the Professional Firefighters of Vermont, the Vermont Ambulance Association, and the Vermont Association of Police Chiefs, and Chief Doug Hoyt of Montpelier, Chief Anthony Bossi of Rutland City, Chief David Demag of Essex, and Chief Jeffery Whitesell of Winhall.  When terrorists strike, first responders are and will always be the first people we turn to for help. We place our lives and the lives of our families and friends in the hands of these officers, trusting that when called upon they will protect and save us.  Just how, without supplying them with the necessary resources, do we expect our Nation's first responders to realistically carry out their duties?  Our State and local law enforcement officers, firefighters and emergency personnel are full partners in preventing, investigating and responding to terrorist acts. They need and deserve the full collaboration of the Federal government to meet these new national responsibilities.  Washington is buzzing about the literally hundreds of billions of additional dollars the President plans to ask Congress to provide for our military services to fight the war on terrorism abroad. The same cannot be said for helping security here at home, which is shamefully overlooked. For a year and a half I have been working hard to remedy that, with allies like our distinguished Democratic Leader and Assistant Democratic Leader, and New York Senators Schumer and Clinton. As former chair and now ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, I have made it a high priority to evaluate and meet the needs of our first responders.  For these reasons, I am proud to introduce the First Responders Partnership Grant Act to give our nation's law enforcement officers, firefighters and emergency personnel the resources they need to do their jobs. Our legislation will establish a grant program at the Department of Justice to provide $4 billion nationwide in annual Federal funds to support State and local public safety officers in their efforts to protect homeland security and prevent and respond to acts of terrorism.  Similar to the highly successful Department of Justice Community Oriented Policing Services and the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Programs, the First Responder Grants will be made directly to State and local government units for overtime, equipment, training and facility expenses to support our law enforcement officers, firefighters and emergency personnel.  The First Responder Grants may be used to pay up to 90 percent of the cost of the overtime, equipment, training or facility. In cases of fiscal hardship, the Justice Department can waive the local match requirement of 10 percent to provide federal funds for communities that cannot afford the local match.  In a world shaped by the violent events of September 11, day after day we call upon our public safety officers to remain vigilant. We not only ask them to put their lives at risk in the line of duty, but also, if need be, give their lives to protect us.  If we take time to listen to our Nation's State and local public safety partners, they will tell us that they welcome the challenge to join in our national mission to protect our homeland security. But we cannot ask our firefighters, emergency personnel, and law enforcement officers to assume these new national responsibilities without also providing new federal support.  The First Responders Partnership Grant Program will provide the necessary federal support for our state and public safety officers to serve as full partners in the fight to protect our homeland security. We need our first responders for the security and the life-saving help they bring to our communities. All they ask is for the tools they need to do their jobs for us. And for the sake of our own security, that is not too much to ask.  I ask unanimous consent that the letters I referred to be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letters was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                    Rutland County                                         Sheriff's Department,                                    Rutland, VT, January 31, 2003.     Senator Patrick Leahy,     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Office Building, Washington, DC.       Senator Leahy: I am responding on behalf of the Vermont      Sheriffs' Association, having reviewed your current proposed      bill entitled, ``First Responders Partnership Grant      Program''.       The Vermont Sheriffs have unanimously voted to endorse your      proposed bill as written. As you know all too well, we are      being asked to perform on the front lines at a level never      before seen, and with fewer resources at the local level. We      are in dire need of financial support to keep our personnel      trained and equipped to meet the challenges here at home as      we continue our vigilant commitment to fight terrorism.       Your continued commitment to the men and women in the      trenches is applauded and appreciated. We remain supportive      of your efforts and look forward to hearing more as the bill      progresses in Congress.           Sincerely,                                                  R.J. Elrick,                                                          Sheriff,     President--Vermont Sheriffs' Association.                                  ____                                         Professional Firefighters                                                   of Vermont,                           White River Jct., VT, January 17, 2003.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     Federal Building,     Montpelier, VT.       Dear Senator Leahy: I am writing to express my support for      the proposed First Responder Partnership Grant Act of 2003.       As you are well aware it is the local public safety      officers who are our Nations first line of defense whenever      tragedy strikes. Since we are this vital link in protecting      homeland security it is extremely important that we have the      resources needed to safely complete this task. The First      Responders Grant Act provides the financial assistance that      local public safety officers need so greatly.       In closing I wish to thank you for your efforts, and once      again express my support and gratitude for the First      Responders Grant Act of 2003. If I can be of any further      assistance please feel free to contact me.           Sincerely,                                                     Steven Locke,     President.                                  ____                                Vermont Ambulance Association,                                    Rutland, VT, January 29, 2003.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     U.S. Senate, Russell Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: The Vermont Ambulance Association and      it's membership strongly support The First Responders      Partnership Grant Act to be introduced in the United States      Senate.       This legislation will bring much needed dollars into local      emergency response systems to be better prepared to respond      to acts of terrorism and serve our communities in homeland      security. We very much appreciate your support of Emergency      Services. Particularly important in this bill is the fact      that it recognizes there are multiple types of public and      private departments and services that protect and serve      communities and they all will be eligible for funding.       Again, we support and thank you for your commitment to      Vermont's Emergency Services and to the safety and security      of the citizens we serve.           Sincerely,                                                  James A. Finger,     President V.A.A.                                  ____                                            Vermont Association of                                             Chiefs of Police,                                                 January 31, 2003.     Senator Patrick J. Leahy,     Russell Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy:  Having been informed of ``The Leahy      First Responders Partnership Grant Act'', I would like you to      know that Vermont Chief's of Police Association      wholeheartedly supports the concept. Public safety officials      throughout the nation have been required to address a whole      new set of issues since September 11, 2001. These issues have      required the need for new training, changes in priorities and      thoughts towards security and safety of first responders,      often without the addition of any new resources. A grant      program of this nature will greatly enhance the ability of      law enforcement, and other first responders, to continue to      pursue their individual missions and to preserve the      individual freedom and security that everyone deserves.       I must add that I feel that it would be beneficial to      afford local entities the opportunity to apply directly to      the government for these grants due to the fact each entity      would have the best knowledge of what their individual needs      are.       If the Vermont Association of Chiefs of Police can be of      any assistance in this endeavor, please feel free to contact      me at anytime.           Sincerely,                                              Brett R. Van Noordt,     President.                                  ____                                 Montpelier Police Department,                                 Montpelier, VT, January 22, 2003.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: Thank you for your staff's notification      of the First Responder Partnership Grant Program For Public      Safety Officers. Jessica has been very helpful in providing      details of your introduction of this legislation.       I know that you are keenly aware of the need for local      government to be able to access funding in the area of      homeland security. Montpelier as well as select larger      communities based on location and function have greater      responsibilities in this new age of defense. At the same time      the State of Vermont is no different from many other states      in the country that are experiencing critical financial      decisions to meet the ``normal'' demands of government.      Shouldering the burden for national defense only adds to the      critical needs.       The current administration cannot realistically believe      that a DOJ funding program that goes to the State of Vermont      which result in a trickle of $3,000 to the Montpelier Police      Department for a radio actually meets the response needs for      government in the Capital City of Vermont.       In support of this legislative initiative I would encourage      your office to advocate strongly for the local units of      government to have a larger role and voice in the      distribution of these funds. In Vermont, as you well know,      the State Government generally controls what occurs on the      local level and the temptation with such a large amount of      money is too great to have local communities excluded.       Again, thank you for your efforts and those of your staff      on behalf of law enforcement and the City of Montpelier. It      is always a pleasure when I call your office. I hope to be in      the Washington area between March 29 and April 1 and hope      that I will be able to stop and visit and perhaps we can talk      about this and other matters important to Montpelier and the      State of Vermont.           Sincerely,                                                  Douglas S. Hoyt,     Chief of Police.                                  ____                                    Rutland Police Department,                                    Rutland, VT, January 30, 2003.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: As the Chief of Policy of The City of      Rutland, Vermont and the immediate past president of the      Vermont Association of Chiefs of Police I am writing this      letter to support your efforts to introduce and pass the      ``First Responders Partnership Grant Act of 2003.''       This grant program will help us at a local level to be able      to have the resources we need to do our jobs in protecting      the citizens of Rutland and Vermont.       Thank you for your strong support of Law Enforcement and      everything you have done for Rutland Police Department. As      always please feel free to contact me if there is anything      more I can do to help you.           Sincerely,                                                 Anthony L. Bossi,     Chief of Police.                                  ____                                      Essex Police Department,                             Essex Junction, VT, January 23, 2003.     Senator Patrick J. Leahy,     Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: Having been informed of ``The Leahy      First Responders Partnership Grant Act'', I would like you to      know that I wholeheartedly support the concept. Public safety      officials throughout the nation have been required to address      a whole new set of issues since September 11, 2001.

Demag,     Chief of Police.                                  ____                                      Winhall Police & Rescue,                                  Bondville, VT, January 22, 2003.     Senator Patrick Leahy,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator: I have read and understand the ``Leahy First      Responders Partnership Grant Program.'' The legislation as      proposed will greatly assist local and state agencies combat      terrorism and educate our citizens. I am in support of this      legislative initiative. Local first responders are a very      valuable entity in this war on terrorism. Thank you for not      forgetting us.           Sincerely,                                             Jeffery L. Whitesell,                                         Chief of Police & Rescue.                                 ______                                       By
