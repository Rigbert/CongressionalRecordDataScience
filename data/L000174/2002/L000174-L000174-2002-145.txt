I send my best to all those who are grandparents. The Presiding Officer, of course, is far too young to know the joys of that time in our lives. She does have the joy of two of the most beautiful children anybody has seen in the Senate family. But there will be a day when the other will come. The ranking member and I have the joy of being grandparents.  So I wish all grandparents the best and also extend special wishes to one growing, shameless Leahy.  After that outrageous usurpation of the podium, Madam President, probably, if my wife is watching, she is probably beginning to wonder if I took too much time off in August.                          ____________________
