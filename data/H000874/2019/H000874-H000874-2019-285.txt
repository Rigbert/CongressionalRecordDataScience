Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his question.  As the gentleman knows, we passed an initial bill some many weeks ago. The Senate didn't pass that. We then passed, more recently, a bill which did, in fact, take care of everyone we know who has had a natural disaster in the interim as well as those we had taken care of the first time around.  So, we think we have a good bill that was passed; however, as the gentleman also referenced, the President has asked for an additional supplemental of a little over $4 billion referenced for humanitarian issues at the border. That is being reviewed.  As the gentleman probably also knows, an offer was made to our side.That offer has now been responded to with respect to both the initial and the supplemental--initial, I mean the disaster bill--and we are looking for an answer back at some point in time to our response. But, hopefully, we can reach an agreement.
