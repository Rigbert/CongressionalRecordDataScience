Mr. Speaker, in the true spirit of bipartisanship, I want to be as partisan as my colleagues across the aisle. There they go again. They say they want tax relief, but actions speak louder than words. Their history: Big spending, big taxes, big government, and they are fighting with all their heart, mind, soul and body to stop tax relief. That is the bottom line.  The sad part about this is that the President offered a hand across the aisle in a true bipartisan spirit for their help to give the American people a refund on their money. What did he get in return? A partisan slap in the face.  I think that beyond a shadow of a doubt what has been displayed here today with the Democratic dilatory tactics, the American people can see what the Democrats are all about. They have never seen a tax cut that they like. They have never seen a tax increase that they have not liked. They have never seen a big government spending bill that they would not vote for.  Mr. Speaker, let us get the money, the tax money, out of Washington and in the pockets of the American people.  Families need help, not Washington bureaucrats. If the Democrats refuse to help and Republicans have to do it alone, so be it.
