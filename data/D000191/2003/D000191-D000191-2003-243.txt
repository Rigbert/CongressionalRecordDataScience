Speaker, we should remember that unemployment benefits have been paid for by the employers and the employees. The employers have to pay a tax; most economists say that comes in the form of lower wages or at least is shared in lower wages by the employees, and there is a large and healthy balance in the unemployment trust fund. Yet our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, the President and the Republican majority, have refused to expend some of those taxes. That was money that was saved for a rainy day for families and individuals across this country. It is raining like hell out there right now, and they need that money. It is their money. That, in fact, does not have an impact on the deficit. Giving a $300 billion tax break to people who clip coupons on their taxes does cost the Federal Treasury and will increase the deficit, but if we kept the books honestly, money spent out of the unemployment trust fund which has been accumulated over many years for a rainy day would not count as money that is spent and created out of nothing. There is money there to spend. It is just like we could invest in infrastructure by spending down the highway trust fund. We could invest in aviation by spending down the aviation trust fund. We could accelerate a whole bunch of projects across this country and put people back to work, really. I mean, in the phony way we keep books here, it counts as deficit; but in reality it would not be. The American taxpayers would be getting the money back that they paid for the purpose for which it was intended, which is unemployment benefits or investment in bridges, highways, roads and aviation.
