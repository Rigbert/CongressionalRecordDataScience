 They are from the national veterans service organizations: The American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, Amvets, Paralyzed Veterans of America, and Disabled American Veterans.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                          The American Legion,                                   Washington, DC, April 11, 2005.     Hon. Patty Murray,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Murray: Thank you for offering an amendment to      the H.R. 1268, FY 2005 emergency supplemental appropriations,      to add $2 billion for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)      medical care. VA medical care is truly the ongoing cost of      war. You have The American Legion's full support.       VA is not meeting the health care needs of America's      veterans. Currently, certain veterans are actually denied      access to the VA health care system even though they are      willing to make co-payments and have third-party health care      insurance, while other face lengthy delays in accessing care.      Although providing quality health care, VA cannot meet its      own timely access standards simply because it lacks the      health care professionals to meet the demand for services.       In 2003, the President's Task Force to Improve Health Care      Delivery For Our Nation's Veterans cited ``eliminating the      mismatch between demand and funding'' as a major obstacle.      Last year, VA officials claimed to need between 10 and 14      percent annual increases just to maintain current services      because of Federal payraises and medical inflation. VA health      care is still the best value for the taxpayer's dollar.       As former active-duty service members, especially National      Guard and Reservists, transition to their civilian      lifestyles, many new veterans will turn to VA to address      their health care concerns, especially those with mental      health problems associated with combat. VA is a world leader      in effective treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder      (PTSD) and other readjustments problems. VA must be funded to      make sure this newest generation of wartime veterans are      properly cared for in a timely manner and not displace other      veterans seeking care due simply to limited resources.       Once again, thank you for offering an amendment to add $2      billion for VA medical     care. Timely access to VA medical care is an earned benefit      from a grateful nation.           Sincerely,                                              Steve Robertson,                                                         Director,     National Legislative Commission.                                  ____                                       The Independent Budget,                                    Washington, DC, April 6, 2005.       Dear Senator: On behalf of the co-authors of The      Independent Budget, AMVETS, Disabled American Veterans,      Paralyzed Veterans of America, and the Veterans of Foreign      Wars, we are writing to express our support for the proposed      Murray-Akaka amendment to the FY 2005 Emergency Supplemental      that would provide $1.9 billion in much needed funding for      veterans' health care.       Providing health care to returning servicemembers is an      ongoing cost of our national defense. Servicemembers who      participate in a theater of combat are eligible for health      care from the Department of Veterans Affairs for two years      after separation or release from active duty, without regard      for strict eligibility rules. VA hospitals are facing budget      deficits and moving to reduce services. Neither the      Administration's FY 2006 budget request nor the recently      passed budget resolution, addressed the costs of providing      needed health care. The Independent Budget has recommended an      increase for VA health care of $3.5 billion for FY 2006. This      amendment would provide the funding needed to care for these      returning veterans, as well as provide the resources the VA      needs to meet shortfalls that are affecting veterans today.       We ask you to support this amendment and to provide the      dollars needed to care for servicemembers returning from Iraq      and Afghanistan, as well as all veterans who rely upon the VA      to provide their health care.           Sincerely,     Rick Jones,       National Legislative Director, AMVETS.     Richard B. Fuller,       National Legislative Director, Paralyzed Veterans of      America.     Joseph A. Violante,       National Legislative Director, Disabled American Veterans.     Dennis Cullinan,       National Legislative Director, Veterans of Foreign Wars of      the United States.
