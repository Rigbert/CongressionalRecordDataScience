 Verrill of Laurel County, KY. Mr. Verrill is a veteran of World War II and served a tour of duty in Europe in 1945. Today he is 92 years old and resides on Old Whitley Road in Laurel County.  Mr. Verrill, or ``Herb'' as many call him, served in the U.S. Army, Company E, 399th Infantry Regiment, 100th infantry division. Near Reyersviller, France, on March 15, 1945, he commanded a small troop. He was just a lieutenant, and at the time he and his men ventured into the midst of an attack that day. To Herb's horror, his unit found themselves trapped in a maze of barbed wire and landmines while bullets whizzed around them. Herb accidentally set off one of the buried mines, and the explosion took off his foot in a nearly fatal wound. In a superhuman act of courage, Herb ignored the pain and forgot the wound he had just received. All the 24-year-old lieutenant would think about was the safety of his troop. Using the one foot he had left, Herb directed his men safely out of the middle of the heated skirmish.  After the war, Herb returned home to Kentucky and settled down. He married, fathered three successful children, and found his way back to civilian life. For the next many years Herb, like many other World War II veterans, kept the courage and selflessness he had shown on the battlefield to himself. He sat by quietly and humbly, watching those around him enjoy the freedoms and liberties he and many others had made such a great sacrifice to preserve. Although Herb had done his best to move on, the world would not forget the great heroism that he had shown.  Herb received a letter from the Consul General of France, based in Chicago, IL, in July of 2011. He had been named a Knight of the Legion of Honor by the President of the French Republic, one of the highest awards one can receive in the country of France. The letter read:       My fellow countrymen will never forget your sacrifice.      Their children and grandchildren are as proud of your      courageous actions as can be your own children and      grandchildren. This outstanding distinction is the highest      honor that France can bestow upon those who have achieved      remarkable deeds for France. It is also a sign of gratitude      for your invaluable contribution to the liberation of France      during these difficult times in the history of our nation.  The award was authorized on July 4, 2011.  Herb was also recognized by the country whose flag he had worn on his uniform in Europe--the United States of America. He received the Distinguished Service Cross. The letter he received from GEN Donald Storm recalled the ``indomitable courage and resolution'' displayed by Herb during the battle in Reyersviller that ``prevented confusion and consequent casualties among the men, which made possible the capture of the objective.''  Herb's nephew, Randy Stanifer, is in awe of the great sacrifice that was made by the service men and women during the Second World War. ``The men from those wars were pre-cell phones and pre-Internet,'' he says. ``They were out in the field and would go months without hearing from their families. They went through many things and when most of them came home, they didn't talk about it.''  Randy went on to declare, ``I think we should all pause for a few minutes and recognize the things they had to go through and appreciate their sacrifices.''  Herb was extremely pleased to receive both awards. He is one of the few remaining veterans of World War II; sadly, our country loses more every day. He answered his country's call to serve, and he did so valiantly. Herbert Verrill undoubtedly deserves every recognition.  Mr. President, at this time I would like to ask my Senate colleagues to join me in commemorating the service and sacrifice made by 2LT Herbert S. Verrill in World War II on behalf of the United States of America and the French Republic.  Recently an article appeared in the Laurel County-area publication the Sentinel Echo. The article highlighted the courageous life of Mr. Verrill and reported on the awards bestowed upon him by the French Republic and the United States in July, 2011. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that said article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Sentinel Echo, Aug. 26, 2011]               Laurel Man Receives French Military Honor                           (By Nita Johnson)       A local veteran of World War II recently received two      honors for his military service, one of which is the highest      honor bestowed by the French government.       Herbert Verrill of Old Whitley Road was presented with the      Knight of the Legion of Honor on behalf of the President of      the French Republic through the Consul General of France,      based in Chicago. He also received the Distinguished Service      Cross for his valor in leading his men away from harm during      a battle in France and for directing his company to continue      an attack, despite being injured himself.       Verrill served with the United States Army Company E, 399th      Infantry Regiment, 100th Infantry Division near Reyersviller,      France, on March 15, 1945. Verrill, a lieutenant at the time,      was leading his troops through an attack by enemy forces--     through mines and barbed wire--when he accidentally set off      one of the mines. The explosion blew Verrill's foot off. In      spite of the pain and trauma, Verrill kept his fellow      comrades and their safety foremost, and ordered them away      from the minefield. He continued to ensure their safety and      defense by continuing to direct the men by hand and arm      signals.       Verrill received the letter from Graham Paul, Consul      General of France in Chicago, Ill., last month.       ``It is my pleasure . . . to inform you, on behalf of the      people of France, the President of the French Republic has      named you Knight of the Legion of Honor for your valorous      action during World War II,'' the citation reads. ``My fellow      countrymen will never forget your sacrifice. Their children      and grandchildren are as proud of your courageous actions as      can be your own children and grandchildren. This outstanding      distinction is the highest honor that France can bestow upon      those who have achieved remarkable deeds for France. It is      also a sign of gratitude for your invaluable contribution to      the liberation of France during these difficult times in the      history of our nation.''       The award was authorized through a decree from the      President of the French Republic on July 4, 2011.       Verrill was also presented with the Distinguished Service      Cross by the American government for his courageous acts. The      citation outlining Verrill's heroic act reads: ``The      President of the United States of America, authorized by Act      of Congress,     July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished      Service Cross to Second Lieutenant (Infantry) Herbert S.      Verrill, United States Army, for extraordinary heroism in      connection with military operations against an army enemy.       ``The indomitable courage and resolution which he displayed      prevented confusion and consequent casualties among the men,      which made possible the capture of the objective. Second      Lieutenant Verrill's intrepid actions, personal bravery and      zealous devotion to duty exemplify the highest traditions of      the military forces of the United States and reflect great      credit upon himself, the 100th Infantry Division, and the      United States Army,'' reads the citation.       The award was recently presented by Adjunct General Donald      Storm, who said, ``It is an honor and privilege to give him      the award. Those soldiers in Afghanistan now will be the next      generation of heroes.''       Verrill is one of the few remaining veterans from World War      II, and although nearly bedfast now at age 92, he was pleased      to receive the honor. His nephew, Randy Stanifer, praised his      uncle for his valiant contributions to his country, not only      during wartime but also after returning home from the war.       Verrill, a mere 24 years old while doing his military      service in France, watched the war rage throughout Europe and      made his sacrifices like thousands of other servicemen and      women. ``Herbert came back home, married and raised three      children, all of whom are successful. Herbert and the men      from those wars were pre-cell phones and pre-Internet. They      were out in the field and would go months without hearing      from their families. They went through many things and when      most of them came home, they didn't talk about it,'' he said.       Stanifer mentioned two other local World War II veterans,      of whom he learned information about their wartime      activities.       ``Vernon Hedrick, who died a few years ago, escaped from a      German POW camp and walked over 100 miles to get away from      enemy lines,'' he said. ``I didn't know that until recently.      Bill Moore (owner of London Tire until his death) was given      his last rites on the battlefield. They both survived and      came back home, but they didn't talk about these things.''       ``Herb (Verrill) never talked about any of (his      experience),'' he continued. ``That generation has sat back      and watched the country do what it's doing now. I think we      should all pause for a few minutes and recognize the things      they had to go through and appreciate their sacrifices.''                          ____________________
