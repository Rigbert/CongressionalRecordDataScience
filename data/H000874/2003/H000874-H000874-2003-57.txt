Leader, November 7 is indicated as the target date for adjournment. So that Members can plan, how confident is leadership that we can meet that date? How strong is leadership's intention to meet that date?  Mr. DeLAY. As the gentleman knows, any date is tentative at the end of any session; but we are working very hard. The Senate is working very hard. If we get the conference reports that I outlined in my opening remarks next week, then we really only have the Medicare conference report, the finishing of the appropriations process, and we hope that we can do all of that in the next 2 weeks.
