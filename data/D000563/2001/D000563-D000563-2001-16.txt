At a time when the United States clearly needs to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels, and particularly on imported oil, I offer legislation to spur the production of electricity from a clean, free and literally limitless source, wind. My bill offers a tax credit to help defray the cost of installing a small wind energy system to generate electricity for individual homes, farms and businesses. It is my hope that this credit will help make it economical for people to invest in small wind systems, thereby reducing pressures on the national power grid and increasing America's energy independence one family or business at a time.  Any serious attempt to create a national energy policy must include innovative proposals for exploring and developing the use of alternative and renewable energy sources. I look forward to debating a comprehensive energy policy for America in the next session of the 107th Congress, and I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the Home and Farm Wind Energy Systems Act of 2001 be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:          Summary of the Home and Farm Wind Energy Systems Act       The bill would provide a 30 percent federal investment tax      credit for homeowners, farmers and businesses when they      install small wind energy systems with a capacity of up to 75      kilowatts (kW). The tax credit would be available for      installation occurring over the next ten years.       Investments in renewable energy provide many benefits,      including:       1. Enhancing the energy security and independence of the      United States;       2. Increasing farmer and rancher income;       3. Promoting rural economic development;       4. Providing environmental and public health benefits such      as cleaner air and water;       5. Improving electric grid reliability, thereby reducing      the likelihood of blackouts;       6. Providing farm and residential customers with insulation      from electricity price volatility resulting from electric      deregulation.       Small wind systems are the most cost-competitive home sized      renewable energy technology, but the high up-front cost has      been a barrier. Phil Funk, for instance, a farmer in Dallas      County, IA, invested $20,000 in a 20kW wind turbine system      that saves him $3000 dollars per year on his electricity      bill. Funk made use of an existing tower on his property to      reduce his total costs significantly. The simple return-on-     investment period for Funk, however, was still 7 years--too      long to interest many farmers. A 30 percent tax credit would      be a powerful incentive in its own right. It would also bring      down production costs for small wind systems by increasing      sales and production volume.       A typical rural residential wind system uses a 60 foot to      80 foot tower, has a 10 kW capacity and costs $30,000 to      $35,000 to install. It produces up to 13,000 kWh of      electricity per year, and offsets seven tons of carbon      dioxide per year. This could yield savings of $1000 or more      per year in energy costs, depending on prevailing commercial      rates. In addition, in most states, system owners whose homes      are connected to the power grid can sell excess electricity      back to the local power company, improving efficiency and      further reducing demands on local power grids.       While a few states offer incentives, the Federal Government      has not offered tax credits for small wind systems since      1985.       A recent USA TODAY/CNN/Gallup poll showed that 91 percent      of the public favors incentives for wind, solar, and fuel      cells. But, while there are tax credits for very large      commercial wind turbines, Production Tax Credit, there is      currently no federal program to support small systems.       According to the American Wind Energy Association, Illinois      ranks 16th in the contiguous states for wind energy      potential. A new map produced by the National Renewable      Energy Laboratory, NREL, for the U.S. Department of Energy      indicates that over 2/3 of Illinois has a ``class 3'' or      better wind resource, making rural areas and the higher      elevations in those areas appropriate for small wind turbine      siting.       Illinois has a strong wind energy heritage. Chicago and      Batavia were the leading centers of wind energy manufacturing      in the United States at the end of the last century, with      millions of farm water pumping windmills and battery-charging      wind turbines built in the area between 1870 and 1910.      Batavia is still known as ``The Windmill City''.       In 1999, the Danish large-wind-turbine manufacturer NEG      Micon chose Champaign for the site of its first American      assembly and servicing facility, continuing the wind energy      tradition in Illinois.       Only a handful of States provide incentives for small wind      systems.       Illinois currently offers a buy-down or rebate on the      purchase of wind energy systems of up to 50 percent or $2/     watt. Eligible applicants include associations, individuals,      private companies, public and private schools, colleges and      universities, not-for-profit organizations and units of State      and local government. Potential recipients must be located      within the service area of an investor-owned or municipal gas      or electric utility or an electric cooperative that imposes      the Renewable Energy Resources and Coal Technology      Development Assistance Charge. Grant payments under current      operating procedures are, however taxable, which reduces      their value significantly.                                 ______                                       By
