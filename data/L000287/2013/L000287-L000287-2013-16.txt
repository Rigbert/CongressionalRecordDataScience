Mr. Speaker, on Wednesday, October 2, 2013, I attended the funeral of a good friend and constituent, Mrs. Evelyn Lowery, in my congressional district. Consequently, I was unable to make votes for a portion of the day.  Had I been present, I would have cast the following votes: on rollcall No. 509, I would have voted ``no''; on rollcall 510, I would have voted ``no''; on rollcall 511, I would have voted ``yes''; on rollcall 512, I would have voted ``no.''                          ____________________
