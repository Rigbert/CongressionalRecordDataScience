It shows how Visa leveraged its dominance in the credit card industry to enter into and dominate the debit card industry. Visa then changed the debit interchange fee system so it looked like the credit card fee system. The result: the United States has the highest interchange fees in the world.  We also have some of the worst fraud prevention technology in the world. This is because Visa gives banks higher interchange rates for so-called signature debit transactions instead of PIN debit transactions. So the banks tell their customers to pay with signature debit, even though far less fraud occurs with the use of PIN numbers.  It doesn't have to be this way. Many countries such as Canada have thriving debit card systems with zero interchange fees. Canada has low fraud and wide consumer debit usage. Other places such as the European Union carefully regulate interchange rates to keep them to a reasonable level. But in this country, we have let dominant card networks--and they are a powerful bunch--take over our debit card system. They are driving that system on an unsustainable course.  I have worked for years to reform interchange fees and to bring transparency, competition, and choice to the credit card and debit card industry. I first introduced a bill on this in 2008. In 2009, I joined with Senator Kit Bond of Missouri to file a modest floor amendment to the Credit CARD Act. The amendment simply said interchange fees should be reported to the Federal Reserve and that Visa and MasterCard should not be allowed to stop merchants from offering discounts for debit cards against credit cards. The card companies and bank industry hated that idea like the devil hatesholy water. They did everything they could to kill the amendment. They used their standard talking points, saying this amendment would hurt consumers, small banks, credit unions, the economy, everything one could think of. The amendment never reached a vote. Instead, in 2009, the banks and card companies said they would support a study. We love to study things in Washington. So Congress delayed real reform and said: Let's get on with the study.  Last year, I said: Enough is enough. We can't continue to let Visa, MasterCard, and the big banks use price-setting schemes to turn our debit card system into their own large piggy bank at the expense of merchants and consumers. The amendment I offered last year said: If banks are going to let a card network set interchange rates for them, those rates must be reasonable and proportional to the cost of processing a debit transaction over that network's wires.  Why would we bring the Federal Reserve in to establish a reasonable and proportional interest change fee? Because there is no competition in this market. Visa and MasterCard, recently under investigation by the Department of Justice for their practices, establish what these interchange fees are going to be. They impose them on merchants who many times are told late in the game how much the fee is. They don't bargain. Merchants can't shop around. There is no competition when it comes to the establishment of interchange fees.  The amendment will end this inefficient subsidy that Visa and MasterCard have created for banks, and it will incentivize banks to operate their card systems efficiently. The amendment directs the Fed to issue regulations to implement this reasonable and proportional standard. The Fed issued draft regulations in December and is now working on final regulations to be completed in April and take effect in July.  Do my colleagues know what they found in their initial cut at this? The average interchange fee is in the range of 40 cents, and the average cost to use a debit card is about 10 cents. Think of the overcharge that is going on with every single transaction. The next time you are standing in the airport and somebody hands a debit card to the cashier to pay for a pack of gum, think about that retailer just having lost money. The only ones who made money in the transaction were Visa, MasterCard and the issuing bank.  Last year, when I was drafting this amendment, I knew we had to be careful about the way the reform would affect small banks and credit unions that currently benefit from the rates Visa and MasterCard set. I didn't want to drive small issuers out of the debit card market. So my amendment specifically exempted them from regulation. That means that now, just like before, networks will compete by raising interchange rates to win the business of those small, unregulated issuers.  I know the small banks and credit unions are also lobbying on the Hill, saying that interchange reform will hurt them. For years, they have been making this argument against any type of reform. I have been on the Hill for a while, in the House and in the Senate.  I used to really believe there was a qualitative--not just quantitative but a qualitative--difference between community banks and credit unions and the big boys, the Wall Street banks. Over the years, I am sorry to say when it comes to these issues, they are the same. It is just a quantitative difference. Credit unions and community banks are smaller, but in terms of the way they look at issues, there is not a dime's worth of difference.  When it comes to this issue, there is an interesting phenomenon at work. Visa and MasterCard do not dare raise their head on Capitol Hill. If there are two more unpopular companies with American consumers, it is hard to think of what they might be. Maybe today it is oil companies. But it is a close second with credit card companies and the way they treat people. So they do not come in and lobby.  Well, how about the Wall Street banks? Do you think they are going to show up here and say: You cannot regulate these interchange fees? Two-thirds of the debit cards come from the biggest banks out of Wall Street, not the community banks and credit unions. So the big money in this whole transaction is on Wall Street. But you do not hear from the Wall Street banks. Why? Because they are not going to win any popularity contests either.  It was not that long ago we were shoveling billions of taxpayer dollars at these banks to keep the lights on after they made some pretty stupid investment decisions that drove our economy into the ditch. So they cannot lobby, the big banks, with the big money involved in this issue. The credit card companies cannot lobby because they have no popularity with the American consumer. So what do they do? They have some beards, and the beards in these circumstances are the credit unions and the community banks. Those specifically exempted are now coming to Congress, coming to Capitol Hill, saying this could hurt us in the future.  We drew a line and said if the asset value of the financial institution is below $10 billion--$10 billion--they are not affected by this law. There are, if I recall, only three credit unions in America with assets over $10 billion. The vast majority, the overwhelming majority, of credit unions in this country do not have anywhere near that kind of asset value. The same thing is true with community banks.  So Wall Street banks and credit card companies have found their great agents. Their agents are the credit unions, community banks, presenting their case to the Members of Congress as if they are directly regulated when they are specifically exempted from this.  I know the small banks and the credit unions are working the Hill. For years, they have been using these arguments against any type of reform. When we tried to get bankruptcy reform to deal with foreclosures a few years back--and I honestly think it could have had a dramatically positive impact to slow down foreclosures in this Nation--we specifically exempted credit unions and community banks, and they still lobbied against it. They are in concert when it comes to issues with the biggest banks in America. I do not understand it. It is a dramatic departure from where they have been historically.  Independent analysts agree that the reform Congress passed last year will give small banks actual competitive advantages over big banks. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a recent op-ed by Andrew Kahr in the American Banker newspaper entitled ``Never Mind the Lobbyists, Durbin Amendment Helps Small Banks.''  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:            [From American Banker--BankThink, Mar. 3, 2011]      Never Mind the Lobbyists, Durbin Amendment Helps Small Banks       The Durbin Amendment in Dodd-Frank lowers the interchange      paid to large banks on debit card purchase transactions, and      hence takes money away from these banks to give it to      merchants, almost dollar for dollar. When passed, this      provision was politically popular. It was a time for bank-     bashing.       Now this component of Dodd-Frank is much less popular.      Maybe legislators have noticed that even if Wal-Mart passed      through every last penny of the 0.7% of debit card sales it's      apt to save to customers in the form of lower prices, the      consumer benefit is likely to be invisible to voters. In any      event, the banks have made themselves highly audible to      voters in shrill but absurd threats to cap debit card      purchases at $50 and the like. Another form of lobbying.       One of the arguments made against the Durbin restriction on      interchange is that it will hurt community banks.       Poppycock.       Since Durbin explicitly excludes banks with assets under      $10 billion from the restriction on interchange, it takes a      hyperactive imagination to see how these banks could be hurt      by it. Lobbyists have the requisite inventiveness.       If large banks get 75% less interchange than they do now      and small banks continue to get today's interchange rates,      then obviously this confers a substantial competitive      advantage on the small banks. They can impose lower fees, pay      more interest, and give greater rewards to depositors.      Anything that reduces revenue for big banks but not for small      ones should help the latter compete more effectively against      the former.       In opposition to common sense, bank lobbyists have put      forward some very far-fetched arguments about how, in some      upside-down world, small banks are still going to be losers      rather than winners from Durbin.       One argument is that the clearing networks, of which there      are only four that     matter, will not support the ``two-tier'' interchange system      envisaged by Durbin. Ridiculous. Visa is the largest of the      networks. It's already announced that it will implement      Durbin. (Maybe this is an object lesson as to why Visa      remains No. 1.)       For the small banks, MasterCard is the only other      significant player. If MasterCard finds it politic not to add      one more wrinkle to a skein of interchange levels that is      already of Byzantine complexity, then let the small banks      gravitate to Visa in order to benefit from Durbin.       A second argument of the big-bank lobbyists is that      merchants will reject the debit cards of small banks if these      carry a 1% interchange cost, versus 0.3% for the large banks.      Really? Then why don't these merchants reject all credit      cards, with interchange of 2% or more, if the customer could      instead use a debit card? When is the last time a merchant      politely asked you whether you could pay with a debit card      instead of a credit card?       The reason merchants don't do this, apart from association      rules that purport to prohibit it, is that the retailer's top      priority is sales, not interchange. Selective ``suppression''      of cards by merchants has occurred with extreme rarity. One      instance took place long ago when merchants in Boston      revolted against higher interchange rates from American      Express. This can't happen now. Are cashiers in stores going      to look at a list of small banks in order to discriminate      against their cards--and then have customers walk out and      leave their would-be purchases at the cash register? The      fraction of customers who would be persuaded to change banks      or carry two debit cards is infinitesimal.       The notion that merchants will give discounts on big-bank      debit cards but not small-bank debit cards is equally silly.      Since when did they offer an incentive to use debit rather      than credit cards? If they are not motivated to do so by 2.3%      versus 1% interchange, then why should they be motivated by      1% versus 0.3%?       Finally, we are warned that a second, utterly unrelated      provision of Durbin that mandates competitive network routing      will somehow injure small banks. Impossible. It is      predominantly the biggest banks that have negotiated      exclusive or volume-dependent routing deals with Visa or      others. This too gives them an advantage over small banks      that Durbin will undermine or erase--to the benefit of the      small banks.       The charm of the Durbin debate on interchange is that it      largely amounts to ``Who's going to get the money, big banks      or merchants?'' (In other words, ``Which do you like less,      Congressman, big banks, or big merchants?'')       Outside the realms of taxation and appropriations, it is      unusual to see such a choice so sharply focused for our      representatives in Washington.       Ben Bernanke and other regulators would like to see less      pressure on big-bank earnings and capital. That's      understandable. Maybe it's even a winning--though illogical--     argument.       But let's not talk nonsense about bogeyman danger to      community banks.
