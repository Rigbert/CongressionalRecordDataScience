Mr. Chairman, in all due respects to my good colleague from Arizona, I would appreciate it if he would withdraw the amendment. We know what he is trying to do, and I have told the leadership we are going to get to where hewants to go. If my colleague insists on a vote, I will reluctantly have to vigorously oppose it.  So I would like to make a suggestion. Discretion is the better part of valor.
