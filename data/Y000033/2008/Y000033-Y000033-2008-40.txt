Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.  Again, I have great respect for my friend from Texas, and I understand the pressure he's under.  But just think for a minute. There's no real offshore exploration in their bill. There's no renewables in their bill. There's no oil shale in their bill. Of course there's no ANWR in their bill. There's no nuclear in their bill. There's no clean coal to coal to liquids in their bill. There's no new refinery capacity in their bill.                              {time}  1715  There is no electricity price hike control in their bill. And most of all, there is no lawsuit reform in their bill.  This bill is, in fact, a ``no'' bill: no energy, no energy, no energy.  Mr. Speaker, at this time I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman from Texas and the ranking Republican on the Energy and Commerce Committee be allowed to control 21 minutes of the general debate time.
