Today we are here debating housing that averages $208,000 a unit, and generally, despite the earlier speaker, not to address the living needs of enlisted people.  Here is one example, Little Rock Air Force Base, Arkansas, we have a home here for the general officer housing. It is totally inadequate for the position and entertainment responsibilities of the installation. Perhaps the general could use the officers' club or the golf club to entertain if he finds his home inadequate.  The kitchen configuration creates a circulation problem. Well, a lot of us have that problem in our homes. Generally we remodel. We do not tear the house down and start over, but the taxpayers are not paying for our homes.  Here the four bedrooms and their closets are undersized. Is the general entertaining in the bedrooms? What sort of entertainment are we talking about here?  They have outdated ceramic tile floors. I do not know, in my part of the country, people consider that a feature, and they actually pay extra for ceramic floors.  Wainscoting, that is kind of considered a plus out my way, too.  The question here is: Are we going to spend an average of $208,000 a unit to better house the general staff because they do not want to entertain at the officers' club and they want to live in spiffy new houses? They have already got cars, drivers; they have already got the helicopter rides from the Pentagon to Andrews Air Force Base, the private jets around the country. Now they need new houses at a average of $208,000 each with no rent paid in return.                              {time}  1730  I think it is time to draw the line somewhere. Support housing for our enlisted folks, but no more for the generals and the top brass.
