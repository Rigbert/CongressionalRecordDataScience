President, I know the Senator from Arizona is a skeptic on Amtrak, and whether there is forbearance or blind hope, thank you. And thank you to the Senator from Washington for showing leadership because$1.2 billion means Amtrak has hope and an opportunity.  It means a lot when you consider the context of our Federal support for transportation: Over $30 billion for highways each year, over $10 billion for airports, so $1.2 billion for national passenger rail service is not an extraordinary amount of money in that context.  People talk about the coastal service. The Senator from Delaware made that point a moment ago. But for the State of Illinois, it means that 2.6 million passengers last year used Amtrak. If Amtrak disappears and we do not provide the money the Senator from Washington asks for, 2.6 million trips will be converted into automobile trips, by and large, and that means more highway congestion, more pollution, more use of petroleum products, and more dependence on foreign oil. None of that is good for my State of Illinois. We value Amtrak. It not only means a lot of service, it means a lot of jobs. I think it is important to our economy.  My hometown, a downstate city, is the largest user of Amtrak outside of the city of Chicago. We believe in Amtrak. We believe investing in Amtrak and improving its service so we can have high-speed rail is going to dramatically increase passenger ridership. I hope those who are skeptical of Amtrak will understand we have in this new administrator, Mr. Gunn, a man who has been brutally honest in terms of the future of Amtrak and what it needs, and the Senator from Washington is offering him the resources he needs to continue to reform this important service to our Nation. I thank the Senator from Washington for her leadership on this.  I yield the remainder of my time.
