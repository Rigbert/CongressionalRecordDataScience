 President, as cochairman of the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control, I have had a distinct interest in the National Youth Antidrug Media Campaign and how we can improve its quality and improve its effectiveness.

That effort in 1998 built upon the success of former First Lady Nancy Reagan's ``just say no'' campaign.
