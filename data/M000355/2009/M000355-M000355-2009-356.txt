 Feinstein, Mr. McCain, and         Mr. Durbin:)  S.J. Res. 17. A joint resolution approving the renewal of import restrictions contained in the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the annual renewal of the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003. Once again, I am joined by Senators Feinstein, McCain and Durbin who have been steadfast and longtime advocates for the Burmese people.  This resolution extends for another year the sanctions that are currently in place against the illegitimate Burmese regime, the State Peace and Development Council, SPDC. This bill would keep those sanctions in place unless and until the regime takes a number of clear steps towards democracy and reconciliation. This measure also includes renewal of the enhanced sanctions enacted last year as part of the Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE Act of 2008.  As many of my colleagues know, the news from Burma has been particularly troubling of late. Nobel Peace Prize winner Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, who has been under house arrest for 13 of the last 19 years, was charged last month with permitting a misguided American to enter her home. As a result, she faces up to 5 years in prison. My colleagues in the Senate and I remain deeply concerned about the outcome of her ``trial.'' I was pleased that the Senate responded to this outrageous prosecution by unanimously passing S. Res. 160, which condemned the ``trial'' of Suu Kyi and the dubious actions taken by the SPDC against her.  The Obama administration has indicated that a new strategy on Burma is forthcoming, and I look forward to reviewing it. Whatever the content of this strategy, it appears from correspondence between my House colleagues and the State Department that the administration will continue to support sanctions against the Burmese regime, even as it considers additional means of effecting positive change in the troubled country.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the joint resolution be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the joint resolution was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                              S.J. Res. 17       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the      United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. AMENDMENT TO BURMESE FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY ACT OF                    2003.       Section 9(b)(3) of the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of      2003 (Public Law 108-61; 50 U.S.C. 1701 note) is amended by      striking ``six years'' and inserting ``nine years''.     SEC. 2.
