President; I introduce The Transportation Empowerment Act which will allow states to keep a majority of the federal gas tax dollars raised in their state. Similar to legislation introduced by our former colleague Connie Mack, ``The Transportation Empowerment Act'' restores to states and local communities the ability to make their own transportation decisions without the interference of Washington.  This proposal is very straightforward. It streamlines the federal-aid highway program into four core areas: Interstate, Federal Lands, Safety and Research. The proposed bill provides for continued general fund support for transit grants and authorizes states to enter into multi state compacts for planning and financing regional transportation needs.  The federal tax is kept in place for a four-year transition period, beginning in FY04. After funding the core programs and paying off outstanding bills, the balance is returned to the states in a block grant. At the end of the transition period, in FY07, the federal tax is reduced to two cents per gallon.  I have long believed that the best decisions are those made at the local level. Unfortunately, many of the transportation choices made by cities and states are governed by federal rules and regulations. This bill returns to states the responsibility and resources to make their own transportation decisions.                                 ______                                       By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Hollings, Ms. Cantwell, and Mr.         Biden):  S. 2862. A bill to provide for the establishment of a scientific basis for new firefighting technology standards, improve coordination among Federal, State, and local fire officials in training for and responding to terrorist attacks and other national emergencies, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senators Hollings, Cantwell, and Biden in introducing the Firefighting Research and Coordination Act. This legislation would provide for the establishment of the scientific basis for new firefighting technology standards; improved coordination between Federal, state, and local fire officials in training and response to a terrorist attack or a national emergency; and authorize the National Fire Academy to offer training to improve the ability of firefighters to respond to events such as the tragedy of September 11, 2001.  The purpose of this legislation is to act upon some of the lessons learned from the tragic terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and address other problems faced by the fire services. On September 11, the New York City fire fighters and emergency service personnel acted with great heroism in selflessly rushing to the World Trade Center and saving the lives of many Americans. Tragically, 343 firefighters and EMS technicians paid the ultimate price in the service of their country. While we strive to prevent any future attack in the United States, it is our duty to ensure that we are adequately prepared for any future catastrophic act of terrorism. In addition, we must recognize that many of the preparations we make to improve the response to national emergencies will also prepare our firefighters for their everyday role in protecting our families and homes.  Today's firefighters use a variety of technologies including thermal imaging equipment, devices for locating firefighters and victims, and state-of-the-art protective suits to fight fires, clean up chemical or hazardous waste spills, and contend with potential terrorist devices. The Federal government's Firefighter Investment and Response Enhancement, FIRE, program is authorized for $900 million this year to assist local fire departments in purchasing this high-tech equipment. It is important that the American taxpayers' money is used for effective new equipment that will protect our local communities.  Unfortunately, there are no uniform technical standards for this new equipment for combating fires. Without such standards, local fire companies may purchase equipment that does not satisfy their needs, or even purchase faulty equipment. For example, Montgomery County, MD, spent $40,000 on ``Level B'' protective suits that they cannot use, because these suits have ``booties'' that are not compatible with the firefighter's boots. Currently, local fire departments also have problems using each other's fire hoses and air bottles for self-contained breathing apparatuses because of inconsistent equipment standards. It is important that new equipment performs properly and is compatible with older equipment.  This bill seeks to address the need for new equipment standards by establishing a scientific basis for voluntary consensus standards. It would authorize the U.S. Fire Administrator to work with the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the Inter-Agency Board for Equipment Standardization and Inter-Operability, and other interested parties to establish measurement techniques and testing methodologies for new firefighting equipment. These new techniques and methodologies will act as a scientific basis for the development of voluntary consensus standards. This bill would allow the Federal government to cooperate with the private sector in developing the basic uniform performance criteria and technical standards to ensure that effectiveness and compatibility of these new technologies.  Many issues regarding coordination surfaced on September 11. Titan Systems Corporation recently issued an after-action report, on behalf of the fire department of Arlington County, VA, which highlighted problems between the coordination of Washington D.C., and Arlington County fire departments. The report also cited the confusion caused by a large influx of self-dispatched volunteers, and increased risk faced by the ``bonafide responders.'' These conclusions are consistent with an article by the current U.S. Fire Administrator, R. David Paulison, in the June 1993 issue of Fire Chief magazine, where he described being overwhelmed by the number of uncoordinated volunteer efforts that poured into Florida after Hurricane Andrew. Additionally, many fire officials and the General Accounting Office have highlighted the duplicative nature of many Federal programs and the need for better coordination between federal, state, and local officials.  The bill also seeks to address these problems by directing the U.S. Fire Administrator to work with state and local fire service officials to establish nationwide and state mutual aid systems for responding to national emergencies. These mutual aid plans would include collection of accurate asset and resource information to ensure that local fire services could work together to deploy equipment and personnel effectively during an emergency. This legislation would also establish the U.S. Fire Administrator as the primary point of contact within the Federal government for state and local firefighting units, in order to ensure greater Federal coordination and interface with state and local officials in preparing and responding to terrorist attacks, hurricanes, earthquakes, or other national emergencies. In addition, the bill would direct the U.S. Fire Administrator to report on the need for a strategy for deploying volunteers, including the use of a national credentialing system. Currently, there is a system for credentialing volunteers to fight wildfires that has proven effective, and the development of a similar system may prevent some of the confusion that occurred at the World Trade Center and Pentagon on September 11.  Finally, the bill would improve the training of state and local firefighters. The bill would authorize the National Fire Academy to offer courses in building collapse rescue; the use of technology in response to fires caused byterrorist attacks and other national emergencies; leadership and strategic skills including integrated management systems operations; deployment of new technology for fighting forest and wild fires; fighting fires at ports; and other courses related to tactics and strategies for responding to terrorist incidents and other fire services' needs.  This bill would also direct the U.S. Fire Administrator to coordinate the National Fire Academy's training programs with the Attorney General, Secretary of Health and Human Services and other Federal agencies to prevent the duplication in training programs that has been identified by the General Accounting Office.  I am pleased to announce that this legislation is supported by the National Volunteer Fire Council; the Congressional Fire Services Institute; the National Fire Protection Association; the International Association of Fire Chiefs; the International Association of Fire Fighters; the International Association of Arson Investigators; and the International Fire Service Training Association. I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure passage of this legislation. I am aware that some issues, including funding of this legislation, need to be addressed.  Last year, we were caught unprepared and paid a terrible price as a result. We must ensure that future firefighters are adequately equipped and trained, and are working in coordination to respond to any future national emergencies. Every day firefighters rush into burning buildings to save the lives of their fellow Americans. It is our duty to adequately equip and protect them.
