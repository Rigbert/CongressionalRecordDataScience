 President, we have all heard accounts of innocent children being victimized and abused by predators. Today I will introduce legislation to extend two of the key programs that Congress established under the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006. With today's legislation, I hope to send a strong message to all Americans about Congress' continued commitment to keeping our Nation's children safe.  Many of us here in the Senate worked very hard on the original version of the Adam Walsh Act, which is named for a six year-old who was tragically murdered in 1981. President George W. Bush signed that legislation on the 25th anniversary of Adam Walsh's abduction from a Florida shopping mall. I am pleased that Senators Hatch, Schumer, and Feinstein--who cosponsored the Senate version of that legislation when it was first introduced in the 109th Congress--have joined me as original cosponsors of today's legislation.  John Walsh, the father of Adam Walsh, worked closely with us on the development of the 2006 Adam Walsh Act, and we worked with him on the development of today's legislation as well. Reauthorization of the Adam Walsh Act is a priority for him and has the support of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.  The Adam Walsh Act was enacted in response to multiple, notorious cases involving children who had been targeted by adult criminals, many of them repeat sex offenders. Its passage became a national priority after Congress discovered that criminals were taking advantage of gaps and loopholes in some States' laws to circumvent sex offender registration requirements--with tragic results for some of the nation's children.  Who can forget Jetseta Gage--a beautiful 10-year-old girl from Cedar Rapids, Iowa who was sexually assaulted and murdered by a registered sex offender in 2005? As a cosponsor of the Senate version of the Adam Walsh Act, I championed the inclusion in the 2006 law of language imposing mandatory minimum penalties for those who murder, kidnap, or inflict serious bodily harm to children like Jetseta.  Of course, the centerpiece of the Adam Walsh Act is the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act, or SORNA. SORNA divides sex offenders into three categories, or tiers, depending on the seriousness of their crimes. It encourages States to set minimum criteria for the registration of sex offenders in each tier, with the aim of discouraging ``forum shopping'' by offenders who prey on children.  The Adam Walsh Act also established several programs that are key to its successful implementation. One such program, known as SOMA, or the Sex Offender Management Assistance Program, makes federal grant resources available to states to offset the costs of Walsh Act implementation. Today's legislation would extend the authorization for that program, which expired 8 years ago.  The federal government, through the U.S. Marshals Service, also supports States and localities in tracking down sex offenders who fail to register or re-register. Those fugitive apprehension activities were authorized under the 2006 Adam Walsh Act, and today's legislation would extend the authorization for those U.S. Marshals Service activities at $60 million annually for each of the next 2 years.  Nothing can bring back Adam Walsh, Jetseta Gage, Dru Sjodin, Megan Kanka, or the other innocents for whom the Adam Walsh Act was passed. But it is important that we continue to not only honor their memories but also protect America's future children from harm by extending the key programs that were authorized under the original Adam Walsh Act. The authorization for these programs expired at least 7 years ago.  According to the Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics, there are about a hundred thousandpeople convicted of sexual violence offenses in state prisons, and hundreds of thousands more who currently reside in neighborhoods across the United States. As a father of five and the grandfather of 9, I believe we should continue to make sex offender registration and notification a priority.  Mr. President, July 27 of this year will mark the 35th anniversary of Adam Walsh's abduction. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the passage of this important legislation before that date elapses.                                 ______                                       By
