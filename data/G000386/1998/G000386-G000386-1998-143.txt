 President, I yield myself such time as I consume.  We have the chairman of the appropriate subcommittee willing to work with Senator Reed to address this problem in the Banking Committee. My opposition to this is not so much a matter of substance but of procedure and not usurping the authority of that committee. It does need to be studied. I can tell you that in the Grassley-Durbin amendment, we have enhanced disclosure requirements to help consumers.  While I respect the Senator's view on price controls, my view is that forcing a credit card company to offer credit when it has made a business determination that it would lose money will only force increased prices on other consumers. This is something that the Banking Committee needs to take a very serious look at and do it before we do something that may help some but may also hurt others.  Mr. President, I am going to ask that this amendment be tabled after the Senator from Alabama speaks. I yield my remaining time to the Senator from Alabama.
