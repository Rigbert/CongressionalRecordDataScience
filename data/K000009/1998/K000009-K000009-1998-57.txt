Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise in opposition to this amendment. If we think back to the reforms we have made in our farm programs, trade is at the center, international trade is at the center of trying to prepare and improve our programs for the 21st century.  If we look at the trade ledger for our country today, the only positive parts of the account exist in the areas of agriculture largely. Over a third of our domestic production is exported and, in fact, we have been experiencing a record trade surplus just in agriculture of over $30 billion annually while the rest of the budget and trade ledger is in serious deficit at historic levels.  So something in what we are doing is working, and the Market Access Program is an important piece of this puzzle.  If Members look at who we are in competition with, it is U.S. farmers, individual farm families, individual producers against the European Union, against Asian production.                              {time}  1215  It is very important that we help these farmers move their product into the international marketplace. This program is targeted to smaller producers and to farmers' cooperatives. It is not helping the big companies.  In fact, if you look at the amount of money in the program, $90 million, it does not even come close to what the European Union is currently spending, over $500 million, half a billion dollars, in trying to promote their products in the international marketplace.  These exports just in agriculture represent well over a million jobs in our country. Quite frankly, unless you have dealt in the international market, you really do not understand how subsidized a lot of our competitors' production actually is. Certainly their advertising programs are. So I would rise in strong opposition to this amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
