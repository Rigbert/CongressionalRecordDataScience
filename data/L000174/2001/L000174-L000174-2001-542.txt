President, I will yield the floor in a moment. I know the Senator from Texas wishes to speak, and I don't want to deny him that privilege.  The Senator from New York was given a commitment by the Republican leadership to have a vote. Frankly, at the rate we are going, I don't see that commitment being fulfilled. I have been here 26 years and I have never seen an instance where the majority--and I have been here three times the majority and three times the minority--I have never seen an instance where the majority has given such a commitment that hasn't been carried out.  I urge Senators on both sides of the aisle to make sure this will not be the first time in 26 years such a commitment was not carried out. This is a very serious matter.  There are only 100 Members who represent a nation of over a quarter of a billion people; 100 Members have a special responsibility because we are a small number. One is a responsibility to always carry forth our commitment. The Senator from New York has a commitment. It should be carried out. Frankly, we are only 3 months into this Congress. On a bill as serious as this, we should not have to be debating keeping a commitment that is laid out in the Congressional Record but, rather, try to find how to get the votes and vote amendments up or down.  I have amendments. I am prepared to go to vote with a 2- or 3-minute time agreement. Let's not delay on the Senate floor and then hold press conferences by the Ohio clock saying: We can't understand why this bill is taking so long; I guess we have to file cloture.  The fact is, the bill could have been finished last week if people had let the votes occur.
