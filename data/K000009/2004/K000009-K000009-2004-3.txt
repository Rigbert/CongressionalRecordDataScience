Speaker, I am proud to speak this evening on behalf of the people of our congressional district in Ohio. All Members like to rise when something really significant has happened, and I come from a part of America, northern Ohio, that has always fought for the betterment of the working conditions of people, across our region, across our State, across our country, and indeed across the world.  This past week, and I will place the article in the Record, something truly historic has occurred, something that deserves mention in the Congressional Record of our Nation, and that is the great victory by the Farm Labor Organizing Committee of Northwest Ohio and its magnificent leader, Baldemar Velasquez, in achieving the first labor agreement on behalf of thousands and thousands of migrant workers across this continent, for the first time giving them the ability to earn a decent wage, to have decent working conditions, and to contract for their labor, to begin to get rid of the corruption that surrounds individuals who move around this continent, exploiting people and forcing them to pay bounty if they want to go back to their nation, forcing them to pay a bounty if they want a job, and then ignore them, ignore their welfare when they are working with no rights at all.  Every year, 9 million people come to the United States of America, most of them illegally, to work in our fields, picking blueberries, cutting cabbage, working in meat plants, working in food processing facilities with absolutely everybody sort of closing their eyes to their welfare, everybody making money off their backs, and yet those workers having no standing.  This past week, through this incredible agreement, the Farm Labor Organizing Committee has finally given the most exploited people on this continent the first platform to stand on. I could not be prouder to represent any group of people than this group.  I can remember as a young college graduate coming back to my community in Ohio and wearing a button that said FLOC, the Farm Labor Organizing Committee, and it had the words ``viva la causa,'' long live the cause. Indeed the cause has finally been victorious across this great continent.  This contract that the workers have gotten will cover over 8,000 workers, dozens of growers, and hopefully begin to ameliorate the terrible conditions forced on workers on this continent because of NAFTA, all that came before it and the worsening conditions that came after, as millions of Mexican farmers were thrown off their land and became a mobile group of people across this continent with no place to live, no decent wages, coming into our market, trafficked by among the most despicable people that have ever lived.  I am just so proud of the Farm Labor Organizing Committee. This is the firstcontract for guest workers in our Nation's history, in Mexico's history, and, indeed, in Latin America's history.  What will happen is that workers will receive a decent wage, not terrific for working in the hot sun 12 hours a day, $8.06 an hour, for the backbreaking work they do. It has been covered in articles in the Toledo Blade which reported this front page story: ``Pact to affect 8,000 migrants.''  The pact was signed in North Carolina after a several-year boycott of the second-largest pickling company in our country called Mt. Olive Pickle. It talks about FLOC's 35 years of struggle to provide migrant workers with better working conditions and fair wages. Initially, the contracts were signed locally in our region of Ohio with companies like Campbell's Soup and Vlasic Pickle, but finally it has expanded to other parts of the country where workers will now be paid $8.06 an hour, a federally set minimum wage rate for what are called H2-A workers, the workers that do come into our country. But again I say, so many are illegally trafficked by unscrupulous labor barons they call ``coyotes.'' And workers could earn up to $12 an hour on piecework. So it provides for people who have the ability to work harder to be paid more.  Undocumented workers who are under control of unscrupulous smugglers and farm labor contractors, this provides the ability, finally, to get rid of those terrible, terrible individuals.  Mr. Speaker, I could not be prouder than to come to this floor this evening and congratulate Baldemar Velasquez and the Farm Labor Organizing Committee for building a better world.  Mr. Speaker, I include for the Record the article from the Toledo Blade.                     Pact to Affect 8,000 Migrants                            (By Jon Chavez)       In what would be its first major organizing victory outside      Ohio and Michigan, the Toledo-based Farm Labor Organizing      Committee today is expected to sign a three-way labor      agreement in North Carolina with Mt. Olive Pickle Co. Inc.,      which has been the subject of a FLOC boycott since 1999.       At a ceremony in Raleigh, N.C., this morning, FLOC      officials said they will sign a three-year labor pact with      the North Carolina Growers Association, of Vass, N.C., which      represents about 1,050 farms that raise 27 different crops      ranging from cucumbers to tobacco, and a related agreement      with Mt. Olive.       It's a marked change in business in mostly nonunion North      Carolina. The contracts will cover the most union workers in      the state, and FLOC will be its largest labor organization.       Covered by the agreements will be nearly 8,000 migrant      workers who travel from Mexico to North Carolina, numbers      that will more than double FLOC's membership rolls.       Baldemar Velasquez, president of FLOC, was ecstatic      yesterday. ``I knew eventually they would have to do      something. I just never knew the timing would be this soon,''      he told The Blade.       Lynn Williams, a spokesman for Mt. Olive, said the company      would not comment until the contract is signed.       How individual farmers feel is unclear. They can choose to      opt out of the association, which a party to the contract.      But how those growers would be affected is uncertain.       The agreements cover migrants who harvest crops and work      with visas issued under a U.S. Department of Labor program      called H-2A. The growers association helps place H-2A workers      at various farms as needed.       The pacts will provide the workers with specific wage rates      for either hourly work or for how much is picked (depending      on the crop), a formal procedure to address grievances, and      third-party verification to ensure all parties are living up      to the agreement.       FLOC was born in the fields of northwest Ohio nearly 35      years ago as a means to provide migrant workers with better      working conditions and fair wages. Initially, it reached      contracts with individual growers but became a formidable      force in the industry when it reached an agreement in 1986      with Campbell Soup Co. and its subsidiary, Vlasic Pickle, and      a group of growers to improve wages and working conditions.       The agreements in North Carolina follow a similar      arrangement and similarly occurred after years of public      boycotts and pressure tactics by the farm union.       In FLOC's agreement with Mt. Olive Pickle, the nation's      second-largest pickle firm, the Mount Olive, N.C., company      endorses the separate contract between the union and growers      association and it provides economic incentives for the deal      to occur.       Mr. Velasquez said that about 60 cucumber growers will get      a 10 percent price increase for their crops they supply to      Mt. Olive. That increase will be passed along in the form of      wage increases for the 800 to 1,000 workers who work for      those growers.       Those workers are paid $8.06 an hour, a federally set      minimum wage rate for H-2A workers. Under the new pact, which      raises pay rates, workers could earn up to $12 an hour. ``It      depends, but a good picker could earn that,'' Mr. Velasquez      said.       Growers do not have to participate in the contract.      However, those who remain in the association will be covered      by the agreement and receive the crop price increases, said      Stan Eury, director of the growers association.       The agreements do not prohibit farmers who are not part of      the association from supplying Mt. Olive Pickle. At least a      few suppliers now do not belong to the association.       David Rose, a sweet-potato and tobacco farmer from      Nashville, N.C., said there have been rumors for months that      a farm labor contract was in the works. He declined to say      how many farmers might leave the association.       Still, Mr. Rose, of JB Rose Farms Inc., said the labor      agreements likely will have an impact on all farmers.       The key provisions of the contracts were not necessarily      wages.       Workers frequently complained of abuses by growers but were      fearful to report them because they might be blacklisted and      later denied a work visa, Mr. Velasquez said. The agreements      provide a list of worker rights, including a hiring seniority      system that the union will administer through a work office      to be set up in Mexico.       ``The pact goes from Mexico all the way to Ohio, so that      will eliminate debate around blacklisting of workers,'' Mr.      Velasquez said. ``They'll be union members by the time they      enter the U.S.''       For the growers, there is a formal grievance system and      third-party inspections to verify compliance, which should      protect the farmers' image if they are treating their workers      right, he said.       ``The worst part of it for them is the terrible negative      image that comes with these issues,'' the Toledo labor leader      said. ``They don't like the publicity.''       In a statement, Mr. Eury agreed that credibility is      important.       ``Unfortunately the lines have been blurred between the      treatment of H-2A foreign guest-workers and undocumented      workers who are under control of unscrupulous smugglers and      farm labor contractors,'' the statement said. ``Our industry      is continually judged as a whole by the misdeeds of a few.''       The three parties began negotiating about six weeks ago at      the behest of Mt. Olive, Mr. Velasquez said. The first hint      became publicly known last month when FLOC said a large      growers' association agreed to not meddle in the union's      organizing activity.       After reaching agreement on key principles, details of the      pact were worked out in about a week, Mr. Velasquez said.       Both Mt. Olive and the growers researched FLOC's previous      labor agreements with growers for Campbell and Vlasic.       ``They studied it and told us they could live with it,''      Mr. Velasquez said. ``They had also called some growers in      Ohio to see how it had worked up there. The growers gave them      some positive feedback.''                          ____________________
