Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 740, which I introduced with bipartisan support, will do just what it says: provide a way forward for the Northern Ireland Peace Process.  I thank my colleague from Michigan, Mr. Thad McCotter, for managing this bill so ably on the floor. I thank Chairman Henry Hyde, Reps. Elton Gallegly, Peter King, Jim Walsh, Tom Lantos, the Ranking Member of the House International Relations Committee and many others for their work and support on this bill.  Yesterday, the Northern Ireland Legislative Assembly met for the first time since 2002. Yet it still faces crucial challenges over community policing, and acceptance by the nationalist community of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI). For the population of Northern Ireland to fully transfer its trust to the police, it must have confidence that the police and the authorities deserve trust and will be held accountable.  A key stumbling block to that greater acceptance has been the lack of resolution of charges of official collusion in the murder of human rights lawyer Patrick Finucane, who was gunned down in his home, in front of his wife and three small children, in 1989. Pat Finucane was not only a courageous human rights activist, but also a loving father and husband. His murder symbolizes the depth and danger of official State sponsored collusion inNorthern Ireland. Resolving the questions surrounding this murder will help restore confidence in the agencies of government in the north, and allow Northern Ireland's still fragile peace to flourish in a new atmosphere of trust.  That is a major reason why this inquiry needs to be done, and done right, as soon as possible. This is the purpose of H. Res. 740, which calls on the British government to establish the kind of full, public, independent, judicial inquiry into Patrick Finucane's killing called for by Judge Peter Cory, an esteemed Supreme Court judge from Canada who was asked by the British and Irish Governments to investigate this murder and make a recommendation regarding the possibility of collusion.  H. Res. 740 calls for exactly the type of inquiry that nongovernmental human rights organizations, including British Irish Rights Watch, the Committee for the Administration of Justice, Human Rights First, and Amnesty International have demanded. This is what the Irish Government and Parliament have urged. It is what we in Congress have supported. In 1999 the House passed House Resolution 128, which I authored, and in 2003 the full Congress passed, and the President signed into law, Chairman Hyde's Foreign Relations Authorization Act (Public Law 107-228).  But most of all, this is what the Finucane family, which for 17 years has courageously campaigned for justice, for Pat Finucane and all the victims in Northern Ireland, has demanded. Let us once again join them in their struggle.  I have held eleven hearings on human rights and police reform in Northern Ireland since 1997. In every one of those hearings witnesses have testified to the central role the Finucane murder has played in advancing an atmosphere of distrust and no confidence in state agencies. We've had family members, other Northern Ireland attorneys, non-governmental human rights activists, as well as Mitch Reiss, President Bush's special envoy for the Northern Ireland Peace Process and Param Cumaraswamy, the United Nations' Special Rapporteur all testify that properly investigating this case is key to securing a just and lasting peace in Northern Ireland.  This is a crucial moment in the peace process in Northern Ireland. A credible public, independent, judicial inquiry into Pat Finucane's murder will help ensure confidence in the rule of law in the north of Ireland and will help bring the people of both sides of the divide to a just, stable and lasting peace which they richly deserve.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to again express my deepest condolences to the Finucane family and thank them for their courageous and tireless efforts on behalf of justice not only for their loved one but also for others who may have been victims of state-sponsored collusion in the north of Ireland. Similarly, I would like to acknowledge the work and support from many human rights activists including Jane Winter of British Irish Rights Watch, Elisa Massimino from Human Rights First formerly the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights), and Maggie Beirne, Martin O'Brien and Paul Mageean who have testified before Congress on behalf of the Committee on the Administration of Justice. Finally, Mr. Speaker, I would also like to remind my colleagues of the riveting testimony offered on this matter in 1998 by Rosemary Nelson, an attorney from Northern Ireland who told Congress that defense attorneys there feared that they could be murdered themselves because no one had been held accountable in the murder of Patrick Finucane. Six months after her testimony, Rosemary Nelson was killed, the victim of a car bomb.  For the Finucanes, for Rosemary Nelson and her family, and for peace and justice in Northern Ireland, I urge my colleagues to vote to pass this important resolution.  I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record the statement from the Honorable Judge Peter Cory, March 15, 2005 and a copy of the resolution adopted by Dail Eireann on March 8th urging an independent, judicial, public inquiry into the murder of Patrick Finucane.                                         The Honorable Peter Cory,                                             C.C., C.D., Q.C.,                                      Toronto, ON, March 15, 2005.     Chairman Chris Smith,     Rayburn HOB,     Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Smith: The proposed legislation pertaining to      the public inquiries is unfortunate to say the least.       First, it must be remembered that when the Weston Park      Accord was signed, the signatories would have had only one      concept of a public inquiry. Namely, that it would be      conducted pursuant to the 1921 Public Inquiry Act. Indeed, as      an example, the Bloody Sunday Inquiry would have commenced      its work as a public inquiry by that time.       The families of the victims and the people of Northern      Ireland would have thought that if a public inquiry were to      be directed it would be brought into existence pursuant to      the 1921 Public Inquiry Act.       To change the ground rules at this late date seems unfair.      It seems as well unnecessary since the security of the realm      would be ensured by the courts when the issue arose in a true      public inquiry.       My report certainly contemplated a true public inquiry      constituted and acting pursuant to the provisions of the 1921      Act.       Further, it seems to me that the proposed new Act would      make a meaningful inquiry impossible. The commissions would      be working in an impossible situation. For example, the      Minister, the actions of whose ministry was to be reviewed by      the public inquiry would have the authority to thwart the      efforts of the inquiry at every step. It really creates an      intolerable Alice in Wonderland situation. There have been      references in the press to an international judicial      membership in the inquiry. If the new Act were to become law,      I would advise all Canadian judges to decline an appointment      in light of the impossible situation they would be facing. In      fact, I cannot contemplate any self respecting Canadian judge      accepting an appointment to an inquiry constituted under the      new proposed act.           Yours sincerely,     The Hon. Peter deC. Cory.                                  ____       ``That Dail Eireann:       Recalling the brutal murder of solicitor, Patrick Finucane      at his home in Belfast on 12 February 1989;       Noting the on-going allegations of collusion between      loyalist paramilitaries and British security forces in the      murder of Mr. Finucane;       Recalling the commitments made at the Weston Park talks in      July 2001 by the British Government to hold a public inquiry      into the Finucane case, if so recommended by the Honourable      Judge Peter Cory, it being clearly understood that such an      inquiry would be held under the UK Tribunals of Inquiry      (Evidence) Act, 1921;       Noting that Judge Cory found sufficient evidence of      collusion to warrant a public inquiry into the case and      recommended that such an inquiry take place without delay;       Recalling that in his conclusions, Judge Cory set out the      necessity and importance of a public inquiry into this case      and that the failure to hold a public inquiry as quickly as      reasonably possible could be seen as a denial of the      agreement at Weston Park;       Noting that the limited form of inquiry under the UK      Inquiries Act 2005, proposed by the British Government has      been rejected as inadequate by Judge Cory, the Finucane      family, the Government and human rights groups;       1. Commends the Finucane family for their courageous      campaign to seek the truth in this case of collusion;       2.

Calls for the immediate establishment of a full,      independent, public judicial inquiry into the murder of Pat      Finucane, as recommended by Judge Cory, which would enjoy the      full co-operation of the family and the wider community      throughout Ireland and abroad.
