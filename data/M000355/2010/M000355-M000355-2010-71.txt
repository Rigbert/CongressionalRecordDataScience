 President, I rise to pay tribute to a legendary Kentucky newspaperman who, after 39 years, is retiring, and the Commonwealth will certainly be the poorer for it. I am going to miss my old friend, Bill Bartleman of the Paducah Sun, as his service in the fourth estate ends this month.  Bill's first day at the Paducah Sun was January 7, 1972, when the Murray State University graduate was hired as both a reporter and a photographer. In the four decades since, he has covered Senators and Governors, local lawmakers and the Kentuckians whose names you may not know but who, in his words, ``make life happen.''  He has interviewed a President of the United States, and he has ridden a hot air balloon over the Ohio River. He has become Kentucky's longest running legislative reporter. He has led quite a life of accomplishment, and I wish him well in the next stage of his career.  I first met Bill when he covered my initial race for the Senate in 1984, and he has covered every one of my races since that time. For my last election campaign in 2008, Bill moderated a debate between me and my opponent that was broadcast on C-SPAN. So the whole Nation had a chance to see Bill hard at work. He was fair, honest, and professional, as always.  After 39 years, it would be easy for some reporters to make the mistake of thinking they are the story--but not Bill. This veteran journalist has words of wisdom for young reporters. This is what Bill had to say:       Remember the responsibility of what you do.  He went on to say:       Bill Bartleman isn't important, but what he covers is      important. You need to represent the public and report what      happens fairly. You can't send people tainted water, and you      can't send tainted news.  Those words are well said. Those of us in public life will always have a close relationship with members of the press. Sometimes it is a bit challenging and sometimes it is frustrating. Sometimes the politician and the reporter do not always see eye to eye. I cannot say Bill Bartleman and I agree on everything. But I can say that Bill Bartleman will always have my respect.  For 39 years, Kentuckians have benefited from his incisive political coverage. As he moves on to a position with Mid-Continent University in Mayfield, KY, I know I speak for many Kentuckians when I say: Thank you, Bill. Thank you, Bill, for your dedicated service. You certainly will be missed.  Bill's own newspaper, the Paducah Sun, recently published an excellent article about his life and career, and I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 [From the Paducah Sun, Oct. 24, 2010]              After 39 Years, Bartleman To Retire From Sun       Kentucky's longest-running legislative reporter plans to      retire from The Paducah Sun in November.       Bill Bartleman, 61, will retire from the Sun after 35 years      of covering government and politics, and nearly 39 years      total working for the newspaper.       ``I have thoroughly enjoyed my career as a reporter for The      Paducah Sun and have mixed emotions about retiring,''      Bartleman said.       ``The profession has provided me with opportunities to      experience things and see things that others don't get to see      and feel. Most gratifying are the memories of the people I've      met and having the opportunity to work for people who care.''       The Pennsylvania native graduated from Murray State      University in December 1971. Bartleman served his first day      at the Sun on Jan. 7, 1972, after being hired as a dual      reporter and photographer with the majority of his duties in      photography.       He took over the paper's government and politics beat in      1975 and covered, in person, every session of legislature in      Frankfort from 1976-2007 while using the Web, phone      interviews and less frequent Frankfort visits for coverage in      the past three years.       A frequent commentator for more than 30 years on Kentucky      Educational Television's ``Comment on Kentucky,'' Bartleman      also served as a panelist for KET political debates for      governor, U.S. senator and other offices.       In 2008, he moderated a U.S. Senate candidate debate      between Sen. Mitch McConnell and Bruce Lunsford, which was      broadcast on C-SPAN, the national cable affairs network.       Bartleman said he will become an administrator at Mid-     Continent University in Mayfield on Dec. 1.       ``I learned early in my career that The Paducah Sun has had      a rich tradition and responsibility of reporting news      thoroughly, fairly and accurately,'' Bartleman said. ``It is      a tradition handed down by Ed Paxton, Sr. I've always viewed      myself as one of his caretakers to help carry on that      tradition and responsibility. It is time for me to pass on my      caretaker role to someone else and meet a new and exciting      challenge.''                          ____________________
