That rule, however, provides that in the event that the votes of the Delegates make a difference in the outcome, that immediately the Committee would rise, go into the House, and it would be revoted in the full House without the ability of the Delegates to vote.  The reason I articulate that, Mr. Whip, is to point out that, as you know, that was taken to court to see whether or not that was appropriate under the Constitution. The Court ruled that it was appropriate under the Constitution, with that caveat that I have just referenced. I have discussed this with all five Delegates. They are all supportive of this rule.  We believed, as you know, when you adopted your rules in January of 1995 and dropped the Delegates, we believed that that was unfortunate, because we have five people here sent by their constituents to the House but do not have an opportunity to express their view in a public way, their position in a public way on behalf of their constituents. This will do that, although under the Constitution we are constrained to write it as we did, which has been confirmed by the court. And I thank the gentleman for that question.
