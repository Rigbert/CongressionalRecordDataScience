 President, I thank the chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee for working with me to find a way that the California dairy industry can be held harmless by the dairy provisions in the farm bill.  California is the largest dairy State in the Nation. Last year, California dairy farmers produced 32.2 billion pounds of milk--over 19 percent of the Nation's supply. With over 2,100 dairy farms in the State, California leads the Nation in total number of milk cows at approximately 1.5 million.  I spoke on the floor last week about how devastating the original farm bill would have been to the California dairy industry. And I have said California cannot be left out of any dairy equation. The original bill would have cost California dairy farmers $1.5 billion over 9 years and driven up prices for consumers by $1.5 billion over 9 years. I thank the Chairman for recognizing how much better California fares under this substitute versus the original proposal. I am delighted that he has agreed to see to it that California can be held harmless.  Under the compromise in this bill, and according to an analysis by the University of Missouri's Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute, California dairymen will receive a net benefit $143.1 million in payments until the end of fiscal year 2005. This means California dairy farmers will receive $78.1 million in fiscal year 2002, $70.7 million in fiscal year 2003, and $19.4 million in fiscal year 2004. If these numbers are not accurate projections for California, it is my understanding that the dairy provisions will be worked out in conference so that California is ultimately not adversely impacted by the dairy provisions in this bill.
