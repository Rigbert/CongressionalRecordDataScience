President, last week was National Police Week, and last Wednesday was National Peace Officers Memorial Day. On Monday, May 13, 2013, I joined my colleague, Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri, at a ceremony in St. Louis to honor six brave deputy U.S. marshals who were awarded the Federal Law Enforcement Congressional Badge of Bravery.  Fewer than two dozen of these badges have been awarded since Congress created them 2 years ago. In fact, these six deputy marshals honored in St. Louis are the first law enforcement officers from either Missouri or Illinois to receive the Congressional Badge of Bravery.  Two of the six men are from my State of Illinois. Deputy U.S. Marshal John Brookman Perry lived in Edwardsville; Jeremy Wyatt is from Granite City.  On March 8, 2011, they and four other deputy U.S. marshals, Theodore Abegg, Travis Franke, Nicholas Garrett, Supervisory Deputy Marshal Patrick James, joined members of the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department to arrest a dangerous fugitive in south St. Louis. The officers knew there could be trouble that day when they went to serve the arrest warrant. The man they were looking for had a long criminal history and a record that included assaults on law enforcement officers. But they went anyway because that is their job: bringing in the bad guys so that others can feel safer walking down the street.  Deputy Perry was team leader for the Federal marshals. Tragically, though, he never made it home. He was killed and Deputy Marshal Abegg was wounded in a shootout with the man they went to arrest. His story deserves to be told, so that everyone can know the sort of man and law enforcement officer he was.  John Perry grew up in Glen Ellyn in northern Illinois. He had public service in his blood. His grandfather was the son of an Alabama coal miner who went on to be a Federal district judge in northern Illinois. His father was an administrative law judge. He earned a bachelor's degree in earth science and a master's degree in environmental science from SIU. But he wanted to work in law enforcement. He spent 16 years as a probation officer in Madison County, IL before joining the U.S. Marshals Service in 2001. The Federal marshals who worked with him said there was no one better when it came to tracking dangerous felons and bringing them in.  John was a great marshal, but apparently he had a little trouble with the ``good cop/bad cop'' style of interrogation. At his memorial service, one speaker recalled how, after what was supposed to have been a hard-core interrogation, the suspect emerged and told John's partner: ``Your partner is the nicest guy in the world.'' Just imagine what the world would be like if the worst thing people could say about us was, ``Sometimes he's too nice.''  One of his last gifts to his community was that he was an organ donor. After he died, his heart, lungs, liver, pancreas, and kidneys were donated to people who would have died without them, along with skin and bone tissue to help as many as 100 more people. His spirit--and his commitment to duty--lives on in those people. It lives on in his friends and family, especially his three children. It lives on in the countless law enforcement officers whose back he watched and with whom he shared his professional knowledge and bad jokes. And it continues to be exemplified every day by his fellow deputy marshals who successfully apprehended their suspect on that fateful March day.  John Perry didn't lose his life. He laid down his life to keep his fellow officers and our communities safe.  I hope my colleagues will join me in honoring Deputy U.S. Marshals John Perry, Jeremy Wyatt, Theodore Abegg, Travis Franke, Nicholas Garrett, and Supervisory Deputy U.S Marshal Patrick James. They and all the law enforcement officers who risk their lives to protect ours deserve our respect and gratitude this week and every week.  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I also wish honor three St. Louis Metropolitan Police Detectives who played an instrumental role in the March 8, 2011, apprehension of a fugitive in St. Louis, MO, an incident that claimed the life of Deputy U.S. Marshal John Perry and resulted in the wounding of Deputy U.S. Marshal Theodore, Ted, Abegg, as well as St. Louis Police Officer Jeff Helbling. Before I talk about the heroic service and incredible sacrifice of these three officers, I have to mention the tremendous service the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department provides to the people of St. Louis every day. As the principal law enforcement agency serving the City of St. Louis, the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department, in addition to its routine functions, provides a variety of specialized services, including acting as a liaison with the U.S. Marshals Service Fugitive Task Force. Since its inception in 1836, over 160 St. Louis police officers have lost their lives in the line of duty. When the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department's steadfast dedication to community involvement is considered alongside its traditional crime prevention and mitigation duties, the officers of this department truly exemplify the mission ``To Protect and Serve.''  I know how valuable police officers and other first responders are to communities across Missouri. While I was Jackson County prosecutor, I witnessed firsthand the essential skills and hands-on training needed to keep our neighborhoods safe from crime. I know that our first responders form the backbone of our communities, and I salute the countless acts of bravery performed by law enforcement officers across Missouri.  On March 8, 2011, members of the U.S. Marshals Service Fugitive TaskForce, which included St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department officers, engaged in an effort to apprehend a dangerous fugitive in St. Louis. In approaching the fugitive's residence, the officers and deputies, discovering there were two children at the home, safely removed them and entered the home behind a ballistic shield. Upon entering the home and ascending a stairwell, the officers and deputies were fired upon by the fugitive. Both Deputy U.S. Marshal John Perry and St. Louis Police Officer Jeff Helbling were wounded in the initial exchange of gunfire. Tragically, Deputy Perry's wounds later proved fatal. While other task force members engaged the fugitive, Officer Anna Kimble alerted supporting officers of the shooting over the radio system and Officer Joe Kuster provided perimeter security. A rescue attempt was mounted by the U.S. Marshals, during which another deputy U.S. Marshal was wounded. In the course of the rescue attempt, the fugitive was subdued by task force team members.  I am proud these three officers hail from my home State of Missouri. Their sincere dedication to duty and endless compassion for the residents of the city they serve are an inspiration to the people of St. Louis. First responders like these place themselves in harm's way every day, forsaking the safety many of us take for granted. They and their families make precious sacrifices so that we, the American public, may enjoy the freedom to live our lives to an extent made possible by the knowledge that someone stands watchful and ready on our behalf.  Therefore, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department Detectives Jeff Helbling, Anna Kimble, and Joe Kuster for their distinguished service to the people of St. Louis. I thank them, and I thank all of you for joining me in recognizing these outstanding Missourians.  Finally, Mr. President, I wish to honor two deputy U.S. marshals who played an instrumental role in the March 8, 2011, apprehension of a fugitive in St. Louis, MO, an incident that claimed the life of Deputy U.S. Marshal John Perry and resulted in the wounding of Deputy U.S. Marshal Theodore ``Ted'' Abegg, as well as St. Louis Police Officer Jeff Helbling. Before I talk about the heroic service and incredible sacrifice of these two deputies, I have to mention the tremendous service the U.S. Marshals Service provides to the people of this country every day. As the Nation's oldest Federal law enforcement agency, the U.S. Marshals Service provides a variety of crucial services, including protecting Federal judges, operating the Witness Security Program, seizing illegally obtained assets from criminals, and apprehending Federal fugitives--a function which led to its cooperation with the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department and the formation of the U.S. Marshals Service Fugitive Task Force in St. Louis. Since its inception in 1789, over 200 Federal marshals, deputy marshals, special deputy marshals, and marshals guards have lost their lives in the line of duty. When the U.S. Marshals Service's steadfast devotion to crime prevention and mitigation is considered alongside its traditional witness protection and judicial security duties, the law enforcement officials of this agency truly exemplify the values of ``Justice, Integrity, Service.''  I know how critically important the Marshals Service is to the Federal justice system and the impact these officials have in communities across Missouri. These highly trained men and women help form the backbone of our legal system, and I salute the countless acts of bravery performed by Federal law enforcement officers across Missouri and this Nation.  On March 8, 2011, members of the U.S. Marshals Service Fugitive Task Force, which included St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department officers, engaged in an effort to apprehend a dangerous fugitive in St. Louis. In approaching the fugitive's residence, the officers and deputies, discovering there were two children at the home, safely removed them and entered the home behind a ballistic shield. Upon entering the home and ascending a stairwell, the officers and deputies were fired upon by the fugitive. Both Deputy U.S. Marshal John Perry and St. Louis Police Officer Jeff Helbling were wounded in the initial exchange of gunfire. Tragically, Deputy Perry's wounds later proved fatal. While other task force members engaged the fugitive, Officer Anna Kimble alerted supporting officers of the shooting over the radio system, Deputy U.S. Marshal Melissa Duffy administered first aid to Officer Helbling, and Deputy U.S. Marshal Shawn Jackson provided protective cover allowing wounded Deputy U.S. Marshal Abegg to withdraw. A rescue attempt was mounted by the U.S. marshals, during which another deputy U.S. marshal was wounded. In the course of the rescue attempt, the fugitive was subdued by task force team members.  I am proud these two deputies are based in my home State of Missouri. Their sincere dedication to duty and strong sense of justice are an inspiration to the American people. Marshals like these place themselves in harm's way every day, forsaking the safety many of us take for granted. They and their families make precious sacrifices so that we, the American public, may enjoy the freedom to live our lives to an extent made possible by the knowledge that someone stands watchful and ready on our behalf.  Therefore, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Deputy U.S. Marshals Melissa Duffy and Shawn Jackson for their distinguished service to the people of this country. I thank them, and I thank all of you for joining me in recognizing these outstanding individuals.                          ____________________
