President, in recent weeks I have spent a great deal of time thinking about Bosnia. I have been to hearings and briefings. I have consulted with experts. I have had many discussions with my colleagues and my constituents. One month ago, I even went to Sarajevo and Tuzla myself to see the conditions our soldiers would face there.  Since my return, I have taken to the floor of the Senate many times, and used every public opportunity, to state my opposition to the President's imminent deployment of ground troops to Bosnia. In the days since the conclusion of the Proximity Peace Talks in Dayton, I have also spoken out against any conditional support of this deployment coming from the Congress. The decision to intervene on the ground in Bosnia is a bad idea, Mr. President, and while I will always support our soldiers wherever they are sent, I want no part of this decision.  My conviction that the administration's intention to put troops in harm's way in Bosnia is a huge mistake rests on three broad arguments. First, and above all, the conflict in Bosnia poses no real threat to vital American interests--simply put, there is nothing in Bosnia that Americans should die for. Second, the Dayton talks have produced a false peace that is inherently unstable and politically doomed. Finally, the implementation force [I-For] plan is self-contradictory and hopelessly optimistic, and will expose our soldiers to unreasonable risks even as they diligently pursue its unrealistic objectives.                     What interests are threatened?  The administration has repeatedly argued that two vital interests are at stake in the conflict in Bosnia. If we don't intervene now, they say, the war will widen to a point where it threatens all of Europe. If the U.S. does not lead NATO in intervention, they say, both the NATO alliance and U.S. leadership of it will be at risk.  The President is correct when he says that preserving security in Europe, and maintaining American leadership of NATO, are vital American interests. But it is one thing to refer to vital interests, and another to claim that they are really threatened by the conflict in Bosnia. I do not think they are. The administration asserts that the war in Bosnia will spread throughout Central Europe. But where is the evidence that this conflict threatens Bosnia's neighbors? Local countries like Italy, Hungary, and Austria do not seem concerned.  The President has often referred to previous European wars in this century. But comparing this war to either of the world wars--and likening those of us who oppose United States involvement in Bosnia to 1930's-style isolationists--is absurd. It shows a profound misunderstanding of history, and of the roots of those conflicts. World War I began in the Balkans because the world powers took sides in a Balkan war, not because they kept at a safe distance. What the Clinton administration is doing looks a lot more like taking sides. As for World War II, neither Serbia, Bosnia, nor Croatia are anything like Nazi Germany, in terms of ambition, population, industrial strength, military power, or anything else. They are focused on each other, not on external aggression.  The Balkan war has not spread in the past 4 years, and it shows no signs of spreading. So when the President states that stability in Europe is a vital American interest, he is right. But when he says that European security is threatened in Bosnia, he is wrong.  The only other vital interest the administration refers to is that of preserving our leadership of the NATO alliance. Mr. President, I believe in NATO. It has served us well, and because there are still potential threats to European security, we must enhance and even expand it. But right now, the American people are divided on the question of NATO's importance. Many wonder if the alliance has outlived its usefulness. How does the administration expect Americans to feel about NATO when we get bogged down in a NATO mission in Bosnia? They will view every body bag as one more reason to get out of the alliance once and for all. They will ask: ``This is why we are a part of NATO?'' And they will be much less willing to act when a real threat to Europe comes along. There are still real threats to Europe out there, Mr. President.  Dragging--or being dragged by--the alliance into a conflict for which it was not designed and for which it is not suited is not leadership. NATO still has a viable mission, but not one of intervening in a nasty Balkan civil war that poses no demonstrable threat to European security. Why should we risk the inevitable conflicts with our NATO partners that will result when we all start taking casualties in a place where no one really wanted to be in the first place?  And why, if this is so important to NATO, should Russia--whose unpredictable future is one of the principal reasons for NATO's continued existence--be included so completely? Why would we go out of our way to include Russian forces with our own, when their natural sympathies lie with the Serbs that we will be trying to disarm, the Serbs we were bombing just a few weeks ago? We have been told by the administration that we would be evenhanded in our actions in Bosnia, but I was told by an administration official not long ago that the Bosnians were our first priority. But Russia's first priority will certainly be the Serbs.  Not only will this forced alliance with Russia bring Russian troops into Central Europe for the first time since World War II; it will create the potential for misunderstandings and conflict with Russian forces that we have not seen since the Berlin Wall came down--all in the name of preserving European security.  Mr. President, I repeat--I support NATO. If and when this conflict truly threatens Greece and Turkey, or any of our other NATO allies, I will support action to contain it. But the administration proposes not to contain the conflict, but to jump right into the middle of it. If NATO is to become a rationale for America intervening in civil wars in states that are not even members of the alliance, then I say we should disband the alliance tomorrow.           What kind of ``peace'' are we trying to implement?  Mr. President, in all the discussion of the implementation force, many people have lost sight of how shaky the agreement reached in Dayton is itself. Regardless of our interests in Bosnia, or our concern for the victims of the war there, the NATO force is being sent to Bosnia to implement what I believe is a fatally flawed agreement, one not likely to survive without the continued presence of large numbers of NATO troops. Let me quote at length from a study by John Hillen of The Heritage Foundation, dated November 30, 1995, and titled ``Questioning The Bosnia Peace Plan'':       Is a bifurcated Bosnian state a realistic and sustainable      political entity? The Bosnian peace accord proposes a Bosnia-     Herzegovina that has the appearance of a single state, but is      in fact based on two very separate political entities--The      Bosnian Muslim/Croat Federation and the Bosnian Serb      Republic. In order for the central organs of Bosnia to      actually function as intended, the two separate entities of      Bosnia will have to show the most extraordinary goodwill and      cooperation towards each other, qualities that have never      before been in evidence in Bosnia.       Many experienced diplomats have expressed skepticism about      the political viability of this Bosnian state and the      realistic chances of its survival as a centrally governed and      coherent nation. * * * Stephen Cambone of the Center for      Strategic and International Studies noted that ``any      agreement reached in 20 days over issues that have been      fiercely fought over for more than four years is fraught with      compromises and internal flaws.'' Helmut Sonnenfeldt of the      Brookings Institution noted that the accord has ``a lot of      loose ends'' and ``many ways in which it could unravel.'' In      short, the accord is diplomatically enchanting but      realistically impractical.       Much of this skepticism over the accord is rooted in the      fact that the accord does not address fundamental issues of      sovereignty and ethnic self-determination. Instead, it      freezes those unresolved issues in place and offers up an      elaborate power sharing agreement for a Bosnian central      government. However, it will be difficult for a contrived      central government to replace the bonds of loyalty,      authority, and legitimacy that currently exist between      Bosnian Croats and Croatia and Bosnian Serbs and Serbia.      Those existing bonds are rooted in centuries of political,      ethnic, and cultural identity and are sure to prove stronger      than bonds to a hastily fabricated central government. * * *       If history is any guide, this agreement does not stand much      chance of lasting. In Cyprus in 1964, international      negotiators reached a similar agreement between Turkish and      Greek Cypriots. Much like the Bosnian agreement, the doomed      Cyprus accord attempted to replace bonds to the ``parent      entities'' for both sides (Greece and Turkey) with an      unworkable central executive and ethnically aligned      parliamentary blocs. This ensured continued intractability      except in the event of the most extraordinary goodwill. This      structure never worked because it never addressed the      fundamental fears and aspirations of the warring factions and      was completely predicated on a diplomatic fantasy: the hopes      for a degree of cooperation that had never been present in      Cyprus. After 10 years of sporadic fighting and instability      under this makeshift arrangement, Turkey invaded the island,      partitioned Cyprus, and put an end to the ephemeral peace; an      imposed peace that was never locally supported. UN      peacekeepers have been in Cyprus for over 30 years.       The same pattern can be expected in Bosnia. How can an      imposed peace that does not reflect political realities or      the basic concerns of the warring factions hope to survive      except by the continued enforcement of thousands of NATO and      American troops? The hastily concluded Bosnian peace accord      is, by necessity, a weak plan. The weakness is inherent      because the accord does not address the fundamental issues      that caused the parties to go to war in the first place. It      is, at best, a cease-fire that can only work under the      continued stewardship of 60,000 heavily armed NATO combat      troops.  Mr. President, it is my view that, in addition to finding threats to vital interests in the Balkans where there are none, the President is putting U.S. prestige on the line to implement a peace plan that has very little chance of succeeding in the long run even if everything goes well for a year.                   The real risks to American troops  Maybe the most troubling thing about the Administration's approach to the Balkans is its confidence that it will be able to control the conflict after it jumps in with both feet. The President speaks of a ``limited, focused'' mission; he tells us that we are ``not fighting a war.'' Then why are we sending more than 60,000 troops, reinforced with tanks, artillery, and airpower? What of this talk of ``overwhelming force'' and ``robust rules of engagement?'' Just what is ``overwhelming force'' when you are fighting against landmines? What are ``robust rules of engagement'' when you are fighting snipers --an airstrike on the village where you think the shot came from? Mr. President, I remind my colleagues that we had robust rules of engagement and overwhelming force in Vietnam, and they did not work in the end. I think that it is utter nonsense to apply these concepts to Bosnia.  Regardless of any paper agreement signed in Dayton, there are those in Bosnia for whom continued fighting is a better deal. There are those who are profiting from the war as bandits or on the black market. There are those who are used to getting their way with guns; for them this war is about money, not ethnicity; one NATO commander told me that they had found cases where Serbs were selling black market ammunition to Muslims! What about those who will be displaced from their homes by the Dayton agreement, who will not willingly leave? What about those who have been displaced--there are up to three million refugees in Bosnia-Herzegovina--for whom peace means ``going home,'' but who will not be allowed to return as the result of the agreement? What about fighters who are demobilized as a result of the treaty, but cannot find jobs because the economy has been ruined? And those who just miss the power of a rifle? While I was in Tuzla last month, the commanding general of UN Sector Northeast, General Haukland, told me that there will be criminality and gangsterism when troops are demobilized. Mr. President, what about those who have a score to settle after four years of brutal war? One thing is certain, Mr. President--there are a lot of people in Bosnia who may be tempted to shoot at Americans, regardless of our ``overwhelming force'' and ``robust rules of engagement.''                         A long-term commitment  On October 17, 1995, Secretary of Defense Perry told the Senate Armed Services Committee: ``The U.S. has vital political, economic, and security interests in Europe. The war in Bosnia threatens those interests, and the U.S. vital security interest is served by stopping this war.'' At the same hearing, Secretary Perry states the administration's commitment to bringing our troops home in approximately one year.  But the Administration cannot have it both ways. President Clinton cannot say that our vital interests are threatened in Bosnia, and at the same time pledge that we will be out of Bosnia in about a year. If two vital interests--European security and the NATO alliance--are truly threatened in Bosnia, how can there be a one-year statute of limitations on our response? Since when are American vital interests only worth one year's commitment?  The Administration has also said that United States troops will leave Bosnia if the peace agreement is violated and conflict resumes. In short, their plan claims to be defending a vital interest, but promises that we will leave if enough people shoot at us, or when the 12-month clock runs out. But if conflict in Bosnia really threatens a vital U.S. interest, are they not committed to ending that conflict no matter what it takes, or how long it takes? Is that not what ``vital interest'' means? Mr. President, if the administration can tell us that IFOR will leave in about a year, no matter what, then there must not be much of a threat or much of a vital interest. If there are vital interests at stake, the Administration should be honest and tell the American people that we are committed to Bosnia for the long haul.  If I were sending one of my sons to Bosnia, I would want to know that his life was being put on the line to accomplish something important, something worth doing at any cost, and something that the American people stood firmly behind. But at best, the Dayton plan and IFOR will bring a few months' respite to the people of Bosnia. When the war resumes after we leave, or if ``systemic violations'' force us out, then the hundreds, perhaps thousands, of Americans who died trying to impose a token peace in an artificial country will truly have been wasted.  Vital interests are the only thing we should ask our soldiers to die for. When U.S. vital interests at stake, the American people and our troops alike will tolerate things going badly for a while. They will stay the course. If there were vital interests at stake in Bosnia, the President would not be giving us all of these details about rules of engagement, exit strategies, and time limits--he would not have to.  Mr. President, administration officials in Washington seem to be the only people who think we can finish this operation in a year. Not one military or diplomatic person I spoke with on my trip, not a single U.S., NATO, or U.N. commander, thought that peace in Bosnia could be achieved in anything close to 12 months. Given the forbidding geography, harsh winter climate, and wholesale destruction in Bosnia, it will be months before even modest degree of stability could be restored, even if everyone cooperates fully. The UN commander in Tuzla, General Haukland of Norway, described a one-year presence as a hand in water--when you take it out, nothing has changed. In Balkan history, a year is no time at all.  The simple truth, Mr. President, is that the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina is about to become America's pet country. The United States of America is going to own Bosnia and all of her problems just as soon as the 1st Armored Division sets up in Tuzla. Does anyone really believe that we will leave Bosnia in a year if the threat to her stability remains? Does anyone really believe, after arming, training, and equipping the Bosnian Army for a year, that we will stand by and watch if our pet army is on the verge of defeat? Of course not; if Bosnia is as important as the Administration says it is, we will stay in Bosnia as long as we have to. We have already employed airstrikes against the Serbs; we will do so again if Bosnia is threatened again. I say to my colleagues--we are on the verge of what may be a very long commitment.  So Mr. President, I have said that I will resist this plan with all of my power, and I will do so down to the wire. I think the peace is false, the plan is naive, and the risk to our troops unrealistically high. There is only one way to express these conclusions: I urge my colleagues to oppose the Dole-McCain Resolution of conditional support, and to support the Hutchison-Inhofe Resolution opposing the deployment of ground troops to Bosnia.  Mr. President, I want to make a couple of observations about the debate that is taking place tonight. There seems to be a lot of people who are going to vote, perhaps, for the Hutchison-Inhofe resolution, then turn around and vote also for the Dole-McCain resolution. I suggest, Mr. President, that would be a little inconsistent.  After looking at a final copy--and we only received a copy of the Dole-McCain resolution a matter of a couple of hours ago in its final version--I cannot see that it narrows the mission at all. It starts off by saying, ``Before acting, pursuant to the resolution, the President shall make available to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate his determination. . .''--and then they cover a number of things that they want the President to certify. For example, the Dole-McCain resolution says: ``The mission will be limited to the implementation of the military provisions of the Dayton agreement.''  But the administration has already, in effect, certified this: Secretary Christopher said, on December 1: ``Let me assure you that IFOR's mission is well-defined and limited. Our troops will enforce the military aspects of the agreement. They will not be asked to guarantee the success of democracy or reconstruction.''  Secretary Perry said the same thing: ``The mission of IFOR is to oversee and enforce the implementation of the military aspects of the peace agreement.'' That is exactly the same as we find in the Dole-McCain amendment.  Second, Dole-McCain says: ``An integral part of the successful accomplishment of the objective is the establishment of military balance.'' This is what the administration has been saying all along. For example, Secretary Christopher has said: ``We are committed to achieve the stable military balance with Bosnia and among the states of the former Yugoslavia.''  In another part of the Dole-McCain resolution, it says: ``The United States will lead an immediate international effort to provide equipment, arms, training, and related logistics assistance of the highest possible quality to ensure that the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina can provide for its own defense.''  Again, on December 1, Secretary Christopher said: ``The Armed Forces in the Federation will need to obtain some equipment and training in order to establish an effective self-defense capability. As for our part, the United States will ensure that the Federation Armed Forces receive the necessary assistance.''  What I am saying, Mr. President, is I think it is inconsistent for someone to vote for Hutchison-Inhofe and turn around and vote for Dole-McCain. Dole-McCain simply requires the President to say what he has been saying all along. Is that supposed to narrow the mission? Is that supposed to reassure us?  Second, Mr. President, I was listening very attentively to the very knowledgeable and scholarly Senator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, talking about the constitutional rights of the President and the responsibilities of the President and also the constitutional rights of Congress. I thought, all the way through, that he was coming to the conclusion that the President cannot do what he has already done. At least that is what I was inferring from his remarks. But I gather he will support the President by voting for Dole-McCain.  I did hear several other valuable arguments during the course of the day. Senator Feingold came out with some very strong constitutional arguments that would lead one to believe that the President has indeed overstepped his powers. He referred to an article by Louis Fisher, which I later made a part of this Record. He says: ``The framers knew that the British King could use military force against other countries without legislative involvement. They gave to Congress the responsibility for deciding matters of war and peace. The President, as Commander in Chief, was left with the power to repel sudden attacks.''  So that qualifies what the President is able to do within his constitutional rights. We made that a part of the Record. In sitting and listening to the debate today--and I stayed in the Chamber the entire day, as I feel this is the most critical vote we will have, probably, at least in the last year or 2, and I wanted to hear everyone's viewpoint. I think the distinguished Senator from Alabama, Senator Heflin, talked at some length about how this should be a European mission. I have said over and over again that maybe we have a responsibility--and I am not going to debate that because everybody is assuming that we have a responsibility to protect the integrity of NATO, to respond in some way to the atrocities that have taken place. I have suggested that there are atrocities taking place all over the world. Where do you draw the line? Do you draw it here? Or are we, in fact, doing this because the President, in February 1993, made a statement that he was going to send ground troops in?  But the Senator from Alabama, Senator Heflin, talked about the fact that this should be a European mission. Nobody will deny that it is more a responsibility of Europe than it is the United States. Yet, we talk about the contribution that our NATO partners are making to this.   Germany, who is in the backyard of the Balkans, is sending a total of 4,000 troops, and they debated it in their legislative body before agreeing to do that. We did not have time to debate it before we did it. Yet, we are talking about sending five times the troops that Germany is sending.  I listened very carefully while several people on the floor made points. I want to briefly respond to a couple of them. First of all, as far as our troops being supported, I think we all have made it abundantly clear that we in this body, as well as the other body, are supporting our troops, not just here, but all around the world. What greater support could there be for our troops than by not sending them into this hostile area to start with? That is real support of the troops.  That is what we are trying to do with the Hutchison-Inhofe resolution--make it abundantly clear that our troops should not have to be over there. When they are over there--if, in fact, they end up in a mass deployment--yes, we will support our troops all the way. I think that has been said over and over again. I do not think anybody is going to deny that.  The Senator from New Mexico, Senator Domenici, made a very good point. What we are trying to do is state our opposition to this before it gets started.  You see, the troops are not deployed yet. Yes, there are some there. We will support those. Those are the advance troops, logistic troops, but the mass deployment that the President has promised immediately after the signing of this agreement in Paris has not yet taken place. So this debate is taking place now, before the mass deployment has taken place.  The junior Senator from California commented in her remarks that this deployment was acceptable ``as long as it remains a peacekeeping mission.'' I suggest to the junior Senator from California it is not a peacekeeping mission now. We keep hearing about peacekeeping as if there is currently peace to keep. There is a cease-fire in effect. But I have been in parts of Bosnia during this cease-fire when the gunfire was going off; in some parts of the northeast sector, near Tuzla, they do not even know there is a cease-fire. The title that we are giving ourselves now, giving to I-FoR, is ``peace implementation.'' There is a big difference between peacekeeping and peace implementation. Peace implementation means we do not have peace now but we will implement it. That is a totally different mission.  Mission creep has already crept into this, Mr. President. The exit strategy seems to be to keep peace for a year, and then leave. As the junior Senator from California said, all we have to do is keep peace for a year and we are out of there. She is saying exactly what Secretary Christopher said, exactly what General Shalikashvili said as recently as last week before the Senate Armed Services Committee, saying it is inconceivable we will not be out of there in a year.  During my visit with the Norwegian general who commands the U.N.'s northeast sector, in the Tuzla area, I mentioned ``12 months,'' he smiled and said, ``You mean 12 years.'' And when we talked about 12 months he said, ``Apparently the American people do not understand the way the people in that region think, the Serbs, the Croats, and the Moslems. Their conception of time is totally different.'' He used an analogy I have used on the floor. It is like putting your hand in water for 12 months, you look and take your hand out and nothing has happened. When we leave the war will start again. If they know we will be gone in a year, which we have said we will be--the President has reaffirmed that as recently as last week, and it was reaffirmed a week ago by Secretary of Defense Perry--what will they do? Lay low for a year and then come back out swinging. By the way, Mr. President, the combatants in this conflict have a habit of laying low every winter.  I do not think I have ever in my life--and I did serve in the Armed Forces--I do not ever remember a time in our Nation's history or in the history of warfare where we went into a hostile area and then our exit strategy was geared to time, instead of being geared to events. But that is exactly what we are proposing to do here.  The senior Senator from California was talking about ``A far greater risk in doing nothing than in sending our troops.'' I suggest that it is not quite that easy. It would be easy if we were able to pass the Hutchison-Inhofe resolution and the President would look at this and say clearly we do not have Congress behind sending ground troops in but we have a responsibility to NATO, we have a responsibility to Bosnia. If he felt that way he could do it and we could do it through air power. We have already been there with airstrikes. We know that works. We could lift the arms embargo.  Sure, our European partners do not want us to do that. They want us on the ground there. People talk about how well received our President was over in Europe. I think if I lived in Europe I would be receiving him well, too. He is coming over and proposing that we fight their battle for them. I suggest that there are other alternatives.  Senator Ashcroft from Missouri was talking about the speech that the President made in 1993 and suggested something I had not thought about. Maybe the President made the commitment of United States ground troops back in February 1993 without having been really apprised of the situation in Bosnia, the deep hostility, the history of that area, the history of World War I, World War II, the 500-year-old civil war, and what has been going on over there for many years.  The Senator from Delaware, Senator Biden, was articulate and outspoken when he talked about the different parties there. I think he referred to Milosevic as someone who was perhaps a war criminal, and certainly he talked about the others who had actually been indicted for war crimes. Lastly, it was Senator Kohl who said that we either support peace or we do not. I think there are many ways where we can offer our support without doing it on the ground. I will mention one other thing that the Senator from North Carolina mentioned when he talked about the fact that the bridges and the roads in that sector--from Hungary down south through Tuzla, down toward Sarajevo, in the area that goes from the Posavina corridor down to Tuzla--that the roads would not accommodate an M-1 tank. We found out when we were over there that there is only one bridge in that entire area that they say can handle it structurally. The Americans will have to come in and rebuild the bridges, rebuild the roads, and if they do not they will start a civil war because the people are upset for us coming in and messing up the existing roads with our tanks. This came from the people now in command, the U.N. people in the northeast sector.  The most profound thing I have heard on the floor of the Senate today came from the very distinguished Senator from Indiana, Senator Coats. He asked the question, ``Have we so squandered American leadership that we must buy it back with American lives?'' I think this puts it in perspective. If we are wanting to prove to someone that we have this leadership, that we must lead and whatever NATO decides to do is in the best interest of the allies and that we must blindly go along with them, do we do this at the risk of lives?  On October 17 we asked the question of Secretary Christopher and Secretary Perry. This was after Gen. Michael Rose made the statement if the Americans get into this war they will sustain more losses than they did during the Persian Gulf war, where we lost a total of 390 lives.  I asked the question, is your mission here worth 400 or more lives? Secretary Christopher said yes; Secretary Perry said yes; General Shalikashvili said yes. I think that is a defining difference between the administration's view and my own.  I think that we need to at least acknowledge this body is already on record opposing what President Clinton is about to do. So it is not a matter of waiting until the last minute, until the last hour. Over a month ago we passed a sense-of-the-Congress amendment in both the House and Senate, attached to the Defense appropriations bill by Senator Gregg: ``It is the sense of Congress that none of the funds available for the Department of Defense should be obligated or exploited for the deployment or participation of the United States Armed Forces in any peacekeeping operation in Bosnia-Herzegovina * * *.''   This opposition is not something we are coming up with today for the first time. The Senate is already on record.  Lastly, let me go over some of the things that were talked about on the floor today in terms of danger. I think we are kind of trying to soften this thing, trying to gloss over the dangers. Some say we will go over and everyone will be kissing the American flag and everyone will love us because we brought peace into the Balkans. If you stop and look, and this came out of the Defense News, of the various elements over there, the Croats have 80,000 soldiers; the Croatian Serbs 50,000; Serbia, 125,000; Bosnia, 110,000; Bosnian Serbs, 80,000; Bosnian Croats, 50,000. That is not even talking about the rogue elements, and there are some nine rogue elements that are over there.  It is so convoluted it reminds me of the letter that came back from one of our warriors who lost his life in Somalia. It was the son of Captain James Smith, who read me the letter of his son. His son was Cpl. Jim Smith who lost his life. Capt. Jim Smith lost his leg in Vietnam and his son lost his life in Somalia. His was one of those corpses dragged through the street in Mogadishu. His last letter said: Dad, we cannot tell who our friends are and who they are not. We cannot tell the difference.  I suggest that is exactly the situation that we have here. Many people have talked about the fact that we are going to have just 20,000 or 25,000 troops over there. I hope no one is kidding themselves, deluding themselves thinking that is all we are going to have.  There was an article in the Defense News that gave a very persuasive argument that we would end up with a total NATO force of 240,000 troops. Keeping our ratio, that would be 80,000 Americans who will be involved over there.  Go back and read your history. British Prime Minister Disraeli, over 100 years ago, who had been observing the battles over there, said, ``It will take a half-million troops to bring peace to the Balkans.''  I think, when we look at the timeframe of 12 months--that is fictitious. It is not going to happen. The 20,000 troops, that is not going to happen. The mission is peacekeeping--that already is not happening, it is now peace implementation. We are kidding ourselves.  We have already had a vote on H.R. 2606. That was a very strong vote, even though there were just 22 who voted in favor of it. Those are the people who really feel the strongest about not sending troops into that area. But we are going to have another record vote. That record vote is going to take place this evening.  We are going to have two record votes. When you have the first vote on the Hutchison-Inhofe resolution, think very carefully. Because if you vote for that, as I said when I opened these remarks, you cannot turn around and vote for the Dole-McCain resolution because they are inconsistent with each other. This is the last opportunity that the Senators who are here and will be voting tonight will have to get on record. This is their last shot, the last chance they have to say no, we should not send ground troops into Bosnia.  I do not think it is possible for anyone to understand the hostility of the area if he or she has not been up there to Tuzla where our troops will go. To the best of my knowledge, only two Members of Congress have been up there, Senator Hank Brown from Colorado and myself. When we had a meeting the other day in the Senate Armed Services Committee, I discovered that even Secretary Perry had not been up there, Secretary Christopher had not been up there, General Shalikashvili had not been up there, and certainly President Clinton has not been up there.  I cannot imagine that they would be willing to take chances in a hostile area without going up and looking at it. I can tell you firsthand, and I went over much of that area in a helicopter not more than 100 feet off the treetops with Gen. Rupert Smith, a British general. We looked down and for the first time we could realize how Marshal Tito was able to hold off the very best that Hitler had on a ratio of 1 to 8, because of the unique environment, the very hostile and forbidding environment.  Mr. President, this is going to be probably the most significant vote that many Members of this body will cast. It is going to be tonight. I would like to have them think long and hard. Because if you vote for--if you vote against the Hutchison-Inhofe resolution and vote for the Dole-McCain resolution, you are saying we agree with the basic policy of sending ground troops.  You see, I think everybody knows now, we can support our troops and not support the policy. That is an easy thing to do. We all support our troops. The greatest support we could give our troops is to not to deploy them into that warring area.  I yield the floor.
