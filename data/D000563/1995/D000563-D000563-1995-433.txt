Speaker, today I am introducing the Medigap Consumer Protection Act of 1995, which will help millions of seniors hang on to the private health insurance they purchase to pay for the deductibles and services which are not covered by Medicare.  In recent years, insurance companies have increasingly sold Medigap policies whose premiums are determined using a method known as ``attained age rating''. An attained age policy offers the buyer lower premiums at an early age but its premiums increase as a result of the aging of the policyholder. At various age thresholds the insurer raises premiums to reflect the expected greater use of health care by older policyholders. Due to the high inflation rate in the cost of health care, all Medigap policy premiums increase with time, but the premiums of attained age policies increase much more sharply.  The Medigap Consumer Protection Act would prohibit annual Medigap premium increases from being based on the age or aging of the policyholder. This would prohibit insurance companies from selling any more attained age Medigap policies. Ten States already prohibit attained age rating for Medigap: Arkansas, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, and Washington. The bill would allow people who have already purchased attained age policies to keep them if they choose to do so. However, insurance companies would have to offer these policyholders the option of changing their insurance coverage to a policy not based on attained age rating, for example, a community rated or issue age rated policy.  Most Medigap purchasers, and many insurance agents, do not understand how attained age rating works, so prospective policy buyers often have a difficult time in making an informed decision. Senior citizens who purchase attained age policies and later face unexpectedly large premium increases as they age find it difficult to change policies because they usually must face a 6-month waiting period for pre-existing health conditions. When seniors enter the Medicare system--usually at age 65--they have a 6-month window of opportunity during which they can sign up for Medigap insurance without being denied coverage because of pre-existing conditions. At all other times they are subject to such a pre-existing condition waiting period. [[Page E1005]]   The Medigap Consumer Protection Act would direct the National Association of Insurance Commissioners [NAIC] to develop guidelines to eliminate attained age rating which would then be implemented in all States. The NAIC, founded in 1871, is the Nation's oldest association of State public officials. It is composed of the chief insurance regulators of all 50 States, the District of Columbia and the 4 U.S. territories. In the past, Congress has requested similar action from the NAIC, which has successfully completed these requests.  For instance, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 instructed NAIC to develop model standardized benefit packages for the Medigap market. After holding public hearings, and consulting with interested parties, the NAIC completed the standards, which were approved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services and became law.  I would like to include in the Record the following excerpt from a Consumer Reports article of August 1994 which describes the attained-age pricing problem in the Medigap market:       Many companies have changed the way they price policies so      they can bait consumers with low premiums at the outset and      trap them with very high increases later on.       In 1989, most carriers used either ``community rates'' or      ``issue-age rates'' to price their policies. With community      rates, all policyholders, young or old, pay the same premium.      With issue-age rates, premiums will vary depending on the age      of the buyer. But in either case, the annual premium will go      up only to reflect inflation in the cost of benefits; it will      not rise because you get older. Both community and issue-age      rates protect policyholders from steep annual increases.       Now, however, more and more insurance companies are      restoring to a less benign strategy as ``attained-age''      pricing. It allows companies to gain a competitive advantage      by selling cheap policies to 65-year-olds when they enter the      Medicare-supplement market. With attained-age pricing, the      initial premiums, especially for those between 65 and 69, are      usually lower than for issue-age or community-rated policies.      But there's a catch: Premiums will rise steeply as the      policyholder gets older.       In 1990, 31 percent of all Blue Cross-Blue Shield      affiliates sold policies with attained-age rates. In 1993, 55      percent did. At the same time, the proportion of Blue Cross-     Blue Shield plans offering community rates has dropped from      51 percent to 21 percent. AARP/Prudential still offers      community rates but finds its initial premiums have become      less competitive for policyholders age 65 to 69.       Attained-age policies are hazardous to policyholders. By      age 75, 80, or 85, a policyholder may find that coverage has      become unaffordable--just when the onset of poor health could      make it impossible to buy a new, less expensive policy. Take,      for example, an attained-age Plan F offered by New York Life      and an issue-age Plan F offered by United American. For      someone age 65, the New York Life policy is about $114 a year      cheaper. But by age 80, the New York Life policyholder would      have spent a total of $5000 more than the buyer of the United      American policy.       Buyers are rarely warned of these consequences. Neither      insurers nor agents are required to tell consumers how      expensive attained-age policies will become over time. A      sales brochure from California Blue Cross, which boasts one      of the state's hottest-selling Medicare supplements, says      nothing about rate increases; it doesn't even mention that      rates are calculated on an attained-age basis. Of the 17      agents our reporter heard, only one discussed the way his      company's rates were set--and he thoroughly confused the      three methods. ``The vast majority of agents don't understand      attained-age pricing,      so they can't possibly explain it to their customers,'' says      Mark McAndrew, president of United American.       Only 10 states--Arkansas, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia,      Idaho, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, and      Washington--either require that insurers use community rates      or specifically ban attained-age policies. In most other      states, insurers are shifting to attained-age policies.      United American, a large seller of Medicare-supplement      policies, has just notified state insurance regulators that      it plans to switch from issue-age to attained-age rates. ``We      think attained-age rates are a bad thing, but our agents had      to eat,'' explains Joyce Lane, a United American Vice      president.  Mr. Speaker, Bonnie Burns, a private contractor for California's Health Insurance Counseling and Advocacy Program delivered the following testimony before the House Health and Environment Subcommittee earlier this year:       The danger [with attained age rating] is that just when      people begin to need more and more medical care, they will      also be hit with much higher premiums. Alternative methods of      calculating premiums mean that older beneficiaries will      almost always pay less than with attained age rates. The      impact of sharply increased premiums is minimized.       Most seniors are in the middle class or below and are      already spending about 23 percent of their income on health      care expenses according to the AARP, while those under 65      spend about 8 percent. As people age their income and      resources go down over time, particularly for older widowed      women, and out of pocket costs for health care consume an      increasingly larger part of their income. Their ability to      absorb additional costs in premiums, deductibles and      coinsurance is limited.  Mr. Speaker, affordable premiums and reliable health care coverage are crucial issues for millions of elderly Americans on fixed incomes. At age 65, virtually all Americans recognize the importance of good health coverage. Seniors face rapidly increasing health costs as they reach their seventies and eighties. It is inappropriate to lure seniors into attained age policies which they will not be able to afford if they live for a decade or two. That is why Consumers' Union and the National Council of Senior Citizens have written letters strongly supporting the Medigap Consumer Protection Act.  I would like to close, Mr. Speaker, by describing a few of the things the Medigap Consumer Protection Act will not do:  The Medigap Consumer Protection Act does not place price controls on the insurance industry. Under this bill each insurance carrier will continue to set its own rates and can charge as much or as little as it feels is prudent as long as it continues to meet the loss ratio requirements which are already in place under current law.  The Medigap Consumer Protection Act does not diminish valuable consumer choice. Attained age rating makes it more difficult and confusing for consumers to make price comparisons and compare different policies. Attained age rating confuses prospective policybuyers and insurance agents. Attained age rating deceives the average Medigap purchaser into purchasing coverage which they may not be able to afford later in life. This bill only prohibits the sale of any more of those policies that Consumer Reports correctly described as bait and trap policies.  The Medigap Consumer Protection Act will not force insurance carriers out of business. Under current law, insurance carriers must meet loss ratio requirements of 65 percent for the individual market and 75 percent for the group market. Loss ratios represent how much an insurance company must spend on benefits for each dollar it collects in premiums. For instance, a carrier selling Medigap policies to individuals must offer an average of at least 65 cents in benefits for each dollar it collects in premiums. This bill will still allow insurance carriers to clear up to 35 cents on each dollar in premiums they collect.  I hope that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join me in cosponsoring the Medigap Consumer Protection Act and in working toward its enactment so we can help seniors retain affordable, private Medigap coverage as they grow older. This legislation simply eliminates a type of policy that ropes seniors into policies with deceptively low initial premiums followed by sharp increases when those consumers may no longer have the option of switching to a competing policy.                          ____________________
