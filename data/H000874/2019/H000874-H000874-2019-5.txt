 Madam Speaker, I have had the honor of serving in this House for over 38 years. I have served during six Presidencies. I have been here through moments of tremendous progress and terrible tragedy. I have seen periods of rank partnership and patriotic bipartisanship. I have seen our two-party system work, and I have seen it break down.  Never in all my years of serving in this great institution that I love and the people of my district did I ever expect to encounter such an obvious wrongdoing by a President of the United States, nor did I expect to witness such a craven rationalization of Presidential actions which have put our national security at risk, undermined the integrity of our elections, and defined the constitutional authority of the Congress to conduct oversight.  We have heard from Republicans that this impeachment really has to do with policy differences or how we feel personally about the President, about his temperament or that we simply dislike him.  Throughout the Trump Presidency, Democrats have resisted pursuing impeachment even as we watched with dismay and disgust at a pattern of wrongdoing. That pattern included:  Ordering Federal agencies to lie to the public;  Firing the FBI Director for refusing to end investigations of his campaign;  Siding with Vladimir Putin against our intelligence agencies;  Taking funding away from the military to put towards an ineffective border wall; and  Setting policies that have led to the separation of families and caging of children.  We have, to be sure, deep disagreements with the policies and actions taken by this President.
