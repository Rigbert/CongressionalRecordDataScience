Speaker, it is with the greatest pleasure that I pay tribute to an exceptionally dedicated, compassionate, and distinguished member of Indiana's First Congressional District, Mr. J. Donald Leek, of Gary, Indiana. After serving as the School City of Gary's Athletic Director for twenty-seven years, Don will retire on June 30, 1998. Upon completion of his last day, Don will be honored in Gary's Marquette Park with a final, formal salute for his service, effort, and dedication.  A 1947 graduate of Roosevelt High School, Don was a phenomenal athlete and an excellent student. In addition to his four varsity letters in football and three in track, his outstanding efforts earned him Roosevelt's Most Outstanding Athlete award in 1947. In addition to these honors, Don was the city's low and high hurdler champion in 1946 and 1947, 1947 state runner-up in the high hurdles, and a member of the Panthers' 1947 state championship 880 relay team. Continuing his excellence in track, Don attended North Carolina Central University, where he was his school's conference champion in the low hurdles in 1950 and 1951, and the 60-yard high hurdles champion at the Junior National Indoor Track and Field Meet in New York City in 1950. Upon graduating from NCCU in 1951, Don was inducted into the Air Force and spent the next two years serving his country.  After being Honorably Discharged as a First Lieutenant in 1953, he returned to Roosevelt where he began his coaching career in both football and track. Don's success as a track star contributed to his coaching ability, which helped him direct his teams to nine city championships, nine sectional championships, seven regional titles, and five state championships. In recognition of his coaching successes, Don was named the 1962 Coach of the Year by the Indiana High School Track Coaches Association. Don was also honored as Indiana High School Athletic Director of the year in 1975, and he was inducted into the Indiana Association of Track and Cross Country Hall of Fame in 1974.  Though extremely dedicated to his work as a coach and athletic director, Don selflessly gives his free time and energy to his community, his education, and most importantly, his family. Don is a life member of the NAACP, as well as the Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity. He also volunteers for the Gary YMCA, is a member of the Indiana High School Athletic Directors Association, and served as President of the CivilRights Hall of Fame Games. In addition to his degree from North Carolina Central University, Don graduated with an M.S. degree from Indiana University in 1967 and earned an advanced degree from Purdue University in 1976. Don, now seventy years old, plans to continue his daily regimen of walking at least two miles every morning. He also wants to spend more time with his wife, Barbara, their two daughters, Sandra and Cynthia, and his stepson, Cromwell O'Brien.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in commending Don Leeks for his lifetime of service, leadership, and rededication to Gary and Northwest Indiana. Don's efforts as Athletic Director for the School City of Gary are legendary as one tool among many serving to help students stay motivated in the classroom. Don has rewarded the people of his community with true leadership and uncompromising dedication.                          ____________________
