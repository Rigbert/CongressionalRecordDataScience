  No. 1, ExxonMobil, the largest oil company in the world. In 2009, ExxonMobil made $19 billion in profits, and not only did ExxonMobil avoid paying any Federal income taxes that year, they actually received a $156 million rebate from the IRS, according to its SEC filings. Well, do you think maybe we might want to ask ExxonMobil to pay a little in taxes so we do not have to throw children off their health insurance? Maybe.  Bank of America. Last year, Bank of America, the largest bank in America, received a $1.9 billion tax refund from the IRS even though it made $4.4 billion in profits and just a couple of years ago received a bailout from the Federal Reserve in the Treasury Department of nearly $1 trillion. Well, what do you know about that? We are bailing out the largest banks in this country, whose greed caused the recession, and then they get a rebate from the IRS rather than paying any taxes. Yet our Republican friends think the solution to deficit reduction is not to ask Bank of America to pay its fair share but to end Medicare as we know it and force low-income seniors to pay substantially more for their health care.  No. 3, General Electric. Over the past 5 years, while General Electric made $26 billion in profits in the United States, it received a $4.1 billion refund from the IRS. I do not know. What do you think? Do you think we should ask GE maybe to help us out just a little bit with deficit reduction?  Chevron, a major oil company, received a $19 million refund from the IRS after it made $10 billion in profits.  Last year, Boeing, which received a $30 billion contract from the Pentagon to build 179 airborne tankers, got a $124 million refund from the IRS.  And on and on it goes.  Valero Energy.  Goldman Sachs. In 2008, Goldman Sachs paid only 1.1 percent of its income in taxes even though it earned a profit of $2.3 billion. Gee, most Americans would be pretty happy to pay 1.1 percent of their income in taxes. But then again, they are not Goldman Sachs.  Citigroup, ConocoPhillips, Carnival Cruise Lines.  On and on and on. You have large, extremely profitable corporations that either pay nothing in taxes or get a rebate from the IRS. Maybe--just maybe--when we talk about deficit reduction, we might want to ask those people to help us out rather than go after the elderly, the sick, the children, and the poor.  Large corporations today are sitting on a recordbreaking $2 trillion in cash. The problem is not that corporations are taxed too much; the problem is that consumers do not have enough money to buy their products, and the Republican agenda would make that far worse. Corporate tax revenue last year was down by 27 percent compared to 2000 even though corporate profits are up 60 percent over the last decade. These guys make more and more money; their contribution to the Treasury goes down.  When we talk about how we can--in a fair way, in a responsible way--deal with our deficit and our national debt, man, here is one very clear example, as shown in this picture. Here you have, in the Cayman Islands, a building. I think it is a four-story building, and it looks like a normal-size four-story building. Yet it has 18,857 companies that call this building their home. Now, one of two things is going on: Either these guys are very, very crowded--18,000 corporations in this one four-story building; maybe they are very crowded, and we should call in the zoning people in the Cayman Islands to check that out--or maybe something else is going on. Of course, what is going on is this is a total, absolute fraud. This is a building that does not house anybody. It is a phony address that 18,000-plus corporations use for the explicit purpose of not paying taxes to the United States of America.  There are studies out there which suggest that large corporations and wealthy individuals are avoiding $100 billion in taxes every year by setting up these offshore tax shelters in the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, and the Bahamas. Maybe, maybe, maybe, before we tell young people they cannot go to college or single moms they cannot get childcare for their kids or low-income seniors we are going to cut back on their nutrition, maybe, just maybe, we might want to end this blatant outrage, which costs us $100 billion every single year.  In 2005, one out of four large corporations paid no income taxes at all eventhough they collected $1.1 trillion in revenue. What about looking there for revenue? Our Republican friends say: Oh, no, no, no. We can't do that. We have to force elderly people to pay more in Medicare, throw kids off Medicaid.  Now, what is a very interesting point--and, frankly, we are all politicians. You do not get elected to the Senate if you do not understand something about politics. What I do not understand--and certainly what President Obama needs to understand--is that the overwhelming majority of the American people do not agree with the Republican approach, which says: Give tax breaks to billionaires and go after the elderly, the sick, the children, and the poor. That is not just Bernie Sanders talking. I am not much into polls, to be honest with you, but I think it is important to just try to get a little bit of a reflection of where the American people are coming from.  According to a recent Boston Globe poll--a couple weeks ago, the Boston Globe did a poll in the State of New Hampshire and was mostly interested in the Presidential campaign, how Presidential candidates are doing in New Hampshire, but they asked some other questions. In New Hampshire--I know because they are a neighbor of mine--they are the big antitax State. They are the conservative State in New England. Here is what the folks in New Hampshire said in that recent poll.  Seventy-three percent support raising taxes on people making over $250,000 a year, 78 percent oppose cutting Medicare, 71 percent oppose cutting Medicaid, and 76 percent oppose cutting Social Security.  The Republican approach is the opposite. They want to cut Medicare, they want to cut Medicaid, they want to cut Social Security, and they certainly do not want to ask the wealthiest people in this country to pay a nickel more in taxes.  That is one poll. Let's look at another poll. In fact, poll after poll has more or less mirrored what New Hampshire voters are saying.  A recent NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll found the following: 81 percent of the American people believe it is totally acceptable or mostly acceptable--that is how they frame these polls--to impose a surtax on millionaires to reduce the deficit. Let me repeat that. Eighty-one percent of the American people--in the Wall Street Journal-NBC poll--think it is totally acceptable or mostly acceptable to impose a surtax on millionaires to reduce the deficit.  Eighty-one percent of the American people think it is a good idea. Yet we cannot get one Republican to ask the wealthy to pay a nickel more in taxes. Talk about being out of touch with what the American people want.  Seventy four-percent--in that same poll--of the American people believe it is totally acceptable or mostly acceptable to eliminate tax credits for the oil and gas industry, and on and on it goes.  Seventy-six percent believe it is totally unacceptable or mostly unacceptable to cut Medicare to significantly reduce the deficit.  Here is an interesting poll that maybe some of my Republican friends want to pay attention to; that is, that while the leaders of the tea party here in Washington are fighting to dismantle Medicare and Medicaid, it turns out that in another poll done by McClatchy, 70 percent of those people who identify themselves with the tea party oppose cutting Medicare and Medicaid to reduce the deficit. That is the tea party.  Here is the last poll I wish to highlight. There are many more out there. It was done by the Washington Post and ABC News. Here is what that poll says. It says 72 percent of Americans support rising taxes on incomes over $250,000 to reduce the national debt, including 91 percent of Democrats, 68 percent of Independents, and 54 percent of Republicans.  So here you have in Congress, surrounded by lobbyists and powerful special interests, a Congress heavily dominated by large campaign contributors, of Members of the Senate moving in exactly the opposite direction of where the American people want to go. The American people want shared sacrifice. The American people believe that when the wealthiest people in this country are doing phenomenally well and the gap between the rich and everybody else is growing wider, yes, the wealthiest people have to contribute to deficit reduction.  The American people believe we have corporations making recordbreaking profits and not paying a nickel in taxes. Yes, they have to start paying taxes. The American people overwhelmingly believe it is bad for this country to go after Medicare and Medicaid and programs that working families desperately depend upon.  Instead of listening to millionaires and billionaires, it is time for our leaders in Washington to start listening to the overwhelming majority of the American people who do want the wealthiest people in this country and the most profitable corporations to contribute to deficit reduction. It is time for shared sacrifice.  The middle class, the elderly, the sick, the children, and the poor have already sacrificed enough. It is time for those people on top, the people who are doing extremely well, to also understand they are Americans, they are part of our country, and they have to contribute to deficit reduction. The fact is, moving toward deficit reduction in a way that is fair is not as complicated as some would have us believe. In fact, if you are not beholden to Wall Street, large corporations and wealthy campaign contributors and you are not frightened about the number of 30-second ads that may be thrown at you if you take these guys on, it is quite easy.  I know there are many people out there of good faith who have different ideas about how we can move forward toward a balanced budget, toward deficit reduction. I am not saying I have all the answers. But let me just give you a few examples, a few examples as to how we can reduce the deficit by more than $4 trillion over the next decade, and that includes, of course, asking the wealthy and large corporations to begin paying their fair share of taxes and does not do undue harm for ordinary Americans.  We can do it. We can do it. If you are concerned about deficit reduction, I am concerned about deficit reduction. But we can do it, calling for shared sacrifice and in a way that does not attack programs that millions and millions of children, elderly, and working families are terribly dependent upon.  Let me just give you a few ideas. I know other people have other good ideas. First, we simply repeal the Bush tax breaks for the top 2 percent. We can raise at least $700 billion over the next decade. That is it. The rich are getting richer. Bush gave them huge tax breaks. You repeal that, $700 billion.  I know some of my Republican friends say: Oh, my goodness. If you do not give tax breaks to the very wealthy, it will have a negative impact on jobs. This is the trickle-down economic theory. You give tax breaks to the rich, large corporations, and we create all kinds of great jobs. That idea has been tested. That idea was tested. That was the idea of former President George W. Bush. But during his 8 years as President, when that idea was in effect, the private sector lost--lost--over 600,000 jobs, and we had one of the worst economic decades, in terms of job creation, ever seen in this country. We tried that theory. We did give tax breaks to the rich and large corporations, and we lost 600,000 jobs during that 10-year period.  Meanwhile, when Bill Clinton raised taxes on the top 2 percent, you know what. The world did not quite cave in. In fact, during Clinton's Presidency, we created over 22 million jobs, and he left office with a huge budget surplus. But that is just one argument. You heard polls say we should impose a surtax on millionaires. The vast majority of the American people believe that. If you did a 5.4-percent surtax on millionaires and billionaires, that would raise $383 billion over 10 years.  You want another idea? At a time when our manufacturing sector is collapsing, when 50,000 factories have shut down in the last 10 years, when millions of workers have lost good-paying jobs, the U.S. Government continues to reward companies that move U.S. manufacturing jobs overseas through loopholes in the Tax Code known as deferral and foreign source income.  That, clearly, from a financial point of view, in terms of revenue to our government, as well as policies which result in the loss of millions of good manufacturing jobs, is not something we should sustain. If we ended that absurdity, that policy alone, the JointTax Committee has estimated we could raise more than $582 billion in revenue over the next 10 years. So what about that--$582 billion of revenue and we stop the outsourcing of jobs so maybe we can rebuild our manufacturing sector. Sounds to me like a pretty sensible idea.  My Republican friends think it is a better idea to throw poor children off Medicaid or force elderly people to pay far more than they can afford for Medicare. But ending this absurd policy, which encourages companies to throw American workers out on the street, makes a lot more sense to me than what the Republicans are talking about.  Fourth, if we ended tax breaks and subsidies for big oil and gas companies, we can reduce the deficit by more than $40 billion over the next 10 years.  Fifth, if we prohibited abusive and illegal offshore tax shelters--what I just talked about a moment ago--we could bring in $1 trillion over 10 years. That says to the corporations and the wealthy: Sorry, you are no longer going to be able to stash your wealth in the Cayman Islands and avoid paying taxes.  Sixth, if we established a Wall Street speculation fee of less than 1 percent on the sale and purchase of credit default swaps, derivatives, stock options and futures, we could reduce the deficit by more than $100 billion over the next decade and also--also--tell Wall Street we are not going to tolerate their outrageous behavior which led us into this recession in the first place. We are going to try to get a handle on their speculation.  Seventh, if we tax capital gains and dividends the same way we tax work, ordinary work, we can raise more than $730 billion over the next decade. Why should somebody who clips dividend coupons pay a substantially lower tax rate than somebody who is out working on our streets or is a nurse or is a teacher? Warren Buffett has often said he pays a lower effective tax rate than his secretary. Today, the effective tax rate of the wealthiest 400 Americans is just 18 percent, the lowest on record.  On and on. We have a number of ideas out there, not the least of which is taking a hard look at the military. There are debates as to how much we can cut, but certainly we should all be in agreement that it no longer makes sense to sustain weapons systems that were built in order to fight the Cold War against the Soviet Union. They are not our enemy right now.  I can tell you that I, my office, requested a GAO report that found that the Pentagon had $36.9 billion in spare parts it does not need and which are collecting dust in government warehouses. We can do better than that. Frankly, in my view--I think I speak for the majority of the people in my State of Vermont, I suspect, in this country--it is time to begin bringing the troops home from Iraq and Afghanistan at an accelerated rate. We have been in Afghanistan now for 10 years. It is time for the Afghan people and their military to take responsibility, in terms of defeating the Taliban. We should be supportive of those efforts. But we should bring our troops home a lot sooner than the President has suggested. When we do that, among other things, we are also going to save a substantial sum of money.  Further, I will not deny for one second that there is waste and fraud and bureaucracy in almost every government program out there. I think we have to take a hard look at them all. I believe that in addition to the Pentagon, we can save hundreds of billions of dollars a year by eliminating unnecessary bureaucracy.  The ideas I have enumerated, and some I have not but which will become part of the Record, if we did all or some of these things, we could easily reduce the deficit by well over $4 trillion over the next decade, if not, in fact, much more. It would be done in a way that is fair, and it would not unnecessarily and needlessly ruin the lives of some of the most desperate and fragile and hurting people in our country today, millions of people who are just struggling to make ends meet. Those people would be spared.  The extreme rightwing agenda of more tax breaks for the wealthy, paid by the dismantling of Medicare, Medicaid, education, nutrition, and the environment, may be popular in the country clubs and cocktail parties of the wealthy and the powerful, but it is way out of touch with what the overwhelming majority of Americans want.  As you know, late last week Congressman Cantor, the Republican majority leader in the House, and Senator Jon Kyl, the Republican whip, walked out of the budget negotiations being led by Vice President Biden. The reason they walked out was pretty clear. They were not willing to close one single loophole in the Tax Code that allows the wealthy and large corporations to avoid paying taxes by stashing their money in the Cayman Islands and all the other loopholes that currently exist.  My sincere hope is that President Obama will use this Republican walkout, their unwillingness to talk about the wealthy and large corporations contributing anything toward deficit reduction--that he will use this as an opportunity to rally the American people and make it clear he will never support Republican demands to move toward a balanced budget solely on the backs of working families, the elderly, the children, the sick, and the poor. But I don't think the President will do it unless the American people send him a message that enough is enough.  The American people do not support the Republican agenda. The American people support the concept of shared sacrifice as we move toward deficit reduction. But the President has to hear from the American people. He has to hear that they will not accept decimating Medicare, Medicaid, Pell grants, education, and the environment in order to give more tax breaks to the wealthy. The President has to stand up for the millions of Americans who have seen their homes, their jobs, and their savings vanish, instead of the millionaires who have never had it so good.  It is my belief if the American people make that demand of the President and tell the President not to yield on this issue, we can win this budget struggle. If people would like to sign it--and I hope they would--we have a letter to the President, which I will read in a moment, on my Web site, sanders.senate.gov--and, also, as I mentioned earlier, they can contact the White House directly by going straight through the White House Web site and sending a message.  If hundreds of thousands of people do that, the President, I hope, will have the strength and determination to say to the Republicans: Sorry, we are not going to balance the budget on the weak and the vulnerable.  This is the letter that is on my Web site, which I hope the people will sign. This is what it says, which encapsulates much of what I have been saying for the last hour:       Dear Mr. President,       This is a pivotal moment in the history of our country.      Decisions are being made about the national budget that will      impact the lives of virtually every American for decades to      come. As we address the issue of deficit reduction, we must      not ignore the painful economic reality of today--which is      that the wealthiest people in our country and the largest      corporations are doing phenomenally well, while the middle      class is collapsing and poverty is increasing. In fact, the      United States today has, by far, the most unequal      distribution of wealth and income of any major country on      earth.       Everyone understands that over the long term we have got to      reduce the deficit--a deficit that was caused mainly by Wall      Street greed, tax breaks for the rich, two wars, and a      prescription drug program written by the drug and insurance      companies. It is absolutely imperative, however, that as we      go forward with deficit reduction, we completely reject the      Republican approach that demands savage cuts in desperately      needed programs for working families, the elderly, the sick,      our children, and the poor, while not asking the wealthiest      among us to contribute one penny.       Mr. President, please listen to the overwhelming majority      of the American people who believe that deficit reduction      must be about shared sacrifice. The wealthiest Americans and      the most profitable corporations in this country must pay      their fair share. At least 50 percent of any deficit      reduction package must come from revenue raised by ending tax      breaks for the wealthy and eliminating tax loopholes that      benefit large, profitable corporations and Wall Street      financial institutions. A sensible deficit reduction package      must also include significant cuts to unnecessary and      wasteful Pentagon spending.       Please do not yield to outrageous Republican demands that      would greatly increase suffering for the weakest and most      vulnerable members of our society. Now is the time to stand      with tens of millions of Americans who are struggling to      survive economically, not with the millionaires and      billionaires who have never had it so good.       Respectfully yours.  That letter is at sanders.senate.gov. I think we have many thousands of signatures on that letter already. I hope we can get more. If people prefer to go to the White House Web site, they can do that. That would be important. The main point is that the President has to know that we will not accept a deficit reduction package that just comes out heavily on working families.  The reason I raise these issues today is that I am, frankly, very worried because we have gone through this negotiating process two times in the last 6 months. That is why we need the American people to weigh in on this issue.  In fact, we have seen this movie before. The Republicans, led by their extreme right wing, have been successful in getting their way because of their refusal to compromise and willingness to hold the credit and economic security of the American people hostage.  As many people will remember, in December the Republican leadership was prepared to hold the middle-class tax cuts and unemployment benefits hostage in order to extend the Bush tax breaks to the top 2 percent. As we all know, the Republicans won. As a result, over $200 billion was added to the deficit over the next 2 years. Not only did the Bush tax breaks for the wealthy get extended, they also got a reduction in the estate tax which benefits the top three-tenths of 1 percent.  Specifically, the December tax cut agreement extended the Bush income tax rates, and it cost us very substantially.  It is not just the Bush tax cuts that were extended. In March of this year our Republican friends said that unless we made very significant cuts, the Republicans were prepared to shut down the government, disrupt the economy, and deny paychecks to some 800,000 Federal workers--if they could not get their way. They said: We are going to shut down the government unless you make these Draconian cuts.  One of the cuts I was disturbed about--among many--was $600 million to build new community health centers, which would keep people alive and end up saving money. There are other Draconian cuts, as well. They also cut Pell grants, making it harder for students to go to college. The point is, they acted as bullies and said: If we don't get our way, we are prepared to shut down the government.  Now we are back here again, and this is part 3 of the act. Part 1 was whether the middle class would get its tax breaks and whether unemployment benefits would be extended. The Republicans won. Part 2 is whether the government would be shut down. The Republicans mostly won and got almost everything they wanted.  Here we are, act 3, the biggest act of all; and the question is whether the Republicans will, in fact, not raise the debt ceiling. If they do that, it is quite possible that not only our country but the entire world might be plunged into a major financial crisis.  This is what they are threatening: If we don't get everything we want, we are prepared not to pay our government's debt for the first time in the history of our country. We are prepared to see interest rates go up in a very fragile global economy. And we are prepared to see more and more instability.  In many ways, the Republicans in Washington are acting like schoolyard bullies. As we know, bullying is a very serious problem in our schools. Every educator worth his or her salt would tell us that when dealing with a bully, we must not give in to their tactics or tolerate their temper tantrums or allow them to hurt innocent people. We have to deal with them sternly and consistently. We cannot allow them to win by dictating the rules of the game and trampling over everybody else if they don't get their way.  We have a serious debt problem that must be solved, but it must be solved in a way that is fair and in a way that calls for shared sacrifice.  Let me conclude by suggesting that the American people are concerned about the deficit. They are also concerned about the economy, and they are also concerned that so many of our people--of all ages, in all parts of this country--are hanging on economically by their fingernails.  The American people understand that it is just not fair at all to come down on people who are already hurting and leave unscathed the wealthiest people in this country and large profitable corporations.  What I say today to the President of the United States is this: Mr. President, stand tall. Do not yield to Republican blackmail. Stand with the vast majority of the American people who believe that deficit reduction requires shared sacrifice--that everybody makes a sacrifice, not just working families, the elderly, the sick, and the poor.  With that, I yield the floor.                          ____________________
