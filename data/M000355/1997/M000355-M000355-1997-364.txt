 President, I thank my distinguished colleague from New Mexico for an outstanding speech. I think he is right on the mark. The issue here is who is going to control political discourse in this country. And the Supreme Court has said no one may do that. That is protected first amendment speech.  I just wish to thank my good friend from New Mexico for his thoughts on the first amendment and say I agree with him entirely.
