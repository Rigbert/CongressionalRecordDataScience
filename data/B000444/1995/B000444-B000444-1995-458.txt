 DOLE. It is like making sausage out here.  It may be we can work it out. I do not see much problem with the Kerrey amendment. We might be able to accept that with some modification. But we want to finish the bill. I promised the President we would finish it before Memorial Day. I like to keep my word. That was not possible. But the President did not know it was not possible and he said some things I did not like.  So I am going to finish this bill. If I do not finish the bill it will not be my fault. Because we could not get cloture or we could not get cooperation on the other side. That is his side, not my side. We are ready. We are ready to do habeas corpus and have final passage before 6 o'clock. That would be an antiterrorism bill. All these other things are going to be around here a long time, this year and next year. We can offer all the amendments we wish. This came to us as an emergency. This was an emergency. We were all called to the White House. We do not do this on every bill.  This is very important to the President of the United States. He has been to Oklahoma City. He saw the need. He met with the Attorney General. He met with leaders of Congress and said, ``Let's do it.'' We did not say let us see how many amendments we can offer, who can outpoint each other, make some political points on some issue, whatever it might be. That is what we are about to get into here, and I do not think I want to be any part of that. I want to try to keep my word to the President. If we cannot, we cannot. We will do the best we can. I think he will understand. If he does not understand, I will write him a letter. But that is the way it goes.
