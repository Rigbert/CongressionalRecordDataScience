 President, the Senate's newest Member is coming down from Massachusetts today. We will have a chance to welcome Senator-elect Brown to the Capitol. Obviously, we are delighted to have him.  Senator-elect Brown has captured the attention of the entire country, but he has captured the attention of Massachusetts voters first. The people of Massachusetts sent a very strong message. They were looking for someone who would help change the direction in Washington. They put their hope in the candidate whose views reflected the kind of change they were looking for.  So we welcome Senator-elect Brown to the Senate, and we look forward to working with him to bring about the change that Americans are telling us they want. We need to show them we are listening.                          ____________________
