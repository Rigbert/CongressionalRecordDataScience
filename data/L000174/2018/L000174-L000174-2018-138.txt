. Senator, and most importantly, a dear friend of mine. Dan passed away recently after 93 years of life imbued with the aloha spirit, and I have been reflecting on his legacy of quiet but effective work in the Senate.  Dan Akaka was a tireless advocate for indigenous people. As I was working on the 2013 reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, his cooperation and persistence as chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee helped include important provisions to protect Native-American women from violence. He also worked hard to support vital programs that provided education, healthcare, housing, and other basic services for Tribes across the country.  A World War II veteran himself, Dan was a strong supporter of the National Guard. He was one the first cosponsors to support my National Guard Empowerment Act and give the Guard the representation that it deserved. He will also be remembered for fighting to have the valor and sacrifice of Asian-American soldiers in World War II recognized, sponsoring legislation that awarded long overdue Medals of Honor to those who had been discriminated against because of their race.  Hawaiians were lucky to have him as a champion in the Senate, and I was lucky to have him as a friend.  I ask unanimous consent that the New York Times article ``Daniel Akaka, Former Democratic Senator From Hawaii, Dies At 93'' be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, Apr. 6, 2018]    Daniel Akaka, Former Democratic Senator From Hawaii, Dies at 93                            (By Adam Clymer)       Former Senator Daniel K. Akaka, a Democrat who represented      Hawaii for 36 years in Congress and successfully fought for      the belated recognition of Asians and Asian-Americans who had      fought for the United States in World War II, died on Friday      in Honolulu. He was 93.       Jon Yoshimura, the senator's former communications      director, confirmed the death, saying Mr. Akaka had been      hospitalized for several months, The Associated Press      reported.       A World War II veteran, Mr. Akaka sponsored legislation in      1996 that led to a re-evaluation of the service records of      Asian-Americans who had fought in the 442nd Regimental Combat      Team and the 100th Infantry Battalion during the war.       As a result, almost two dozen Medals of Honor, the      military's highest award, were ultimately bestowed belatedly,      some posthumously, on Asian-American veterans, most of them      of Japanese heritage. Only one had been awarded during the      war itself.       After a White House awards-presentation ceremony led by      President Bill Clinton in 2000, Senator Akaka said the medals      had dispelled apparent wartime discrimination against Asian-     American military personnel.       The most prominent recipient was Senator Daniel K. Inouye,      Mr. Akaka's much better-known colleague--and Hawaii's senior      senator--for 22 years in the Senate. Mr. Inouye, who died in      2012, had lost his right arm while serving with the 442nd in      Europe.       Senator Akaka also successfully pursued legislation that      provided onetime compensation for members of the Phillipine      Scouts, an American-led unit of mostly Filipino and Filipino-     American recruits who fought alongside United States troops      but did not qualify for Veterans Administration benefits.       And he secured a formal apology for the United States's      role in the overthrow of Queen Lili'uokalani of Hawaii in      1893 as well as a transfer of land that the federal      government had taken.       But he failed in repeated legislative efforts to have      native Hawaiians recognized as an indigenous people so that      they might receive federal benefits similar to those provided      to American Indians and natives of Alaska.       During his Senate years Mr. Akaka had stints as chairman of      its Committee on Veterans Affairs and of its Committee on      Indian Affairs.       Mr. Akaka was an outspoken critic of the war in Iraq. On      March 17, 2003, three days before the United States attacked      that country, he warned the Senate:       ``If we pursue our current path, we will have a war lacking      in many things essential to achieving complete success. It      will be a war without broad international support, without      sufficient planning for post-conflict reconstruction and      stability, without a definite exit time and strategy, and      without a firm price tag.       ``Moreover,'' he continued, ``it will be a war with serious      ramifications for our long-term readiness capabilities for      homeland security and for managing other crises.''       A steadfast liberal on most issues, he was known as a      champion of federal workers, complaining that his Senate      colleagues too often denigrated them and cheerfully froze      their pay.       He chaired a Senate subcommittee on the federal work force      and was the chief sponsor of the 2012 Whistleblower      Protection Act, which provided safeguards against retaliation      to federal workers who report waste, fraud and abuse.       Daniel Kahikina Akaka was born in Honolulu on Sept. 11,      1924, the youngest of eight children. His father was of      Chinese and Hawaiian descent; his mother was Hawaiian. He      attended public schools.       After service with the Army Corps of Engineers, he      graduated from the University of Hawaii in 1952 with a degree      in education and taught music, social studies and math in      elementary, middle and high schools. He later became a school      principal and earned a master's degree.       After Hawaii was admitted into the union in 1959, he was an      official in the state's Department of Education and was named      director of the Hawaii Office of Economic Opportunity, an      antipoverty program.       Mr. Akaka was first elected to the House in 1976 and easily      re-elected afterward. In 1990 he was appointed to fill a      Senate vacancy caused by the death of Spark Matsunaga. He was      elected that fall and re-elected in 1994, 2000 and 2006. He      announced in March 2011 that he would not run again in 2012.       Mr. Akaka, who lived in Honolulu, is survived by his wife,      Mary Mildred Chong, whom he married in 1948; a daughter,      Millannie Akaka Mattson; four sons, Daniel Jr., Gerard, Alan      and Nicholas; and many grandchildren and great-grandchildren.       While he was never known as a key lawmaker, Mr. Akaka was      familiar to watchers of C-Span: his name came first whenever      the Senate roll was called and, in his early years, he      relished presiding over that body, a duty many of his      colleagues regarded as tedious.       In 1992, the Senate presented him with its Golden Gavel      Award for presiding for at least 100 hours.       ``I really was proud of being able to chair the Senate      floor over the years and really looked forward to it,'' he      said in a 2011 interview for this obituary.       Even in his final years, he left instructions with the      Democratic cloakroom that he would preside in a pinch,      saying, ``Any time you can't find somebody, call me.''                          ____________________
