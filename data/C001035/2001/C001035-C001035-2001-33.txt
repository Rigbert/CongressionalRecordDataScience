President, before I speak to the pending amendment, I want to commend the two leaders of our committee. I joined this committee in January, and they have worked very hard in the last week to come up with a bill that would unify this body. So I want to commend both Senator Levin and Senator Warner for their tremendous efforts in producing a bill that will help bring us together and ensure we are providing the resources and the authority for the important task before us. I praise them and thank them for their efforts.  I commend the Senator from Kentucky for his amendment. I rise in strong opposition to the provisions in our bill known as the base realignment and closure, or BRAC, proposal. I opposed this proposal in committee, and I continue to oppose it today. In fact, I think the reasons for opposition are even more compelling than they were at the time of our committee markup. After the September 11 attacks on America, I question, with even more certainty, the decision to proceed with additional cuts in our base infrastructure.  As the result of the first 4 BRAC rounds, 97 military bases in the United States have been or are in the process of being closed, degrading our defense readiness according to some military experts.  In light of the recent terrorist attacks on our homeland, and based on the testimony provided by the Chief of Naval Operations before the Senate Armed Services Committee when Admiral Clark recently cautioned that the Navy's infrastructure is already at barebones, now is simply not the time, it is simply not in our country's best interests, to initiate yet another round of base closures.  At a time when our Commander in Chief has warned of a long and sustained military operation, we should be preserving, not eroding, our facilities and infrastructure, so that they are fully available for our Armed Forces both at home and abroad. It is the responsibility of this Congress to ensure that these installations are not placed at risk without careful, prudent consideration of the additional military requirements, particularly with regard to homeland defense, that are evolving as a result of the recent horrific attacks on our Nation. It is also clear that our ongoing peacekeeping and humanitarian missions require a greater force structure than had been expected. Our war on terrorism will most likely require a greater one still. In short, it is difficult to conceive of a worse time for the Pentagon to divert its energies to another round of base closures.  Before we legislate a defense-wide policy that will reduce the size and number of training areas critical to our force readiness, the Department of Defense needs time to complete its comprehensive plan identifying the operational and maintenance infrastructure required to support national security requirements, particularly in light of the challenge to come. Before we know what to cut, we need to know what to keep. It is that simple. I fear we are approaching the issue of excess capacity exactly backwards. As Secretary Rumsfeld acknowledged in his recent letter to the committee, our future needs as to base structure are uncertain and our strategy dependent.  I make it clear I understand the Secretary still wants to proceed with base closures, but his own letter says very clearly that our future needs as to base structure are uncertain. Shouldn't we determine what our infrastructure needs are before embarking on a wholenew round of closing bases? Wouldn't that be the better, more logical way to proceed?  Further, while those who support BRAC hope for substantial savings from base closures, the one consequence you can count on when a base is closed is the need for a significant upfront investment.  A recent GAO report released in July of this year underscores how costly base closures can be and how ephemeral the savings estimates may be. The loose estimates of supposed savings, for example, exclude over $1.2 billion in costs of Federal assistance provided to affected communities. These are costs paid by the Federal Government but not out of the BRAC budget accounts. Some $10.4 billion in environmental cleanup costs were the direct result of the first four BRAC rounds. We ought to be doing a better job of environmental cleanup at our bases, whether they are open or closed. However, we can't ignore these significant costs. These are considerable costs which only continue to grow, often not counted, as costs associated with closing bases.  There is another more fundamental reason I oppose the BRAC language in this bill. Simply stated, BRAC is the wrong process for identifying bases for closure. If the Pentagon believes certain bases are no longer needed, those installations should be identified and included in DOD's budget submission. There is no need to cast a cloud of uncertainty over every base in virtually every community hosting a base all across this great Nation.  Senator Snowe and I can testify personally that BRAC is not the clinical, impartial process it is often made out to be. Rather, the BRAC process in the past has been highly politicized and it remains susceptible to political pressure in its current form in this bill. While I recognize the need to reduce proven excess capacity, the BRAC procedure has been unfair in the past. It has not produced the savings anticipated by past rounds of closures, and it could at a critical time result in degraded readiness for our Armed Forces.  I will continue, therefore, to voice my strong opposition to another round of base closures. I will continue to work to ensure that critical assets and training capacities provided by our existing force structure and infrastructure are not lost.  Now is certainly not the time to create chaos, concern, in every community that has proudly hosted a military installation. Now is certainly not the time to embark on another round of base closures, when all of the energies of our civilian and military leaders must be focused on the overriding goal of crushing the global network of terrorists intent on harming our great Nation and its citizens.  I urge support for the amendment of the Senator from Kentucky.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Durbin). The Senator from Arizona.  Mr. McCAIN. I intend to speak at greater length later on on this issue. It is very clear, the opinion of Members of this body, including those just articulated by the Senator from Maine who, among other things, said there has been no savings, when we have ample documentation that they have achieved net savings of $15 billion by the end of this fiscal year from the previous base closure rounds, with another $6 billion in savings each and every year thereafter.  What we are really talking about is an opinion held in the Senate, which I respect, for which I have admiration, and I have great respect for the individuals who are opposing the base closing round. The fact is, at a time when we rally around the President of the United States and the Secretary of Defense and the men and women in the armed services, we are going in direct contravention to the views of the President of the United States, the Secretary of Defense, and our military and civilian leadership. It is that clear.  That is really what this debate is all about.  As the Secretary of Defense wrote on September 21, to Senator Carl Levin and Senator John Warner:        We owe it to all Americans--particularly those service      members on whom much of our response will depend--to seek      every efficiency in the application of those funds on behalf      of our warfighters.       Our installations are the platforms from which we will      deploy the forces needed for the sustained campaign the      President outlined last night. While our future needs as to      base structure are uncertain and are strategy dependent, we      simply must have the freedom to maximize the efficient use of      our resources.  Why is that? Earlier this year there was testimony before the Armed Services Committee by the people who are responsible for our installations. Do you know what they are saying?  ``We are in a slow death spiral,'' said Air Force MG Earnest Robbins II, the civil engineer for his service, who predicted the 2002 defense budget will include enough money only to handle the most pressing priorities.  The services have argued that the poor conditions of many facilities and the shortage of money to fix them are proof they must close unneeded bases.  What is going on here is, because we have so many bases, we don't have the funds to maintain not only their capabilities but the quality of life. The quality of life deteriorates when we do not maintain these facilities. Therefore, there is a requirement to close the unnecessary ones.  By the way, we will get into this argument about how you do it and whether it is politicized. I will submit for the Record and discuss, over time, clearly the fact that there is no other way to close bases. We went for many years until we came up with the Base Closing Commission.  But if you go out to any military facility, you will see that people have aging, not only installations at which they work but aging installations in which they live. It is because we simply have not enough money to go around to maintain all of these facilities.  So what does that translate into? Difficulties in recruiting, difficulties in retention. According to a study last year, the U.S. Army has had the greatest exodus of captains they have had in their history. What do they say? They say they do not put us in conditions in which we can live. We have men and women in the military living in barracks that were constructed in World War II and Korea.  An example of the problems, Robbins said, is at Travis Air Force Base, where routine operations on one runway had to be suspended because a 90-foot-long, 4- to 6-inch-wide crack has appeared.  The Navy has a $2.6 billion backlog in critically needed repairs, about the same as a year ago, because the budget did not include enough money to make up any ground, officials said. Navy people ``are so used to operating and living in inadequate facilities that many accept this as the norm.''  Should we be asking men and women in the military to be living in inadequate facilities and accepting it as the norm?  The carrier berth at Norfolk Naval Air Station is a prime example. Structural deterioration of the berth has forced access restrictions that allow only emergency vehicles to park near the ships.  Marine COL Michael Lehnert, assistant deputy commandant for installations and logistics, says his service does not even have enough money to assess problems at its bases.  Assess problems at its bases?       We are doing the right thing; we just aren't doing it fast      enough.  At Camp Pendleton, the base sewer system, which spilled 3 million gallons of sewage into the Santa Margarita River last year, needs to be replaced. But that would cost $179 million--more than the entire $173 million construction budget proposed by the Marine Corps for 2002.  ``The effects of underfunding only get worse as our facilities age,'' Army MG Robert Van Antwerp, Jr. said. He noted that the backlog has grown to $18.4 billion, a $600 million increase in 1 year.  We are asking these men and women to live and work in facilities that are, at best, substandard, in some cases absolutely abysmal, because we have too many of them. We have too many of them.  I will challenge the proponents of this amendment to find one military expert, active-duty or retired, who would not say we need to close unnecessary bases. I would like for the Senator from Maine to talk to GEN Schwarzkopf. He is a fairly well respected individual. I would like for her to hear all the former Chairmen of the Joints Chiefs of Staff. I would like for her to hear from all the experts onmilitary readiness. All these people unanimously, without exception, will say we have too many bases and we need to reduce those numbers of bases so we can be more efficient, but also we can take the limited assets that we have and put them into the bases that remain so the people there would have a lifestyle, both operationally and recreationally, and living-wise, that would give them the standard of living of most Americans outside the military.  That is all we are asking. The President of the United States needs the flexibility to be able to do that. I know the President feels strongly about this. I know the Secretary of Defense feels strongly about it. I know how the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff feels about it. But do you know who feels most strongly about it? The squadron commanders and base commanders at these installations where they see their men and women subjected to a lifestyle that is not satisfactory. It is not satisfactory. They know it, I know it, and everybody else knows it.  I believe if we take this base closing amendment out of this bill, we will send a signal, my friends, and the signal is: It is business as usual in the U.S. Congress. It is business as usual. We are not prepared to make the necessary sacrifices--even if it affects our State; a base closing commission can clearly affect my State--that are necessary to fight this war on terrorism.  The opening signal is business as usual, my friends. We will not even approve giving the Secretary of Defense the authority, through a base closing commission which, with one exception, has been an apolitical process.  I admit there were some politics around the base closing. We have fixed this. Senator Levin and I have fixed this with this amendment so that is not possible again. If anybody believes there can be any other process to eliminate these bases, then obviously the history of how we tried to do this in the past shows it doesn't work.  So I say this is a very important vote. It is even more important than whether we are going to have a base closing commission. This vote is really all about whether we are going to do business as usual and preserve our bases in our States, whether they are necessary or not, or whether we are going to have another commission so we can have the most efficient military machine to fight this long, protracted struggle, the opening salvo of which was fired on Tuesday, September 11. This is a very important vote.  I am glad to see the Secretary of Defense has made such a very strong statement, a very strong statement in support of this base closing commission. I hope the Members of this body will pay close attention to the views of the uniformed and civilian leadership of the U.S. military, including the President of the United States of America.  I yield the floor.
