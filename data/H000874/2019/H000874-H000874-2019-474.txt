 Since 1992, I have had the distinct honor of serving as a Co-Chair of the Congressional Fire Services Caucus. I have established friendships with many members of our nation's fire and emergency services throughout those years. I got to know Chief Compton well, attending the memorial service for fallen firefighters in Emmitsburg and the annual Congressional Fire Services Dinner together with him every year.  I know it was a difficult decision on his part to step down as the Chairman of the National Fallen Firefighters Board of Directors. Chief Compton has always cared deeply about the mission of the National Fallen Firefighters Foundation to honor our fallen heroes, provide support to their loved ones, and reduce the number of firefighter injuries and deaths. Even though he will no longer serve as Chairman, I know he will remain steadfast in his commitment to firefighter health and safety.  In his many different professional capacities, Chief Compton has shared his thoughts and knowledge with thousands of firefighters about the attributes of leadership, character, and integrity. These attributes define who he is as a friend and leader and have earned him many well-deserved distinctions and honors from his peers. Indeed, his legacy will be felt for many years to come in the countless men and women of the fire and emergency services who will carry out their work aimed with the lessons he imparted and will surely continue to impart in the years ahead.  I would also like to honor him for his dedication and commitment to our nation's firefighters, for his unwavering support for the family members of our fallen heroes, and for his many contributions to the bipartisan work of the Congressional Fire Services Caucus. Serving as a Co-Chair of the Congressional Fire Services Caucus, I have seen Chief Compton's tireless efforts up close.  Prior to his role as Chairman of the National Fallen Firefighters Board of Directors, Chief Compton served in the Phoenix Fire Department for twenty-eight years. He also served as Fire Chief in Mesa, Arizona, for six years. Chief Compton also served as Past Chairman of the Congressional Fire Services Institute (CFSI) National Advisory Council and Co-Chairman of the Fire Service-Based EMS Advocates Steering Committee.  Our nation's fire service owes Chief Compton a debt of gratitude. On behalf of my fellow Co-Chairs of the Congressional Fire Services Caucus, I extend my thanks and appreciation to Chief Dennis Compton for his outstanding leadership as Chairman of the National Fallen Firefighters Foundation.                          ____________________
