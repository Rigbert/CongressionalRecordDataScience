President, I appreciate the comments of my colleagues. First, I commend the two Senators from Michigan, who spent years working out this conclusion for these three nominees to be here. I commend Senator Levin and Senator Stabenow for working so hard. Senator Cardin spent so much time at the hearing with me. I appreciate the amount of time he spent there. His words of calm reasoning, but with questions that cut right to the importance of the hearing, were extremely valuable.  If nobody else is seeking recognition, I am going to suggest the absence of a quorum in a moment. So that Senators will understand, at 6:30 I will call off the quorum, and the time will be yielded back on both sides. Then we will go to a rollcall vote on Helene White.  If Judge White is confirmed, as I fully expect she will be, then we will go to the next two judges, but only if she is confirmed. Again, Senator Specter and I have both said we expect she will be. We will go to the next two judges, and I don't know of anyone who will require a rollcall vote on those two judges.  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
