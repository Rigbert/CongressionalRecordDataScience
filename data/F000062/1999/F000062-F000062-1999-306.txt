 President, today I am introducing a bill to enable the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to eliminate the additive, MTBE, from gasoline. The goal in this bill, as in my previous three bills (S. 266, S. 267 and S. 268) is to eliminate MTBE from drinking water.  Under this bill, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency could waive the two percent reformulated gasoline oxygenate requirement of the Clean Air Act in any state if gasoline with less than two percent or with no oxygenates does not result in greater emissions than emissions from reformulated gasoline containing two percent oxygenates.  MTBE or methyl tertiary butyl ether is added to gasoline by some refiners in response to federal Clean Air Act requirements that areas with the most serious air pollution problems use reformulated or cleaner-burning gasoline. This federal law requires that this gasoline contain two percent by weight oxygenates. MTBE has been the oxygenate of choice by some refiners.  The Clean Air Act's reformulated gas requirements have no doubt helped reduce emissions throughout the United States, but the two percent oxygenate requirement has imposed limitations on the level of flexibility that U.S. EPA can grant to states and limited the flexibility of refiners in making clean gasoline.  I am very troubled to learn from a March 16 article in the Sacramento Bee that the gasoline refiners were awareof MTBE's dangers long before it was approved for use in California. Researchers in Maine pointed out MTBE's harms in 1986. The Bee reporter, after studying industry research documents, quotes a 1992 industry scientific paper: ``MTBE plumes are expected to move faster and further than benzene plumes emanating from a gasoline spill. Moreover, the solubility of MTBE is nearly 25 times that of benzene and its concentration in gasoline will be approximately 10 times greater.''  A spokesman for the Oxygenated Fuels Association is also quoted as saying that the chemical properties that make MTBE problematic in water ``were widely known'' in the 1980s.  Bob Reeb, of the Association of California Water Agencies, is quoted as saying, had they known of MTBE's adverse effects, ``We would have fought like hell to keep it out of gasoline. It appears to be a classic case of placing corporate profits above public health.''  The Sacramento Bee article is appended to my statement.  A number of authorities have called attention to MTBE's harm and have called for prompt action.  The American Medical Association House of Delegates and the American Public Health Association approved resolutions calling for a moratorium on the use of MTBE in 1994--1994!  The University of California released a five-volume study in November 1998, and recommended phasing out MTBE. UC found that ``there are significant risks and costs associated with water contamination due to the use of MTBE.'' The University of California study says: ``If MTBE continues to be used at current levels and more sources become contaminated, the potential for regional degradation of water resources, especially groundwater basins, will increase. Severity of water shortages during drought years will be exacerbated.''  The UC study says that oil companies can make cleaner-burning gasoline that meets federal air standards without MTBE and that they should be given the flexibility to do that. The UC study found that ``there is no significant additional air quality benefit to the use of oxygenates such as MTBE in reformulated gasoline, relative to'' California's reformulated gasoline formula.  The California Environmental Protection Agency on February 19, 23, 24 held two public hearings on the University of California report. A total of 109 people spoke at the hearings and 987 written comments (including mine) were submitted as of today, and the comment period is still open. Of the 109 speakers, 12 supported continued use of MTBE. Cal EPA is still reading the written comments.  A June 12, 1998 Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory study concluded that MTBE is a ``frequent and widespread contaminant'' in groundwater throughout California and does not degrade significantly once it is there. This study found that groundwater has been contaminated at over 10,000 shallow monitoring sites. The Livermore study says that ``MTBE has the potential to impact regional groundwater resources and may present a cumulative contamination hazard.''  The Association of California Water Agencies has detected MTBE in shallow groundwater at over 10,000 sites in the state and in some deeper drinking wells. Their December 1998 study documented MTBE contamination in many of the state's surface water reservoirs, pointing to motorized recreation as a major source.  The environmental group, Communities for a Better Environment, issued a report this month calling for a ban on MTBE in our state because it has contamined groundwater, drinking water and land.  I have received letters and resolutions opposing MTBE from 56 California local governments, water districts, and air districts.  In higher concentrations, MTBE smells like turpentine and it tastes like paint thinner. Relatively low levels of MTBE can make drinking water simply undrinkable.  MTBE is a highly soluble organic compound which moves quickly through soil and gravel. It, therefore, poses a more rapid threat to water supplies than other constituents of gasoline when leaks occur. MTBE is easily traced, but it is very difficult and expensive to cleanup. California water agencies say it costs $1 million to cleanup per well and $5 million plus for reservoirs.  Contamination of drinking water MTBE continues to grow. A December 14, 1998 San Francisco Chronicle headline calls MTBE a ``Ticking Bomb.''  The Lawrence Livermore study says that ground water has been contaminated at over 10,000 sites in my state.  South Lake Tahoe has closed 14 wells and is implementing a ban on personal watercraft. Ten plumes of MTBE released by gas stations (some from a hose torn loose, some from spills, some from underground tanks) have caused the shutdown of 35% of the districts' drinking water wells, eliminating nearly one-fifth of its water supply since September 1997. The levels of groundwater contamination there are as high as 1,200,000 parts per billion. The South Tahoe Public Utility District has spent nearly $1 million in non-budget funds on MTBE.  The February 5 Sacramento Bee reported that MTBE has been detected 30 miles away from Lake Tahoe, that ``it apparently made its way to the reservoir through South Lake Tahoe's wastewater export system. . . Six service stations working to clear MTBE from contaminated areas have been discharging water into the sewer system after a treatment process.'' The article quotes Dawn Forsythe, a Tahoe authority: ``It's going all the way through the sewer system, through the treatment system, through the export pipeline, across a stream and now it's in the reservoir.''  MTBE has been detected in drinking water supplies in a number of cities including Santa Monica, Riverside, Anaheim, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Sebastopol, Manteca, and San Diego. MTBE has also been detected in numerous California reservoirs including Lake Shasta in Redding, San Pablo and Cherry reservoirs in the Bay Area, and Coyote and Anderson reservoirs in Santa Clara.  Drinking water wells in Santa Clara Valley (Great Oaks Water Company) and Sacramento (Fruitridge Vista Water Company) have been shut down because of MTBE contamination.  In addition, MTBE has been detected in the following surface water reservoirs: Lake Perris (Metropolitan Water District of Southern California), Anderson Reservoir (Santa Clara Valley Water District), Canyon Lake (Elsinore Valley Municipal Water District), Pardee Reservoir and San Pablo Reservoir (East Bay Municipal Utility District), Lake Berryessa (Solano County Water Agency).  The largest contamination occurred in the city of Santa Monica, which lost 75% of its ground water supply as a result of MTBE leaking out of shallow gas tanks beneath the surface. MTBE has been discovered in publicly owned wells approximately 100 feet from the City Council Chamber in South Lake Tahoe. In Glennvile, California, near Bakersfield, MTBE levels have been detected in groundwater as high as 190,000 parts per billion--dramatically exceeding the California Department of Health advisory of 35 parts per billion.  While many scientists say we need more definitive research on the human health effects of MTBE, the U.S. EPA has indicated that ``MTBE is an animal carcinogen and has a human carcinogenic hazard potential.''  Dr. John Froines, a distinguished UCLA scientist, testified at the California EPA hearing on February 23 as follows:       We in our report have concluded the cancer evidence in      animals is relevant to humans.       There are ``acute effects in occupationally-exposed      workers, including headaches, dizziness, nausea, eye and      respiratory irritation, vomiting, sensation of spaciness or      disorientation and burning of the nose and throat.''       MTBE exposure was associated with excess cancers in rats      and mice, therefore, multi-species,'' citing multiple,      ``endpoints, lymphoma, leukemia, testicular cancer, liver and      kidney.       All four of the tumor sites observed in animals may be      predictive of human cancer risk.  He further testified:       The related question is whether there is evidence which      demonstrates the animal cancers are not relevant to humans.      The answer developed in detail in our report is no. There is      no convincing evidence that the data is specific to animals.      That is our conclusion. Nobody has come forward to tell us a      basis to change that point of view.  `These, to me, are troubling statements from a reputable authority.  While the data is incomplete, we do know that MTBE is showing up in other states. U.S. EPA funded a study by the University of Massachusetts last year, which was not able to collect data from every state, but which reported that 25 states have reports of private drinking water wells contaminated with MTBE. Nineteen states reported public drinking water wells contaminated with MTBE. EPA experts concluded, ``MTBE detections by most state programs is common'' and ``MTBE may contaminate groundwater in unexpected locations and in unexpected ways, such as at diesel fuel sites or from surface dumping of small amounts of gasoline.'' (Soil and Groundwater Cleanup, August/September 1998, ``Study Reports LUST Programs Are Felling Effects of MTBE Releases.'')  Here are some examples of problems in other states:       A Maine survey found that 15 percent of drinking wells had      detectable amounts of MTBE and 5,200 private wells may      contain MTBE above the state's drinking water standard.       MTBE has contaminated the well water for over 200 homes in      New York.       In Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, MTBE was detected in tap water,      suspected from a leak from a gas station tank.       Texas, with over 21,000 leaking underground fuel tanks, is      finding MTBE in drinking water.       MTBE has been detected in drinking water in Kansas and      Virginia.  Clearly, MTBE is a problem in many states.  The California Air Resources Board in 1994 adopted a clean gas formula that is called a ``predictive model,'' a performance-based program that allows refiners to use innovative fuel formulations to meet clean air requirements.  The predictive model provides twice the clean air benefits required by the federal government. With this model, refiners can make cleaner burning gasoline with one percent oxygen or even no oxygen at all. The federal two percent oxygenate requirement limits this kind of innovation. In fact, Chevron, Tosco and Shell are already making MTBE-free gasoline.  Since the introduction of the California Cleaner Burning Gasoline program, there has been a 300-ton-per-day decrease in ozone forming ingredients found in the air. This is the emission reduction equivalent of taking 3.5 million automobiles off the road. California reformulated gasoline reduces smog-forming emissions from vehicles by 15 percent.  I have now offered to the Congress 4 approaches to getting MTBE out of our drinking water.  I introduced S. 266 on January 20, a bill to allow California to apply its own clean or reformulated gasoline rules as long as emissions reductions are equivalent or greater. California's rules are stricter than the federal rules and thus meet the air quality requirements of the federal Clean Air Act. This bill is the companion to H.R. 11 introduced by Rep. Bilbray on January 6, 1999.  S. 267, my second bill, requires the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to make petroleum releases into drinking water the highest priority in the federal underground storage tank cleanup program. This bill is needed because underground storage tanks are the major source of MTBE into drinking water and federal law does not give EPA specific guidance on cleanup priorities.  The third bill, S. 268, will move from 2006 to 2001 full implementation of EPA's current watercraft engine exhaust emissions requirements. The California Air Resources Board on December 10, 1998, adopted watercraft engine regulations in effect making the federal EPA rules effective in 2001, so this bill will make the deadline in the federal requirements consistent with California's deadlines. In addition, the bill will require an emissions label on these engines consistent with California's requirements so the consumer can make an informed purchasing choice. This bill is needed because watercraft engines have remained essentially unchanged since the 1930s and up to 30 percent of the gas that goes into the motor goes into water unburned.  Dr. John Froines, testified that in California, ``. . . essentially every citizen of California is breathing MTBE daily.''  MTBE is not needed to produce clean air. By allowing the companies that supply our state's gasoline to use good science and sound environmental policy, we can achieve the goals set forth by the Clear Air Act, without sacrificing California's clean water. I believe U.S. EPA should give all states this flexibility.  MTBE is not needed. Refiners can make gasoline that is clean--Chevron, Tosco and Shell are already doing that in my state.  MTBE is an animal carcinogen and a potential human carcinogen.  Let's end it.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and article from the Sacramento Bee be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 645       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. WAIVER OF OXYGEN CONTENT REQUIREMENT FOR CERTAIN                    REFORMULATED GASOLINE.       Section 211(k)(2)(B) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C.      7545(k)(2)(B)) is amended--       (1) in the first sentence, by striking ``The oxygen'' and      inserting the following:       ``(i) Requirement.--The oxygen''; and       (2) in the second sentence--       (A) by striking ``The Administrator'' and inserting the      following:       ``(ii) Waivers.--The Administrator'';       (B) by striking ``area upon a'' and inserting the      following: ``area--       ``(I) upon a'';       (C) by striking the period at the end and inserting ``;      or''; and       (D) by adding at the end the following:       ``(II) if the Administrator determines, by regulation, that      reformulated gasoline that contains less than 2.0 percent by      weight oxygen and meets all other requirements of this      subsection will result in total emissions of ozone forming      volatile organic compounds and toxic air pollutants,      respectively, that are not greater than the total emissions      of those compounds and pollutants resulting from reformulated      gasoline that contains at least 2.0 percent by weight oxygen      and meets all other requirements of this subsection.''.                [From the Sacramento Bee, Mar. 16, 1999]            MTBE Risk to Drinking Water Was Known for Years                   (By Chris Bowman and Patrick Hoge)       America's fuel industry knew about the risk to drinking      water from MTBE years before domestic refineries more than      doubled the chemical's volume in gasoline, but manufacturers      marketed the product as an environmental improvement anyway.       In technical papers and conference presentations,      environmental engineers for refineries and government      regulators alike predicted that MTBE could become a lingering      groundwater menace as its usage increased.       Sixteen years before MTBE-rich gasoline was approved for      statewide use in California to combat air pollution, oil      companies knew from their first experience with the fuel      additive in New England how quickly methyl tertiary butyl      ether can migrate from leaking storage tanks to drinking      water wells, company records and technical journals show.       At the time, the pollution specialists stressed that MTBE      was in many ways more worrisome than gasoline's cancer-     causing benzene.       ``MTBE plumes are expected to move faster and further than      benzene plumes emanating from a gasoline spill,'' three Shell      researchers said in an internal 1992 paper. ``Moreover, the      solubility of MTBE is nearly 25 times that of benzene, and      its concentration in gasoline will be approximately 10 times      greater.''       These papers, recently obtained by The Bee, have renewed      importance today in California where the spotlight on the      fuel controversy is about to turn on industry.       Later this month, Gov. Gray Davis is expected to announce      that MTBE presents a public health threat and should be      phased out of California, sources in his administration say.      Such an action would not end the public debate, but rather      shift it to the question of who will pay to clean up MTBE and      how much cleanup should occur.       Even if the synthetic compound were banned overnight--a      highly unlikely prospect--California would still have to      defend its water supplies for many years against MTBE-laced      groundwater from past fuel leaks.       MTBE is a key component of a ``cleaner-burning gasoline''      that has been used in most of California's 27 million      vehicles for the past three years. While the gasoline has      been credited for removing 300 hundred tons of tailpipe      poisons every day in the state, it also has created a      Pandora's box underground.       Increasingly, the compound has found its way into      underground reservoirs, in storm-water runoff, in      recreational lakes and in wells across the country. In      California, MTBE has contaminated 10,000 groundwater sites      and tainted Tahoe, Donner, Shasta and several other lakes. It      also has knocked out wells in several communities. In South      Lake Tahoe, more than a dozen wells have been shut down due      to MTBE contamination.       While scientists are still studying MTBE's health effects--     the federal government classifies it as a ``possible''      cancer-causing agent     in humans--minute amounts of the pollutant can spoil wells by      imparting a bitter taste and solvent-like ordor.       Already some marina-related businesses have taken an      economical hit due to water utilities banning fuel-spitting      power craft from reservoirs tapped for drinking water.      Filtration plants can't remove MTBE without expensive      treatment upgrades.       But the biggest MTBE bill is yet to come, and, one way or      another, consumers will ultimately pay for it. That will be      in the cleanup of MTBE-laden fuel that has spilled and leaked      from pipelines and storage tanks. The restoration is expected      to take many years, at a cost of tens of millions to hundreds      of millions of dollars a year, a major University of      California study recently concluded.       Makers of gasoline and MTBE put the onus on tank owners and      the environmental officials who regulate the tanks and the      fuels.       Officials at Shell Oil Co. headquartered in Houston told      The Bee that its 1992 paper describing the environmental      downside of MTBE was hardly news.       ``(It) was in the public domain and already accessible to      regulators,'' the company said in a prepared statement. A      spokeswoman said it was based on information disseminated at      a 1986 pollution control conference co-sponsored by the      American Petroleum Institute.       In the 1980s, the chemical properties making MTBE      problematic in water ``were widely known,'' said Charlie      Drevna, chief spokesman for Oxygenated Fuels Association,      which represents makers of MTBE and other oxygen-bearing fuel      components. ``What wasn't known was that the (underground      storage tank) program in this country was in total      shambles.''       But the leaking tanks problem has been widely reported for      at least the past decade when the U.S. Environmental      Protection Agency ordered the tanks replaced or upgraded.      Most major brand gasoline stations in California complied by      the federal deadline last December.       California motorists have been paying for a good part of      the cleanups from leaking tanks since 1992. They pay about      1.2 cents per gallon at the pump toward a $180 million-a-year      state cleanup fund that reimburses mostly small businesses.       The argument that industry should bear more responsibility      for the MTBE pollution is beginning to grow. In the past few      months, attorneys suing oil companies on behalf of      individuals and utilities over MTBE pollution in California,      South Carolina and Maine have joined forces. The common      allegation is that the oil companies knew or should have      known that adding more MTBE to gasoline posed a major threat      to drinking water sources.       ``It would have been astonishing for corporations of this      size and complexity not to have known the risk that an      additive to a product that would become so widespread would      pose to the environment and to the public,'' said Victor      Sher, a Sacramento attorney representing the South Tahoe      Public Utility District.       Sher said his lawsuit, filed in 1999, is the first in the      nation by a public water supplier that goes after fuel makers      on grounds of product liability.       While the environmentally troublesome properties of MTBE      were noted in technical papers from the oil industry and      federal regulators, Sher said he has yet to find evidence      that the oil industry ever raised those problems before      policy-makers as they deliberated the rules for the cleaner-     burning gasoline.       ``They should have been telling the regulators, and they      should have been looking for alternatives,'' Shea said.       Shell Oil officials say EPA regulators had plenty of notice      in the 1980s, well before 1992 when refiners began to      substantially increase the chemical's use to meet the new      federal cleaner-burning fuel rules.       ``The literature then available indicated to government      regulators, manufacturers of MTBE and to gasoline      manufacturers, including Shell, that the then perceived      benefits outweighed the then perceived risks,'' the company      statement said.       Liability aside, the knowledge of MTBE's downside could      have changed what ended up in the gas tanks of millions of      motorists. The gasoline additive is now the fourth top      selling chemical in the United States, with more than 9      million tons of it sold annually.       Water suppliers say they certainly would have raised a      fuss.       ``We would have fought like hell to keep it out of      gasoline,'' said Bob Reeb, of the Association of California      Water Agencies. ``It appears to be a classic case of      placing corporate profits above public health.''       If that's the case, Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa,      D-Los Angeles, said, ``We can make the argument that this      industry has a very high level of responsibility to provide      the cleanup of this contamination.''       MTBE's critics point out that the trail of responsibility      can be traced back at least to 1986 when three researchers      from Maine laid out the basic characteristics of MTBE in      discussion today: that it moves farther and faster in      groundwater, last longer, and is much more difficult to      filter out than other gasoline compounds.       The presentation was at a Houston conference attended by      dozens of regulators and industry scientists on ground-water      pollutants. It was sponsored by the American Petroleum      Institute and the National Well Water Association.       Two of the Maine paper's authors said their presentation      didn't seem to make much of an impact on regulators and      industry.       ``There just seemed to be a feeling that there wasn't      anything that was necessary to do now, which puzzles me in      retrospect,'' said Peter Garrett, one of the authors. ``I      think it was because MTBE was hailed as being the chemical of      the future because of its potential to cut down on air      pollution.''       Co-author Marcel Moreau, now an expert on underground      tanks, said all of the technical information about the      chemical's characteristics was freely supplied by ARCO.       But as momentum was building on Capitol Hill toward      requiring oxygenated compounds like MTBE in gasoline to      combat smog, no such environmental concerns surfaced in the      public debate either from industry, environmentalists or      regulators, according to interviews with key participants.       MTBE's many critics express amazement that a chemical could      have been introduced into the environment on such a massive      scale with so little data on its toxicology or behavior in      the environment.       When first added to premium gasoline in 1979, scientists      had produced no studies on MTBE's long-term health effects.       ``It is astonishing that such a technological process could      have been started without sufficient technological      information that would have enabled us to expose possible      adverse health effects of the compound,'' wrote Fiorella      Belpoggi, lead researcher in a 1995 investigation of MTBE's      cancer-causing potential.       The recent study of MTBE done by the University of      California similarly found that regulators did not do enough      to assess MTBE's potential environmental impacts before      allowing its huge rise.       In California, health officials testified recently before      the state Legislature that they did not realize that MTBE      posed a major groundwater threat until 1995, when Santa      Monica reported contamination of one of its wells.       Ironically, companies like ARCO continued to spend lavishly      in 1996 to promote MTBE as an environmentally friendly      product that made gasoline burn cleaner.       The lack of toxicology data remains even today, more than      three years after MTBE's introduction in California on a      massive scale.       Industry representatives insist that expensive upgrades of      underground tanks already mandated under law will curtail the      MTBE problem.       But others say evidence shows too many other ways that MTBE      can get into water wells.       James Giannopoulos, principal engineer with the state Water      Resources Control Board, made a similar point during a recent      MTBE hearing in Sacramento.       ``Even a small failure rate of the more than 50,000      upgraded tanks, we believe constitutes a good water quality      reason to eliminate MTBE from gasoline,'' he said.                                 ______                                       By
