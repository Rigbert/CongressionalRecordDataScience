 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4709, the Law Enforcement and Phone Privacy Protection Act of 2006. This legislation will protect the privacy of consumers' cell phone records and create new criminal penalties for the unauthorized purchase, sale or disclosure of such records.  Certain unscrupulous companies operating on the Internet use deception to acquire an individual's phone records and then sell this personal information. Typically these companies employ a tactic known as ``pretexting'' to deceive the phone companies.                              {time}  1445  By impersonating the actual cell phone account holder, these companies are often able to obtain significant private information about the individuals.  This practice not only presents a threat to the privacy of the average consumer; the Judiciary Committee has also learned that criminals have employed these services to determine the identity of undercover law enforcement officers as well as suspected confidential informants and witnesses. Additionally, stalkers and domestic users can use such information to track a victim's location and associates.  Amazingly, none of this is clearly illegal under Federal law. H.R. 4709 targets pretexting and other deceptive practices not adequately addressed by the current law and provides express protection in the criminal code for the privacy of confidential phone records information. These important new consumer protections cover the records and calling logs of cellular, land line, Voice-Over-Internet-Protocol users, and accomplish this goal on a technology neutral basis. The bill also establishes specific criminal penalties for the fraudulent acquisition or disclosure of such records without the consent of the consumer.  More specifically, the bill prohibits third parties from purchasing or receiving confidential phone records information without the prior authorization of the consumer, or knowing or having reason to know that the information was obtained fraudulently. It exempts use of information by any covered entity if such use would be permissible under existing laws governing the handling of such information by telecommunications carriers. This exception includes any uses by agents, contractors, or joint venture partners to receive the confidential phone records acting on behalf of the covered entity to perform any of the functions permitted under existing law.  The bill also provides enhanced criminal penalties for anyone who engages in large scale operations to violate the law, or who discloses or uses fraudulently obtained confidential phone records information in furtherance of crimes of violence, including domestic violence and stalking, or to kill, injure or intimidate a witness, juror, confidential informant, or law enforcement officer.  The bill under consideration today incorporates several technical and conforming changes to the text that was reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee on March 2 this year. This bipartisan legislation is supported by the U.S. Department of Justice, the National Center For Victims of Crime, the Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Association, and all of the major land line and mobile telephone companies.  I commend the chairman of the Subcommittee on Courts, the Internet, and Intellectual Property, Lamar Smith, for introducing this important measure. I also want to thank Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Conyers, Congressman Goodlatte, and Congressman Scott for their contributions to this legislation.  Madam Speaker, H.R. 4709 provides consumers with important new protections for the confidentiality of their calling records without compromising the legitimate lawful interests of law enforcement, emergency services and cellular telephone service providers. I urge my colleagues to support this sensible piece of legislation and hope that the Members of the other body will consider and pass this bill expeditiously.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
