  I rise in strong opposition, and I hope it will be robust opposition, to the Dodd-McCain amendment, which would gut the narcotics certification process and replace it with absolutely nothing.  Mr. President, I just heard the distinguished Senator say ``trust General McCaffrey.'' With all due respect to General McCaffrey, this is such a volatile and unpredictable area that it is impossible to know what to believe. It is understandable that General McCaffrey could stand before the world and say, ``I trust General Gutierrez Rebollo. He is an honest man.''  Whoops. The next thing we know, he is on the take. My goodness, how can you gut a process and replace it with nothing except trust when we have already found that trust to be wanting.  Now, let me say for a moment, I want to divide my remarks into three parts. The first is foreign assistance and who should get foreign assistance as a product of this amendment. The second is a certification process and what it has actually done in Colombia. The third is Mexico postsummit and what has not happened.  This debate is really about whether we should give foreign aid and support development loans to other nations with no strings attached even if we know that the leaders and government of the country do nothing to assist in stopping the flow of drugs to the United States.  I think we need to clear up a major misconception about the debate here today on the drug certification process. This is not a debate about whether drug certification is a process that hurts our relations with our allies in the hemisphere because we sit and pass judgment on other nations. This is a debate about foreign assistance and under what circumstances the United States should offer assistance to other nations. With the exception of humanitarian assistance, the United States provides foreign assistance not only because America has a great and good tradition of assisting other states, but because we want to encourage certain types of behavior--because we want cooperation on political, security, or economic policy.  The distinguished manager of the bill, Senator McConnell, has said it very well today again and again. He said, ``Foreign aid is not an entitlement program. Just because you received it last year does not mean you should receive it this year. You have to earn it.''  A nation that does not fully cooperate with our efforts to keep drugs from reaching our schools and our children has not earned the right to receive foreign assistance from the United States. We are not obligated to provide assistance. We provide this assistance because it is in our interest to do so, because it encourages behavior and policies which we support. Before we provide money, we have every right to expect that we will get cooperation from those nations to which we provide it. Indeed, we have a duty to our constituents not to send their tax dollars to a country if it is undermining our counternarcotics effort. That, in fact, is why we have the certification process as an instrument for cooperation--not because we want or enjoy the opportunity to sit in judgment on other nations. It is not a policy for faint hearts. I admit that. It is not about rating who we like or who we do not like. It is not about saying you are good and you are bad.  The current certification process may not be perfect, but it accomplishes something very important. Once a year it focuses the attention of our executive branch and of other nations whose cooperation we need on what is perhaps the most crucial national security issue this country faces.  If anyone had to ask me what is America's No. 1 national security threat, I would say drugs, drugs, drugs. There is no other. It is my firm belief that without the drug certification process, we would have no debate of this kind. So I am not sorry we have this process. I think it focuses our efforts, and, even when it bruises feelings of other nations, it ultimately produces more cooperation, not less.  Now, let us for a moment look at Colombia, a country which we did decertify 2 years ago. The evidence is clear. When we decertified Colombia, the reaction was initially very harsh, and then, very quickly, Colombian cooperation began to improve.  Colombian officials came to my office just a month or so ago, and here is what they told me: In the last year, Colombia has fumigated 20,000 hectares of cocoa, the most ever; destroyed 800 drug laboratories; began working with the United States to develop a radar system to allow the government to secure control of all Colombian airspace, an air control system that allowed them to force down approximately 50 small drug-runner planes--force down 50 small drug-runner planes--which would have otherwise evaded Colombian air traffic control.  They have begun working with the U.S. Coast Guard to develop strategies for intercepting narcotics traffickers at sea; they have passed tough new laws on asset forfeiture for narco-traffickers, and they are implementing them; they have arrested and convicted at least 5 politicians I know of, and incarcerated them for taking money into their campaign funds from narco-traffickers; they have passed tough new penalties increasing sentences by 4 and 10 times for drug-related offenses; and they have instituted aggressive new proceedings against the Cali and Medellin cartel leaders. The Medellin cartel leaders are all in prison. The cartel is no more. And the Cali cartel is in the process of disintegrating.  Does anyone honestly believe that Colombia would have taken these steps in this fashion if it had not been for the U.S. drug certification process? I think not. And as a matter of fact, I am of the view that if this continues, Colombia should be recertified, and we should say thank you for working on this problem in the way in which you have.  Before Colombia was decertified, the powers of the cocaine cartels grew. The number of hectares planted with coca grew. The corruption in the Colombian judicial and political systems grew. But when the United States said ``enough'' and decertified Colombia, all of a sudden the Colombian Government did an aboutface. I think that this example can affect other nations as well. Unfortunately, much of the trafficking and the transportation of drugs has moved to Mexico, and this is the next frontier of the battle.  Now, let's compare the situation in Colombia today with that in Mexico today post-summit, post-Presidential visit to Mexico. Still, not a single extradition of a Mexican national on drug charges. I say on drug charges. On other charges perhaps. Despite all of the debate last year, despite the economic summit, not a single extraditionof a Mexican national wanted in this country for drug charges has been carried out by the Mexican Government.  There are continued restrictions on the operations of United States drug enforcement agents in Mexico. Even when working in cooperation with their Mexican counterparts they still cannot protect themselves if they are working on the other side of the border. They still are not allowed to carry weapons. Coast Guard ships in pursuit of trafficking vessels on the sea still need to give Mexico 30 days' notice before putting into port to refuel. There are no air or maritime agreements to forge a joint approach for interdiction of narco-trafficking. There is still massive corruption at all levels of the government, law enforcement and the military, prosecutors killed, judges murdered, and, most recently, the plastic surgeon that did the surgery on Amado Carrillo-Fuentes has reportedly--I cannot verify it, but reportedly--disappeared.  Drug cartels are running rampant in Mexico. Corruption along the U.S. border--and I will speak for California--has never been worse, never been worse. The cartels are now controlling street gangs in Los Angeles, and this is where I stand up and say ``I have had enough.''  My distinguished colleague and friend from Connecticut read from a number of editorials. You know, I judge stories by the by-line. There is a reporter whom I respect very much. His name is Marcus Stern. He writes for the San Diego Union Tribune. This is a headline on the 12th of this month, ``Drugs still flown over the border, say agents.'' Let me quote from part of this article:       But a dozen military and civilian officials directly      involved with the counter-drug effort along the California-     Mexico border said in interviews during recent weeks that the      skies in San Diego and Imperial counties are largely out of      control and are still being heavily used by drug traffickers.       It's pretty much wide open * * *                            *   *   *   *   *       But the antidrug officials interviewed in recent weeks said      military observation posts deployed along the border are      spotting a half-dozen planes a week flying into Imperial      County alone. The planes are flying low at dusk with their      lights out, the officials said.  This is happening every day on the border. It is the wrong time to do gut the certification process. The administration has agreed to give us a report on September 1 on progress made by Mexico. That is pursuant to our Senate-passed resolution. I, for one, am eagerly awaiting it, to see what progress has been made. At this stage, I know of no real progress that has been made.  The sponsors of this amendment argue that Mexico fails to cooperate because of the certification process. They argue that Mexican pride and nationalism make it difficult to appear to respond to American threats. That's nonsense. It is baloney.  President Zedillo, whom we all believe is committed to fighting the drug traffickers, has said repeatedly that drug trafficking is the No. 1 threat to Mexico's national security. Well, either it is or it isn't. If it's such a grave threat to Mexico's national security, they should cooperate with us in their own interests, not because we make demands. Extradite drug pushers, allow U.S. Coast Guard ships to refuel, allow DEA agents working the other side of the border to carry firearms to protect themselves. I believe we have every legitimate reason to make clear we will not accept anything less than full cooperation.  The whole issue is an issue right now, precisely, I believe, because the administration was not honest in the certification process in dealing with Mexico. As much as I, too, would like to see a more flexible certification process, the situation with Mexico, for me, underscores exactly why we need a certification process.  I come from a State that is perhaps the most impacted State in the Union with these drugs. Yes, cocaine prices have dropped on the streets of Los Angeles in the last 5 years. It is not because of a certification process. It is because we have not had the guts to do what we should have done and decertify Mexico. I believe that's the reason. To replace a policy which may come to some fruition this next year with nothing is wrong.  I agree with the idea of a commission. I am happy to have commissions. I learned when I was mayor, if you didn't know what to do, appoint a committee. Better still, appoint a commission.  But I know what to do. We have to stop those overflights. We have to see that the border is enforced. We have to press for cooperation. We have to have extradition for those for whom there is a bona fide American arrest subpoena or warrant who traffic in narcotics.  So, I am not prepared to vote for an amendment that leaves us with no plan but simply takes Mexico off the hook: No evaluation this fall, no ability to read the September 1 report presented by the administration and make a decision as to whether there has or has not been any progress, then wait 2 or 3 years for this undefined, ephemeral ``something.''  Respectfully, I can't turn around and just depend on trust when another nation's leading anti-drug official turns out to be on the take. What's wrong with our intelligence? How can that happen? We don't question it even. How can that happen? It did. And that, I believe, typifies our drug policy with Mexico. Frankly, it has been one of spin. I, for one, am not going to buy the spin. I want to see the results on the street.  When cocaine prices on the street corners of Los Angeles rise, I know something has happened. When I pick up this newspaper and, instead of seeing ``Drugs still flown over the border,'' I see ``Five Planes Downed, Pilot, Copilot Arrested, Two Tons of Cocaine Recovered,'' then I know we have something going on on the streets, as they say. So, that is what I am looking for. When I see Mexico say, ``Here are the cartel leaders, we are going to bring them to trial, we are going to bust the cartels,'' then I know we have something going.  So, until then, to do away with the certification process, I think, is to say to the people of the United States, ``We are going to do nothing for the next 3 years.'' I, for one, am not going to be party to that policy.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter signed by Senator Grassley, Senator Coverdell, Senator Torricelli, Senator John Kerry, and myself, and I yield the floor.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                                    Washington, DC, July 16, 1997.     Vote ``no'' on the Dodd-McCain amendment to end narcotic          certification.       Dear Colleague: We write to urge you to join us in opposing      the Dodd-McCain amendment on narcotics certification. This      amendment would dramatically weaken the United States'      ability to gain cooperation from other nations in the war      against international narcotics trafficking.       The Dodd-McCain amendment would effectively end the      narcotics certification process and replace it with . . .      nothing!       The Dodd-McCain amendment would tell other nations that we      will provide them foreign assistance with no strings      attached, even if they do nothing to assist stopping the flow      of drugs to the United States.       The Dodd-McCain amendment would instantaneously deprive the      United States of the leverage we have used successfully to      gain greater anti-narcotics cooperation from many nations,      including Colombia, following its decertification two years      ago.       The Dodd-McCain amendment would send a signal to our      friends and partners--and to the drug lords--that the United      States is not serious about combating narcotics.       The Dodd-McCain amendment calls for a task force on      international narcotics control and an international summit      to develop a multilateral strategy--which are laudable      goals--but it would unnecessarily gut one of the central      tools in our current narcotics control strategy, without      specifying what will replace it.       The influx of illegal narcotics is perhaps the gravest      national security threat facing the United States today. In      order to effectively combat this threat, the United States      needs to work with our friends and partners in the Western      Hemisphere to interdict this massive flow of drugs and to      arrest and punish the drug lords.       But when we do not receive the full cooperation of other      nations in these efforts, we must be able to act to let them      know that they must do more. That is why we have the drug      certification process. We urge you to oppose the Dodd-McCain      amendment.           Sincerely,     Dianne Feinstein.     Charles E. Grassley.     John Kerry.     Paul Coverdell.     Robert G. Toricelli.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The Senator from Iowa.
