President, today I would like to recognize a family that has dedicated much time and energy into preserving its Cherokee heritage. Dr. Charles Rogers of Brownsville, TX, his wife Sheron, his son, George Charles Sherson, and his mother, Mary Layton Rogers, have traveled to Mexico in search of the grave of the famous Cherokee, Sequoyah.  Sequoyah is credited with inventing a writing system for the Cherokees by making symbols which form words. As a result of this syllabary, thousands of Cherokees became literate. In recognition of his monumental contribution, the Cherokee Nation awarded him a silver medal, along with a lifetime literary pension.  Sequoyah was born in Tennessee, in 1776, to Nathaniel Gist, a Virginia fur trader, and Wut-teh, the daughter of a Cherokee Chief. He also lived in Georgia, Alabama and Arkansas before moving to Oklahoma, where he lived until 1842. He then set out to find the Chickamauga Cherokees, who had moved to Mexico. He died the following year in Mexico, but the exact location of his grave has remained unknown.  Dr. Rogers and his family, who come from a long line of Cherokees themselves, have searched extensively for Sequoyah's grave. Their efforts may have paid-off as they believe they have found the burial site in a rock-covered cave near the ``lost-village'' of Sequoyah. Epic and Gloria Rodriguez of Mexico, whose ancestors helped Sequoyah and other Cherokees, directed the Rogers to the location. The Rogers' intent is not to return the remains of Sequoyah to Oklahoma, but to recognize his grave in order to preserve the richness of the Cherokee heritage.  I hope you will join me today in honoring Sequoyah, for his contribution to the Cherokee people, as well as the Rogers family, for their work to preserve the legacy of this Cherokee hero.                          ____________________
