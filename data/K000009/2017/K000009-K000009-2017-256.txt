Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life of Fritz Gerhard Hetzel, a devoted husband, father and grandfather; successful businessman and civic leader; and theGodfather of the Toledo-area German-American Festival.  Fritz was born on July 4, 1931, and grew up in war-torn Germany. He lost his father and other members of his family during the conflict. These tragedies and the difficulty that his mother and his sister and he lived through taught him many things. One such lesson was one that he passed down to his children and grandchildren: ``Tough times don't last but tough people do.'' As his wife Ann says, ``That was his mantra with the kids, and even for himself. He went through a lot.''  After the war, Fritz learned to be a barber and cut hair at the U.S. 7th Army headquarters in Heidelberg. It was appropriate that Fritz was born on the Fourth of July because his time spent working on the base inspired him to move to the United States. He first immigrated to Canada where he worked as a barber and then earned enough to be granted a U.S. visa.  In 1958, Fritz moved to Toledo, Ohio and began his new life by purchasing a barber business. He later went into sales at Ottawa Hills Memorial Park and was a co-owner of Fritz and Alfredo's, where the German and Mexican dishes on the menu were very popular.  Fritz thrived in Toledo, meeting his loving wife Ann, whom he married on September 9, 1961. He and Ann had 2 daughters, Susan Molloy and Tina Zientarski, and were blessed with six grandchildren: Mitchell, Michael, Matthew, Katherine, Zachary and Grace.  He dedicated himself to his family and to sharing his pride of his German heritage. He was an active member of the American Turners Club, Bavarian Sports Club and the Toledo Schwaben Verein. At one point there were seven separate German societies in Toledo, and Fritz, along with his friends, was instrumental in bringing the seven societies together to organize one major event, the annual German-American Festival which attracts over 35,000 people annually. The first German-American festival was held in 1966.  Fritz was passionate about music as well, where he led one of the area's most popular German bands, The Tirolers. The band played German music at festival and functions in Ohio, Michigan, Indiana and Pennsylvania.  In 1977, he received the Bundesverdienstkreuz, or, the Federal Cross of Merit from the Federal Republic of Germany, an honor given to citizens of other countries who work to promote German cultural activities in the United States.  Upon his retirement from the restaurant business in Toledo in 2005, Fritz and Ann moved to Delray Beach, Florida, where he immediately joined the Lantana German-American Club and led as the Director of the Club Choir.  Fritz Gerhard Hetzel had never-ending energy and gave his all to his family, community, businesses, and cultural activities. We should all aspire to be a selfless leader as he was.  Goodbye (Auf Wiedersehen), Fritz.                          ____________________
