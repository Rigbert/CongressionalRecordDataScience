No one works harder on health care and is more focused on the delivery of affordable care to all of our people, but particularly concerned about health care for our seniors. How ironic it is that the pledge that the Republicans made was to repeal and replace. I'm going to talk a little bit about that. But there has been no replacement. On the one hand, they want to eliminate the guarantee that Medicare gives to people to have the security that health care will be available to them; and on the other hand they offer nothing to replace it, no alternative, except to increase substantially the cost of those seniors when they are in need of health care.  I thank the gentlelady for her work, and I thank her for her leadership on this very critical issue.  I'm now pleased to yield to the distinguished minority leader, the former Speaker of the House, who has been instrumental in ensuring affordable health care is available to all of our people, Nancy Pelosi of California.
