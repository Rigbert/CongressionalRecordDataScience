President, let me first of all say no, it is not my intent, nor is it the intent of this amendment, to do that. This amendment is pretty straightforward. It does say ``unless otherwise authorized or provided by law.'' What that says to me is if there are some of these privileges out there that you believe are not in the law, then I would not be addressing those. I think what you are talking about is a matter of law, but I don't know that. I would rather say if it is a matter of law, we are providing an exception. And I guess I would ask you the question, since I now have the floor, do you believe that some of these rights are entitlements?
