President, included in the new taxes in this health reform is a tax hike of $20 billion on medical devices. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation both confirmed these excise taxes will not--will not--be borne by the medical device industry but, instead, are passed on to patients in the form of higher prices and higher insurance premiums.  Who are these folks who will bear the burden of this new tax? People with disabilities, diabetics, amputees, people with cancer, just to name some of the people--and more--who will see their costs go up because of this tax. We do not want to do this. Why should we want to do this on those who are most vulnerable?  This amendment would prevent this new tax from raising the already high costs for this group and a tax that will stifle the Medicaid device technology and innovation of this country.  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. It is offset by an amendment similar to that offered by Senator Schumer in the Finance Committee so it must be bipartisan.
