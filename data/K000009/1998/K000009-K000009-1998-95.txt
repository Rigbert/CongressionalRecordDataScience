I am very curious that the gentleman merely, as I read the bill which we only got a few minutes ago, essentially says noncitizens. Does this include foreign-controlled corporations and foreign-controlled trade associations as well as noncitizens, those who are not citizens of this country?  I think the gentleman's bill is seriously lacking in covering where most of the money comes from, which is from legally incorporated foreign corporations which are back-dooring money into our elections. I do not believe the gentleman's bill covers that.  Am I correct?
