President, the holiday rush is underway and millions of Americans are decorating, shopping, and preparing to spend Christmas, Hanukkah, and Kwanzaa with their loved ones. I want to draw attention to one woman from Illinois who is doing something very different.  Janet Teasley is a registered nurse in Chicago. She has volunteered to spend her holiday season in Liberia treating patients with the potentially deadly Ebola virus.  When Janet Teasley first told her family and coworkers of her plan, she says she encountered some resistance. One doctor with whom she works was only half kidding when he said he thought she was crazy. But once he realized she was serious, the doctor told Teasley he admired her. I share that admiration.
