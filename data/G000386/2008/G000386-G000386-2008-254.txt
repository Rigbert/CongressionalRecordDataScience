 President, the budget resolution proposes that Congress delay several CMS Medicaid regulations that are unpopular with states and advocates. I know some people have concerns with the CMS Medicaid regulations. I am not going to argue they are perfect. I have issues with some of them as well.  However, the regulations do address areas where there are real problems in Medicaid. States don't have clear guidance and could be inappropriately spending taxpayer dollars. This leads to improper payments and wasteful spending.  We see this throughout the regulations in question. I have a CRS memo that shows some of the issues that exist under current law that I am going to be quoting from shortly, and ask unanimous consent at this time to have it printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                               Congressional Research Service,                                                   March 13, 2008.                               Memorandum     To: Senate Committee on Finance--Attention: Rodney L.          Whitlock, Ph.D., Health Policy Advisor.     From: Elicia Herz, Specialist in Health Insurance Financing;          Cliff Binder, Analyst in Health Care Financing; Jean          Hearne, Specialist in Health Insurance Financing; Rick          Apling, Specialist in Education Policy.     Subject: Responses to Medicaid Regulation Questions          Governing: Graduate Medical Education, Intergovernmental          Transfers, School-based Services, Rehabilitation, and          Targeted Case Management.       Per your request, we are responding to your specific      questions on Medicaid regulations recently issued by the      Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). Also as you      instructed, we have framed our responses to your request in      the context you described as if the proposed regulations did      not exist:       ``The questions below assume that none of the regulations      are allowed to go into effect. Therefore, current statute and      any regulations or guidance in place prior to the issuance of      these regulations remain in effect.''       Your questions focus on specific aspects of selected issues      addressed in the new Medicaid regulations regarding      intergovernmental transfers (IGTs), graduate medical      education (GME), school-based services, rehabilitation      services, and targeted case management (TCM). Therefore,      the responses provided in this confidential memorandum are      neither intended to be a full discussion of CMS'      justifications for each new regulation, nor the      counterpoints raised by opponents of the regulations. The      Congressional Research Service (CRS) is preparing several      reports on these new regulations that will encompass      fuller discussions of these issues.       In the meantime if you have addition questions or need      clarification, please contact staff as follows: IGTs, Jean      Hearne or Elicia Herz, GME and school-based services,     Elicia Herz, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act      (IDEA), Rick Apling, and rehabilitation services and TCM,      Cliff Binder.     1.0 Intergovernmental Transfers (IGTs)     1.1 Can a state pay a hospital and require the hospital to          return a portion of the payment to the state?       Under certain circumstances, a state can require providers      to transfer funds to the state and because a provider's      Medicaid receipts are indistinguishable from other receipts,      effectively a portion of Medicaid payments may be included in      those transfers. There are two allowable methods states can      use to require hospitals to transfer funds to states:      intergovernmental transfers and taxes. Each method has its      own set of requirements. Congress specifically protects the      ability of states to collect funds from governmental      providers through intergovernmental transfers as long as      those transfers are certified public expenditures (Section      1903(w)(6)(A)). States are limited, however, in their ability      to collect funds from non-governmental providers. States are      able to collect funds from all types of providers through      taxes as long as the taxes comport with federal Medicaid law.     2.0 Graduate Medical Education (GME)     2.1 Is there any guidance in statute for how states should          bill CMS for IME and GME?       Most states make Medicaid payments to help cover the costs      of training new doctors in teaching hospitals and other      teaching programs. Historically, both Medicare and Medicaid      have recognized two components of GME: (1) direct graduate      medical education (DGME) (e.g., resident salaries, payments      to supervising physicians), and (2) indirect graduate medical      education (IME) (e.g., higher patient costs in teaching      hospitals due to treating sicker patients, residents ordering      more diagnostic tests than experienced physicians).       There is one explicit reference to GME in the federal      Medicaid statute. Section 1932(b)(2)(D) of the Social      Security Act stipulates that non-managed care organization      providers (non-MCO providers) that deliver emergency care to      an MCO beneficiary must accept as payment in full (up to) the      maximum amount applicable in the fee-for-service (FFS)      setting, minus any GME payments.       There also is one explicit reference to GME in federal      regulations at 42 CFR 438.6(c)(5)(v). This regulation      stipulates that if a state makes payments to providers for      GME costs under an approved state plan, the state must adjust      capitation rates for managed care to account for those GME      payments made on behalf of MCO beneficiaries, not to exceed      the aggregate amount that would have been paid under the fee-     for-service (FFS) delivery system. States must first      establish actuarially sound capitation rates prior to making      adjustments for GME.       These provisions are intended to prevent duplicate GME      payments under Medicaid managed care since states may make      supplemental GME payments directly to teaching hospitals      outside of provider payments assumed in capitation rates to      MCOs.     2.2 Do states bill for IME and GME using a consistent          methodology?       There appear to be no data that directly address how states      claim federal Medicaid matching dollars for payments related      to IME and DGME. These payments may be included in claims for      inpatient and outpatient hospital services when made on a FFS      or direct payment basis, and also may be represented in      claims for capitation rates paid to managed-care      organizations.       Survey data show that 48 states provided payment for DGME      and/or IME costs under their Medicaid programs. States use a      variety of methods to calculate IME and DGME payment amounts      under both FFS and managed care. Some states use more than      one method. For example, under FFS in 2005, 20 states      reported following Medicare's methodology; 12 used a per-     resident amount based on a teaching hospital's share of total      Medicaid revenues, costs or patient volume; 5 used a lump sum      amount; 4 used a per-Medicaid discharge amount; and 19 states      used other methods. Also, under FFS, states typically use two      methods to distribute GME payments to hospitals. Thirty-one      states included GME payments as part of the hospital's per-     case or per-diem rates, 20 states made a separate direct      payment to teaching hospitals, and 2 states used other      methods.       Under managed care, ten states recognized and included GME      payments in capitation rates for MCOs, but only two of those      10 required MCOs to distribute DGME/IME payments to teaching      hospitals; the other 8 states assumed MCOs provided these      payments to their participating hospitals.     2.3 Do all states separate out IME and GME in billing CMS?       Data do not appear to be available with which to directly      answer this question. However, according to the AAMC survey,      in 2005, 11 states reported that their GME payments to      providers did not distinguish between IME and DGME under at      least one delivery system (FFS, managed care, or both).     2.4 Does CMS know how much they are being billed for IME and          GME?       States are not required to report GME payments separately      from other payments made for inpatient and outpatient      hospital services when claiming federal matching payments      under Medicaid. For the Medicaid GME proposed rule published      in the May 23, 2007 Federal Register, CMS used an earlier      version of the AAMC survey data as a base for its savings      estimate and made adjustments for inflation and expected      state behavioral changes, for example.     3.0 School-based Services     3.1 Based on the original intention of the program, are          states under-funded by the federal government for the          provision of IDEA services?       States, school districts, interest groups, and parents of      children with disabilities often argue that the federal      government is not living up to its obligation to `fully fund'      Part B of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act      (IDEA, P.L. 108-446) (the grants-to-states program). This      argument can be made on one of two grounds.       First, when IDEA was enacted in 1975, the Congress set a      goal (or made a promise--depending on one's interpretation of      the legislative history) to fund up to 40% of the excess cost      of providing special education and related services to      children with disabilities. The metric used to measure excess      cost is the national average per pupil expenditure (APPE).      Appropriations for Part B have never reached the 40% level.      Current appropriations represent about 17%. Based on this      goal, promise, or intent, one can argue that IDEA has been      under-funded.       Another argument for under-funding can be based on      authorization levels contained in the Act. The 2004      reauthorization of IDEA added specific authorization levels      for FY2005 to FY2011. The authorization levels were intended      to provide a path to ``full funding'' by FY2011. The FY2008      authorization is $19.2 billion while the FY2008 appropriation      is $10.9 billion. So the current appropriation is below the      ``full funding'' level, which would be about $25 billion for      FY2008, and it is significantly below the FY2008      authorization level, which was meant to be a target on the      path to eventual ``full funding.''     3.2 Are school-based transportation services focused largely          on children who are receiving IDEA services?       When certain conditions are met, the costs of      transportation from home to school and back home again may      receive federal matching funds as a Medicaid benefit. These      conditions are: (1) the child receiving the transportation      must be enrolled in Medicaid and receiving services pursuant      to an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) or Individualized      Family Service Plan (IFSP) under IDEA, (2) the need for      specialized transportation must be listed in the child's IEP      or IFSP, (3) the transportation is billed on a day when the      child receives a medically necessary Medicaid covered service      in school pursuant to the IEP or IFSP, and (4) the school or      school district that is billing for the transportation must      be a certified Medicaid provider. In this context,      ``specialized transportation'' means the child requires      transportation in a vehicle adapted to serve the needs of      individuals with disabilities, including a specially adapted      school bus. In addition, if a child resides in an area that      does not have school bus transportation (e.g., areas in close      proximity to school), but has a medical need for      transportation that is noted in the IEP, that transportation      may also be billed to Medicaid. Transportation from school to      a provider in the community may also be billed to Medicaid      for both Medicaid/IDEA children and Medicaid/non-IDEA      children. These policies apply whether the state is claiming      FFP for transportation as medical assistance or      administration.       There does not appear to be data that show the proportion      of school-based transportation services that are provided to      Medicaid/IDEA versus Medicaid/non-IDEA children. It is      generally assumed that such transportation is predominantly      provided to Medicaid/IDEA children.     4.0 Rehabilitation Services     4.1 Do states bill CMS for rehabilitation services and how          much has it increased recently?       There are two reporting mechanisms that states may use to      report expenditures for optional rehabilitation services: the      Form HCFA-64 and MSIS. States report expenditures on the Form      HCFA-64, a quarterly financial accounting reporting form.      There is a separate category on the HCFA-64 form where states      may report optional rehabilitation services. States report      rehabilitation expenditures through Medicaid Statistical      Information System (MSIS). MSIS data are derived from      individual paid Medicaid claims. Even though there is a      category for reporting rehabilitative service expenditures,      states have discretion in deciding which paid claims will be      classified as rehabilitative services.       States report rehabilitation expenditures to CMS when      claiming FFP. States or fiscal agents receive bills or      Medicaid claims for payment from providers (e.g., hospitals,      physicians, physical therapists, psychologists, social      workers, nurses, and other providers). Claims submitted to      Medicaid are verified that they meet certain requirements and      electronically checked before being paid.       As shown in Table 1, in FY2005 total federal and state      Medicaid expenditures reported via MSIS as rehabilitation      services were approximately $6.4 billion. In FY1999, states      reported MSIS rehabilitation expenditures of approximately      $3.6 billion. Between FY1999 and FY2005, federal and state      Medicaid rehabilitation expenditures increased by 77.7%. In      FY1999, 1.2 million beneficiaries received rehabilitation      services; but by FY2005, the number of beneficiaries      receiving     rehabilitation had increased by 36.2% to more than 1.6      million. Further, average per beneficiary rehabilitation      expenditures increased by approximately 30% between FY1999      and FY2005. In FY2005 six states reported no rehabilitation      services expenditures and another state reported only 2      beneficiaries received rehabilitation services.TABLE 1: MEDICAID REHABILITATION SERVICES EXPENDITURES AND BENEFICIARIES                           FY 2005 AND FY 1999------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                              Percent             Item                 FY1999        FY2005     Change FY1999-                                                               FY2005------------------------------------------------------------------------Beneficiaries................     1,207,543     1,645,095           36.2Expenditures, Federal and              $3.6          $6.4           77.7 State (in billions).........Average $/Beneficiary........        $3,020        $3,916         29.7%------------------------------------------------------------------------Source: Medicaid Statistical Information System (MSIS), FY1999 and  FY2005, downloaded March 6, 2008. FY2004 MSIS data for Maine were used  as an estimate of state expenditures for Rehabilitation in FY2005.     4.2  Is there clear guidance to states for appropriate          billing for rehabilitation services so that states bill          on a consistent basis?       Guidance for claiming rehabilitation service expenditures      and receiving FFP can be found in Section 1901 [42 U.S.C.      1396] of the Social Security Act (SSA) which gives states the      option to cover rehabilitation services. Section 1905(a)(13)      of SSA, and Medicaid regulations [42 CFR 440.130(d)] define      rehabilitation services broadly as ``any medical or remedial      services recommended by a physician or other licensed      practitioner of the healing arts, within the scope of his or      her practice under State law, for maximum reduction of      physical or mental disability and restoration of a recipient      to his best possible functional level.''       States may receive more explicit guidance on what specific      services may be included as rehabilitation when preparing and      submitting state plan amendments to CMS' Regional Central      Offices. CMS' Regional and Central Office staff must review      and approve all SPAs before a state may add or change a      service.       In addition, a state Medicaid director letter (SMDL) was      issued by CMS in June 1992 (#FME-42) that provided states      some guidance on using the rehabilitation option as a vehicle      for providing services to mentally ill beneficiaries. This      letter reiterated regulatory guidance that rehabilitation      services were intended to be ``medical and remedial in nature      for the maximum reduction of physical or mental disability      and restoration of a recipient to his best possible      functional level.'' The letter offered some examples of      services that states could cover under the rehabilitation      option including: basic living skills, social skills, and      counseling and therapy. The SMDL also described examples of      services CMS believed to fall outside of the definition of      rehabilitation including: vocational training, direct      personal care services, case management (case management is      covered under a separate benefit option).       There have been several attempts to clarify in statute and      regulation what activities states may cover as rehabilitation      services. These administrative and legislative activities      strived to define how rehabilitation service benefits should      be used as well as to control or reduce states'      rehabilitation service expenditures. For example, the      Secretary approved a few states to cover habilitative      services in the 1970s and 1980s under the rehabilitation      option for individuals with mental retardation. Habilitative,      in contrast to rehabilitative services, are intended to help      individuals acquire, retain, and improve self-help and      adaptive skills, but are not intended to remove or reduce      individuals' disabilities. The Secretary later withdrew      approval for habilitative services, because the services were      determined to not meet conditions to qualify for the      rehabilitation benefit.       In 1989, with passage of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation      Act of 1989 [Sec. 6411(g), P.L. 101-239)], Congress      intervened and specifically allowed states that already had      received the Secretary's approval to cover habilitative      services for individuals with mental retardation to continue      to cover these services. Congress disallowed other states      from being approved to cover habilitative services for mental      retardation.     4.3  Is there clear guidance to states so that they can tell          when they should be billing Medicaid for rehabilitation          services or another program?       States need initial CMS' approval for state plan amendments      to offer services for rehabilitation. There is limited formal      guidance for states in Medicaid statutes and regulations on      how to determine when medically necessary services should be      billed as rehabilitation services. However, there is some      informal guidance that states could utilize from GAO and HHS/     OIG reports as well as audits, SPA denials, disallowances,      and deferrals (see footnotes in next section).       Guidance also is often provided on a state-by-state basis      from CMS' Regional Office staff. CMS' Central Office staff in      the Center for Medicaid and State Operations also may provide      individual state guidance on what services might be claimed      as rehabilitation services.     4.4  Is there a clear definition for states of what          constitutes `rehabilitation'?       Section 1905(a)(13) of SSA, and Medicaid regulations [42      CFR 440.130(d)] define rehabilitation services broadly as      ``any medical or remedial services recommended by a physician      or other licensed practitioner of the healing arts, within      the scope of his or her practice under State law, for maximum      reduction of physical or mental disability and restoration of      a recipient to his best possible functional level.''       In 2006, 47 states and the District of Columbia covered      rehabilitation services. Rehabilitation services can be      difficult to describe because the rehabilitation benefit is      so broad that it has been described as a catchall. Services      provided under the Medicaid rehabilitation optional benefit      span a broad range of treatments from physical rehabilitation      to behavioral health and substance abuse treatment, but there      may not be consensus on one definition of Medicaid      rehabilitation. GAO in particular has attributed confusion      about the rehabilitation benefit to the lack of clear      guidance and inconsistent enforcement of existing regulations      across states and CMS Regions. Some states have been audited      and faced subsequent disallowances and claim denials, while      other states have been permitted to continue similar      rehabilitation claiming practices.       Often Medicaid rehabilitation services assist beneficiaries      who have mental-health conditions. In one study, nearly 80%      of MSIS claims that states classified as rehabilitation      expenditures, contained a diagnosis for mental health.      Programs like the New Freedom Initiative that encouraged      better integration and acceptance of mental health treatments      and settings might have led states to utilize Medicaid      rehabilitation benefits to reach mentally-ill beneficiaries.      Also, state initiatives to close psychiatric facilities may      have contributed to a surge in utilization of the Medicaid      rehabilitation benefit for providing treatment to individuals      with mental illness. Although mental health services are      important, even dominant components of states rehabilitation      service benefits, they are not the only services encompassed      by the benefit. States also utilize rehabilitation to assist      beneficiaries with services such as physical, occupational,      and speech therapy, as well as other comprehensive services      to treat and help individuals recover from substance abuse      disorders.     5.0 Targeted Case Management (TCM)     5.1 How do states bill CMS for case management services and          how much has it increased recently?       In 2006, only Delaware did not cover TCM. Most states      report TCM expenditures in their Medicaid Statistical      Information Systems (MSIS) data. MSIS data are derived from      paid Medicaid claims. In FY2005, six states and the District      of Columbia did not report any TCM expenditures in the MSIS      data. In addition, states report Medicaid expenditures to CMS      to claim FFP using a financial accounting form (Form HCFA-     64). The HCFA-64 has a reporting line for targeted case      management. In FY2006, total federal and state expenditures      for TCM reported on the HCFA-64, were $2.8 billion      (individual state-by-state expenditures were not available      from this data source). Expenditures reported on the HCFA-64      and MSIS data for the same years can vary considerably, since      these systems for capturing and reporting Medicaid activity      are independent of each other. HCFA-64 data were for FY2006,      while the most recently available MSIS data were reported for      FY2005.       Medicaid expenditures for TCM have increased rapidly. As      shown in Table 2, between FY1999 and FY2005, total federal      and state TCM expenditures reported in MSIS more than doubled      from $1.41 billion in FY1999 to $2.9 billion in FY2005. For      the same period, the total number of beneficiaries increased      62.6% from approximately 1.7 million in FY1999 to      approximately 2.7 million in FY2005. The average expenditures      per beneficiary also increased during the period FY1999-     FY2005 rising by nearly 27%, from $834 in FY1999 to $1,058 in      FY2005.

FY2004 MSIS data for Maine were used  as an estimate of state expenditures for TCM in FY2005.     5.2 Is there clear guidance to states for appropriate billing          for case management services so that states bill on a          consistent basis?       Guidance for states on appropriate claiming of federal      financial participation for TCM can be found in a number of      official and unofficial sources including: a 2001 letter to      state Medicaid and child welfare directors (SMDL 01-013); the      Medicaid statute, Sections 1905(a)(19) and 1915(g) of the      SSA; Section 6052 of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA,      P.L. 109-171); Medicaid regulations at 42 CFR Parts 431, 440,      and 441 (Sec. Sec. 440.169 for TCM definition); the state      Medicaid manual at Section 4302, Optional Targeted Case      Management Services--Basis, Scope, and Purpose; CMS' Regional      Office staff and CMS' Central Office state representatives;      unofficial sources, such as reports from Health and Human      Services (HHS) Office of Inspector General and the U.S.      Government Accountability Office (GAO); and denials and      approvals of state plan amendments.       In reviewing states use of contingency contractors, GAO      found that CMS has allowed some states to continue to claim      for TCM services even though other states were denied      approval for state plan amendments for     similar proposals to provide TCM services. In addition, some      states received disallowances, deferrals, and denials for      TCM services, while other states were not audited for      similar practices. States received guidance on TCM      claiming for foster care in a January 2001 letter to state      Medicaid and child welfare directors (#01-013). This      letter reiterated the statutory definition of TCM and      described services ``commonly understood to be allowable''      as case management including: (1) assessment of the      eligible individual to determine service needs, (2)      development of a specific care plan, (3) referral and      related activities to help the individual obtain needed      services, and (4) monitoring and follow-up. Moreover, CMS      added that, ``In general, allowable [case management]      activities are those that include assistance in accessing      a medical or other service, but do not include the direct      delivery of the underlying service.'' Although there has      been guidance for individual states and some indirect      guidance and discussion on TCM claiming, states have      received limited written national guidance from CMS.       HHS/OIG and GAO have documented what they describe as      states' attempts to maximize FFP by claiming additional TCM.      These tactics include the use of contingency contractors who      allegedly assisted states in exploiting ambiguity in Medicaid      statutes and regulations to claim additional FFP. Another      tactic CMS and GAO cite that states use to increase Medicaid      matching funds is the practice of paying for direct services      delivered by staff of other state social services programs,      such as schools, juvenile justice, parole, child welfare, and      foster care programs. Furthermore, CMS and GAO have cited      problems with states' use of cost allocation plans that      duplicate claiming for administrative expenses by several      programs. CMS has repeatedly cited these abuses as rationale      for explicit and comprehensive TCM regulation.     5.3 Is there clear guidance to states so that they can tell          when they should be billing Medicaid for case management          services or another program?       States may find guidance on whether services should be      billed as Medicaid case management/TCM or as components of      other programs: the state Medicaid manual at Section 4302,      Optional Targeted Case Management Services--Basis, Scope, and      Purpose; a 2001 letter to state Medicaid and child welfare      directors [(SMDL 01-013), see reference in previous section];      HHS/OIG audits, such as (A-07-06-03078) [see footnote below];      Sec. 6052 of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, (DRA, P.L.      109-171); denials and approvals of state plan amendments; and      CMS's Regional Office staff and CMS's Central Office state      representatives.       Although there may be a number of issues related to      claiming FFP for Medicaid addressed in these sources, at      least two issues have been sources of confusion,      misunderstanding, and dispute. One issue where there has been      misunderstanding is non-duplication of payments. Guidance for      states on non-duplication of payments can be found in the      State Medicaid Manual, ``Payment for case management services      under 1915(g) of the [SSA] Act may not duplicate payments      made to public agencies or private entities under the program      authorities for this same purpose.'' States can not receive      Medicaid FFP for services provided to beneficiaries who      received these services from other state agencies, such as      schools, foster care, child welfare, and juvenile justice.      However, there has been misinterpretation and disagreement      about claiming of a share of administrative costs      attributable to other programs where there is overlap between      Medicaid and other state programs (e.g., foster care, special      education, and juvenile justice). The aforementioned sources      advise states to allocate administrative costs between the      overlapping programs in accordance with OMB Circular A-87      under an approved cost allocation plan.       Another area where there has been some disagreement is over      the direct delivery of services by other programs where      Medicaid is then charged for the direct services provided by      the other program. A letter to state Medicaid directors      (January 19, 2001, SMDL 01-013) indicates that FFP would not      be available for the direct delivery of services by another      program:       ``Unallowable services: Medicaid case management services      do not include payment for the provision of direct services      (medical, educational, or social) to which the Medicaid-     eligible individual has been referred. For example, if a      child has been referred to a state foster care program, any      activities performed by the foster care case worker that      relate directly to the provision of foster care services      cannot be covered as [Medicaid] case management.''       Subsequent HHS/OIG audits recommended that CMS establish      policies and procedures to ensure state FFP claims do not      include direct medical services.
