I have attended more judiciary hearings, voted on more judicial nominations, than virtually anybody in this body, with the exception of the distinguished President pro tem, who tells me he may have been doing them in Thomas Jefferson's time. But for the rest of us, I have. I have never seen it go quite so slowly. In 1996, 1997 and again this year the Senate has been moving slowly with respect to a number of judicial nominees.  We are trying to work that out. Obviously, it is not going to get solved today. I do not want to get having to invoke cloture on judicial nominations. I think it is a bad precedent. That may be necessary.
