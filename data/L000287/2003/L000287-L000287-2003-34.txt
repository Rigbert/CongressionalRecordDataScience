Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank all of the Members who participated this morning and thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Ose) for yielding so much time.  Mr. Speaker, I want to say to the family and friends of Maynard Jackson and to all of the citizens of Atlanta and the citizens of our Nation that we have lost a son of America, a citizen of the world. Maynard Jackson was a very proud graduate of Morehouse College. He loved the school, the glee club; he loved the citizens of our city. He will be deeply missed, but we take this as an opportunity to honor and pay tribute to him for all of the good things that he did to make our city, our State, our Nation, and our world a better place.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
