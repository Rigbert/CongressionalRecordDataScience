Speaker, I rise as the proud sponsor of this legislation.  First, let me thank Chairman Bishop, Ranking Member Grijalva, and all the staff of the Natural Resources Committee for their hard work and support of this act.  Mr. Speaker, my bipartisan bill will create the first National Historic Park in the State of Georgia. This technical change from a ``Site'' to a ``Park'' will make it easier for the National Park Service to share the history of the American civil rights movement with national and international visitors to Atlanta.  These historic spaces are located in my congressional district in downtown Atlanta, on and around Auburn Avenue. This is where Dr. King was born and raised, where he was nurtured and taught, where he preached and loved.  I was a teenager when I first met Dr. King in 1958, at the age of 18. This conversation forever changed my life, but I was not the only one. Many, many people were touched by this man's genius and compassion for all humankind. Dr. King's mission was to create the beloved community, a community of justice, a community at peace with itself.  Dr. King had the power to bring people together to do good. His message was love, his weapon was truth, and the method was the way of nonviolence and passive resistance.  Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., led a nonviolent movement that changed the face of our Nation. He inspired people from all over our country and from all over the world.  My simple act will improve the services and educational opportunities for visitors to this wonderful space and this wonderful piece of history. It will preserve this important part of our history for generations yet unborn.  Again, I would like to thank the chair and ranking member for their support, and I urge all of my colleagues to support this simple, commonsense legislation.
