 George has served in the Ohio statehouse, as Ohio's Lieutenant Governor, as the mayor of Cleveland, as Governor of Ohio, and as a U.S. Senator. That is quite a record of accomplishment. When George walks out of the Chamber for the last time, he will have served 44 years in public service.  Yet in a career that has taken him from Cleveland to Columbus to Washington and around the world, George has always made time for his family, and no one was surprised when in January 2009 he announced that he planned to retire at the end of this year in order to spend more time with Janet.  George and Janet have been married for nearly half a century and they have seen a lot together. George grew up in the same working class neighborhood in Cleveland where he and Janet still call home today. He attended Collinwood High School, Ohio University, and Ohio State University for law school. After practicing law for several years in Cleveland, he began his political career in 1963 as an assistant attorney general of Ohio. Three years later, at the tender age of 30, George was elected to the Ohio statehouse.
