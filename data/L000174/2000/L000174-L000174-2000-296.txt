 I suggest this as an alternative to some of my colleagues. A number of matters are things that could just as well be handled in report language.  The Senator from Kentucky and I, in some of those instances, have been able to work that out. With the help of both the Republican leadership and the Democratic leadership, we have been able to get rid of many of these amendments. I think we are so close to working out the suggestion the distinguished Senator from Mississippi has made, that Senators should look at that. It is one that is strongly supported by the managers of this bill. I hope we might make it possible to do it.
