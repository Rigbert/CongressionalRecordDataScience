 President, today the Senate turned to the Homeland Security appropriations bill. Senators who have amendments to offer to this bill should contact the bill managers, Senator Gregg and Senator Byrd. The bill managers were here today and will be back tomorrow morning ready to move forward on amendments. We expect votes to occur throughout the day tomorrow, and obviously we will notify everyone once those are scheduled.                          ____________________[Page S7287]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                                PROGRAM  Mr. McCONNELL.
