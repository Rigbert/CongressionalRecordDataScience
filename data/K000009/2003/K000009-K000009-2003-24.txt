What we are being given are half measures, empty promises and what is becoming more and more confusing at the local county level. No State standards, no Federal standards, and not enough money. America really deserves better. If we can afford to spend $4 billion a month in Iraq to secure democracy, can we not afford to spend $3 billion over 3 years in our own country to help secure our democratic voting systems here in this Republic? I think it is really an important question for the Congress. In hopes of resolving this issue amicably, I will withdraw my amendment at this point in hopes that we might be able to deal with it in the upcoming supplemental.  Mr. Chairman, I include the following material for the Record:            [From the Cleveland Plain Dealer, Aug. 28, 2003]                       Voting Machine Controversy                         (By Julie Carr Smyth)       Columbus.--The head of a company vying to sell voting      machines in Ohio told Republicans in a recent fund-raising      letter that he is ``committed to helping Ohio deliver its      electoral votes to the president next year.''       The Aug. 14 letter from Walden O'Dell, chief executive of      Diebold Inc.--who has become active in the re-election effort      of President Bush--prompted Democrats this week to question      the propriety of allowing O'Dell's company to calculate votes      in the 2004 presidential election.       O'Dell attended a strategy pow-wow with wealthy Bush      benefactors--known as Rangers and Pioneers--at the      president's Crawford, Texas, ranch earlier this month. The      next week, he penned invitations to a $1,000-a-plate fund-     raiser to benefit the Ohio Republican Party's federal      campaign fund--partially benefiting Bush--at his mansion in      the Columbus suburb of Upper Arlington.       The letter went out the day before Ohio Secretary of State      Ken Blackwell, also a Republic, was set to qualify Diebold as      one of three firms eligible to sell upgraded electronic      voting machines to Ohio counties in time for the 2004      election.       Blackwell's announcement is still in limbo because of a      court challenge over the fairness of the selection process by      a disqualified bidder, Sequoia Voting Systems.       In his invitation letter, O'Dell asked guests to consider      donating or raising up to $10,000 each for the federal      account that the state GOP will use to help Bush and other      federal candidates--money that legislative Democratic leaders      charged could come back to benefit Blackwell.       They urged Blackwell to remove Diebold from the field of      voting-machine companies eligible to sell to Ohio counties.       This is the second such request in as many months. State      Sen. Jeff Jacobson, a Dayton-area Republic an, asked      Blackwell in July to disqualify Diebold after security      concerns arose over its equipment.       ``Ordinary Ohioans may infer that Blackwell's office is      looking past Diebold's security issues because it CEO is      seeking $10,000 donations for Blackwell's party--donations      that could be made with statewide elected officials right      here in the same room,'' said Senate Democratic Leader Greg      DiDonato.       Diebold spokeswoman Michelle Griggy said O'Dell--who was      unavailable to comment personally--has held fund-raisers in      his home for many causes, including the Columbus Zoo,      Opera Columbus, Catholic Social Services and Ohio State      University.       Ohio GOP spokesman Jason Mauk said the party approached      O'Dell about hosting the event at his home, the historic      Cotswold Manor, and not the other way around. Mauk said that      under federal campaign finance rules, the party cannot use      any money from its federal account for state-level      candidates.       ``To think that Diebold is somehow tainted because they      have a couple folks on their board who support the president      is just unfair,'' Mauk said.       Griggly said in an e-mail statement that Diebold could not      comment on the political contributions of individual company      employees.       Blackwell said Diebold is not the only company with      political connections--nothing that lobbyists for voting-     machine makers read like a who's who of Columbus' powerful      and politically connected.       ``Let me put it to you this way: If there was one person      uniquely involved in the political process, that might be      troubling,'' he said. ``But there's no one that hasn't used      every legitimate avenue and bit of leverage that they could      legally use to get their product looked at. Believe me, if      there is a political lever to be pulled, all of them have      pulled it.''       Blackwell said he stands by the process used for selecting      voting machine vendors as fair, thorough and impartial.       As of yesterday, however, that determination lay with Ohio      Court of Claims Judge Fred Shoemaker.       He heard closing arguments yesterday over whether Sequoia      was unfairly eliminated by Blackwell midway through the final      phase of negotiations.       Shoemaker extended a temporary restraining order in the      case for 14 days, but said he hopes to issue his opinion      sooner than that.                                  ____                 [From the Toledo Blade, Sept. 3, 2003]                          The Diebold Dilemma       Did the head of an Ohio company hoping to land a big job      with the state to supply upgraded electronic voting machines      for the 2004 elections simply commit a faux pax? Or did the      high-level fund-raising activity Diebold's CEO has undertaken      for the Bush re-election campaign give his company a      calculated edge in securing a lucrative state contract?       Either way the actions of chief executive Walden O'Dell and      the response of Ohio's Republican Secretary of State Ken      Blackwell raise inevitable and troubling questions about the      influence of money and politics on government decisions--     especially ones as sensitive as the operation of election      systems.       Mr. O'Dell is not just a contributor to GOP campaigns; he's      at the top of the fund-raising food chain. Recently,      according to published reports, he attended a strategy      session at the president's Crawford, Texas, ranch with other      top Bush benefactors known as ``Rangers'' or ``Pioneers,''      depending on the impressive amount of campaign money raised      for the Bush war chest.       No doubt inspired by his inclusion in the elite circle of      wealthy Bush backers, Diebold's CEO sent an impassioned fund-     raising letter to Ohio Republicans declaring that he is      ``committed to helping Ohio deliver its electoral votes to      the President next year.'' The bad judgment from the head of      a firm trying to sell voting machines to the state is      obvious.       Moreover, in his note to party members pledging to deliver      Ohio to the President, Mr. O'Dell invited partisans to a      $1,000-a-plate fund-raiser at his Columbus area mansion and      nudged them to also consider donating or raising an      additional $10,000 each for the state of GOP's use on federal      campaigns.       Interestingly the missive was mailed the day before      Secretary of State Blackwell was due to name Diebold as one      of three firms eligible to sell voting machines to Ohio      counties. The Blackwell announcement was delayed by a court      challenge over the fairness of the state's bidding process by      one of the disqualified contenders.       Mr. Blackwell, who insists that state voting machine      vendors were selected fairly and impartially, downplayed the      political connections of Diebold's chief executive as par for      the course in legitimate Columbus lobbying for influence and      attention.       That may be so, but the appearance of conflict is clear      when a company that is spending money to influence the      outcome of an election also wants to help count the votes.       Democratic lawmakers in Ohio say that's disturbing enough      to warrant disqualifying Diebold from selling voting machines      in this state. Two months ago Republican state Sen. Jeff      Jacobson from Dayton asked Mr. Blackwell to do the same thing      when security concerns were raised about some of Diebold's      equipment.       Now critics are wondering if Mr. Blackwell's office      overlooked problems with Diebold because its CEO had      prominent GOP connections. It is premature to urge Diebold's      disqualification from the field of eligible vendors, but the      issue warrants the state's careful attention.                                  ____            [From the Cleveland Plain Dealer, Sept. 1, 2003]                        Taking Sides at Diebold       In a perfect world, companies that make voting equipment      would be apolitical. But it's not a perfect world.       Still, you would think that the CEO of a company that wants      to make a lot of money selling voting machines to Ohio would      see the value of at least pretending impartiality. Instead,      Diebold Chief Executive Walden O'Dell committed himself in a      recent fund-raising letter to work to ``deliver [Ohio's]      electoral votes'' to President George W. Bush.       The letter accompanied invitations to a $1,000-a-plate      fund-raiser at O'Dell's Upper Arlington mansion--an      invitation issued days after he attended a strategy session      with major contributors at Bush's ranch in Crawford, Texas.       O'Dell's firm public commitment to work for a particular      candidate--while Diebold is engaged in a vigorous competition      to provide voting machines to Ohio--gives Democrats powerful      ammunition to use against his company.       Ohio, like many other states, decided it was time to retire      its punch-card machines after the Florida voting debacle      during the 2000 presidential election. And allegations have      been rampant recently that Ohio Secretary of State Ken      Blackwell would like to see the contract go to Canton-based      Diebold.       That's going to be harder sell now.       Makers of voting equipment routinely give to political      parties and candidates even as they are seeking lucrative      public contracts. That's bad enough. But O'Dell is setting      himself up as an integral part of Bush's re-election      apparatus. That's too close for comfort.       If Diebold just made ATM's and industrial safes, his      actions would not be an issue. But Diebold wants Ohioans to      trust it to be fair and accurate in recording and tabulating      their choices at the polls. That requires impartiality. And      in the wake of O'Dell's letter, impartiality is not a trait      anyone can associate with Diebold at the moment.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore.
