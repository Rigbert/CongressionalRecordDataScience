8 billion, which means if we had a whole pie and there were six slices, now we are down to less than three. And somehow or other the Department of Defense has to spread that money for BRAC construction to these other projects? That is going to be extremely difficult.  I am trying to figure out why on Earth the House acted in such a fashion. I think it is, if I read the press about this--and I ask the Senator if she would agree--it is that under the banner of ``earmark reform,'' there was at least a theory, by some, that all of the money in the $6 billion was somehow earmarks.  I ask another question. The $3.1 billion is the first time in my memory where we have had a breach in the agreement to say we are not going to fund nondefense programs--which are very meritorious and should stand on their own right, and I support many of them--out of the military budget. I can't remember when we have done that.
