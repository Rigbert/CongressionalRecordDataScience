 President, we were making great progress toward getting an agreement yesterday afternoon, and then Senator Warner at the last minute had a proposal he would like us to consider, and that slowed us down a little bit. But we are now reviewing that, and I share the optimism of the majority leader that we may be able to reach a unanimous consent agreement in the very near future that would allow us to wrap up this matter sometime today.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
