President, before I comment on the nomination, I would like to recognize and thank several people who have been very helpful in preparing my comments: Kara Stein, Justin Florence, and Sharon Rapport.  Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a series of letters from national organizations with respect to issues of church and state separation and the nomination of Judge Alito.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                   Americans United for Separation                                          of Church and State,                                 Washington, DC, January 10, 2006.     Hon. Arlen Specter,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Hart          Office Building, Washington, DC.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate,          Russell Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Specter and Ranking Member Leahy: Americans      United for Separation of Church and State urges you to oppose      the confirmation of Judge Samuel A. Alito, Jr. to be      Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.      Americans United for Separation of Church and State      represents more than 75,000 individual members and 9,500      clergy nationwide, as well as cooperating houses of worship      and other religious bodies committed to the preservation of      religious liberty. We oppose the confirmation of Judge Alito      to the Supreme Court because his record demonstrates that he      would fundamentally alter First Amendment law and immediately      put at risk many of the crucial protections for religious      minorities that the Supreme Court has recognized and      consistently enforced over the past sixty years.       Legal scholars have understood the First Amendment's      religion clauses as striking a balance between the religious      and political rights of individuals and groups within our      society. There is a necessary tension between the Free      Exercise Clause and the Establishment Clause, which serves to      balance the sometimes competing interests of individuals'      freedom of conscience against the requirement that the state      be neutral with respect to religious viewpoints. Justice      O'Connor has been successful in ensuring that public      expression did not turn into government favoritism or state      coercion of religious beliefs.       During his fifteen year tenure on the United States Court      of Appeals for the Third Circuit, however, Judge Alito has      shown himself to have a view of the First Amendment,      particularly of the Establishment Clause, that differs      dramatically from both Justice O'Connor's judicial philosophy      and the settled understanding of fundamental Establishment      Clause principles that has guided the Supreme Court's      decisions for at least six decades. Indeed, early on, Judge      Alito acknowledged his disagreement with the Supreme Court on      its Establishment Clause jurisprudence. When applying for a      position in the Reagan Administration Department of Justice,      Judge Alito declared that his ``deep interest in      constitutional law [was] motivated in large part by      disagreement with the Warren Court decisions, particularly in      areas [such as] the Establishment Clause. . . .'' As      evidenced by his longstanding appeals court record, we remain      concerned that such a motivation taints his view today.       There is much at stake for the future of religious liberty      as a result of Justice O'Connor's retirement and Judge      Alito's nomination to take her place on the Supreme Court. As      Justice O'Connor has recognized, it is vital that our      longstanding Establishment Clause protections remain in      place:       ``At a time when we see around the world the violent      consequences of the assumption of religious authority by      government, Americans may count themselves fortunate: Our      regard for constitutional boundaries has protected us from      similar travails, while allowing private religious exercise      to flourish. . . Those who would renegotiate the boundaries      between church and state must therefore answer a difficult      question: Why would we trade a system that has served us so      well for one that has served others so poorly?'' (McCreary      County, Kentucky v. ACLU of Kentucky, 125 S. Ct. 2722, 2746      (O'Connor, J., concurring)).       In the Establishment Clause area, replacing Justice      O'Connor with Judge Alito likely would have a profound effect      on the religious freedoms that our dual constitutional      commitments to free exercise and separation of church and      state have long ensured. Both the straightforward holdings      and the underlying tenor of Judge Alito's decisions in      Establishment Clause cases contrast sharply with Justice      O'Connor's views. Throughout her career on the Court, Justice      O'Connor has been keenly attuned to the plight of religious      minorities in society as a whole, and most especially in the      public schools. But Judge Alito's focus has been elsewhere:      on religious majorities' ability to express their views      through governmental instrumentalities, at government owned      facilities, and in government-organized enterprises like the      public schools. Judge Alito has given broad license to      religious majorities to use the public schools and other      official settings to broadcast their religious messages      without regard for the competing rights and interests of      religious minorities.       Because Judge Alito has not extended the same protections      to all Americans that he has granted to politically powerful      religious majorities, the Senate should decline to confirm      his appointment as an associate justice of the U.S. Supreme      Court.       If you have any questions on Americans United's position on      this nomination, please contact Aaron D. Schuham, Legislative      Director.           Sincerely,                                           Reverend Barry W. Lynn,     Executive Director.                                  ____                                       B'nai B'rith International,                                  Washington, DC, January 6, 2006.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: On behalf of B'nai B'rith International      and our more than 110,000 members and supporters, we write to      ask that the confirmation hearings of Judge Samuel Alito      deeply probe the nominee's judicial philosophy with regard to      issues of great concern to our organization. Founded in 1843,      B'nai B'rith is America's pioneer Jewish agency, with a wide      range of domestic and international public policy priorities.      Included in our agenda are several issues that we would like      to ask the Judiciary Committee to raise with Judge Alito:       (1) Church-State Relations. We hope the Committee will ask      Judge Alito which judicial test should be applied to      determine whether a particular government action violates the      First Amendment's Establishment Clause. It might be helpful      to ask if the nominee feels it is permissible for public      school officials to lead students in prayer or scriptural      readings, or whether he believes that public funds and public      property may be used for religious displays. We also would be      interested to learn whether Judge Alito believes that a      statute or ordinance requiring schools to give ``equal time''      to instruction in creationism or intelligent design would      violate constitutional principles.       (2) Asylum. B'nai B'rith hopes the Committee will ask the      nominee what standard should be applied to asylum claims by      individuals facing persecution in their homelands. We would      be interested to know what threshold of harm, or risk of      harm, a person fleeing a repressive society must demonstrate      before receiving asylum in the United States.       (3) Workplace Discrimination. B'nai B'rith would like to      hear Judge Alito's views on the standard that should be      applied to cases of age, disability, or sexual discrimination      in the workplace. It would be useful to know the nominee's      position on the burden of proof an older worker must meet to      demonstrate that he or she has been passed over for      promotion, denied accommodation, or unfairly rejected as a      job applicant because of his or her age or disability.       Thank you for your attention and consideration. B'nai      B'rith looks forward to remaining in communication with you      about this and other matters of mutual interest in the months      to come.           Respectfully,     Joel S. Kaplan,       President.     Daniel S. Mariaschin,       Executive Vice President.                                  ____         Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations,                                Washington, DC, December 15, 2005.Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations Urges Opposition to the Confirmation of Judge Samuel Alito Jr. to the United State Supreme                                  Court       Dear Senator: On behalf of the over 1,000 congregations      that make up the Unitarian Universalist Association, I urge      you to oppose the confirmation of Judge Samuel Alito Jr., to      the United States Supreme Court. After a careful review of      his decisions, and in particular dissents, we have concluded      that Judge Alito does not show sufficient respect for civil      liberties. His deciding vote on the court could undermine      fundamental rights for decades.       The decision to take a position on a judicial nominee is      not one the UUA takes up lightly--or frequently. Indeed, it      was only in 2004 that our highest policy-making body approved      language explicitly stating that the Association would oppose      nominees whose records demonstrated insensitivity to civil      liberties. We did not take a position on the confirmation of      either Judge John Roberts or Harriet Myers.       The nomination of Judge Samuel Alito Jr. is significantly      different, in that he has an extensive judicial record--more      than 15 years on the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals--that      clearly reveals his judicial philosophy on a wide range of      issues. After extensive research, Unitarian Universalist      Association staff agreed that Judge Alito's rulings      demonstrate a pattern of views that were outside the      mainstream and hostile to established precedent favoring      civil liberties. In case after case, Judge Alito found      against the rights of individuals in relation to government      or corporations. In at least six cases, the Supreme Court      voted to overturn decisions of the Third Circuit or Alito's      dissent in Third Circuit cases. Several notable cases and      patterns are mentioned below.       Police Power: In the case of Doe v. Groody, Judge Alito      dissented from a Third Circuit ruling that police officers      had violated clearly established constitutional rights.      Police had strip-searched a mother and her ten-year-old      daughter while executing a search warrant authorizing only      the search of her husband and their home. Then-Third Circuit      Judge Michael Chertoff, now Secretary of Homeland Security,      held that the unauthorized search violated ``clearly      established'' rights. Alito disagreed, arguing that even if      the warrant did not authorize the search, an officer still      could have read the warrant as allowing it.       Religious Liberty: In the case of ACLU-NJ v. Schundler,      Judge Alito held that religious symbols displayed on      government property during the holiday season (in this case a      creche and menorah) were not unconstitutional when      ``secular'' decorations such as Frosty the Snowman and Santa      Claus were subsequently added to the display. While Justice      O'Connor has voted to allow secular holiday displays, she has      rejected efforts for religious symbols, including the Ten      Commandments, to stand alone in public display.       In ACLU of New Jersey v. BlackHorse Pike Regional Board of      Education, Judge Alito joined a dissent from the Third      Circuit's ruling which struck down a public school board      policy allowing high school seniors to vote on whether to      include student-led prayer at their school-sponsored      graduation ceremonies. In a subsequent case (Santa Fe      Independent School District v. Doe), the Supreme Court, with      Justice O'Connor in the majority, struck down a public school      board policy allowing students to vote on whether to include      student-led prayer at high school football games.       Limiting Access to the Courts: Among the most troubling      pattern is Judge Alito's consistent finding that plaintiffs      in discrimination cases did not have enough evidence to bring      their cases to trial. By denying even the opportunity for      judicial remedies, Judge Alito's philosophy undermines one of      the most fundamental checks and balances in our system of      government. For example:       Judge Alito has strongly disagreed with Third Circuit      rulings protecting the civil rights of African Americans. In      Bray v. Marriot Hotels, Alito disputed a ruling by Theodore      McKee--the Circuit's only African American judge--allowing a      race discrimination case to go to trial. McKee said that      Alito's position would ``immunize an employer from the reach      of Title VII if the employer's belief that it had selected      the `best' candidate, was the result of conscious racial      bias.''       Judge Alito has narrowly construed statutes in gender      discrimination cases. In Sheridan v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours      and Co., Alito was the only judge to dissent from a ruling      clarifying the nature of evidence permitting a jury to find      an employer engaged in discrimination. Alito's position would      have denied the plaintiff the opportunity to go to trial      despite significant evidence of discrimination.       Judge Alito's dissents would have made it harder for      victims of discrimination based on disability to prove their      cases. In Nathanson v. Medical College of Pennsylvania, the      majority lamented that under Alito's restrictive standard for      proving discrimination based on disability under the      Rehabilitation Act of 1973, ``few if any Rehabilitation Act      cases would survive summary judgment.''       Reproductive Freedom: Dissenting in Planned Parenthood v.      Casey, Judge Alito wrote that the right to reproductive      freedom does not prevent states from requiring women to      notify their spouses, except in limited circumstances, before      getting an abortion. Justice O'Connor cast the deciding vote      rejecting Judge Alito's position. Joined by Justices Kennedy      and Souter, O'Connor held that the provision Alito supported      harkened back to the days when ``a woman had no legal      existence separate from her husband'' and created an undue      burden on a woman's ability to obtain an abortion.                            We Are Not Alone       When the Unitarian Universalist Association makes a      decision to adopt a particular stance, we generally find      ourselves in the company of other religious organizations      with similar views. This holds true for our opposition to the      confirmation of Judge Alito.       In late November, the biennial convention of the Union for      Reform Judaism--the largest branch of Judaism in North      America--voted overwhelmingly to oppose Judge Alito's      confirmation, saying that it ``would threaten protection of      the most fundamental rights'' that the Reform Movement      supports. ``On choice, women's rights, civil rights and the      scope of federal power,'' Alito would ``shift the ideological      balance of the Supreme Court on matters of core concern to      the Reform Movement,'' according to the resolution adopted by      the more than 2,000 voting delegates from more than 500      congregations in all 50 states.       Both our denominations reviewed Judge Alito's rulings and      found that his record did not support our stated values. The      Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations criteria      and supporting materials are available at http://www.uua.org/. Materials from the Union for Reform Judaism can      be found at http://urj.org.       Liberty is at the core of our Unitarian Universalist faith.      Civil liberties are at the heart of our American experiment      in democracy. Those civil liberties guaranteed by the Bill of      Rights are as fundamental to our practice of democracy as      freedom of conscience is to our religion. We believe that      Judge Alito's philosophy does not sufficiently respect these      fundamental rights, and we urge you to oppose his      confirmation.           In Faith,                                                Robert C. Keithan,                                                         Director.                                       ____                                          Women of Reform Judaism,                                    New York, NY, January 9, 2006.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Ranking Member, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, U.S.          Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: Recognizing the profound significance      of the Judiciary Committee hearings on the nomination of      Judge Samuel Alito, Jr. to the United States Supreme Court      for the future of jurisprudence in the United States, Women      of Reform Judaism, comprised of 75,000 members in 550      affiliates in North America urges you to oppose his      confirmation.       Women of Reform Judaism rarely opposes judicial      nominations. Its resolution ``Judicial and Executive Branch      Nominations'' adopted in 2004, however, emphasizes the need      for balance of legal and social perspectives on the federal      bench. This resolution also enables Women of Reform Judaism      to oppose judicial candidates whose record demonstrates      opposition to the core values, rights and principles      supported by our organization.       In his years in the Reagan Administration and on the Third      Circuit Court of Appeals, Judge Alito has been a strong and      consistent voice for restricting women's rights, extending      police powers and destroying the wall separating church and      state in schools and in community religious displays. Judge      Alito has also taken anti-affirmative action positions and      has supported stringent barriers in discrimination cases.      Judge Alito's vote could be a crucial one on the court in all      these areas and more, replacing the balance provided by      Justice Sandra Day O'Connor with a marked shift that would      endanger the civil liberties and civil rights of the people      of the United States.       Committed to the precepts of our tradition and adhering to      the words of Deuteronomy, which tell us to pursue justice      (Deuteronomy 16:20), we look to the Supreme Court to protect      the civil liberties and civil rights of all Americans. Based      on his record, we are concerned that Judge Alito will be      unable to put aside his private views to dispense equal      justice for all and oppose his confirmation.           Respectfully,     Shelley Lindauer,     Rosanne M. Solfon.                                  ____                                           Religious Action Center                                            of Reform Judaism,                                 Washington, DC, January 11, 2006.     Hon. Arlen Specter,     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Specter and Leahy: As you consider the      nomination of Judge Samuel Alito Jr. to the Supreme Court of      the United States, we write on behalf of the Union for Reform      Judaism, encompassing 1.5 million Reform Jews in 900      congregations across' North America, to express our      opposition to Judge Alito's nomination.       Our decision to oppose Judge Alito's nomination was not      taken lightly. During the debate on the nomination at our      recent Biennial General Assembly Reform Jews old enough to      remember the significant role the Supreme Court played in      extending basic human and civil rights to all Americans      cautioned the delegates about the danger of a Court whose      members have records in opposition to defending those rights.      Our Movement's youth spoke of cherished constitutional rights      that, with but one Supreme Court justice's vote changing the      balance of the court, could be undone, altering their lives      and those of the generations to follow. The older members did      not want to leave this legacy, and the youth did not want to      inherit it.       In 2002, the Union for Reform Judaism adopted a resolution      that established our criteria for considering nominees to the      federal courts. Under these criteria, which are not limited      to issues of character or professional competence, we will      oppose a nominee in those rare cases in which after      consideration of what the nominee has said and written, and      his or her record, a compelling case can be made that the      appointment would threaten protection of the most fundamental      rights which our Movement supports. Based on these criteria,      in November of 2005 we resolved to oppose the nomination of      Judge Samuel Alito Jr. to the Supreme Court of the United      States believing that:       Judge Alito's elevation to the Supreme Court would threaten      protection of the most fundamental rights which our Movement      supports including, but not limited to, reproductive freedom,      the separation between church and state, protection of civil      rights and civil liberties, and protection of the      environment;       On choice, women's rights, civil rights, and the scope of      federal power (particularly as it relates to civil rights and      environmental protection), Judge Alito's nomination has      sparked a national debate on one or more issues of core      concern to the Reform Movement so that the outcome of the      nomination is likely to be perceived as a referendum on that      issue and will have significant implications beyond the      individual nomination;       Many of his rulings have been contrary to our core values      and differed from the views of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor      (who was so often the moderate ``swing vote'' on a closely      divided Supreme Court), and, consequently, Judge Alito's      elevation would shift the ideological balance of the Supreme      Court on matters of paramount concern to the Reform Movement;      and       Judge Alito's elevation to the Supreme Court would likely      contribute significantly to reshaping American jurisprudence      in a direction that would jeopardize our core values.       Judge Alito's government service, and especially his      fifteen-year record on the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals,      provide clear insight into his judicial philosophy and      understanding of the Constitution. His rulings from the bench      in many areas of great import to the Reform Movement, and the      views he expressed while working at the Department of      Justice, demonstrate to us that he should not be confirmed.       As a religious minority, our community has historically      been committed to maintaining a strong wall of separation      between church and state. We see nothing in Judge Alito's      background to suggest he shares our commitment. In fact, in      his 1985 job application to the Reagan Justice Department,      Judge Alito wrote that one of the very reasons he became      interested in constitutional law was his ``disagreement''      with the Warren Court's decisions regarding the Establishment      Clause. His opinions as a sitting judge have been consistent      with this claim. In ACLU-NJ v. Schundler, Judge Alito said it      was constitutional to have a holiday display consisting of a      creche (a representation of the infant Jesus in the manger),      a menorah, a Christmas tree, and other ``secular holiday''      displays in front of the entrance to the main city government      building. Again evidencing his lack of commitment to      Establishment Clause values, in ACLU of New Jersey v. Black      Horse Pike Regional Board of Education, Judge Alito's      dissenting opinion argued that it was constitutional for a      public school district to allow prayer at graduation      ceremonies. Later, in a similar case involving school prayer      the Supreme Court disagreed. The statements in Judge Alito's      1985 job application and the aforementioned cases illustrate      his indifference (at best) to the constitutional protections      separating church and state; safeguards that have been the      linchpin protesting religious liberty for all Americans.       A longtime advocate for women's rights and reproductive      choice, the Reform Movement is also deeply concerned by Judge      Alito's views on reproductive rights. During his time as an      attorney in the Solicitor General's office, Judge Alito      helped author the Reagan Administration's amicus brief in      Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and      Gynecologists which argued for overturning the Roe v. Wade      decision. Judge Alito also authored a 17-page memo to the      Solicitor General on how to ``advance the goals of      bringing about the eventual overturning of Roe v. Wade . .      .'' Further, in his 1985 job application to the Reagan      Justice Department he wrote of his work in the Solicitor      General's office saying, ``it has been a source of      personal satisfaction to me . . . to help advance legal      positions in which I personally believe very strongly. I      am particularly proud of my contributions to recent cases      in which the government has argued in the Supreme Court      that . . . the Constitution does not protect a right to an      abortion.'' This dedication to the ``advancement'' of      reversing Roe is also clearly illustrated by his      dissenting opinion in Casey v. Planned Parenthood (1991).      Judge Alito would have upheld a provision of      Pennsylvania's restrictive anti-abortion law requiring a      woman to notify her husband before obtaining an abortion.      His colleagues on the Third Circuit disagreed and the      Supreme Court overturned the Pennsylvania provision (with      Justice O'Connor casting the deciding vote). The Court's      majority opinion found that the provision Judge Alito      would have upheld reverted back to the days when ``a woman      had no legal existence separate from her husband.''       So often our nation's courts ensure civil rights and civil      liberties that are otherwise unprotected by flawed systems      and discriminatory actions. In order to continue      administering justice and equality for all, individuals with      grievances must have access to the courtroom. Here, too, the      record suggests that Judge Alito does not share our      commitment to this fundamental principle. In split decisions      on the merits of claims alleging violations of the civil      rights of racial minorities, women, seniors, and people with      disabilities, Judge Alito has consistently ruled with the      defendants. In 16 of 24 such cases, Judge Alito has voted to      deny litigants the right to even bring their suit before the      court. For example, in Bray v. Marriott Hotels, involving      claims of race discrimination, the Court majority sharply      criticized Judge Alito's dissent, stating that his ``position      would immunize an employer from the reach of Title VII'' in      certain circumstances. In Public Interest Research Group v.      Magnesium Elektron, another case involving access to the      courtroom, Judge Alito again voted to make it harder for      citizens to establish standing to sue, this time concerning      toxic emissions that violate the Clean Water Act.       Judges, especially those selected to serve on the highest      court in our land, must be committed to upholding our      foundational principles of liberty and equality. Judge      Alito's record leaves us with serious doubts as to his      ability to safeguard these rights that we as a Movement, and      a nation, hold so dear. Here, with the stakes so high--a      lifetime appointment to the nation's highest court, replacing      a pivotal Justice who was often the ``swing vote'' in key      areas--we cannot afford such doubts.       We, therefore, urge you to oppose the nomination of Judge      Samuel Alito Jr. to the Supreme Court of the United States,      and we     stand ready to discuss our concerns with you or your staff in      greater detail.           Respectfully,     Rabbi David Saperstein,       Director, Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism.     Jane Wishner,       Chair, Commission on Social Action of Reform Judaism.                                                  National Council                                              of Jewish Women,                                                November 29, 2005.     Hon. Arlen Specter,     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, Hart Senate Office          Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Specter: I am writing to you on behalf of      90,000 members and supporters of the National Council of      Jewish Women (NCJW) to express our strong opposition to the      nomination of Judge Samuel A. Alito, Jr. to fill the seat of      Justice Sandra Day O'Connor on the U.S. Supreme Court. We      have decided to oppose Judge Alito for many reasons, most      notably because of his record concerning the right to      privacy, his views on civil rights and women's equality, and      his support for weakening the wall of separation between      religion and state. In light of this record, NCJW believes      that Judge Alito should not be confirmed for a lifetime      position on the Supreme Court.       When Justice Sandra Day O'Connor announced her intention to      retire from the Supreme Court, NCJW called upon President      Bush to seek a mainstream consensus nominee that would unite      and not divide the nation. Instead, he has selected a nominee      who is deeply ideological with a demonstrated commitment to      pulling the court to the far right.       Judge Alito is clearly not a nominee in the tradition of      Justice O'Connor, who sought to balance competing interests      and adopted a pragmatic approach to the law. Rather, over the      course of his career, Judge Alito has ruled to severely      restrict a woman's constitutional right to abortion and      against civil rights protections for both women and      minorities. He has shown a cramped view of the power of      Congress to legislate, ruling, for example, that Congress      lacked authority to ban fully automatic machine guns and that      Congress overstepped its bounds in passing the Family and      Medical Leave Act.       With the withdrawal of the nomination of Harriet Miers to      the Supreme Court, it became clear that the extreme right      wing was determined to see a justice confirmed who would      implement their agenda from the bench. Judging from his      record, Samuel Alito appears to be just such a nominee. We      are extremely disappointed that the President chose this path      and gave in to those forces demanding a nominee dedicated to      rolling back fundamental constitutional rights, rather than      protecting them. We urge the Senate to reject Judge Alito's      nomination.       We applaud your intention to hold hearings that will      thoroughly explore Judge Alito's views and judicial      philosophy. While we hope that he will be candid in his      answers, the hearing is only part of the record that senators      must take into consideration as they determine whether or not      a nominee is fit to be confirmed to be an Associate Justice      of the Supreme Court. With the stakes so high, it is all the      more critical that the Senate take into account Alito's      entire record--not just his brief appearance before the      Judiciary Committee. President Bush must immediately turn      over all of the records requested by the senators. And Judge      Alito must now be forthcoming regarding his judicial      philosophy and views on settled legal questions.       NCJW believes that the most basic qualification for a      lifetime seat on the federal bench is a commitment to      fundamental rights and freedoms. What we know of Judge      Alito's record raises sufficient doubt that he meets that      essential qualification and therefore we urge the Committee      to reject his confirmation.           Sincerely,                                                   Phyllis Snyder,                                                   NCJW President.
