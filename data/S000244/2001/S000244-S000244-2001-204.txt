Speaker, I yield myself 5\1/2\ minutes.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2505, the Human Cloning Prohibition Act of 2001. This bill criminalizes the act of cloning humans, importing cloned humans, and importing products derived from cloned humans. It is what is needed, a comprehensive ban against cloning humans. It has bipartisan cosponsorship. It was reported favorably by the Committee on the Judiciary on July 24, and is supported by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, Tommy J. Thompson, and by President Bush.  Today we are considering more than the moral and ethical issues raised by human cloning. This vote is about providing moral leadership for a watching world. We have the largest and most powerful research community on the face of the Earth, and we devote more money to research and development than any other Nation in the world. Although many other nations have already taken steps to ban human cloning, the world is waiting for the United States to set the moral tone against this experimentation.  Currently in the United States there are no clear rules or regulations over privately funded human cloning. Although the FDA has announced that it has the authority to regulate human cloning through the Public Health Service Act and the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, this authority is unclear and has not been tested. The fact of the matter is that the FDA cannot stophuman cloning; it can only begin to regulate it. This will be a day late and a dollar short for a clone that is used for research, harvesting organs, or born grotesquely deformed.  Meanwhile, there is a select group of privately funded scientists and religious sects who are prepared to begin cloning human embryos and attempting to produce a cloned child. While they believe this brave new world of Frankenstein science will benefit mankind, most would disagree. In fact, virtually every widely known and respected organization that has taken a position on reproductive human cloning flatly opposes this notion because of the extreme ethical and moral concerns.  Others argue that cloned humans are the key that will unlock the door to medical achievements in the 21st century. Nothing could be further from the truth. These miraculous achievements may be found through stem cell research, but not cloning.  Let me be perfectly clear: H.R. 2505 does not in any way impede or prohibit stem cell research that does not require cloned human embryos. This debate is whether or not it should be legal in the United States to clone human beings.  While H.R. 2505 does not prohibit the use of cloning techniques to produce molecules, DNA cells other than human embryos, tissues, organs, plants, and animals other than humans, it does prohibit the creation of cloned embryos. This is absolutely necessary to prevent human cloning, because, as we all know, embryos become people.  If scientists were permitted to clone embryos, they would eventually be stockpiled and mass-marketed. In addition, it would be impossible to enforce a ban on human reproductive cloning. Therefore, any legislative attempt to ban human cloning must include embryos.                              {time}  1500  Should human cloning ever prove successful, its potential applications and expected demands would undoubtedly and ultimately lead to a worldwide mass market for human clones. Human clones would be used for medical experimentation, leading to human exploitation under the good name of medicine. Parents would want the best genes for their children, creating a market for human designer genes.  Again, governments will have to weigh in to decide questions such as what rights do human clones hold, who is responsible for human clones, who will ensure their health, and what interaction will clones have with their genealogical parent.  Fortunately, Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Weldon) and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Stupak) have introduced this legislation before a cloned human has been produced.  As most people know, Dolly the sheep was cloned in 1997. Since that time, scientists from around the globe have experimentally cloned a number of monkeys, mice, cows, goats, lambs, bulls and pigs. It took 276 attempts to clone Dolly, and these later experiments also produced a very low rate of success, a dismal 3 percent. Now, some of the same scientists would like to add people to their experimental list.  Human cloning is ethically and morally offensive and contradicts virtually everything America stands for. It diminishes the careful balance of humanity that Mother Nature has installed in each of us. If we want a society where life is respected, we should take whatever steps are necessary to prohibit human cloning.  I believe we need to send a clear and distinct message to the watching world that America will not permit human cloning and that it does support scientific research. This bill sends this message, that it permits cloning research on human DNA molecules, cells, tissues, organs or animals, but prevents the creation of cloned human embryos.  Mr. Speaker, support H.R. 2505. Stop human cloning and preserve the integrity of mankind and allow scientific research to continue.
