President, I was very honored to have the opening prayer given by my pastor in Tulsa, OK--a church where my wife, who is present today, and I were married 41 years ago--when he was a very small baby, I might add. It is kind of unique, Mr. President. You know Oklahoma quite well. Oklahoma wasn't even a State until 1907, and yet the First Presbyterian Church started in 1885. For the first 15 years, the congregation was made up entirely of Cree Indian. It is an unusual type of church. I might also add that in all those years--that would be what, 115 years--there have only been six pastors of the First Presbyterian Church of Tulsa. Dr. Jim Miller is the sixth pastor. So once they come, they do not want to leave.  We are honored also to have with us his wife Diana and two of his children, David and Courtney, who are in attendance with my wife.  I yield the floor.
