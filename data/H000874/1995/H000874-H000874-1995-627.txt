Speaker, last night President Clinton spoke of a covenant of rights and responsibilities between Government and the American people. Today we begin again the renewal of our responsibility to manage our Nation's money with common sense and discipline.  The issue of balancing the budget is not a conservative or liberal one, nor is it an easy one, but it is an essential one for us in this House, for the American people, and most assuredly, for future generations.  The 1980's saw an explosion of debt in Government, in business, and in personal finances. It threatened our economic health and strength. We dramatically addressed this crisis in 1993, and the debt is receding, but we must ensure that the competing demands for Federal resources do not erode our fiscal covenant of responsibility. That is why I believe it so important for us to adopt the Stenholm-Schaefer balanced budget amendment.                          ____________________
