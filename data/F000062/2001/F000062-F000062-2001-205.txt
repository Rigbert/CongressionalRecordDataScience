 President, by now we know that there will not be enough electricity supply to meet demand in California this summer and that there will be significant rolling blackouts.  As the peak summer demand for power in the State kicks in over the next few months, the crisis is only going to deepen, and we may see electricity prices in California and the Northwest reach unprecedented levels.  And without intervention by the Federal Government, the price gouging that has occurred over the past 6 months will almost certainly continue.  In fact, it looks like California will spend 10 times more for power in 2001 than it spent in 1999, an increase from $7 billion to $70 billion.  And I predict that if left unchecked, these price spikes will spread to other states as well.  But despite the severity and scope of this crisis, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC, has failed to take necessary steps to address the problem.  Since last August, I have called upon FERC to impose a temporary wholesale price cap or cost of service-based rates on energy prices in the Western market.  But FERC, an agency whose sole mission is to regulate the energy market, has refused to act. Today, we introduce this legislation to force FERC to do its job.  Some have argued that a bill to control energy prices would remove incentives for companies to build additional energy generation, exacerbating the situation.  While I agree that we desperately need new supply, I believe that a price cap would provide temporary price stability and reliability until the market returns to normal.  And quite frankly, I think that with prices for power 10 times more than they were in 1999, there is more than enough incentive for suppliers to sell into the Western market.  With cost of service based rates, energy suppliers would generate significant profits and be guaranteed a reasonable rate of return.  With wholesale price caps, companies would be able to decide for themselves whether it is profitable to produce at a given price.  In fact, the energy crisis we are now experiencing is marked much more by the withholding of energy supply from the market than an unwillingness to build additional generation.  In fact, California expects to have 20,000 additional megawatts on line by 2004, enough power for 20 million additional people.  But because it takes 2-3 years to site new power generation, not enough energy can be brought online in time to help the situation this summer.  Price controls, if done right, could actually bring more power into the market.  Indeed, the temporary cost-based rates and/or the regional price cap that Senator Smith and I are proposing will eliminate that incentive. Thus, generators would have no reason to withhold power to the market.  With that said, let me talk briefly about what this bill would do: The bill requires FERC to set either a temporary price cap or cost of service based rates (with a reasonable rate of return). And make no mistake this bill is temporary; it is intended to get us through two summers. In order to qualify, a state must allow its utilities to recover costs from ratepayers and a state must pass electricity rates onto ratepayers. Though a state regulatory authority would still determine the manner in which wholesale rates are passed onto consumers. In addition, the bill directs FERC to end the temporary suspension of the natural gas transportation rate cap. Even today the price of natural gas in Southern California is about 3 times the cost in neighboring San Juan, New Mexico, $13 Decatherm vs. $4.50 Decatherm. The bill directs FERC to require that anyone selling natural gas in a bundled transaction into California to disclose the commodity and transportation components of the price. When a company purchases both the transportation and commodity components of natural gas, there is no reporting requirement as to the price of each transaction. The bill also requires that all future orders to sell natural gas or electricity to an affected state must include a reasonable assurance of payment.  I am deeply disappointed that FERC will not do its job and protect consumers and businesses in the West.  It is my hope that FERC will reconsider its opposition to price caps or cost-based rates. Price caps or cost-based rates may be the only way to prevent the further transfer of wealth from the Western region to energy suppliers.                                 ______                                       By
