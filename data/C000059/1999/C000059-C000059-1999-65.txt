Speaker, I take the floor today to recognize the outstanding career of John Moramarco, who is retiring as Senior Vice President and General Manager at Callaway Vineyard and Winery in Temecula, California--after 30 years with the winery.  John comes from a long history of vintners. In fact, he started his career at the family's Old Mission Winery in Los Angeles as a young boy, and continued the family tradition as an 11th generation viticulturalist.  Years in the family business allowed John to learn the basics of the business, and the finer points and finesse of making great wine.  It was his love of wine, and know how, that John applied to the Capistrano Winery and Vineyards in Fontana, California, which he and his brother, Mike, established. John became the vineyard's manager from 1945 to 1967, and put into place the lessons learned from his youth--grape growing, wine producing, marketing and sales techniques. He also continued to supervise the family's vines and those of several other wineries.  In 1969, Ely Callaway hired John Moramarco to plant and supervise his new vineyard in the small, rural Riverside County town of Temecula. In this position, John was instrumental in Callaway's vineyard and wine development.  Only recently have I had the privilege of working with John, and observing his talent, first hand. Wineries in Southern California are currently facing an unfortunate situation with a disease that kills grapevines and has no cure. But, John's life-time devotion to the industry has made the California Wine Industry better prepared than they may have been.  John's progressive work with professors from both the Universities of California at Davis and Riverside, gives the wine industry a relationship that they can now draw upon to solve this crisis. The industry is indebted to John's work with the universities and his willingness to devote vineyard blocks to the universities for their experiments. Those experiments have resulted in improved rootstocks, fertilizers, herbicides, mildew resistance, grafting and pruning, techniques now standard practice in California, and will give the industry the greatest chance of surviving their current crisis.  I know that I speak for everyone in the wine industry when I say, ``John will be missed.''                          ____________________
