Speaker, the 43rd Congressional District has been fortunate to participate in the writing of United States military history. I take the floor today to praise and honor a military installation that is an important part of Riverside, California. For the past 80 years, March Air Reserve Base, as it is now called, has contributed to the defense of our country and made a lasting impression in the lives of many service men and women. The March community is currently celebrating a milestone--the 80th anniversary of the installation and the 50th anniversary of the Air Force Reserve.  As March Air Force Base, it witnessed many advances in aircraft technology, from the JN-4D ``Jenny'' which landed there in 1917, to the KC-10 which was housed at the base in the 1980's. On March 20, 1918, March Field was officially named in honor of Second Lieutenant Peyton C. March, who had been recently killed in a flying accident. From there, Captain William Carruthers took over as the field's first commander. Following World War I, March Field was forced to close its doors due to budget cuts. With the creation of the Army Air Corps in 1926, March Field soon reopened as a pilot training field, training such luminaries as Hoyt Vandenberg, Nathan Twining, Thomas Power and Curtis LeMay. March Field became an operational base in 1931 and in 1949 became a part of the relatively new Strategic Air Command. From 1949 through 1993, March Air Force Base served as an integral part of the Strategic Air Command and America's nuclear deterrent force, a logistical springboard for supplies and equipment during the conflict in Southeast Asia and an effective support for the United States' defensive posture. March Air Force Base received its first Reserve unit in 1960.  In 1993, March Air Force Base was selected for realignment. Knowing how important the base has been historically and realizing its significance for the future, I fought vigorously to insure that it remained open. From its inception as a dirt air strip to today, the base has been a key element in the advancement of aviation and the growth of the modern Air Force. The impact of March Air Reserve Base's contributions to the community and the nation will be appreciated for many years to come. As March Air Reserve Base restructures, I want to offer them my full support, encourage them to look to their future as a large and important Air Force Reserve Base and look forward to their continued contributions to the defense of the United States.                          ____________________
