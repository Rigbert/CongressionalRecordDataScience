President, I would like to say a few words about two Army Reserve soldiers from Illinois I had the pleasure of meeting recently: SPC Jeremy Church and LT Matthew Brown.  Both of these soldiers fought last year in a battle that remains the largest enemy ambush of American troops in the war in Iraq. The battle occurred on Good Friday last year, April 9, 2004.  The 724th Transportation Company of Bartonville, IL, was taking part in a convoy escort operation delivering fuel to Baghdad International Airport when it was ambushed by insurgents. More than 150 enemy fighters poured heavy weapons fire onto the convoy.  Lieutenant Brown was the convoy commander. Specialist Church was his driver. In the first minutes of the attack, Lieutenant Brown was wounded, losing his eye. Specialist Church remained calm, simultaneously treating his wounded lieutenant, driving his damaged vehicle, and firing his rifle, one-handed, at the enemy.  Specialist Church drove to safety, dropped off the wounded Lieutenant Brown, rallied some assistance, and then drove back into danger, the kill zone, to help rescue, extract, his buddies who were still trapped under fire. He loaded casualties onto a truck until it was full, then sent the wounded soldiers to safety while he remained behind to continue the fight, taking cover behind destroyed vehicles.  For his actions that day, Specialist Church was awarded the Silver Star, the third-highest honor the United States can offer for valor in combat. He is the first and only U.S. Army Reserve soldier to win this medal in this conflict. Lieutenant Brown was awarded the Bronze Star.  In that same battle, PFC Gregory Goodrich was killed. SPC Keith Maupin was captured and remains missing in action.  Members of the National Guard and Reserve train on weekends and during 2-week annual training periods to prepare for that day when their country might call upon them to step away from families and civilian careers in order to fight America's wars.  These citizen-soldiers were ready to do that. The call came. They answered it. Now they have borne the terrible burden of battle. Gregory Goodrich gave his life. Keith Maupin remains missing. Matthew Brown has lost an eye and, because of that, he will probably lose his job as a Peoria, IL, law enforcement officer. Jeremy Church risked life and limb to save others and to vigorously fight back the attackers. All of these men exemplify the finest traditions of America's citizen-soldiers. We honor their service.                          ____________________[Pages S4177-S4178]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]               SILVER STAR IN ILLINOIS ARMY RESERVE UNIT
