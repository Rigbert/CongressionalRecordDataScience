 President, speaking of looking ahead, just a few hours ago our Republican conference came together and chose the leadership team that will serve for the 116th Congress.  Our Republican leadership team will feature faces both new and familiar. We are looking forward to earning our colleagues' trust and working as hard as we can to seize the opportunities that will lie before us this coming Congress.  It is my honor to have been asked by my colleagues to continue serving as leader. I can honestly say that not a day goes by when I am not humbled and honored by this opportunity to serve my colleagues, the institution of the Senate, and our incredible country in whatever measure I am capable.  I know my friend the Democratic leader feels much the same. I want to congratulate him on his election as leader once again. I look forward to working with him and his colleagues to move the ball and to make bipartisan progress for the American people.                          ____________________
