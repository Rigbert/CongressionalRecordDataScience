Speaker, our thoughts and prayers this evening are with the men and women in our Armed Forces who serve America's cause on the front lines in Afghanistan, fighting one front in the war against terrorism. We await their prompt return, and we extend our deepest sympathies to the families of our fallen soldiers. As we prosecute the war against terrorism, we must take affirmative steps as a Nation to drain the swamp of hatred and violence in central Asia and the Middle East, in Indonesia, Africa, and Central America.  But the real dimension of our mission must be clear. Even as our troops carry out their dangerous assignments in the four corners of our world, the Bush administration is pushing a plan for $98 million in outlays for military equipment to protect not democratic values, but an oil pipeline in Colombia. This aspect of the Bush administration foreign policy should serve to focus our attention on the urgent need for the United States to wean itself from a dangerous addiction to foreign oil. In fact, that historic addiction to Saudi oil, to Kuwaiti oil, to Iraqi oil, to Colombian oil, to Nigerian oil, lies on the basis of the repressive regimes whose dissidents strike out now against our country. It is an addiction that distorts our foreign policy, that drains our national wealth and demands treatment.  The treatment on the home front for that oil addiction is restoring fuel independence, energy independence for America again, and one of the most promising sources is biofuels.  I would like to submit for the Record this evening a simply magnificent article in foreign affairs called ``The New Petroleum,'' written by a Member of the other body, Richard G. Lugar and former CIA Director R. James Woolsey. The first sentence of this article reads: ``Oil is a magnet for conflict.'' And it talks about well over two-thirds of the world's remaining oil reserves lie in the Middle East and becoming more and more precious as thiscentury and millennium proceed. But then it talks about ethanol always being there as an alternative to gasoline, but never really being taken seriously, because until now, it has only been possible to produce ethanol from a tiny portion of the corn plant, the edible portions.  But recent breakthroughs in genetic engineering and processing of new biocatalysts have made possible something called ``cellulosic biomass,'' literally using every scrap of organic material on the face of the Earth, including this country's waste material put into our landfills, to spawn an entire new industry for our country and, indeed, countries of the world. If the hundreds of billions of dollars that now flow into a few coffers of a few nations were to flow instead to the millions of people who till the world's fields, most countries would see substantial national security, economic, and environmental benefits.  It talks about genetically engineered biocatalysts and advancing processing technologies that can make a transition from fossil fuels to biofuels affordable, and would not the world's security picture change dramatically. U.S. diplomacy and policies in the Middle East could be guided by a respect for democracy, rather than a need to protect oil supplies and accommodate oil-producing regimes, all of which are undemocratic.  It talks about cellulostic ethanol, radically improving the outlook for rural areas around the world, and how the nearly $70 billion spent annually for imported oil representing nearly half of the U.S. trade deficit, and would it not be better to spend those dollars here at home producing new jobs based on new fuels production for our own people and the world. It talks about how renewable fuels will actually reduce greenhouse gases around the world, and it talks about how these technologies are even better than the battery-powered technologies that are being developed and the various nuclear technologies that are being promoted by the Bush administration, which have spent plutonium, for which there is no real safe answer.                              {time}  1915  It talks about ethanol's economic viability as a result of these new technologies coming online with biocatalysts and new genetic engineering and the tremendous difference it will make in the price per gallon. The current efficiency of ethanol processing is somewhat analogous to that of petroleum refining in the early part of the 20th century, when after the invention of thermal cracking, it made possible a major share of the petroleum molecule for gasoline production. We are at the dawn, at the dawn of the biofuels age. We only need to see it.  Dartmouth engineering professor Lee Lynd talks about using only some of our Nation's agricultural and forest residues to produce a minimum of 8 percent of replacement for gasoline. And then take a look at much of the land idled across the country, and many of the forests, where there is residue on the ground, harvesting that, using that, using all the corn stalks that are being thrown away, all of the cotton hulls that are being thrown away, using those organics to produce fuel, and replacing a minimum of 25 percent additional.  So we would add the 8 percent, add the 25 percent, and we are moving to well over nearly 40 percent already of replacing what we currently are required to fuel with gasoline.  I include for the Record this really incredible article; again, ``The New Petroleum in Foreign Affairs,'' by Senator Lugar and R. James Woolsey. It is the future. Please take a look at it.  The article referred to is as follows:                           The New Petroleum               (By Richard G. Lugar and R. James Woolsey)                              why change?       Oil is a magnet for conflict. The problem is simple--     everyone needs energy, but the sources of the world's      transportation fuel are concentrated in relatively few      countries. Well over two-thirds of the world's remaining oil      reserves lie in the Middle East (including the Caspian      basin), leaving the rest of the world dependent on the      region's collection of predators and vulnerable autocrats.      This unwelcome dependence keeps U.S. military forces tied to      the Persian Gulf, forces foreign policy compromises, and      sinks many developing nations into staggering debt as they      struggle to pay for expensive dollar-denominated oil with      lower-priced commodities and agricultural products. In      addition, oil causes environmental conflict. The possibility      that greenhouse gases will lead to catastrophic climate      change is substantially increased by the 40 million barrels      of oil burned every day by vehicles.       Ethanol has always provided an alternative to gasoline. In      terms of environmental impact and fuel efficiency, its      advantages over gasoline substantially outweigh its few      disadvantages. But until now it has only been practical to      produce ethanol from a tiny portion of plant life--the edible      parts of corn or other feed grains. Corn prices have      fluctuated around $100 a ton in the last few years, ranging      from half to double that amount. Ethanol has thus been too      expensive to represent anything but a small, subsidized niche      of the transportation fuel market. In spite of recent      reductions in the expense of ethanol processing, the final      product still costs roughly a dollar a gallon, or about      double today's wholesale price of gasoline.       Recent and prospective breakthroughts in genetic      engineering and processing, however, are radically changing      the viability of ethanol as a transportation fuel. New      biocatalysts--genetically engineered enzymes, yeasts, and      bacteria--are making it possible to use virtually any plant      or plant product (known as cellulosic biomass) to produce      ethanol. This may decisively reduce cost--to the point where      petroleum products would face vigorous competition.       The best analogy to this potential cost reduction is the      cracking of the petroleum molecule in the early twentieth      century. This let an increasingly large share of petroleum be      used in producing high-performance gasoline, thus reducing      waste and lowering cost enough that gasoline could fuel this      century's automotive revolution. Genetically engineered      biocatalysts and new processing techniques can similarly make      it possible to utilize most plant matter, rather than a tiny      fraction thereof, as fuel. Cellulosic biomass is extremely      plentiful. As it comes to be used to produce competitively      priced ethanol, it will democratize the world's fuel market.      If the hundreds of billions of dollars that now flow into a      few coffers in a few nations were to flow instead to the      millions of people who till the world's fields, most      countries would see substantial national security, economic,      and environmental benefits.                           paying for rogues       Energy is vital to a country's security and material well-     being. A state unable to provide its people with adequate      energy supplies or desiring added leverage over other people      often resort to force. Consider Saddam Hussein's 1990      invasion of Kuwait, driven by his desire to control more of      the world's oil reserves, and the international response to      this threat. The underlying goal of the U.N. force, which      included 500,000 American troops, was to ensure continued and      unfettered access to petroleum.       Oil permeates every aspect of our lives, so even minor      price increases have devastating impacts. The most difficult      challenge for planners, policymakers, and alternative-energy      advocates is the transportation sector, which accounts for      over 60 percent of U.S. oil demand. The massive      infrastructure developed to support gasoline-powered cars is      particularly resistant to modifications. It precludes rapid      change to alternative transportation systems and makes      America highly vulnerable to a break in oil supplies. During      a war or embargo, moving quickly to mass transit or to fuel-     cell or battery-powered automobiles would be impossible.       For most countries, excluding only those few that will be      the next century's oil suppliers, the future portends growing      indebtedness, driven by increasingly expensive oil imports.      New demand for oil will be filled largely by the Middle East,      meaning a transfer of more than $1 trillion over the next 15      years to the unstable states of the Persian Gulf alone--on      top of the $90 billion they received in 1996.       Dependence on the Middle East entails the risk of a repeat      of the international crises of 1973, 1979, and 1990--or      worse. This growing reliance on Middle Eastern oil not only      adds to that region's disproportionate leverage but provides      the resources with which rogue nations support international      terrorism and develop weapons of mass destruction and the      ballistic missiles to carry them. Iraqi vx nerve gas and      Iranian medium-range missiles show how such regimes can      convert oil revenues into extensive and sophisticated      armament programs.                          is oil running out?       Optimists about world oil reserves, such as the Department      of Energy, are getting increasingly lonely. The International      Energy Agency now says that world production outside the      Middle Eastern Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries      (OPEC) will peak in 1999 and world production overall will      peak between 2010 and 2020. This projection is supported by      influential recent articles in Science and Scientific      American. Some knowledgeable academic and industry voices put      the date that world production will peak even sooner--within      the next five or six years.       The optimists who project large reserve quantities of over      one trillion barrels tend to base their numbers on one of      three things: inclusion of heavy oil and tar sands, the      exploitation of which will entail huge economic and      environmental costs; puffery by OPEC nations lobbying for      higher production quotas within the cartel; or assumptions      about new drilling technologies that may accelerate      production but are unlikely to expand reserves.       Once production peaks, even though exhaustion of world      reserves will still be many years away, prices will begin to      rise sharply. This trend will be exacerbated by increased      demand in the developing world. As Daniel Yergin, Dennis      Eklof, and Jefferson Edwards pointed out in these pages      (``Fueling Asia's Recovery,'' March/April 1998), even      assuming a substantial recession, increased Asian needs alone      will add enough demand by 2010 (9 million barrels per day) to      more than equal Saudi Arabia's current daily production.       The nations of the Middle East will be ready to exploit the      trend of rising demand and shrinking supply. The Gulf states      control nearly two-thirds of the world's reserves; the states      bordering the Caspian Sea have another several percent.      Barring some unforeseen discoveries, the Middle East will      control something approaching three-quarters of the world's      oil in the coming century.                           a whole new world       If genetically engineered biocatalyst and advanced      processing technologies can make a transition from fossil      fuels to biofuels affordable, the world's security picture      could be different in many ways. It would be impossible to      form a cartel that would control the production,      manufacturing, and marketing of ethanol fuel. U.S. diplomacy      and policies in the Middle East could be guided more by a      respect for democracy than by a need to protect oil supplies      and accommodate oil-producing regimes. Our intrusive military      presence in the region could be reduced, both ameliorating      anti-American tensions and making U.S. involvement in a      Middle Eastern war less likely. Other states would also reap      benefits. Ukraine, rich in fertile land, would be less likely      to be dominated over time by oil-rich Russia. China would      feel less pressure to befriend Iran and Iraq or build a big      navy to secure the oil of the South China Sea. The ability of      oil-exporting countries to shape events would be increasingly      limited.       The recent report by the President's Committee of Advisers      on Science and Technology (PCAST) predicted that U.S. oil      imports will approximately double between 1996 and 2030, from      8.5 million barrels per day, at a cost of $64 billion, to      nearly 16 million barrels per day, at a cost of $120 billion.      They estimated, however, that with concentrated efforts in      fundamental energy research and investment in renewable fuel      technologies, this could be reduced to 6 million barrels per      day in 2030. The report concluded, ``A plausible argument can      be made that the security of the United States is at least as      likely to be imperiled in the first half of the next century      by the consequences of inadequacies in the energy options      available to the world as by inadequacies in the capabilities      of U.S. weapons systems. It is striking that the Federal      government spends about 20 times more B money on the latter      problem than on the former.''                              fuel farmers       Cellulosic ethanol would radically improve the outlook for      rural areas all over the world. Farmers could produce a cash      crop by simply collecting agricultural wastes or harvesting      grasses or crops natural to their region. Agricultural      nations with little to no petroleum reserves would begin to      see economic stability and prosperity as they steadily      reduced massive payments for oil imports. Even more striking      would be redistribution of resources that would occur if      farmers and foresters produced much of the world's      transportation fuel. We know from the positive results of      micro-credit institutions and other such programs that even      small increases in income can be a major boost to a      subsistence-level family's prospects. If family income is a      few hundred dollars a year, earning an extra $50-$100 by      gathering and selling agricultural residues to a cellulosic      ethanol plant could mean a much improved life. Such added      income can buy a few used sewing machines to start a business      or a few animals to breed and sell. It can begin to replace      despondency with hope.       There are likely to be even larger effects on rural      development if biomass ethanol production can lead a shift      toward using plant matter of other products as well, such as      biochemicals and electrical energy. The cleanliness of      renewable fuel technologies makes them particularly      attractive to countries that lack a sophisticated      infrastructure or network of regulatory controls. At least      some facilities that process carbohydrates should lend      themselves to being simplified and sized to meet the needs      of remote communities. If such towns can produce their own      fuel, some of their fertilizers, and electricity, they      will be far better positioned to make their way out of      poverty and to move toward democracy and free enterprise.      Local economic development can promote political stability      and security where poverty now produces hopelessness and      conflict.       A major strength of the new technologies for fermenting      cellulosic biomass is the prospect that almost any type of      plant, tree, or agricultural waste can be used as a source of      fuel. This high degree of flexibility allows for the use of      local crops that will enrich the soil, prevent erosion, and      improve local environmental conditions.       Finally, as recession and devaluations overseas move the      American balance-of-payments deficit from the 1998 level--$1      billion every two days--toward nearly $1 billion every day,      there will be increased calls for protectionism. The best way      to avoid the mistakes of the 1930s is to have a solid      economic reason for increasing U.S. production of commodities      new bought abroad. The nearly $70 billion spent annually for      imported oil represents about 40 percent of the current U.S.      trade deficit, and every $1 billion of oil imports that is      replaced by domestically produced ethanol creates 10,000--     20,000 American jobs.                            easy being green       To be politically and economically acceptable, changes in      fuel must be understood by the American public to be      affordable and not disruptive. Most other countries require      the same tough criteria--U.S. difficulties in convincing      developing nations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are      directly related to the cost and the damage this would have      on their development plans. But if one of the most effective      ways to reduce greenhouse emissions also produced an improved      balance-of-payments deficit and opportunities for rural      development, economic benefits would suddenly far exceed the      costs. The political acceptability of reducing emissions      changes substantially when the economics change. A shift to      biomass fuels stands out as an excellent way to introduce an      environmentally friendly energy technology that has a chance      of both enjoying widespread political and economic support      and having a decisive impact on the risk of climate change.       Renewable fuels produced from plants are an outstanding way      to substantially reduce greenhouse gases. Although burning      ethanol releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, it is      essentially the same carbon dioxide that was fixed by      photosynthesis when the plants grew. Burning fossil fuels, on      the other hand, releases carbon dioxide that otherwise would      have stayed trapped beneath the earth.       If one looks at the complete life cycle of the production      and use of ethanol derived from feed gains, the only addition      of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere results from the use of      fossil fuel products in planting, chemical fertilizing,      harvesting, and processing. But this fossil fuel use can be      substantial--up to seven gallons of oil may be needed to      produce eight gallons of ethanol. When ethanol is produced      from cellulosic biomass, however, relatively little tilling      or cultivation is required, reducing the energy inputs. It      takes only about one gallon of oil to produce seven of      ethanol. There is a virtual consensus among scientists: when      considered as part of a complete cycle of growth,      fermentation, and combustion, the use of cellulosic ethanol      as a fuel, once optimized, will contribute essentially no net      carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.       According to a 1997 study done by five laboratories of the      U.S. Department of Energy, a vehicle powered by biomass      ethanol emits well under one percent of the carbon dioxide      emitted by one powered by gasoline. More surprising, however,      is that ethanol produced from biomass emits only about one      percent of the carbon dioxide emitted by battery-powered      vehicles, since the electricity for those is commonly      produced by burning fossil fuels at another location.      Although local air quality is improved, total carbon dioxide      emissions are not curtailed; they are merely exported--for      example, from Los Angeles to the Four Corners. Unless the      electricity to charge the car's batteries is produced by      renewable fuels or nuclear power, electric vehicles are only      20 to 40 percent better as carbon dioxide emitters than      gasoline-powered cars. Biomass ethanol beats both by a factor      of about 100, fundamentally changing the global-warming      debate.                            fringe benefits       Cellulosic ethanol is the only alternative fuel that      requires, at most, very modest changes to vehicles and the      transportation infrastructure. One need not spend money      retooling Detroit, nor spend years awaiting the gradual      replacement of older vehicles by those with new technology.      Nor does one need to modify or construct pipelines and      storage tanks to hold hydrogen as an alternate to petroleum.      This compatibility with today's infrastructure saves billions      of dollars and not just years, but decades. Moreover, there      is nothing incompatible between using ethanol now in internal      combustion engines and using it later in more efficient power      systems, such as hybrids or fuel cells.       Essentially all automobiles currently on the road can use      fuel containing up to ten percent ethanol. But strict fuel      economy standards have encouraged the development and      production of flexible fuel vehicles (FFVS) that can use up      to 85 percent ethanol. FFVS are already in dealers'      showrooms, containing (at no added cost to the consumer) the      minor engine modifications--a computer chip in the fuel      system and a fuel line made out of slightly different      material--that make large-scale ethanol use possible. Even      pure ethanol vehicles are quite practical. Brazil has 3.6      million on the road.       Corn ethanol will continue to serve an important role as      ethanol production shifts to cellulosic biomass.      Commercialization of corn ethanol has provided a base of      industrial experience, talented people, and infrastructure      from which a much larger cellulosic ethanol industry may be      launched. For corn farmers, biomass is no threat; it will      probably be a boon. Indeed, there is likely to be a      continuing, perhaps even an expanding, market for corn      ethanol because of the value of its byproducts, such as      animal feed. In general, the transition from corn to      cellulosic biomass and from a few producers to many is likely      to expand opportunities for American farmers.                           bioengineered bugs       Ethanol's economic viability depends on making it cheaper      to produce. This can be achieved by making it out of      cellulosic biomass, which includes essentially anything that      grows or has grown: agricultural and forest residues, prairie      grass, kudzu, waste wood, used paper products, even much of      urban waste. Last year, about 95 percent of the ethanol      produced in the United States came from corn. But      agricultural residues and other wastes have low or even      negative cost--some you are paid to haul away--while crops      like prairie grass cost only a few tens of dollars a ton.      This represents a substantial savings in the raw material      used in ethanol and puts it within the range of oil, even      inexpensive Persian Gulf oil.       Only recently have scientists developed the means to      convert cellulosic biomass efficiently into ethanol. The      edible portions of corn and other grains easily ferment into      ethanol because of their chemical make-up. Most biomass,      however, consists of more recalcitrant hemicellulose and      cellulose, requiring both the breaking up of these two fibers      as well as the fermenting of both five- and six-carbon      sugars. This all happens in nature, but two parts of it--     fermenting five-carbon sugars and breaking up cellulose      quickly--are technically challenging. The first is now done      by genetically engineered microorganisms; this tool and other      new techniques are now being brought to bear on the second      problem.       How far along are these developments? The current      efficiency of ethanol processing is somewhat analogous to      that of petroleum refining in the early 1900s: after the      invention of thermal cracking made it possible to use a major      share of the petroleum molecule for gasoline production but      before the invention of catalytic cracking opened up an even      larger share of petroleum to exploitation. In short, we have      come a long way, but still have some inventing to do. The      new, genetically engineered microorganisms have already taken      us far toward the fermentation of ethanol from a wide range      of plant material, laying the groundwork for reductions in      processing costs as well.       The new microorganisms, combined with other improvements in      processing, fundamentally change the equation for considering      ethanol a major transportation fuel. According to a recent      study by Dartmouth engineering professor Lee Lynd, utilizing      only some of the nation's agricultural and forest residues,      with no additional land use, could supply over 15 billion      gallons of ethanol a year--more than ten times the amount now      produced from corn, and enough to replace around eight      percent of the nation's gasoline. (Not all residues would be      used, of course, since some must be left for long-term      fertility.) Lynd also calculated that taking a little over      half of the 60 million acres of cropland historically      idled by federal programs for conservation and other      purposes, and using for ethanol production the mown      grasses with which much of this acreage is ordinarily      planted, would produce enough ethanol to fulfill around 25      percent of the country's annual gasoline needs. These      calculations use current automobile mileage. Lynd notes      that further mileage improvements, achieved through a      shift to hybrids or fuel cells, could obviate the need for      gasoline entirely, without taking land from food crops or      nonagricultural uses. The coproduction of animal feed and      biomass residues from alfalfa and witchgrass is especially      promising. There is, in short, no basis for the argument      that America does not have the land to produce enough      ethanol to make a very large dent in U.S. gasoline      consumption.       Biofuels must be produced in ways that enhance overall      environmental quality. Sound land-use policies certainly must      be followed, to protect wildlife habitat and address other      environmental concerns. But professional land-use techniques      should readily accomplish this. Alternative fuels are often      seen as an unpalatable necessity representing a retrenched      standard of living, forced upon us in an age of limits. The      opposite may be true. Utilization of renewable fuels will      make it possible for us to continue enjoying the freedom      afforded by private cars, even as the production of petroleum      begins to decline.                            THE RIGHT STUFF?       Early this century, Henry Ford expected that ethanol, not      gasoline, would be the fuel of choice for automobiles. His      reasons are evident. The two fuels can be compared by      examining three basic parameters--energy content, octane, and      vapor pressure. Pure ethanol contains 69 percent of the      energy of gasoline. A lower energy content translates into      fewer miles to the gallon; in order to travel the same range,      about a 30 percent larger fuel tank is needed (as is used in      Brazil). Many scientists believe that optimizing engines for      ethanol use will largely compensate for this difference, in      part because ethanol is a simple combination of carbon,      hydrogen, and oxygen. It is vastly less complex than      gasoline, which means that fine-tuning an engine to squeeze      very last drop of energy from ethanol is potentially easier.       Octane is the measure of a fuel's ability to oxidize      hydrogen and carbon molecules within a fraction of a second.      When the reaction is not simultaneous, ``engine knock'' and      inefficient combustion result. Ethanol has an octane rating      15 percent higher than gasoline's. In the 1920s ethanol was      briefly considered as a large-scale additive to gasoline to      stop the knocking of the new higher compression engines.      However, to the detriment of public health, ethanol lost out      to highly toxic tetraethyl lead, for three reasons: in      contrast to ethanol, only a small amount of lead was needed      as an additive; some were concerned that corn-derived ethanol      would compete for land and threaten the feed grains market;      and since Prohibition was in effect, many were also worried      about the security problems associated with maintaining large      volumes of what is essentially 200-proof vodka. Ethanol's      ability to be an effective fuel, however, was never an issue.       A third important fuel measurement is vapor pressure, or      how readily a liquid evaporates. A fuel's vapor pressure is      directly lined to the quantity of vehicle emissions, since      over 40 percent of automobile emissions result from      evaporation, not tailpipe emissions. Substituting ethanol for      gasoline in any amount reduces tailpipe emissions and thus      reduces urban smog. Pure ethanol, and any gasoline-ethanol      mixture that is more than 22 percent ethanol, has a lower      vapor pressure than gasoline and would therefore reduce the      amount of evaporative emissions.       Somewhat confusingly, however, blends of ethanol and      current gasoline have a slightly higher vapor pressure than      pure gasoline when the mixture contains less than 22 percent      ethanol, because of the unique mixing properties of the      liquids. Some studies show that low-level blends of ethanol      and gasoline (like gasohol, which is ten percent ethanol) can      actually worsen local air pollution, especially the formation      of low-level ozone. Consequently, in cities in the Northeast      and California, proposals to encourage the use of ethanol      blends have often fallen on deaf ears. Some environmentalists      see them as camouflaged subsidies for Midwestern corn growers      at the expense of the cities.       But although low-level ethanol blends present complex      issues, blends with more than 22 percent ethanol--which can      be used in FFVs--do not have the vaporization problem.      Moreover, with different approaches to refining and blending      gasoline, a solution to the vaporization problem may well      exist even at mixtures below 22 percent. Finally, ETBE--an      oxygenate made from ethanol that improves gasoline      combustion--improves air quality both in tailpipe      emissions and vaporization, although its use means the      fuel contains five to ten percent ethanol.       Choosing to use cellulosic ethanol is not a choice to      forsake more advanced automobile propulsion technologies,      such as hybrids and fuel cells. Ethanol is compatible with      both. Jeffrey Bentley, vice president of Arthur D. Little,      Inc., a company recently honored by the U.S. government for      its novel fuel-cell technology, stated that ``ethanol      provides higher efficiencies, fewer emissions, and better      performance than other fuel sources, including gasoline. . .      . Where ethanol is available, it will be the fuel of choice      by consumers.'' As both hybrids and fuel cells continue to      improve, automobiles powered by them may dramatically reduce      air pollution. Ethanol's compatibility with both makes moving      toward cellulosic ethanol as a transportation fuel much more      desirable.       If government policies promote FFVS, moreover, a large      fleet of ethanol-compatible vehicles will be available much      earlier than would otherwise have been feasible. This is      because FFVS can burn gasoline now but can use cellulosic      ethanol as it becomes available. Introducing FFVS into the      national fleet differs radically in timing from other changes      in transportation. Even if an ideal hybrid or fuel-cell      vehicle came on the market, the slow rate of turnover in the      nation's cars would mean that it would be many years before      its introduction would make a dent in overall fuel use. But      moving now to substantially increase the number of FFVS being      produced would create the capability to shift to cellulosic      ethanol as soon as it is available at attractive prices.       In addition, insofar as U.S. security and environmental      concerns are more with the consumption of problem-causing      petroleum fuel than with fuel in general, substituting      cellulosic ethanol for gasoline improves relevant ``mileage''      radically, even in internal combustion engines. For example,      an average automobile gets approximately 17 miles per gallon      and is driven approximately 14,000 miles per year, thus using      825 gallons of gasoline annually. Suppose that same      automobile were an FFV using a mixed fuel containing 85      percent cellulosic ethanol. Because of ethanol's lower energy      content, it would use about 1,105 gallons of fuel, but only      165 would be gasoline. Such a vehicle could be said to be      getting, in a sense, over 80 miles per gallon--of national-     security-risk-increasing, carbon-dioxide-producing gasoline.       The one remaining barrier to widespread replacement of      gasoline with ethanol is production cost. Relying on feed      grains makes this cost comparatively high and volatile, since      corn is subject to the caroming behavior of feed markets. In      1995, its price of $100 a ton nearly doubled, forcing a sharp      curtailment in ethanol production. A partial shift to biomass      should circumvent such instabilities. Over the past 15 years,      the cost of producing a gallon of ethanol has been cut in      half, to just over $1 a gallon wholesale. If, as predicted,      the new biocatalysts, low and steady raw material costs, and      improved processing let costs fall another 50 percent or so,      ethanol could compete with gasoline at today's prices. If oil      prices rise in the next century, gasoline could actually be      at a substantial price disadvantage.       Such a reduction of ethanol cost is entirely plausible for      two reasons. First, a simple comparison of energy content      reveals that a dry ton of biomass crops--$40 is a reasonable      current average cost--is comparable to oil at $10-13 a      barrel. Agricultural wastes, in many cases, are considerably      cheaper than either: many are free or have negative cost. So      the overall costs of cellulosic biomass are likely to at      least be in the same ballpark as those of crude oil Second,      further reductions in the cost of processing seem quite      achievable. The current cost of processing ethanol is      significantly higher than the equivalent price per barrel for      oil. But this discrepancy reflects the maturity and      sophistication of the petroleum industry, developed over the      past century, as compared to the fledgling biofuels effort.      Producing ethanol is not inherently more complex than      refining petroleum--in fact, just the contrary. The world has      simply invested far more effort in the latter.                               Jump-Start       While the private sector will provide the capital and      motivation to move toward ethanol, the federal government has      a vital role to play. Market forces seldom reflect national      security risks, environmental issues, or other social      concerns. The private sector often cannot fund long-term      research, despite its demonstrated potential for dramatic      innovation. Hence, the federal government must increase its      investment in renewable energy research, particularly in      innovative programs such as genetic engineering of      biocatalysts, development of dedicated energy crops, and      improved processing. The very small sums previously      invested by the Departments of Energy and Agriculture have      already spawned dramatic advances. Every effort should be      made to expand competitive, merit-based, and peer-reviewed      science and to encourage research that cuts across      scientific disciplines.       Research is essential to produce the innovations and      technical improvements that will lower the production costs      of ethanol and other renewable fuels and let them compete      directly with gasoline. At present, the United States is not      funding a vigorous program in renewable technologies. The      Department of Energy spends under two percent of its budget      on renewable fuels; its overall work on renewable      technologies is at its lowest level in 30 years. Because      private investment often follows federal commitment,      industrial research and development has also reached new      lows. These disturbing trends occur at a time of national      economic prosperity when America has both time and resources      for investing in biofuels. The United States cannot afford to      wait for the next energy crisis to marshal its intellectual      and industrial resources.       Research alone will not suffice to realize cellulosic      ethanol's promise. The federal government should also modify      the tax code to spur private investment. The existing      renewable alcohol tax credits have recently been extended by      Congress through 2007--which will help the growth for the new      biofuels industry and offer some protection in the transition      from grain to cellulosic biomass. But the tax credit      structure should facilitate the gradual adoption of      cellulosic ethanol--in time, it should not need subsidies.      Government incentives to produce FFVs should also be      increased.       Finally, there must be a coordinated effort across the many      different federal agencies that oversee government      laboratories and regulatory agencies. The analogy to the      semiconductor industry is instructive. In 1987, Congress      authorized the creation of a government-industry partnership,      the Semiconductor Manufacturing Technology Association      (SEMATECH). Under the direction of the Department of      Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency, SEMATECH pursued      fundamental research in semiconductor components and      manufacturing processes. Private firms with innovative ideas      were encouraged to devote research dollars to transform the      idea into a commercial reality. The few domestic      semiconductor manufacturers were brought together in forums      where the companies could discuss technical hurdles without      sacrificing competitive advantage. Today, the success of      SEMATECH is evident, as the high-technology sector      demonstrates. Biofuels offer a similar opportunity.       Cellulosic ethanol is a first-class transportation fuel,      able to power the cars of today as well as tomorrow, use the      vast infrastructure already built for gasoline, and enter      quickly and easily into the transportation system. It can be      shipped in standard rail cars and tank trucks and is easily      mixed with gasoline. Although somewhat lower in energy      content, it has a substantially higher octane rating than      gasoline, allowing for more efficient combustion. It can      radically reduce the emission of global warming gases, help      reduce the choking smog of our cities, and improve air      quality. It is far less toxic than petroleum, far less likely      to explode and burn accidentally, and far simpler physically      and chemically, making possible simpler refining procedures.      If a second Exxon Valdez filled with ethanol ran aground off      Alaska, it would produce a lot of evaporation and some drunk      seals.       Our growing dependence on increasingly scarce Middle      Eastern oil is a fool's game--there is no way for the rest of      the world to win. Our losses may come suddenly through war,      steadily through price increases, agonizingly through      developing-nation poverty, relentlessly through climate      change--or through all of the above. It would be extremely      short-sighted not to take advantage of the scientific      breakthroughs that have occurred and that are in the offing,      accelerate them, and move smartly toward ameliorating all of      these risks by beginning to substitute carbohydrates for      hydrocarbons. If we do, we will make life far less dangerous      and far more prosperous for future generations. If we do not,      those generations will look back in angry wonder at the      remarkable opportunity that we missed.                          ____________________
