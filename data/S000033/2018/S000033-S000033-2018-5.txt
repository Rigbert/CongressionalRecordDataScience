 President, we are actually at a historic moment here in the U.S. Senate. I want to thank all of the Senators who in a very bipartisan way have come together to say that the United States will no longer participate in the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen, which has caused the worst humanitarian crisis on Earth, with 85,000 children already starving today.  Today, we tell the despotic regime in Saudi Arabia that we will not be part of their military adventurism. Today, maybe in the most profound way, 45 years ago, the War Powers Act was passed--45 years ago. Today, for the first time, we are going to go forward utilizing that legislation and tell the President of the United States--andany President, Democrat or Republican--that the constitutional responsibility for making war rests with the U.S. Congress, not the White House.  Let us pass this resolution.
