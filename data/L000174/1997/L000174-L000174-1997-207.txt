President, I am very pleased that my amendment to strengthen our ability to prosecute war criminals in the United States has been accepted by the Republican side.  This amendment, which builds on the War Crimes Act of 1996, closes some gaps in our Nation's implementation of the Geneva and Hague Conventions.  The War Crimes Act of 1996 only permits prosecution for war crimes in the United States if the person accused of committing the crime, or the victim of a war crime, is a national of the United States or a member of the U.S. Armed Forces. While noble in its intent, that act does not permit the United States to prosecute non-U.S. nationals who come within our jurisdiction. It leaves the United States open as a potential safe-haven for war criminals seeking to escape prosecution.  Currently, we have no extradition treaties with 75 nations including Somalia, Cambodia, Afghanistan, Lebanon, and Iran. If a war criminal from any of these countries takes refuge in the United States, we cannot extradite him. The alternative--deportation--is a long and complex process which becomes even more difficult when the accused is to be deported to a specific country. Even if deportation is successful, a war criminal may be returned to a country in which the judicial system is nonfunctional--Cambodia, for example--thus escaping prosecution altogether.  My amendment allows us to prosecute war criminals located in the United States, regardless of their nationality. The amendment in no way obligates the United States to prosecute war crimes, nor does it permit the extradition of non-U.S. nationals of the United States for prosecution if the victims of the crime are not United States nationals. Any case undertaken by our Government requires written notification to the Congress by the Attorney General, who must take into consideration U.S. national interests and the necessity of U.S. prosecution, to assure a just resolution in each case. The United States will not be drawn into international conflicts where we have no significant national interest.  The amendment expands the scope and offers a more specific definition of what constitutes a war crime that the 1996 act. The 1996 act only refers to grave breaches of the 1949 Geneva Conventions which are defined as willful killing, torture or inhuman treatment, including biological experiments, willfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health, and extensive destruction of property, not justified by military necessity and carried out unlawfully or wantonly.''  My proposed 1997 amendments also covers articles of the 1907 Hague Convention IV which clarify actions prohibited in war.  The inclusion of common article 3 of the Geneva Conventions is vital in that it expressly allows the United States to prosecute war crimes perpetrated in noninternational conflicts, such as Bosnia and Rwanda. In January 1997, there were a reported 35 such internal conflicts, from Algeria to Kasmir.  Finally, violations of the protocol on prohibitions or restrictions on the use of mines, booby-traps and other devices will constitute a war crime under this amendment, once the United States ratifies this important protocol.  The International Committee of the Red Cross, the American Red Cross, the State Department, the Department of Defense, and President Clinton all support the expansion of United States prosecutorial authority as it is contained in this amendment. With its adoption, we will be following in the footsteps of Great Britain, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia--each of which passed similar laws in the 1950's. It is time for us to join them.                           amendment no. 911(Purpose: To Allocate Funds for a Western Hemisphere International Law                       Enforcement Academy (ILEA))       On page 28 line 19 after the word ``country'' insert the      following:       ``Provided further. That of this amount not to exceed $5      million shall be allocated to operate the Western Hemisphere      International Law Enforcement Academy under the auspices of      the Organization of American States with full oversight by      the Department of State.''
