Mr, Speaker, I rise today to honor one of Alaska's most distinguished, faithful, and respected public servants, John Katz.  Fresh out of Berkley Law, he boldly moved to Alaska and made a decision to embark upon a life of selfless public service to the people of Alaska. Among his first few jobs in public service were being Alaska Commissioner of Natural Resources and special counsel on land-use issues, before being appointed the Governor's man in Washington D.C. in 1983.  His departure can only be described as an enormous loss for our great state. For more than 40 years, and spanning eight governors, he has served Alaska with unwavering commitment, integrity, and with the utmost level of professionalism. Having worked with him for almost 30 of those years, I have little doubt that his loyalty to and knowledge of Alaska is second to none.  Through thick and thin, his dedication to Alaska was evident to everyone who worked with him. Over the years he has always put the needs of Alaska first, no more so than when he delayed his retirement at the request of Governor Frank Murkowski.  His reputation of being calm and cool under pressure is well known and his ability to work well with Republicans and Democrats alike should be emulated by others here in Washington. He once said his greatest disappointment was being unable to open up ANWR and I share that disappointment with him.  But despite ANWR, he was an integral part of every positive development to happen to Alaska in the last three decades including Alaska Native rights, fisheries management, protecting Alaska's sovereignty, and natural resource development. After all the work we've done together, I will do my utmost to continue this legacy for the good of Alaska.  He is exactly the kind of public servant who gives public service a good name. My staff and I will miss working with him, but I hope that our paths will continue to cross.  Thank you for your service to Alaska, John, and I wish you all the best in the future.                          ____________________
