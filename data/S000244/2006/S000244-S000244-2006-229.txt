Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.  Mr. Speaker, let me just point out what the people on the other side, if they have their way, are going to have as a result.  I just want to quote one of the coordinating counsels for the detainees, a gentleman named Michael Ratner, who boasted about what they are planning on doing in public. ``The litigation is brutal for the United States. It is huge. We have over 100 lawyers now from big and small firms working to represent the detainees. Every time an attorney goes down there, it makes it much harder for the U.S. military to do what they are doing. You can't run an interrogation with attorneys. What they are going to do now is that we are getting court orders to get more lawyers down there.''  Now, to put some order in this and to defeat what Mr. Ratner said, the legislation has got to pass.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Daniel E. Lungren).
