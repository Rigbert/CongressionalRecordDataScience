 President, I pay tribute to a fellow Kentuckian, Mr. R.J. Corman. Mr. Corman is a remarkable man who has overcome life's adversities and achieved great business success.  Mr. Corman got his start in the railroad business working a backhoe for L Railroad. Little did he know, but this initial exposure would lead to his lifetime work. He founded and continues to operate the R.J. Corman Railroad Group in his hometown of Nicholasville, Kentucky. His business has grown over the years and now operates in 19 States, has about 630 employees, and will have at least $120 million in sales this year. The goal of the R.J. Corman Railroad Group is to please customers and perform their services better, faster, and more efficient than anyone else.  While Mr. Corman's companies are incredibly successful and expansive, it is his personal successes that I pay tribute to most. Three years ago, Mr. Corman was diagnosed with cancer and given 3 years to live. A man not used to sitting idly by, he successfully completed a stem-cell bone marrow transplant in November 2001 and today his cancer is in complete remission. In fact, Mr. Corman is doing so well that at the age of 48 he ran in the 108th annual Boston Marathon.  Mr. Corman came from humble beginnings, the son of a state highway worker and homemaker. But he hasn't forgotten where he came from or the lessons his grandfather taught him about hard work and honesty. His never give up attitude has led to business success and overcoming seriousillness. Today I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring and recognizing Kentucky's railroad entrepreneur, Mr. R.J. Corman.                          ____________________
