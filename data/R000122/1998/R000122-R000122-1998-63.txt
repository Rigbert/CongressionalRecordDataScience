President, I rise to pay tribute to the Japan-America Society of Rhode Island for its efforts in organizing this weekend's 15th annual Black Ships Festival of Rhode Island.  The Black Ships Festival takes its name from the Japanese word Kurofune (Black Ships) which the residents of Shimoda, Japan used to describe the tar covered American ships which sailed into Shimoda harbor under the command of Rhode Island native Commodore Matthew Perry in 1854. As you know, Commodore Perry and officials in the Edo Period Shogunate negotiated the Treaty of Kanagawa, the first treaty between United States and Japan, which opened Japan to trade with the West and marked the beginning of the relationship between our two great countries.  Each summer, Newport, Rhode Island and Shimoda, her sister city, hold Black Ships Festivals to celebrate the friendship which began in 1854. Since its inception 15 years ago, the Black Ships Festival of Rhode Island has grown bigger and better every year, becoming a fixture on Newport's summer schedule and an event that the entire state eagerly awaits.  The Festival truly is one of Rhode Island's treasures. It provides residents and visitors to the Ocean State a unique and inexpensive opportunity to learn about and celebrate Japan's traditions and culture. As a result, I can honestly say that our state has gained a better awareness than most of Japanese culture.  The success of the Black Ships Festival of Rhode Island is now recognized far beyond the borders of the Ocean State. On July 1, the Japan-America Society of Rhode Island was selected to receive the prestigious Japanese ``Minister of Foreign Affairs' Citation'', which recognizes individuals and organizations that have contributed to friendship and understanding between Japan and other countries. Of the 9 organizations receiving this award in 1998, the Japan-America Society is the only one that is not Japanese.  Mr. President, as the Co-Chair of this year's Black Ships Festival of Rhode Island, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the Japan America Society of Rhode Island for its tremendous efforts in organizing the Festival and strengthening the bond friendship between the United States and Japan.                          ____________________
