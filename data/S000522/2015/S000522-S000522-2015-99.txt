Mr. Speaker, I take this opportunity to express my profound gratitude and deep appreciation for the leadership and commitment of one of New Jersey's most dedicated public servants, Colonel Angelo Candelori.   For over 30 years, Colonel Candelori has volunteered countless hours and offered exceptional guidance and insights as a member of the Fourth Congressional District's Service Academy Nominations Board--a task he has taken most seriously and accomplished with great success. Year after year, Colonel Candelori has ``sweat the details,'' tenaciously poring over the applications of prospective Service Academy nominees. With great scrutiny and wisdom he has interviewed every young man and woman, recommending only those whom he and his two colleagues on the board felt were most deserving of my congressional nomination.   I have benefitted greatly from Colonel Candelori's expertise, discernment, dedication, and desire that our armed services receive only the best, bravest and brightest officer applicants. And so, too, has the United States military.   Having served for 32 years in the United States Marine Corps and the reserves--a tenure that overlapped with his time on our Service Academy Board--Colonel Candelori relied on his knowledge and judgement, as well as years of military training, to help identify young applicants best suited to become America's next generation of military leaders. With honor, integrity, courage and dedication, Colonel Candelori easily embodies the Marine Corps motto ``Semper Fi''--proving to be ``always faithful'' to the United States of America, his fellow Marines, and all members of our armed forces.   If you knew Colonel Candelori personally, you would know that his dedication to his community and his commitment to public service is evident beyond his military career. For many years Colonel Candelori was a member of the Hamilton Township Planning Board and the Hamilton Township Development Review Advisory Board. His positive impact in many local and state volunteer and/or civic organizations resulted in his designation as a Point of Light by President George H. W. Bush. Colonel Candelori was also named a recipient of the U.S. Secretary of Energy's Community Service Award and the Enrico Fermi Federation Achievement Award.   Colonel Candelori's leadership is recognized internationally as he was knighted with the title of Cavaliere in the Order of Solidarity by the government of Italy. He served as president of the Societa Cavalieri d'Italia and is a past trustee of the Italian-American National Hall of Fame and a past president of the Enrico Fermi Federation.   Mr. Speaker, to say that Colonel Angelo Candelori is a patriot and a gentleman would be an understatement. He is a community leader who has advanced the common good, and a remarkable, dedicated husband and father. Colonel Candelori and his wife, Elaine, have been married for over 55 years. The Candelori's first started dating when Elaine was in 8th grade and the Colonel was a freshman. Fast-forward to today and now they are the proud parents of four--David, Eric, Aliza and Matthew; the grandparents of eleven; and the great-grandparents of two. What an enduring legacy of love and devotion and goodness.   This year, as he steps down from his more than three decades of assisting in the vetting and selection of military academy nominees, I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join me in honoring Colonel Angelo Candelori for his dedicated service to the citizens of New Jersey and to our country.                          ____________________
