 President, I am so happy that my colleague, my friend from Pennsylvania, is concerned about fairness, which, no doubt, is why 62 percent of the benefits in this tax proposal are going to go to the top 1 percent, and after 10 years we are going to see over 80 million middle-class families pay more in taxes while the richest people in this country get huge tax breaks. If that is the definition of fairness, then I don't quite know what unfairness is about.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators Blumenthal, Merkley, and Warren be added as cosponsors to amendment No. 1720, which I am offering.
