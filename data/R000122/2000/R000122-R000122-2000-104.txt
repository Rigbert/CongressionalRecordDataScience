President, I rise to join with Armenians throughout the United States, in Armenia, and around the world in commemorating the 85th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide.  On the night of April 24, 1915 in Constantinople, nationalist forces of the Ottoman Empire rounded up more than 200 Armenian religious, political, and intellectual leaders and murdered them in a remote countryside location. This atrocity began an eight year campaign of tyranny that would affect the lives of every Armenian in Asia Minor.  Armenian men, women, and children of all ages fell victim to murder, rape, torture, and starvation. By 1923, an estimated 1.5 million Armenians had been systematically murdered and another 500,000 were exiled. With the world community consumed in the events of World War I and the subsequent period of recovery, the plight of the Armenian people went unanswered.  Today, this tragic episode in history serves to unite the Armenian people as they struggle to build an independent nation committed to democracy and peace in the Caucasus region. Despite the unresolved conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh, the ongoing blockade by Turkey and the violent attack on the Armenian Parliament last October, Armenians continue to build on these principles. It is this indomitable spirit that has kept the hope of Armenians alive through centuries of persecution.  The madness and cruelty which led to the tragic events of the Armenian genocide are not forgotten. Last year, when hundreds fled their homes in Kosovo, fearing for their lives, America and its NATO allies reacted quickly and decisively. We, as a nation, must continue to respond to such acts of oppression so that the deaths of all victims of hatred and prejudice are not in vain.  Therefore, on the 85th anniversary of the terrible tragedy of the Armenian genocide we remember the past and rededicate ourselves to supporting Armenia as it looks to the future.                          ____________________
