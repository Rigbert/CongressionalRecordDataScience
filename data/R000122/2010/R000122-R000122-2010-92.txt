President, I appreciate the Senator's objection. Additionally, I appreciate his consideration in allowing me to speak.  Let me conclude. We have a huge debt at the moment. I think if you look at the major contributing factors of that debt, they would include tax cuts that were unpaid for, supported strongly by the Republicans, which went dramatically to the richest Americans, and two wars that have been unpaid for. In fact, I think in a few weeks we are going to have to consider another supplemental Defense budget which at this point I do not believe is paid for and which I do not feel will engender any objection by the Republican side. It will include, given the nature of counterinsurgency operations, monies that will be used, ironically, to help develop productive jobs and build clinics and do things our soldiers must do to secure the peace in Afghanistan and Iraq. Yet at the same time we can't find that kind of money here without on offset to help Americans.  So there is a question of priorities.
