 On July 21, 550 soap box champions from 183 cities in 43 states gathered in Akron, Ohio to compete for the National Championship. In the Stock Division, Tyler Schoff took home first place. In the Super Stock Division, Andrew Feldpausch bested the field to earn a national title as well. And in the Master's Division, Kacie Rader, of Maryland's Fifth District, took the National Championship after winning the Greater Washington Soap Box Derby in a race held right here on the Capitol grounds. Kacie is the first racer from the National Capital region--or the entire state of Maryland for that matter--to win a National Championship.  Kacie, who started her racing career at the age of 7, has worked tirelessly to earn such a noteworthy win. Last year alone, Kacie competed in 40 Soap Box Derby events and traveled to 6 different states over 20 weekends to compete. Kacie, who will be beginning her senior year at Chopticon High School in the fall, will now continue on to Indiana for the National Derby Rally Championship where she will be ranked number one in points. I along with the people of Maryland wish her the best of luck.  My congratulations go out to Kacie, Tyler, Andrew, and everyone who participated in what has become a national tradition over the last seven decades. The All-American Soap Box Derby is one of the oldest road races in America today--second only to the Indianapolis 500. And those who compete in this race are part of a long-standing legacy that highlights the best that American youths have to offer.  That is because it takes more than just athletic prowess to be a champion soap box racer. It takes imagination and creativity to design a vehicle that has the durability, handling and speed needed to win. It takes hard work and diligence to build a racer once it has been designed. And it takes intelligence and grace under pressure to successfully command a soap box racer in a racing environment.  Once again, I offer my congratulations to everyone that participated in the ``greatest amateur racing event in the world.'' And I want to thank Kacie Rader, of Mechanicsville, Maryland, for bringing national acclaim to Maryland's Fifth District by winning the All-American Soap Box Derby Master's Division Championship.                          ____________________
