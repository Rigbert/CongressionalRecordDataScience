President, today I recognize the 31st anniversary of the independence of Cape Verde. On July 5, 1975, this island nation gained independence from Portugal and since then has established itself as one of the most politically stable and economically viable countries in Africa.  After discovery by Portuguese explorers in 1457 and then again in 1462, Cape Verde was incorporated into the Portuguese Empire as the first European settlement in the tropics. Over the next several hundred years, it was a lucrative trading post between Europe, Africa, and the Americas.  A few years after World War II, with a growing nationalist movement, Portugal granted Cape Verde overseas province status. Within 5 years a group of Cape Verdeans and neighboring Guinea-Bissauans organized a coalition for the independence of Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde. After the 1974 Portuguese revolution, the new government signed an independence agreement with all of Portugal's overseas provinces, including Cape Verde. After six centuries of colonial rule, Cape Verde formally gained independence on July 5, 1975.  Since the beginning of its independence, Cape Verde has strived for a democratic government. In 1991, the first multiparty elections in Cape Verdean history were held. Today, the Cape Verdean government is stable, with four parties sharing seats in the National Assembly. It has established market-oriented economic policies that are attracting foreign visitors, ensuring Cape Verde a strong service and tourism economy.  Cape Verde has also been an essential part of international security. Over the past month, Cape Verde has served as the proving grounds for the latest testing of the emerging NATO Response Force, NRF. With over 7,000 soldiers, sailors, and airmen, Exercise Steadfast Jaguar 2006 is a major test of the NRF's ability to operate quickly, strategically, and at distance. Facing a variety of environmental conditions, the NRF is able to execute its largest military maneuvers since its creation exercising a wide array of missions. The archipelago's terrain provide challenging beaches for amphibious assault, arid flatlands for ground warfare, and a mountainous volcano for humanitarian relief after a fictitious eruption. These exercises, while still ongoing, can only be measured as a success and a true representation of international cooperation.  Today there are close to 350,000 Cape Verdeans living in the United States, almost equal to the population of Cape Verde itself. Many of these Cape Verdeans make their home in Rhode Island. On behalf of the residents of my State, I wish to thank them for their contributions to our country.  Finding its place in the international community, Cape Verde has stood up to assist the world's peacekeeping force in their infancy. It is fitting we honor Cape Verde's independence along side of our own. They understand the importance of a democratic society and international responsibility. I send all Cape Verdeans in Rhode Island and around the world my best wishes as they celebrate their homeland's independence                          ____________________
