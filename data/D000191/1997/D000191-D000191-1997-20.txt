Speaker, I believe there are a number of very significant provisions in this bill, riders added to this bill that have had no review by the House, added by the Senate, that are very much to the detriment of the environment. I spoke about them at length during the rule. Nothing has changed here before us. I would urge Members to vote against this bill.  Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Washington [Mr. Dicks] is trying to clarify some very complicated provisions added into the bill by the Senate having to do with the export of logs. I still have the opinion of the IG from the Department of Agriculture who says, no, in fact this would allow the virtual explicit export of Federal logs. The gentleman says he is trying to fix that. I appreciate that.  Mr. Speaker, that points out the whole problem with doing legislation on appropriations bills. It is an extraordinarily complicated subject. It has not been reviewed by the committee of jurisdiction in either the House or the Senate. It has been added to this bill without any scrutiny.  The gentleman is now trying to say that it does not do what this attorney who works for the agency charged to enforce the law says it does do. I do not really know. Who knows?  So, Mr. Speaker, we should reject this bill. If we need changes in substitution, we should do it in the regular order, not in an appropriations bill.
