President, as the founder and the cochair of the Senate Diabetes Caucus, I have learned much about this devastating disease affecting nearly 29 million Americans. Fortunately, due to the Special Diabetes Program and to increased investments in diabetes research, we have seen some exciting breakthroughs and we are on the threshold of a number of important new discoveries.  This is particularly true for the estimated 1.2 million Americans living with type 1 diabetes. Advances in technology such as continuous glucose monitors are helping patients control their blood glucose levels, which is key to preventing costly and sometimes deadly diabetes complications. We are moving closer and closer to our goal of an artificial pancreas.  The National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration have been extremely supportive of these innovations in diabetes care. I was, therefore, shocked and troubled to learn that insulin-dependent Medicare beneficiaries are being denied coverage for continuous glucose monitors because the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has determined that they do not meet the definition for durable medical equipment and do not fall under any other Medicare category. As a consequence, we are seeing situations similar to what we saw with insulin pumps in the late 1990s, where individuals with type 1 diabetes have had coverage for their continuous glucose monitors on their private insurance, only to lose that coverage when they get old enough to become eligible for Medicare.  Let me give some brief background. A continuous glucose monitor is a physician-prescribed, FDA-approved medical device that can provide real-time readings and data about trends in glucose levels every 5 minutes, thus enabling someone with insulin-dependent diabetes to eat or take insulin and prevent dangerously high or low glucose levels.  There has been essential and extensive clinical evidence that shows that individuals using this device have improved overall glucose control and, thus, reduced rates of hypoglycemia or low blood glucose levels. That is why professional medical societies have recognized the clinical evidence and have published guidelines recommending that these monitors be used in appropriate patients with type 1 diabetes.  Now, here is the fact that is astonishing to me. About 95 percent of commercial insurers provide coverage for continuous glucose monitors, but Medicare is refusing to provide coverage for those devices. I recently heard about this problem from one of my constituents, 74-year-old Prudence Barry of Portland, ME. Diabetes treatments have changed dramatically since Pru was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes back in 1954. Back then, it was very difficult for her to control her insulin levels and to get her glucose levels properly read. Well, Pru has led an active and fulfilling life. Living with type 1 diabetes for more than 60 years has taken its toll.  Today, Pru no longer feels it when her blood glucose levels drop to dangerous levels, causing her to lose consciousness and suffer seizures more frequently. Nighttime low sugars are particularly troubling. She fears the possibility of her blood sugar developing so low during the night that she never wakes up. The continuous glucose monitor is a potential lifesaver for Pru because it prevents these dangerously high or low blood glucose levels by alarming the wearer when the glucose levels fall outside of the safe range.  So even though 95 percent of private insurers cover this technology, Medicare does not. As a consequence, Pru does not have access to the potentially lifesaving device because she cannot afford to pay for it out of pocket. Pru is not alone. There are thousands of seniors with type 1 diabetes who like my constituent are denied access to thistechnology that would help keep them healthy and safe.  The ironic thing is it is only because of advances in diabetes care, such as continuous glucose monitors, that people with type 1 diabetes can expect to live long enough to become Medicare beneficiaries. So I am very concerned about this decision by CMS. It makes absolutely no sense. It contradicts all the work NIH and the FDA are doing to get new innovative treatments and technologies to patients.  I brought this up in a recent hearing of the HELP Committee and asked the outgoing FDA Commissioner what she thought. She expressed her regret about the lack of consultation between her agency and CMS about payments for FDA-approved devices and drugs. I am particularly concerned given the implications that this coverage decision will have for future decisions regarding artificial pancreas systems, which will combine a continuous glucose monitor, insulin pump, and sophisticated algorithm to control high and low blood sugar around the clock.  This coverage decision on the part of CMS--which, after all, is also part of the Department of Health and Human Services--directly counteracts all of the work that the NIH and the FDA are doing to get new innovative treatments and technologies to patients. As I said, I recently had the opportunity at a HELP Committee hearing to ask outgoing FDA Commissioner Hamburg whether CMS consults with her agency when making these kinds of coverage decisions. In response to my question, Commissioner Hamburg expressed regret that her agency does not routinely consult with CMS about payments for FDA-approved drugs and devices, saying that the FDA should ``look at the whole ecosystem of biomedical product development and use, and recognize that each of the different components that often operate in silos actually are very interdependent.'' I completely agree with her assessment.  I am therefore joining my colleague from New Hampshire and the Co-Chair of the Senate Diabetes Caucus in introducing the Medicare CGM Access Act of 2014 to create a separate benefit category under Medicare for the continuous glucose monitor and require coverage of the device for individuals meeting specified medical criteria.  Our legislation is strongly supported by a coalition of organizations, including the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, the American Association of Diabetes Educators, the Endocrine Society and the JDRF.  I encourage my colleagues to join us as cosponsors of this important legislation.  I see Senator Leahy has come to the floor and undoubtedly wants to speak on the pending business. Let me conclude my remarks by saying I am very pleased the Senator from New Hampshire, Jeanne Shaheen, who is the cochair of the Senate Diabetes Caucus, is joining me in introducing the Medicare CGM Access Act to create a separate benefit category under Medicare for these monitors and to require coverage of the device for seniors who are meeting specified medical criteria.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter of endorsement be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                   March 15, 2015.     Hon. Susan Collins,      U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Jeanne Shaheen,     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Collins and Shaheen, Therapy innovation is      moving forward at a rapid pace for those living with insulin-     dependent diabetes. As leaders of the Senate Diabetes Caucus,      you have worked to catalyze these efforts by ensuring      American patients have access to these life-saving      technologies that can transform quality of life. Advancements      in integrated insulin pump and continuous glucose monitoring      (CGM) technologies are progressing toward closed-loop      ``artificial pancreas'' systems that will enable greater      patient care and improved health outcomes. With these      technology advancements, thankfully, most children with type      1 diabetes will be Medicare beneficiaries one day, something      that could not have been said with such certainty even 20      years ago.       While thousands of people with insulin-dependent diabetes      benefit from advanced diabetes technologies, including CGM,      Medicare beneficiaries do not. CGM is covered by nearly all      private health plans. Numerous studies have demonstrated      conclusively that use of CGMs improves glucose control,      enabling better patient care, thereby improving patient      health. Studies have also shown that use of CGM devices      reduce severe hypoglycemia events, which particularly impact      elderly patients and can lead to falls, fractures and other      complications. The average cost of an inpatient hypoglycemia      admission is over $17,500.       The undersigned organizations strongly support your      legislation, the Medicare CGM Access Act that would remedy      this disparity for those in Medicare. Your legislation      creates a new benefit category for FDA approved CGM devices,      including stand-alone CGM, CGM integrated with an insulin      pump, and future artificial pancreas device systems. This      therapy would be covered for those meeting appropriate      medical criteria consistent with private coverage and      professional clinical guidelines. Again, thank you for your      continued leadership on behalf of those with diabetes and we      look forward to working with you to move this legislation      forward quickly.
