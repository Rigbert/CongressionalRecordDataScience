 President, debate concerning drugs and drug policy has reached new levels. The letters and phone calls which my office receive are a constant reminder that the influx of drugs into this country are at the top of constituents' concerns. Our fight against drugs exists on two fronts. Within our border we must educate our young about the dangers of drugs in an effort to reduce demand.  Along our borders there exists another battle. This battle, to keep drugs from entering the U.S. has become increasingly difficult as drug runners have been employing more sophisticated technologies and techniques. Small planes are using remote landing strips to ferry drugs across the border. In the Caribbean traffickers are using high-speed boats to escape the Coast Guard. I need not reiterate how these preexisting conditions are straining the effort of our front-line law enforcement people on the border. As the methods which drug traffickers along the Mexican border continue to improve, we are beginning to lose ground in our ``War on Drugs.'' This current predicament calls for an increasing and appropriate role for the U.S. military.  In recognition of this need, I am joining with Senator DeWine amd Senator Graham in sponsoring an amendment which, has been accepted, to the Department of Defense reauthorization bill. This amendment calls upon the Secretary of Defense to add drug interdiction and counter-drug activities under military operations other than war, in the Global Military Force Policy. This would effectively give counter-drug efforts greater priority than military exercises. In addition, it would come at no extra cost to the taxpayer. Military resources such as AWAC's and other military hardware would be reallocated and instead of being sent out on exercises, they would be used to detect and intercept drug traffickers.  Elevating the priority of drug interdiction within the Global Military Force Policy is necessary in helping stem the flow of illegal drugs into this country. In conclusion, if we are to ``get tough on drugs'' in the face of increasingly modernizing drug trade, we must seek to incorporate the U.S. military in our effort.                          ____________________
