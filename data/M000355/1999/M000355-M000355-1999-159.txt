 COCHRAN. I assure the gentleman from Kentucky that the Conference Report does contain the language as he has described.  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Chairman for including this project in the conference report. The Freeman Lake Dam is in dire need of rehabilitation, and the safety of the community rests upon the integrity of this dam. Finally, I would ask the gentleman from Mississippi, is it the conference's intent that funding to rehabilitate this dam comes from existing Emergency Watershed Protection program funds, since this structure represents a serious threat to life and property.
