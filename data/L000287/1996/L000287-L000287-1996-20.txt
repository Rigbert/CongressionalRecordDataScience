There now exists a $500,000 report from the outside counsel. Later today or tomorrow, the House will once again consider a privileged resolution I have offered calling for the release of the outside counsel's report. The public deserves the right to see that report. I encourage all of my colleagues to vote for the release of the secret Gingrich ethics report.                          ____________________
