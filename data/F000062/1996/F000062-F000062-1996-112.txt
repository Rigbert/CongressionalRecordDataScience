 President, I see that the new majority leader has entered the Senate. I personally want to extend to him my very sincere congratulations on his election. As he knows, we have had occasion to work together on one bill, and it was ill-fated. It was a postponement of the base closure process. As I recall, we got 16 votes. However, with your election, I look forward to occasions where we will have a majority of votes. I congratulate the Senator. I know he will do just fine.
