  This is a funny story. Even in the landslide Presidential election of 1936, when FDR--Franklin Delano Roosevelt--won a huge landslide victory, Vermont joined Maine as the only State in the country to vote against Roosevelt and vote for Alfred Landon, and thus came the well-known expression: ``As goes Maine, so goes Vermont.'' What Phil Hoff helped do is lead Vermont out of a one-party State, badly in need of reforms, and brought that State in many significant ways into the second half of the 20th century.  I yield back to the senior Senator from Vermont.
