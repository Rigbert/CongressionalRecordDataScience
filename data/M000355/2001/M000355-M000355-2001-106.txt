A bill to establish a Blue Ribbon Study Panel and an Election Administration Commission to study voting procedures and election administration, to provide grants to modernize voting procedures and election administration, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Rules and Administration.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, when election reform emerged on the nation's agenda last winter, as chairman of the Senate Rules Committee, the committee of jurisdiction over election law, I resolved to keep the issue from getting bogged down in the partisan morass. The furor and fervor surround the last election has finally given way to a constructive bipartisan consensus. Today it is a distinct pleasure to join with Senators Schumer, Torricelli, and Brownback in advancing bipartisan legislation to restore faith in American elections.  Even more remarkable is the support in the endeavor of two reform groups with whom I have been engaged over the years in something less than a mutual admiration society, to say the least: Common Cause and the League of Women Voters. Ours is perhaps the most curious alliance since Bob Dole teamed up with Britney Spears to push Pepsi. And only slightly less jarring.  Nearly as discombobulating was opening the New York Times editorial page and seeing my name in print in the lead editorial applauding the McConnell/Schumer/Torricelli/Brownback bill. My wife, the Secretary of Labor, subsequently performed the Heimlich maneuver, lest I choke on the New York Times' praise. No doubt the editorial writer experienced similar bewilderment, as Darth Vader suddenly became Luke Skywalker overnight.  As this alliance indicates, election reform must transcend partisanship and result in real and lasting achievement by ensuring what I call, the three A's of election reform: Accuracy, Access and Accountability. This is the essence of this bill.  Our bill will establish, for the first time in our Nation's history, a permanent Election Administration Commission. This new permanent commission will bring focused expertise to bear on the administration of elections, and, importantly, award matching grants to States and localities to improve the accuracy and integrity of our election system.  Accuracy. The last election produced outcries over inaccurate voter rolls where some cities actually had more registered voters than the voting age population. And, of course, we've all heard the stories of both pets and dead people being registered to vote, and, in some instances, actually voting.  This legislation will require accurate voter rolls to ensure that those who vote are legally entitled to do so, and do so only once.  Access. This legislation also seeks to ensure that never again will our men and women in uniform be denied the opportunity to vote. The bill will merge the Department of Defense's Office of Voting Assistance into the new permanent commission. Moreover, the bill will increase the ability of disabled voters to both register and vote.  Accountability. The new Election Administration Commission will dramatically increase accountability by awarding grants only to those states and localities who ensure accurate and accessible voting.  Again, I applaud Senators Schumer, Torricelli, and Brownback for their principled and diligent work on this effort over the past six months. I believe this bill is the first, best step toward meaningful election reform.                                 ______                                       By
