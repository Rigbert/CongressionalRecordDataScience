ADDITIONAL PROCEDURE FOR AUTHORIZING CERTAIN                    ACQUISITIONS OF FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE                    INFORMATION.       The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (50      U.S.C. 1801 et seq.) is amended by inserting after section      105 the following:   ``CLARIFICATION OF ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE OF PERSONS OUTSIDE THE                              UNITED STATES       ``Sec. 105A.  Nothing in the definition of electronic      surveillance under section 101(f) shall be construed to      encompass surveillance directed at a person reasonably      believed to be located outside of the United States.``ADDITIONAL PROCEDURE FOR AUTHORIZING CERTAIN ACQUISITIONS CONCERNING                PERSONS LOCATED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES       ``Sec. 105B.  (a) Notwithstanding any other law, the      Director of National Intelligence and the Attorney General,      may for periods of up to one year authorize the acquisition      of foreign intelligence information concerning persons      reasonably believed to be outside the United States if the      Director of National Intelligence and the Attorney General      determine, based on the information provided to them, that--       ``(1) there are reasonable procedures in place for      determining that the acquisition of foreign intelligence      information under this section concerns persons reasonably      believed to be located outside the United States, and such      procedures will be subject to review of the Court pursuant to      section 105C of this Act;       ``(2) the acquisition does not constitute electronic      surveillance;       ``(3) the acquisition involves obtaining the foreign      intelligence information from or with the assistance of a      communications service provider, custodian, or other person      (including any officer, employee, agent, or other specified      person of such service provider, custodian, or other person)      who has access to communications, either as they are      transmitted or while they are stored, or equipment that is      being or may be used to transmit or store such      communications;       ``(4) a significant purpose of the acquisition is to obtain      foreign intelligence information; and       ``(5) the minimization procedures to be used with respect      to such acquisition activity meet the definition of      minimization procedures under section 101(h).       ``This determination shall be in the form of a written      certification, under oath, supported as appropriate by      affidavit of appropriate officials in the national security      field occupying positions appointed by the President, by and      with the consent of the Senate, or the Head of any Agency of      the Intelligence Community, unless immediate action by the      Government is required and time does not permit the      preparation of a certification.     In such a case, the determination of the Director of National      Intelligence and the Attorney General shall be reduced to a      certification as soon as possible but in no event more than      72 hours after the determination is made.       ``(b) A certification under subsection (a) is not required      to identify the specific facilities, places, premises, or      property at which the acquisition of foreign intelligence      information will be directed.       ``(c) The Attorney General shall transmit as soon as      practicable under seal to the court established under section      103(a) a copy of a certification made under subsection (a).      Such certification shall be maintained under security      measures established by the Chief Justice of the United      States and the Attorney General, in consultation with the      Director of National Intelligence, and shall remain sealed      unless the certification is necessary to determine the      legality of the acquisition under section 105B.       ``(d) An acquisition under this section may be conducted      only in accordance with the certification of the Director of      National Intelligence and the Attorney General, or their oral      instructions if time does not permit the preparation of a      certification, and the minimization procedures adopted by the      Attorney General. The Director of National Intelligence and      the Attorney General shall assess compliance with such      procedures and shall report such assessments to the Permanent      Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of      Representatives and the Select Committee on Intelligence of      the Senate under section 108(a).       ``(e) With respect to an authorization of an acquisition      under section 105B, the Director of National Intelligence and      Attorney General may direct a person to--       ``(1) immediately provide the Government with all      information, facilities, and assistance necessary to      accomplish the acquisition in such a manner as will protect      the secrecy of the acquisition and produce a minimum of      interference with the services that such person is providing      to the target; and       ``(2) maintain under security procedures approved by the      Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence      any records concerning the acquisition or the aid furnished      that such person wishes to maintain.       ``(f) The Government shall compensate, at the prevailing      rate, a person for providing information, facilities, or      assistance pursuant to subsection (e).       ``(g) In the case of a failure to comply with a directive      issued pursuant to subsection (e), the Attorney General may      invoke the aid of the court established under section 103(a)      to compel compliance with the directive. The court shall      issue an order requiring the person to comply with the      directive if it finds that the directive was issued in      accordance with subsection (e) and is otherwise lawful.      Failure to obey an order of the court may be punished by the      court as contempt of court. Any process under this section      may be served in any judicial district in which the person      may be found.       ``(h)(1)(A) A person receiving a directive issued pursuant      to subsection (e) may challenge the legality of that      directive by filing a petition with the pool established      under section 103(e)(1).       ``(B) The presiding judge designated pursuant to section      103(b) shall assign a petition filed under subparagraph (A)      to one of the judges serving in the pool established by      section 103(e)(1). Not later than 48 hours after the      assignment of such petition, the assigned judge shall conduct      an initial review of the directive. If the assigned judge      determines that the petition is frivolous, the assigned judge      shall immediately deny the petition and affirm the directive      or any part of the directive that is the subject of the      petition. If the assigned judge determines the petition is      not frivolous, the assigned judge shall, within 72 hours,      consider the petition in accordance with the procedures      established under section 103(e)(2) and provide a written      statement for the record of the reasons for any determination      under this subsection.       ``(2) A judge considering a petition to modify or set aside      a directive may grant such petition only if the judge finds      that such directive does not meet the requirements of this      section or is otherwise unlawful. If the judge does not      modify or set aside the directive, the judge shall      immediately affirm such directive, and order the recipient to      comply with such directive.       ``(3) Any directive not explicitly modified or set aside      under this subsection shall remain in full effect.       ``(i) The Government or a person receiving a directive      reviewed pursuant to subsection (h) may file a petition with      the Court of Review established under section 103(b) for      review of the decision issued pursuant to subsection (h) not      later than 7 days after the issuance of such decision. Such      court of review shall have jurisdiction to consider such      petitions and shall provide for the record a written      statement of the reasons for its decision. On petition for a      writ of certiorari by the Government or any person receiving      such directive, the record shall be transmitted under seal to      the Supreme Court, which shall have jurisdiction to review      such decision.       ``(j) Judicial proceedings under this section shall be      concluded as expeditiously as possible. The record of      proceedings, including petitions filed, orders granted, and      statements of reasons for decision, shall be maintained under      security measures established by the Chief Justice of the      United States, in consultation with the Attorney General and      the Director of National Intelligence.       ``(k) All petitions under this section shall be filed under      seal. In any proceedings under this section, the court shall,      upon request of the Government, review ex parte and in camera      any Government submission, or portions of a submission, which      may include classified information.       ``(l) Notwithstanding any other law, no cause of action      shall lie in any court against any person for providing any      information, facilities, or assistance in accordance with a      directive under this section.       ``(m) A directive made or an order granted under this      section shall be retained for a period of not less than 10      years from the date on which such directive or such order is      made.''.     SEC. 3. SUBMISSION TO COURT REVIEW AND ASSESSMENT OF                    PROCEDURES.       The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (50      U.S.C. 1801 et seq.) is amended by inserting after section      105B the following:               ``SUBMISSION TO COURT REVIEW OF PROCEDURES       ``Sec. 105C.  (a) No later than 120 days after the      effective date of this Act, the Attorney General shall submit      to the Court established under section 103(a), the procedures      by which the Government determines that acquisitions      conducted pursuant to section 105B do not constitute      electronic surveillance. The procedures submitted pursuant to      this section shall be updated and submitted to the Court on      an annual basis.       ``(b) No later than 180 days after the effective date of      this Act, the court established under section 103(a) shall      assess the Government's determination under section      105B(a)(1) that those procedures are reasonably designed to      ensure that acquisitions conducted pursuant to section 105B      do not constitute electronic surveillance. The court's review      shall be limited to whether the Government's determination is      clearly erroneous.       ``(c) If the court concludes that the determination is not      clearly erroneous, it shall enter an order approving the      continued use of such procedures. If the court concludes that      the determination is clearly erroneous, it shall issue an      order directing the Government to submit new procedures      within 30 days or cease any acquisitions under section 105B      that are implicated by the court's order.       ``(d) The Government may appeal any order issued under      subsection (c) to the court established under section 103(b).      If such court determines that the order was properly entered,      the court shall immediately provide for the record a written      statement of each reason for its decision, and, on petition      of the United States for a writ of certiorari, the record      shall be transmitted under seal to the Supreme Court of the      United States, which shall have jurisdiction to review such      decision. Any acquisitions affected by the order issued under      subsection (c) of this section may continue during the      pendency of any appeal, the period during which a petition      for writ of certiorari may be pending, and any review by the      Supreme Court of the United States.''.     SEC. 4. REPORTING TO CONGRESS.       On a semi-annual basis the Attorney General shall inform      the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate, the      Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of      Representatives, the Committee on the Judiciary of the      Senate, and the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of      Representatives, concerning acquisitions under this section      during the previous 6-month period. Each report made under      this section shall include--       (1) a description of any incidents of non-compliance with a      directive issued by the Attorney General and the Director of      National Intelligence under section 105B, to include--       (A) incidents of non-compliance by an element of the      Intelligence Community with guidelines or procedures      established for determining that the acquisition of foreign      intelligence authorized by the Attorney General and Director      of National Intelligence concerns persons reasonably to be      outside the United States; and       (B) incidents of noncompliance by a specified person to      whom the Attorney General and Director of National      Intelligence issue a directive under this section; and       (2) the number of certifications and directives issued      during the reporting period.
