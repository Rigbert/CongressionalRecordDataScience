President, today I outlined some of the privacy challenges we will soon face as new micro monitoring technologies begin to proliferate in our society. I spoke in particular about breakthroughs in Radio Frequency Identification, also known as RFID.  My remarks were offered at Georgetown University Law Center, during a conference on the legal and technological challenges of video surveillance. Micro monitoring is a subject that deserves the attention of the Senate and of the American people, and I ask unanimous consent the text of my address be printed in the Record in the interest of advancing this discussion.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows:   The Dawn of Micro Monitoring: It's Promise, and its Challenges to                           Privacy and Security       In our post-9/11 world, technology often has been our      crucial but silent partner in helping us to ramp up our law      enforcement and national security capabilities. We in this      city are profoundly aware of the new risks we face. But we      also need to do it right. The public does not want false      assurances, nor do they want to be unduly alarmed. What the      American people want is to actually be safer. And we still      have a way to go in accomplishing that.                  Tension Between Liberty And Security       In our constitutional system there is always tension      between liberty and security and never more so than since      September 11th. One of the difficult challenges we face is to      strike the right midpoint. Our constitutional checks and      balances are intended to help us do that.       The video technologies you are discussing today offer tools      that are better, faster and smarter, on scales of magnitude      that are unprecedented. As an advocate of emerging      technologies who also has a keen interest in them, I watch      these breakthroughs with great interest.       I have sought to find ways to encourage the commercial      sector to create new products and opportunities, and I have      promoted use of new technologies by law enforcement agencies,      while also protecting consumer privacy and constitutional      freedoms. That was the balance I sought to strike in my work      on CALEA and in other legislation that blends law      enforcement's needs, the needs of our robust technology      sector, and the privacy interests of the American people. The      hands-off approach to the Internet that I have favored is      another example, and right now I am working with others to      extend the Internet tax moratorium, to keep the Internet free      from discriminatory and multiple state and local taxes.              On The Cusp Of A Micro-Monitoring Revolution       The marriage of information-gathering technology with      information storing technology, manipulated in increasingly      sophisticated databases, is beginning to produce the defining      privacy challenge of the information age. Modern databases,      networks and the Internet allow us to easily collect, store,      distribute and combine video, audio and other digital trails      of our daily transactions. We are on the verge of a      revolution in micro-monitoring the capability for the highly      detailed, largely automatic, widespread surveillance of our      daily lives.                                 RFIDs       And one of the most dramatic and dazzling new challenges we      all will be facing soon is the emergence of a relatively new,      surveillance-related technology called radio frequency      identification--R-F-I-D for short.       RFID tags are tiny computer chips that can be attached to      physical items in order to provide identification and      tracking by radio. Their potential invasiveness is obvious      from their size, which already is surprisingly small. And      they will only get smaller.       In their basic function, RFID chips are like barcodes,      which by now are ubiquitous in our stores and offices and      crime labs and manufacturing plants.                          Barcodes On Steroids       But RFID chips are like supercharged barcodes--barcodes on      steroids, if you will. They are so small they can be tagged      onto almost any object. They do not have to be in open view;      RFID receivers just have to be within the vicinity--at a      security checkpoint, in a doorway, inside a mailbox, atop a      traffic light. And RFID chips can carry a lot more      information than barcodes. Some versions are recordable so      that they can carry along the object's entire history.       RFID chips are more powerful than today's video      surveillance technology. RFIDs are more reliable, they are      100 percent automatic, and they are likely to become more      pervasive because they are significantly less expensive, and      there are many business advantages to using them. RFIDs seem      poised to become the catalyst that will launch the age of      micro-monitoring.       I have followed RFID technology for some time and have      welcomed its potential for many constructive uses. I have      supported the use of RFIDs in a Vermont pilot program for      tracking cattle to curtail outbreaks, like mad cow disease,      and our Vermont program     is now being emulated for a national tracking system. RFID      technology may also help thwart prescription drug      counterfeiting, a use the FDA encouraged in a recent report.      Leading retailers like Wal-Mart and Target--as well as the      Department of Defense--are requiring its use by suppliers for      inventory control. Fifty million pets around the world have      embedded RFID chips. Of course, many of us already have      experience with simpler versions of the technology in ``smart      tags'' at toll booths and ``speed passes'' at gas stations.       But this is just the beginning. RFID technology is on the      brink of widespread applications in manufacturing,      distribution, retail, healthcare, safety, security, law      enforcement, intellectual property protection and many other      areas, including mundane applications like keeping track of      personal possessions. Some visionaries imagine, quote, ``an      internet of objects''--a world in which billions of objects      will report their location, identity, and history over      wireless connections. Those days of long hunts around the      house for lost keys and remote controls might be a      frustration of the past.       These all raise exciting possibilities, but they also raise      potentially troubling tangents. While it may be a good idea      for a retailer to use RFID chips to manage its inventory, we      would not want a retailer to put those tags on goods for sale      without consumers' knowledge, without knowing how to      deactivate them, and without knowing what information will be      collected and how it will be used. While we might want the      Pentagon to be able to manage its supplies with RFID tags, we      would not want an al Qaeda operative to find out about our      resources by simply using a hidden RFID scanner in a war      situation.                             Drawing Lines       Of course these are just some of the foreseeable      possibilities, and a lot depends on enhancements in the      technology, reductions in costs, and developments in      voluntary standard-setting, systems and infrastructure to      manage RFID-collected information. But the RFID train is      beginning to leave the station, and now is the right time to      begin a national discussion about where, if at all, any lines      will be drawn to protect privacy rights.       The need to draw some lines is already becoming clear.      Recent reports revealed clandestine tests at a Wal-Mart store      where RFID tags were inserted in packages of Max Factor      lipsticks, with RFID scanners hidden on nearby shelves. The      radio signals triggered nearby surveillance cameras to allow      researchers 750 miles away to watch those consumers in      action. A similar test occurred with Gillette razors at      another Wal-Mart store.       These excesses suggest that Congress may need to step in at      some point. When privacy intrusions reach the point of      behavior that is absurdly out of bounds, we find ourselves      having to deal with such issues as the ``Video Voyeurism      Prevention Act,'' a bill now before Congress that would ban      the use of camera to spy in bathrooms and up women's skirts,      a practice that by now has even been given a name,      ``upskirting,'' which I'm sure is as new to you as it is to      most of us in Congress.       Other powerful new technologies are on the horizon, like      sensor technology and nanotechnology. All the more reason to      think about these issues broadly and to establish guiding      principles serving the twin goals of fostering useful      technologies while keeping them from overtaking our civil      liberties.       With RFID technology as with many other surveillance      technologies, we need to consider how it will be used, and      will it be effective. What information will it gather, and      how long will that data be kept? Who will have access to      those data banks, and under what checks-and-balances? Will      the public have appropriate notice, opportunity to consent      and due process in the case mistakes are made? How will the      data be secured from theft, negligence and abuse, and how      will accuracy be ensured? In what cases should law      enforcement agencies be able to use this information, and      what safeguards should apply? There should be a general      presumption that Americans can know when their personal      information is collected, and to see, check and correct any      errors.       These are all questions we need to consider, and it is      entirely possible that Congress may decide that enacting      general parameters would be constructive. It is important      that we let RFID technology reach its potential without      unnecessary constraints. But it is equally important that we      ensure protections against privacy invasions and other      abuses. Technology may also help with the answers--for      example, ``blockers'' that deactivate RFID tags, and software      that thwarts spyware.                     Beginning A National Dialogue       There is no downside to a public dialogue about these      issues, but there are many dangers in waiting too long to      start. We need clear communication about the goals, plans and      uses of the technology, so that we can think in advance about      the best ways to encourage innovation, while conserving the      public's right to privacy.       We have seen this time and time again where a potentially      good approach is hampered because of lack of communication      with Congress, the public and lack of adequate consideration      for privacy and civil liberties.       Take for example the so-called CAPPS II program. No doubt      in a post-9/11 world, we should have an effective airline      screening system. But the Administration quietly put this      program together, collected passengers' information without      their knowledge and piloted this program without      communicating with us and before privacy protections were in      place. The result was a recent GAO analysis that showed      pervasive problems in the screening program and admissions      that we are now set back in our efforts to create an      effective screening system.       As another example, the Administration recently funded the      MATRIX program to provide law enforcement access to state      government and commercial databases. This was potentially a      useful crime-fighting tool. But there was insufficient      information about the program and about potentially intrusive      data mining capabilities, and there were unaddressed concerns      about privacy protections. Now 11 out of 16 states      participating in the program have pulled out--many, citing      privacy concerns--thus hampering the effectiveness of the      information sharing program. Again, had some of these issues      been vetted in advance, we may have been able to enhance law      enforcement intelligence.       Just recently, there were reports about the FBI's new      Strategic Medical Intelligence program, in which doctors have      been enlisted to report to the FBI ``any suspicious event,''      such as an unusual rash or a lost finger. The goal of      preventing bio-terrorism is important. But there are many      unanswered questions about the program's privacy protections      and its ability to identify truly suspicious events and not      unrelated personal medical situations. Hopefully, this      program will not be hampered by lack of communication and      oversight.       I have written oversight letters to the Justice Department      and to the Department of Homeland Security on all of these      issues and am waiting for their responses.       I want to make sure that mistakes like those are not      repeated, especially with RFID technology, where there is so      much potential value. That is why I asked to speak with you      today, to begin the process of encouraging public dialogue in      both the commercial and public sectors before the RFID genie      is let fully out of its bottle.       This is a dialogue that should cut across the political      spectrum, and it should include the possibility of      constructive, bipartisan congressional hearings. The earlier      we begin this discussion, the greater the prospects for      success in reaching consensus on a set of guiding principles.       When several of us from both parties banded together years      ago to found the Congressional Internet Caucus, we were      united by our appreciation for what the Internet would do for      our society. Years later, we remain united, we remain      optimistic, and partisanship has never interfered in the      Caucus's work.       That is the spirit in which I hope a discussion can now      begin on micro-monitoring.       Thank you for your interest in these cutting-edge issues,      and thanks for this opportunity to share some ideas with you.                          ____________________
