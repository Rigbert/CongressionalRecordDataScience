President, I am pleased today to speak on the 60th anniversary of the founding of the State of Israel, and to congratulate the Israeli people on this historic occasion.  It is also an appropriate occasion to note the close and unwavering friendship our two countries have enjoyed over the past 60 years.  President Harry Truman formally recognized Israel just 11 minutes after the new country's independence proclamation. Eleven minutes. That is perhaps the fastest that anything has ever occurred in this city.  Fast doesn't necessarily mean easy, though, and President Truman was under a great deal of pressure, including from his own State Department, not to support the creation of a Jewish state.  But Harry Truman did the right and courageous thing, and for the past 60 years, Israel has been one of America's closest friends and allies  That friendship has persevered, in part because of our dedication to many common values.  Israel has a strong and vibrant democratic tradition, and a prosperous and innovative free-market economy.  In fact, Israel's economy grew faster last year than that of the United States, Europe, the U.K. or Japan. Such growth stems in part from more than 3,000 hi-tech companies now operating in Israel.  And, I believe, Israel is committed to achieving peace with its neighbors. But peace requires security, and the United States still has a very important role to play to make both of these a reality.
