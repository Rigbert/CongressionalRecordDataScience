President, I was necessarily absent from this afternoon's vote on Franken amendment No. 3833, which was adopted to the pending business--Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, H.R. 2028.  On rollcall vote No. 59, had I been present, I would have voted to support the amendment. Senator Franken's amendment will further strengthen the deployment of clean energy by creating a Tribal Energy Loan Guarantee Program to fund energy projects in Indian Country. This amendment will help Indian tribes access much needed financing as they seek to develop energy projects and create well-paying jobs.
