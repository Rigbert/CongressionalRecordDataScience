 President, before the Senator from Ohio leaves the floor, I had an opportunity to listen to his tribute to our former colleague, Senator Voinovich, and he was indeed a stunningly successful public servant. I mean, just thinking about any Republican getting elected mayor of Cleveland, it is hard to imagine such a thing, and then to be so extraordinarily successful at every step in his career.  I was privileged to get to know him when he came to the Senate. My colleague from Ohio knew him a lot longer than I did, but I wanted, on behalf of all of us who served with George, to thank the Senator for that extraordinary tribute to his outstanding life.                          ____________________
