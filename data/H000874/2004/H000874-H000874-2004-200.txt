 Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, as the gentleman knows, the bill was introduced last Friday. Members should be aware of that for those who are interested to see what is in the bill.  It is very difficult to answer the gentleman's question, not having the bill marked up and looking at what the ultimate outcome of the bill might be. And again, I do not want to preempt what the Committee on Rules does. As the gentleman knows, a bill coming from the Committee on Ways and Means, particularly a bill like this which has so many issues in it, amendments are traditionally not allowed, but substitutes are considered. And wewill just have to work through that as we work through next week to decide one way or another whether a substitute or a number of substitutes would be offered, or allowed to be offered.
