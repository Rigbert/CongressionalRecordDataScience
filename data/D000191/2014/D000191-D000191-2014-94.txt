 I would congratulate the gentleman from Kentucky on his eloquent description of Mill Springs and its significance in our history in the Civil War. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1993, but the gentlemanmakes an eloquent case that it should be upgraded from a National Historic Landmark to look at as a part of the National Park System.  This bill would allow the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a special resource study in anticipation of making this a part of the National Park System. And I want to congratulate the gentleman on his advocacy and thank him for his dedication to protecting and promoting this resource.  With that, I yield back the balance of my time.
