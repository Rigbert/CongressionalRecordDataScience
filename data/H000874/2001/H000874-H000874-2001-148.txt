Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. I am glad to join him. All of us have staff members and they have become extraordinarily close. We work together sometimes some intense and long hours, and I know how much Joe Moakley thought of the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern). To the extent that Joe is gone, he certainly will live on in the gentleman on this floor who replicates his decency, his honesty, his integrity, and his ability, and his commitment to people. I say to the gentleman, we count him as a colleague who will reflect Joe's values on this floor for years to come.  Mr. Speaker, this is D-Day. It was the beginning of the end of the great conflict in our lifetime. There were other conflicts, and there will be others, but Tom Brokaw correctly reflects on the Joe Moakley generation as being the greatest generation.                              {time}  1315  On December 7, of course, 1941, that war began essentially for the United States. We had been participating to some degree, but it began for us then, that day that will live in infamy.  Days after, Joe Moakley, at the age of 15, said, ``I am going to be a part of the defense of freedom,'' and he volunteered for the United States Navy. Initially, as I understand, even he could not get away with it, being 15. But a few months later he bulked up, I suppose, and maybe grayed his hair a little bit. I am not sure what he did, but he made it in, because he wanted to serve. He wanted to be in the forefront of the defense of liberty of the country that he loved.  It has been said so many times here that Joe Moakley did not forget from whence he came. I went to the Maryland State Senate at the age of 27, and there was an individual there who I thought was old then, but he is probably younger than I am now. His name was William Hodges. They called him Bip Hodges. He had been a fighter, a prize fighter. He represented the Sixth District of Baltimore City.  He was, from my perspective, sort of a Damon Runyon type figure. Everybody loved Bip Hodges. Everybody in his district referred to him as Bip. I thought when I went there fresh out of law school that this was sort of a rough-hewn guy that really did not know what was going on.  I had the privilege of serving with him on the Senate Finance Committee, and every day that I served with him, every week and every month and every year, I became more aware of how in touch he was with his district, of how in touch he was with his people.  I do not frankly think it was so much that Joe Moakley never forgot his district; Joe Moakley was what he came from. To that extent, I think everyone who has spoken reflects the truth that Joe Moakley represented exactly what the Founding Fathers wanted this body to be: representatives of their people.  No one with whom I have served better reflected that representation, that sense of his people, of their decency, of their fortitude, of their faith, of their courage, better than our friend, Joe Moakley. The gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Neal) spoke of it, as have others.  He loved this institution. He loved what it represented, as well as the opportunity that it gave him, as he did as a boy of 15 defending freedom on the front lines, and here defending freedom at every opportunity; as has been mentioned, sometimes in the front lines, and sometimes when his people perhaps did not exactly understand what the defense of freedom was and what he was representing.  We have all been blessed to have served with a person of the wit, of the warmth, of the well-grounded and in-touch nature that was Joe Moakley. There are a lot of smart people in the world, but there are not so many wise people. Joe Moakley was smart, Joe Moakley represented his people, and Joe Moakley was a wise and extraordinarily good human being.  The Founding Fathers, were they on this floor speaking, I think would say, ``Joe Moakley is what we had in mind when we created the House of Representatives.'' His friend, Tip O'Neill, has been called a man of the House, and he was. His dear friend, Joe Moakley, was equally a man of the House, a man of south Boston, a man of Massachusetts, a man of the Irish, a man of America. How blessed America was by the life of Joe Moakley.
