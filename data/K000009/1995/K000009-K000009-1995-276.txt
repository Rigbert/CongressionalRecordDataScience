They are unelected. They do not have to come up here. Most Americans do not know who the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve are, and yet all of the money that the citizens put in their banks back home, those banks, if they should choose, and most of them do, then pay dues into the Federal Reserve System.  They are organized by districts around the United States. The closest one to me is in Cleveland, OH, since I [[Page H963]] live in the State of Ohio. Those banks belong to the Federal Reserve here in Washington.  It is my opinion not all Federal Reserve district banks have the same importance in the system, because it was not the banks that belonged to the Cleveland Federal Reserve that got into all the trouble 12 years ago or 13 years ago in making those loans to Mexico. It was largely money-center banks in New York City that caused all the trouble. Yet our member banks back home had to help cushion those blows. They were forced to charge higher interest rates to their customers.  They did not cause the damage in the system, and I think what we have here is the predominance of one set of money-center banks from Wall Street and their related brokerage houses doing business in very close communication, not open to the general public. Of course, I mean, they do not see this happening.  But yet they draw money in from the system, do things with it that causes problems, and they become very powerful in making economic decisions for this country.  The gentleman was asking me about an article in the Wall Street Journal today. You know, we have been trying to figure out why interest rates are going up in the United States when there is no inflation, when people's wages are not going up; in fact, people are taking benefit cuts all over this country. We have so many part-time workers and temporary workers and people who are being outsourced, downsized, restructured, redeployed. There are all kinds of names for this.  And you ask yourself why would interest rates be going up in the United States. Well, they are not really going up because of what is happening in this country, but the markets are reflecting, our market here, and the interest rates, are reflecting draws on the system because of decisions made by money-center banks and large corporations in other countries.  The closest one at the moment is Mexico. I believe interest rates are going up in this country because the market is taking it out on the American people, the banks that have a lot at risk and have made some bad decisions, and the brokerages that borrow from them have made some bad decisions. And now the American people are having to pay for it in their checking accounts, in the mortgage payments that they make, as the gentleman said, and what you mentioned in terms of the price of a $100,000 house.  I know I figured it out for a $60,000 house in Toledo, OH. The interest rates over last year will cost that family $100 more a month, $1,200 more a year.  I do not care how much tax-cutting we do this year in this Congress, we are not going to be able to offset the real dollars people are paying every day through the worst taxes of all, which are these higher interest rates people pay on their credit cards and cars and on their homes.  Some of the people that are causing the trouble were talked about today beginning on page A3 of the Wall Street Journal in an article called ``Mexico's Currency Plunges Nearly 10 Percent,'' and it continues on page A8. We have been asking the Clinton administration for a list of who Mexico owes money to, who are the creditors that are supposed to be bailed out. Of course, they have not sent us an answer.  It is very interesting what it says in the top paragraph on page A8. It says that if the Congress and the taxpayers were to bail out Mexico, one beneficiary would be the firm that Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin used to run, Goldman, Sachs & Co., which ranked as the No. 1 underwriter of Mexican stocks and bonds in the United States and European markets for 1992 through 1994. In those 3 years, according to Security Data Co., Goldman underwrote over $5 billion worth in Mexican securities compared with $2 billion for the securities unit of J.P. Morgan & Co. Third was Bear, Stearns & Co. at $1.8 billion.  So I would guess that even though the administration and the Treasury Department have not provided us with the specific list of creditors that we are looking for, we can begin by reading between the lines here and see whose wallets are really on the line.  Mr. DeFAZIO. If I could interject at that point. There is an excellent quote which plays off that in the business section today of the Washington Post, page D1, where the vice-chairman of Goldman, Sachs, Robert Hormats, says the prestige of the President, the Fed Chairman, and the leadership of both Houses in Congress has been committed. If Congress were to kill the aid package, the feeling in the rest of the world would be that we are a nation in disarray, a country incapable of addressing a crisis. The psychological blow would be enormous.  I wonder if Mr. Hormats is really talking about the blow to the United States of America and the people whom I represent who have not been speculating in Mexico, or is he talking about the blow to Goldman, Sachs, who has done 5.2 billion dollars' worth of business in Mexico for the last 3 years.  If we are taking about that, I am really concerned what is being proposed now by the ex-director of Goldman, Sachs, the Secretary of the Treasury, is to bail out Mexico now through an Executive order, not through coming to the United States Congress.                             {time}   2050  They found the Congress exerted, in this case, uncommon good sense; they said ``Wait a minute, we don't see the collateral or the national security interests. Why are we looking at this $40 billion bailout?''  I see the gentleman from California [Mr. Hunter] has arrived.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California.
