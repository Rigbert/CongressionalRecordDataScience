 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a dedicated steward of our national forests, Mr. Ben Worthington. Last month, Ben retired from the National Forest Service after 32 years of service. For the last 10 of these years, my home State of Kentucky was fortunate to have him serve as forest supervisor of the Daniel Boone National Forest.  Ben began his forestry career at Washington State University, where he earned a degree in forest management. After graduating, he joined the Peace Corps and was relocated to Costa Rica for 2 years. Upon his return, he worked for the Forest Service in his home State of Oregon and eventually in Washington State and California. Before moving to Kentucky, he was the deputy forest supervisor at Bridger Teton National Forest in Wyoming.  As forest supervisor of the Daniel Boone National Forest, Ben oversaw the day-to-day operation and preservation of Kentucky's only national forest. The Daniel Boone National Forest covers over 700,000 acres of land from the northeastern part of the Commonwealth of Kentucky all the way to the Tennessee State line, and also includes some noncontiguous counties in eastern Kentucky. This Kentucky treasure has something for every outdoor enthusiast. With over 600 miles of trails, it can be hiked, biked, and explored on horseback. Visitors may also fish, hunt, and camp in the forest, making it a popular weekend getaway or vacation destination.  I had the privilege to team up with Ben by securing funds over the years to help with the marijuana eradication operations on or near the national forest land. Ben and his staff have worked in lockstep with the local sheriff's departments, the Kentucky State Police, and the Kentucky National Guard to identify and destroy marijuana plants. They have done a terrific job, and I know that Ben's success will be carried on by his successor.  After working for 32 years in the Forest Service, Ben plans to remain in Kentucky. His wife is active in their local community of Winchester, his mother now calls Kentucky home, and his two children attend Western Kentucky University. Ben's work ethic, dedication, and love of the land will be greatly missed, but it is time for him to start a new chapter, and I wish Ben the best in his retirement.                          ____________________[Page S13334]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                     TRIBUTE TO MR.
