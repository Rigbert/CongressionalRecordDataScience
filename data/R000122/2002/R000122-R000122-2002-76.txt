 Although some in the world still want to convince themselves, as well as others, that the deaths of so many Armenians was simply a product of a civil war, the facts are undeniable: from 1915 to 1923 1,500,000 Armenians died, and 500,000 refugees were forced to flee. These facts must continue to be affirmed. To ignore the Armenian Genocide would be to ignore history and therefore allow the preconditions to exist for another radical leader to rise and legitimize the future genocide of another of the world's people. Let anyone ask: ``who remembers the Armenians?'' and the answer would be: Millions in the United States and around the world. Today, Rhode Island is among 31 States which have, by either resolution or proclamation, recognized the Armenian Genocide.  At the time of the Armenian Genocide, Europe and the United States were too embroiled in the First World War to understand the magnitude and consequences of the atrocities being committed and therefore did little more than protest by correspondence. Understanding and remembrance today ensures that the world will respond appropriately to avert these tragedies tomorrow. As proof, we need only look to NATO's quick and decisive action to quell the Kosovo crisis.  We must also recognize that, in addition to the tragedies of the past, Armenians continue to suffer from the economic effects of natural disaster and the dispute over Nagorno Karabagh. Yet amidst this suffering the Armenian people continue to strive to build an independent democratic nation of peace in the Caucasus region. So, despite crisis elsewhere in the world, we must remain attentive to Armenia and the people of Nagorno Karabagh and recognize that significant economic assistance now will prove to be an investment with long term reward in a region of strategic significance to the United States.  Today while we solemnly commemorate the tragedy of the past, let us rededicate ourselves to building a strong and vibrant Armenia for the future.                          ____________________
