Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the Furse amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I first want to say that I applaud the subcommittee this year and the full committee as well, for the bill itself is $1.1 billion less than last year's spending bill, which I think is a step in the right direction.  However, Mr. Chairman, I must say that I am dismayed that it is still $900 million more than what the Pentagon asked for. This amendment seeks to cut $17 million of the $900 million in unrequested funds. The money is designated, as the gentlewoman from Oregon [Ms. Furse] indicated, for barracks improvements in Germany.  While there is nothing wrong with improving the quality of life for our troops, there is something wrong in asking the taxpayer to spend $17.5 million for a military project that the Pentagon does not have in its long-range plan. It did not request it, and consequently it must not see the need for this project.  Mr. Chairman, I know that it is hard to cut spending. We do not win a lot of battles, and I regret that this amendment is likely to fail. I wish that we had the line-item veto in effect for this year's spending appropriations instead of next year's. It would have been a good first test. But unfortunately it does not start until next year.  Mr. Chairman, $17 million is a lot of money. It is a lot of money in anybody's checkbook, whether it be the Federal Government's or somebody else's. And if we are going to start in cutting back on waste and unneeded projects, this is where we ought to start.  So, Mr. Chairman, I would urge my colleagues to join with me and the Citizens Against Government Waste and the Taxpayers for Common Sense in supporting this amendment.
