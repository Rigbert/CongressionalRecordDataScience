Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the only amendments remaining to the bill other than the pending amendments be the two lists I now send to the desk; provided further that they be subject to second degrees that are related to the subject matter of the first degree; further, that all other provisions governing the consideration of this bill remain in effect.
