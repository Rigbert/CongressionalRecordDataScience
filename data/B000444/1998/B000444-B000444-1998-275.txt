 President, I will ask my friend a question on my time. What is the relevance of whether or not there is a new strategic concept as it relates to whether or not Austria is a new member of NATO? Are you suggesting that if the 16 NATO members now agree--or 19 when we finish tonight--to a change in the strategic concept, that change might or might not influence whether we should let Austria in if they meet all other criteria?
