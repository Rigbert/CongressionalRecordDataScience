 President, I am pleased to join Senators Kohl, Leahy, and others in introducing the COPS Improvement Act of 2009. I am honored to join them in introducing this important bill on an issue that has been so forcefully championed by Senator Biden for so many years.  It is my sincere hope that we are entering the dawn of a new age in our approach to State and local law enforcement funding. For the last 8 years, the Bush administration has steadily and drastically reduced the amount of funding and programming that the Federal Government provides to State and local law enforcement. This has been a huge mistake, with a corresponding spike in the rise of violent crime in our country.  The need for additional funding for state and local law enforcement through the COPS program is clear. Over the last 5 years, our country has experienced an alarming increase in violent crime. In 2007, the Police Executive Research Forum reported that from 2004 to 2006, homicides increased overall by 10 percent, aggravated assaults with guns rose 10 percent, and robberies rose 12 percent.  This survey mirrors the FBI's own statistics, which showed that violent crime rose by 1.8 percent between 2003 to 2007. And this surge in the violent crime rate isn't just limited to big cities. In February 2008, in testimony before the House Judiciary Committee, Attorney General Mukasey acknowledged that violent crime was increasing across all of our communities.  Let me put these numbers in human terms. The International Association of Chiefs of Police equates the rise of 2.5 percent to 31,479 more victims of violent crimes in 2005. The 3.7 increase for all of 2006 means about 47,000 more Americans were victims of murder, robbery, assault, rape, or other violent crimes.  Unfortunately, despite these disturbing numbers and the Justice Department's own acknowledgement that violent crime is increasing, over the last 8 years the Bush administration continually proposed drastic cuts in the Federal assistance traditionally available to state and local law enforcement.  President Bush's proposed fiscal year 2009 budget slashed funding for State and local law enforcement at unprecedented rates. After repeatedly proposing to eliminate COPS hiring grants, President Bush finally zeroed out the entire COPS program for fiscal year 2009, replacing it with a mere $4 million for a new community policing grant. This is simply not acceptable and our communities are suffering because of it.  During the 1990s and earlier years in this decade, the federal government vigorously funded grant programs for state and local law enforcement, including the COPS Program. We saw real results--violent crime went down year after year. It is no surprise that with the recent cuts, violent crime rates have ticked back up.  This trend has to stop, and it is my hope that Congress and the incoming Obama administration will move to correct the huge damage that has been inflicted on state and local law enforcement in the last eight years. The bill Senator Kohl and I introduce today will go a long way to do that.  We know what works and we can see the results of ignoring and underfunding proven programs. We also know that crime often rises in times of economic trouble. Now is not the time to continue the rollbacks in state and law enforcement funding initiated by the Bush administration.  This bill will serve a dual purpose--creating thousands of jobs in the current economic downturn and providing state and local law enforcement with the resources they need to successfully fight crime.  Specifically, the bill would authorize $1.15 billion per year for the next 6 years to fund the following:  Police Hiring Grants: The bill authorizes $600 million per year to hire up to 50,000 officers to work in community policing efforts, and school resource officers to fight school violence. These funds will create jobs in a worsening economy, and can be used to retain officers, pay overtime costs, and reimburse officers for training costs.  Law Enforcement Technology Grants: The bill authorizes $350 million per year for police departments to obtain new technology and equipment to analyze real-time crime data and incident reports to anticipate crime trends, map crime ``hot-spots'', examine DNA evidence, and purchasing badly needed technology upgrades for police on the street.  Community Prosecutor Grants: The bill authorizes $200 million per year to help local district attorneys hire and train more prosecutors.  Troops-to-Cops Program: The bill authorizes a troops-to-cops program to encourage local police agencies to hire former military personnel who are honorably discharged from military service or who are displaced by base closings to allow them to continue working and engaging in public service.  The COPS Program is a time-tested program that has proven its effectiveness for years. It is one of the cornerstones in the State and local law enforcement efforts that have removed thousands of pounds of drugs and millions of dollars worth of drug proceeds from communities across the country.  Money from the COPS Program provides law enforcement with the officers, prosecutors and technology that they need to keep our communities safe. All we have to do is look at the rising rates of violent crime that correspond to the staggering funding cuts to understand how important these programs are for our country.  We must provide the necessary tools and funds to State and local law enforcement and act decisively to combat the nation's growing gang problem and violent crime. Enacting the COPS Improvement Act of 2009 will be a step in the right direction. I hope my colleagues will join Senator Kohl and I in supporting this important legislation.                                 ______                                        By
