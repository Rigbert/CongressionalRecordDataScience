Mr. Chairman, this is a historic day for our Nation. The coverup of abortion methods is over.  Today, Congress comes to grips with the specifics of what an abortion actually does, and it ain't pretty. From this day forward, we will no longer be able to say we did not know. We now know, and every Member of this Chamber should know, that every abortion takes the life of a child. Whether it be a partial-birth abortion or D&E abortion, where the baby is literally dismembered while in utero, or the suction abortions routinely done, thousands per day, where a high-powered vacuum, 20 to 30 times more powerful than a vacuum cleaner in one's home, literally dismembers the child. All of these methods kill the baby. This is all about human rights for children, and it is about preserving and protecting the right to life of baby girls and baby boys.  Somebody said this is anti-woman. Half of those little infants killed are baby girls. Let us not ever forget that. Then again, let's also remember what Dr. Haskel himself has said. I would like to repeat it very briefly. Dr. Haskel said and I quote: ``The surgeon forces the scissors into the base of the skull.'' This is medical practice? And then a high-powered suction catheter is introduced, and the baby's brains are sucked out.  This is not medical practice.  This is child abuse.
