 President, I am glad the Senate is finally getting serious about passing tax extenders this year. Congress has put off the extension of the expired tax provisions until the last minute all too frequently. In 2012 provisions remained expired for an entire year before finally being extended in January of 2013. Similarly, the previous extension of the expired provisions did not occur until the middle of December. Such late action by Congress results in complications come filing season for taxpayers, particularly for people who hire tax preparers; tax forms are not ready and as a result refunds are delayed. So we owe it to our constituents to see to it that these added complications are not a factor this year. Tax season is unpleasant enough without our adding to it by failing to do our job in a timely fashion.  Already, by allowing these tax provisions to expire for more than 5 months, we have created a lot of headaches and uncertainty for individuals and businesses.
