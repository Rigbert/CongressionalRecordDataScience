President, many of us served here with Jim Sasser, the very distinguished former chairman of the Budget Committee, now our Ambassador to China at a very difficult time.  We have seen the photographs of Ambassador Sasser under siege in the Chinese Embassy. I faxed him a note the other day, saying how proud I was, and I mentioned the comments of many Senators saying how proud they were, of his grace under fire and the fact that he would not leave the American Embassy that is under siege. When there were Embassy staff there, in the true and best tradition of the State Department and the Senate and the Marine Corps and everything else, he said he would stay until it was safe. So I faxed him this note.  This morning I got back this note from him, and I will read it for my colleagues. It is handwritten. It says:       Dear Pat: My sincere thanks for your wonderful note. Please      tell all my former colleagues that Mary and I are well and      safe. Things have stabilized after a turbulent few days. Last      night I got a good night's sleep in a real bed. All the best,      Jim.  I just wanted everybody to hear that.  I thank my friend from Utah.
