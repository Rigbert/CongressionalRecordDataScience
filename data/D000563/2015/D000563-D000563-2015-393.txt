President, in opposition to the Cornyn amendment, let me say this. Up to forty percent of the overall homeless youth population identify as LGBT, and many have reported that they have been subjected to service denial and discrimination by staff and providers based on their sexual orientation. The Leahy-Collins alternative expressly prohibits discrimination against youth because of their sexual orientation. That should be the gold standard.  Defeat the Cornyn amendment and vote for the bipartisan Collins-Leahy amendment.
