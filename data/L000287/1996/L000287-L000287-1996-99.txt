Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman for yielding and take just a moment, and I will have a much more extensive statement to submit for the Record, because I believe that Mr. Mfume represents the very best that this body has to offer. He is the personification of leadership, of vision.  We came here together, elected in 1986 and came here in 1987. He has been a great Member, a good Member. I hate to see him leave this place, but I know he is going on to bigger and better things. He will provide leadership for the NAACP, but in providing leadership for the NAACP, he will be providing leadership for this Nation.  So let me say to Congressman Mfume, my friend, my leader, and my brother, we wish you well, and Godspeed.
