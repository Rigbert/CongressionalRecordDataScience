Chair, as the gentleman knows, the bill already provides $87 million for other land acquisition. Our intent was to needle a Federal land acquisition program that has strong support in the East--certainly, in New Hampshire--and lukewarm support in the West, where the government already owns a significant amount of real estate in the Western United States. When the conference begins on this bill with the Senate, Congress will exercise its power of the purse by selecting projects from the President's budget to improve recreational access that have strong local, State, and congressional support.  I will work with the gentleman. I know he is a strong advocate of the Land and Water Conservation Fund, but this amendment might leave advocates on both sides of the aisle with some difficult and unnecessary choices. Therefore, I ask the gentleman to consider withdrawing his amendment, knowing I will be working with him in the future to see if we can't be of assistance through the conference process.  I yield back the balance of my time.
