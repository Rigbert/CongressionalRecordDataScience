President, I would just say to the Senator from Iowa, I was not part of his conversation with the majority leader as to when he was going to offer his unanimous consent request. He offered it after the chairman of the Finance Committee had left and virtually all the members had left.  Whether he had an opportunity to do that before, I do not know. He did not make a request of me. I was not aware of it. But he certainly met with Senator Baucus during the course of this week and had ample opportunity to raise this issue. It is something that should have been resolved between the two of them before Senator Baucus left. I think he would understand, as I do, that is a problem for Senator Baucus to be gone and to make a unanimous consent request.  One thing the Senator from Iowa did not say was why he objected to this bill. Again, he voted against it. Now he objected again--this bill that does contain assistance for my State and his State because of the recent flood disaster.
