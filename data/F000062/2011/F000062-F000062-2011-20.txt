 I may well use it.  Madam President, I object to the statement just made that this will make the United States of American less safe. Ten years of experience has shown it has not. Plot after plot after plot has been interrupted. I have served on the Intelligence Committee for 11 years now. We follow this closely. This country is much more safe because things have finally come together with the process that is working.  The FBI has a national security division with 10,000 people. There are 56 FBI offices. The military does not have offices to make arrests around this country. This constant push that everything has to be militarized--they were wrong on Hamdi, they were wrong on Hamdan. And it keeps going. And that it is terrible to protect people's rights. I do not think that creates a safe country. This country is special because we have certain values, and due process of law is one of those values. So I object. I object to holding American citizens without trial. I do not believe that makes us more safe. I object to saying that everything is mandatory military commission and military custody if anyone from abroad commits a crime in this country. The administration has used the flexibility in a way that they have won every single time. There have been no failures.  The Bush administration as well used the Federal courts without failure. They have gotten convictions. The military commissions have failed, essentially; 6 cases over 10, 11 years. I pointed out the sentences. So to say that what we are doing is to make this country less safe may be good for a 30-second sound bite, but it is not the truth.  I yield the floor.
