 I would like to have the time to read part of the transcript in a hearing on the Committee on Agriculture on July 10. A question that Senator Crapo asks to Mr. Newsome of the CFTC.       Senator Crapo: I know we have been over this before but I      want to be sure that I have it right. As I listened to the      testimony of both of you it seems to me that there is      actually a lot more agreement than disagreement with respect      to what we ought to be doing and where we ought to be. The      disagreement, as I understand it, is over whether 2G excludes      from the fraud and manipulation provision swap transactions.  Now, swap transactions are the dominant majority of what goes over the over-the-counter market.       I am correct about that. Would the two of you agree that is      the core of the disagreement between your testimony?       Mr. Newsome: 2G certainly does exclude swap transactions.  That is my point. And he is testifying to it in this committee that this is not covered by the CFTC.  It goes on.       Senator Crapo: It excludes them from fraud and manipulation      protections.       Mr. Newsome: 2G excludes them from jurisdictions of the      CFTC.
