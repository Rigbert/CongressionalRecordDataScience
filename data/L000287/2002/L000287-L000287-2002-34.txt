Mr. Speaker, I rise to salute a distinguished citizen, Paul L. Brady, of the Fifth Congressional District of Georgia as he celebrates a special day in his life, his 75th birthday.  Paul L. Brady, a native of Flint, Michigan, received his early education in the Flint public schools. After graduating from high school, he enlisted in the U.S. Navy. Following military service, he attended the University of Michigan and University of Kansas, majoring in psychology.  Judge Brady's interest in the law was prompted by his personal involvement in what became the landmark case of Brown v. The Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas. He attended law school at Washburn University, Topeka, where he received his Juris Doctor Degree. He did further study at the Lawyer's Institute, Chicago, Illinois; the Center for Administrative Justice, George Washington University; and graduate work at Georgetown Law Center, Washington, DC.  His legal experience included twelve years of private practice in Chicago, Illinois, an adjudicator for the Social Security Administration, a Supervisory Trial Attorney for the Federal Power Commission (receiving this commission's highest award for efficiency in 1971), and a Hearing Examiner with the Department of Health, Education and Welfare.  In 1972, he was appointed a Federal Administrative Law Judge and became the first African American to be so named. After serving 25 years on the bench, Judge Brady retired. During the last 6 years of his tenure, he presided as Chief Judge of the Atlanta Regional office. In his honor, a Library-Conference Room has been designated the Brady Conference Room in the Sam Nunn Federal Office Building.  Judge Brady is a member of the Judicial Council of the National Bar Association, the Federal Administrative Law Judges' Conference and the Federal Bar Association. He has also served as a faculty coordinator for a course on Administrative Law Procedure at the National Judicial College, Reno, Nevada. In addition to being a member of several State Bars, he is also admitted to practice before the Supreme Court of the United States.  A life member of the NAACP, he has received numerous awards and honors for community involvement, the highlight of which was national recognition for organizing government lawyers in a Volunteer Neighborhood Legal Services Program in Washington, DC.  In 1992, Flint Central High School selected Judge Brady as one of its initial honorees in the Alumni Hall of Fame. In 1997 he was inducted into the National Bar Association's Hall of Fame. He is the author of ``A Certain Blindness,'' a book that chronicles his family's history and is a prototype of other African-American families' quest for the ``promise of America.''  Judge Brady is the father of two children: Paul L. Brady, Jr., of Los Angeles, Dr. Laura Brady Sullivan and son-in-law Dr. Paul Sullivan, Southlake, Texas and grandson Paul Sullivan, Jr. He lives in Atlanta with his wife, Xernona, a television executive.                          ____________________
