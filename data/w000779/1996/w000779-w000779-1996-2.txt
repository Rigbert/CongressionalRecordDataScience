President, I introduce the Human Tissues Safety Act of 1996. I want to acknowledge at this time the hard work and cosponsorship of my colleagues, Senators Dodd and Simon, who have acted tirelessly in crafting this legislation which I believe enjoys broad support throughout the industry, and which offers patients receiving transplanted human tissues substantial new safety protection and assurance of quality.  This bill addresses regulation by the Food and Drug Administration of human tissue, including cells grown from a patient's own tissue, for transplantation. The bill also addresses the regulation of stem cells obtained from umbilical cord blood, which involves similar issues.  The purpose of this legislation is to ensure that human tissue is regulated in a manner that ensures its safety, while allowing efficacy to be demonstrated through the use of patient outcome registries rather than premarket approval mechanisms that would impede patient access and burden the development of important new tissue repair therapies.  Mr. President, I find it shocking that FDA does not even have a list of the hundreds of tissue banks in this country that process human tissue from cadavers. Without such a list, FDA cannot send inspectors to these tissue banks to ensure that they comply with the Agency's infectious disease screening requirements. We should not wait until a child get AIDS from infected tissue to empower FDA to ensure compliance with its infectious disease screening requirements.  At the same time, our bill would create reduced regulation for the safest type of human tissue--human cells that are taken from a patient biopsy, grown in cell culture, and then reimplanted into the same patient to repair or replace similar tissue. This type of tissue, known as autologous tissue, presents no risk of infectious disease. Although autologous tissue has historically been unregulated, both in the U.S. and throughout the world, the FDA recently announced that it would begin requiring premarket approval for this class of tissue in December 1997.  The FDA's policies for allogeneic, that is, from a donor source, and autologous, that is, from the same patient, tissue are inconsistent with the concept of regulating products based on risk. For instance, cartilage that is obtained from a cadaver presents a number of risks--infectious disease, rejection by the patient's body, graft-versus-host disease, and the risks associated with using immunosuppressive drugs--but is not subject to premarket approval. It does not make sense to require premarket approval for a patient's own cartilage, when alternative, and more risky, sources of cartilage are essentially unregulated.  This bill approaches this field from a very different perspective. We begin with a recognition that transplantation of human tissue, whether allogeneic or autologous, has been an unregulated practice of medicine for over thirty year. During this time, the major problems with tissue and, for that matter, organ transplantation have been, first, the risk of infectious disease and, second, the lack of enough donated tissues and organs for all the patients who need them. There has never been any demonstrated need for a premarket approval mechanism for tissue transplantation. Indeed, the lack of premarket approval has permitted rapid progress to occur in this field, along with faster patient access to important new therapies.  This bill also recognizes that human cells and tissues are not drugs, biological products, or medical devices, and that it is inappropriate to regulate them as if they were. Drugs may be toxic or carcinogenic, while tissue is not. Drugs circulate in the bloodstream and have systemic effects, while tissue is typically transplanted into a localized area and does not circulate in the blood. For these, and many other reasons, tissue is generally less risky than the products that FDA traditionally regulates. The results of transplantation generally are much more predictable than are the effects of a synthetic chemical. It does not make sense to regulate human tissue under a regulatory regime designed for vastly different products. Nor does it make sense to regulate autologous tissue more stringently than allogeneic tissue.  We also recognize that, unlike the patented products that FDA regulates, human tissue transplantation typically involves nonproprietary substances, such as heart valves, bone marrow, corneas, and ligaments. As a result, it's difficult for physicians, tissue banks, and biotechnology companies that develop new ways to use tissue to financially justify the expenditures associated with meeting premarket approval requirements. It is unclear, for instance, that bone marrow transplantation would have been developed had FDA required premarket approval for this technology. And, indeed, when FDA decided to require premarket approval for human heart valves, two of the four tissue banks that supplied these heart valves to surgeons went out of business.  The bottom line is that FDA's plan to regulate many types of human tissue as if they were drugs, and to regulate autologous tissue more stringently than allogeneic tissue, is an exercise of trying to fit square pegs in round holes. It will significantly increase the costs of developing new tissue repair therapies, while delaying patient access for years.  This bill also addresses the regulation of umbilical cord blood, a related field with tremendous medical promise. Until recently, a baby's umbilical cord was considered to be a disposable medical waste. Now we know that umbilical cord blood is a rich source of stem cells, which like bone marrow can be used in transplantation to treat childhood leukemia and other cancers. Infact, cord blood stem cells are even better than bone marrow stem cells because cord blood cells require less precise donor matching than bone marrow cells.  Bone marrow transplantation has been essentially unregulated for the past 30 years, and during that time the principal problem has not been a lack of safety or efficacy, but a lack of bone marrow. Only about 10 percent of transplant candidates are able to obtain a donor match in time to save their lives. So cord blood transplantation is an exciting and potentially lifesaving new development.  Unfortunately, while bone marrow transplantation was developed at a time when FDA did not feel the need to subject every new therapy to premarket approval, cord blood transplantation was not. As in the case of autologous cell therapies, FDA is proposing to regulate cord blood transplantation as if it were a drug, significantly hindering the development of this new therapy.  Mr. President, this bill does not answer all of the questions. For example, I believe that when we take up this legislation at the beginning of the next Congress we must address issues including safeguarding the confidentiality of proprietary company and patient information likely to be recorded during the registry process. Also, oversight will be needed to ensure that if and when FDA implements this process, an overriding theme drives the regulatory exercise . . . that being that the rigor of the FDA's requirements match, but not exceed, the degree of manipulation a particular human tissue product undergoes.  This is an exciting and potentially very important new field of biomedical research. It is my intention to focus on this issue early in the next Congress.                                 ______                                       By
