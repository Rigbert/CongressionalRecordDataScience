 President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that motion on the table.  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.  Mr. President, I commend first the occupant of the Chair for an extraordinarily effective debate on the issue that dominated today's discussion in the foreign operations appropriations bill. I think the Senator from Kansas did an outstanding job.  I also want to thank my staff. Robin Cleveland has done work on foreign policy matters for some 15 years now, and I thank Robin for, as usual, outstanding work; and Billy Piper, with whom I have worked 5 or 6 years, has done an absolutely superb job; and his assistant, Jon Meek, from my personal staff; as well as Jennifer Chartrand, a new member of the Subcommittee on Foreign Operations. All of those folks are on the majority side; and of course Tim Rieser and Cara Thanassi from the minority staff, with whom we always enjoy working, and Steve Cortese and Jay Kimmitt from the full committee.  I say to my friend, Pat Leahy, I enjoy our annual collaboration on this bill, and I look forward to working with the Senator in conference.
