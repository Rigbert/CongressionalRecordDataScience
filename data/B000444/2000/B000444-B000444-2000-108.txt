 President, in the best economic and budget times in our country's history, I believe that we should provide American families with tax relief. That is why I supported this bill when it passed the Senate earlier this week, and that is why I will vote for it again today.  But I vote today knowing that this bill will be vetoed by the President. Everyone here knows that. I hope that passage here today will lead to the kind of eventual compromise between the President and Congress--maybe a grand compromise that will include a prescription drug benefit under Medicare--that we can all support.  If that kind of compromise is not reached, Mr. President, I will vote to sustain that veto.  Since we voted just a few days go, the cost of this bill has gone up over $40 billion--that is the wrong direction. I still prefer an alternative that would cost less and that would be better targeted at the marriage penalty and at those families with the greatest need, one that would give families more flexibility to deal with their own circumstances.  Passage of this bill today is the beginning of the debate on this issue, Mr. President, not the end.
