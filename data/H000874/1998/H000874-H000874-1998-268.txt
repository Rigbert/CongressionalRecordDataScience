Speaker, last year House Republicans created a $7.9 million reserve fund for unanticipated committee expenses. They always anticipated, of course, spending the money. What they could not anticipate was which partisan witch-hunts they would use it for.  This cash stash is nothing but a slush fund for GOP priorities. Committees cook up schemes; if the Speaker approves, the Committee on House Oversight rubber stamps, and money flows. There is no floor debate, no vote, and no accountability. Millions have been disbursed this way, and Republicans are now scheming how to spend the $4 million left in the fund.  I have introduced legislation, Mr. Speaker, requiring a House vote on future payouts from the slush fund. If Republicans want to waste public money on partisan witch-hunts, they should have to debate and vote in public.  The majority loves to talk about accountability. Let us see if they can put the slush fund where their mouth is.                          ____________________
