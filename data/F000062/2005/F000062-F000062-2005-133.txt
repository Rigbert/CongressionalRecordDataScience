 President, I am pleased to have the opportunity to introduce a resolution to honor the contributions of Chinese art and culture and recognize the landmark Festival of China taking place this October at the John F. Kennedy Center for Performing Arts in Washington, DC.  I commend the joint efforts of the Kennedy Center and the Chinese Ministry of Culture in organizing this celebration and congratulate the hundreds of individuals who have contributed to its success.  With over 800 artists and 50 scheduled events, the Festival of China will truly be one of the largest celebrations of Chinese performance arts in American history.  Starting with Beijing Cultural Week, the Festival will feature Chinese dance, theater, and opera, and musical performances, along with film and art exhibitions.  I am also privileged to be joined today in offering this resolution by two of my colleagues, Senators Stevens and Murkowski, both of whom play significant roles in fostering our relationship with China.  Senator Stevens, as the Senate Pro Tempore, chairs the U.S.-China Interparliamentary Group, which facilitates annual exchanges between Members of the Senate and their counterparts in the Chinese National People's Congress.  A hero in both the United States and China, his long history with the Chinese people and their culture goes backto World War II, when as a pilot he flew missions in support of the Flying Tigers over the ``Hump'' between Burma and China. Because of his dedicated service to the people of China, he was later decorated with the Yuan Hai Medal by the Chinese government.  Since he first arrived in the Senate 36 years ago, Senator Stevens has worked tirelessly to improve the bilateral relationship between the United States and China, and promote exchanges and cooperation between the two sides.  While Senator Murkowski's tenure in the Senate may be shorter than that of her senior colleague from Alaska, she nevertheless is already playing a key part in shaping our relationship with China.  As the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs, she has the unique responsibility of overseeing our relationship with China and its many neighbors in the region.  My own relationship with China first started in 1979 when I had the chance to visit as the Mayor of San Francisco.  In 1980, I joined my counterpart, Mayor Wang Daohan, in signing an agreement to establish the first Sister City relationship of its kind between San Francisco and Shanghai.  Since that time, I have traveled regularly to China and had the opportunity to get to know many of its leaders.  I can tell you that, in my view, no nation on Earth has changed more positively in the past three decades than China.  That is why I consider it truly an honor to join with my colleagues in introducing this resolution to recognize the Festival of China.  I hope that during the month of October 2005 more Americans will have the chance to understand China and its unique contributions to art and culture during the past 5,000 years.                          ____________________
