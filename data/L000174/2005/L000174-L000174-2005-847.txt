President, I stand to voice my support for the amendment offered by my friend and colleague, Senator Durbin, which will protect our military servicemembers from attempts to penalize them by making it tougher for them to file for bankruptcy, even when the reason they lost all their income is because they answered the call of duty to serve America. I am proud to join my colleague as a cosponsor of this amendment.  We cannot have a thorough debate on bankruptcy reform without considering the economic hardships faced by servicemembers and their families. Calls to serve their country in Iraq, Afghanistan, or elsewhere can cause loss of family income, the closing of a family business, or unexpected expenses. Unfortunately, it is not uncommon for servicemembers and their families to be forced into filing for bankruptcy relief. We need to protect those who are fighting for us.  I support Senator Durbin's efforts to protect our soldiers, particularly young recruits and junior officers, from sales of inappropriate insurance and investment products on military bases. It is crucial that servicemen and women who sacrifice for their country not be exploited or taken advantage of through dishonest business practices. It is our duty to ensure that America's military personnel are offered first-rate financial products so they can provide for their families and invest in their futures.  I commend Senator Durbin for his leadership on this issue, and I urge my colleagues to accept his amendment so we can remedy the financial hardships faced by servicemembers who serve our nation and their families.                            Amendment No. 23
