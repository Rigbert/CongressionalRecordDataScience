 Having said that, as you know, I announced we have Friday scheduled as a day for us to do our business. Now if we were extraordinarily fortunate and got our business done by Thursday, or frankly could conclude it late Thursday night, perhaps we would be able to do that. But I do not anticipate that. I know as many Members on my side of the aisle, I want to assure the gentleman, have talked to me, as I am sure Members on your side of the aisle have talked to you about that, and if we can accommodate them, we will. But you heard the schedule. It is a pretty full schedule with a lot of substantive legislation. We have the intelligence authorization and other bills. It is my expectation that we will be in on Friday. But it is also my intent to make every effort to make Friday as short a day as we possibly can. As you know, our objective is no later than 2 p.m.; but if we could do earlier, 12:30, before 1, to accommodate Members and their flights, we certainly would like to do that. I would certainly welcome your help in accomplishing that objective.
