President, it is fitting that we in the Senate take note of the retirement of Ron Edmonds of the Associated Press, a veteran news photographer who has long and superbly documented public life in the Nation's Capital, including here on Capitol Hill.  If by chance we have not seen Ron himself over the years on the White House driveway or in the Senate's hearing rooms and hallways, we all surely recognize his work. His images, in the parlance of photographers, have bracketed the history of our era, from marches on Washington, to the attack on President Reagan's life--a photograph for which Ron Edmonds was awarded a Pulitzer Prize for spot news photography.  By now he has covered the White House for 28 years and captured the news in images of so many Presidents. He entered the world of photography in the day of celluloid film and concluded his career after having helped usher in the age of digital news photography.  I am grateful to have known Ron during his long career. I wish him and his family our congratulations and our best wishes.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record Ron Edmonds' farewell message to his AP associates.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                   Retirement Message of Ron Edmonds                               July 2009       After twenty-eight years of covering the White House for      the Associated Press, I have decided to retire and spend some      time with my family. I know you usually hear this excuse from      politicians who have just been caught with their hands in the      cookie jar or with a high-priced companion; but, in this      instance, spending time with my family is my true reason, ok      maybe a little fishing as well.       I have had one of the most fantastic jobs in the world. It      has allowed me to work with some of the greatest journalists      in the world and to make images of some of the biggest events      in the last thirty years. I hope that in some small way, I      have helped the Associated Press maintain its prominence as      the number-one news organization.       I will never forget the experiences that I have been      allowed to take part in: such as, walking through the      Forbidden City in China or walking around Red Square with      Ronald Reagan; ducking behind an inadequate rock in the      Iranian desert as Iraqi artillery shells exploded around us;      or, more pleasantly, drinking lemonade with King Hussein and      Queen Noor at their summer home in Aqaba, Jordan; and boating      down the Nile and strolling through the Valley of the Kings      in Egypt with then-Vice President Bush.       I have spent many sleepless nights mulling over this      decision. It is difficult to leave my many friends here and      around the world at the Associated Press. But I have great      hopes for a continued bright future for the AP. I leave with      no trepidation but rather with a heart full of confidence      that our younger generation of talented AP photographers,      such as Charles Dharapak among others, will fill the void      with a better and stronger report than ever before.       I have been lucky enough to win a couple of small awards      for my work. But perhaps one of the most rewarding still was      when my daughter Ashley came home from elementary school one      day and announced that she was so proud, because that day she      was able to raise her hand and tell the teacher that the      picture on the front of her Weekly Reader was taken by her      dad.       I will miss all of my friends, especially those editors on      the desk of the Washington bureau, who very rarely get the      credit they deserve for wading through my many images to put      me on the front pages of newspapers and web pages around the      world. It has always been a team effort in Washington.       Thanks to all of you for making me look good.           Regards,                                                  Ron Edmonds,                                  Senior White House Photographer,     Associated Press.                          ____________________
