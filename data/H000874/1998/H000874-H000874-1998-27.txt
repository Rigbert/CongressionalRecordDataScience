Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak about the motion that we will make, because there will be no time for debate when the motion to recommit is made.  As has been referenced earlier in this debate, there will be a motion to recommit. I regret that the gentlewoman from Connecticut is not on the floor, because the motion to recommit will be limited to one single issue, and it will be an issue that has enjoyed the majority support of the Members of this House, including approximately 51 Republicans, as well as 178 Democrats. It is a measure that has been supported in a bipartisan fashion, that is overwhelmingly supported in this Nation, and that is to commit to providing for women the family planning options of their choice that they can use most effectively.  Mr. Speaker, I would hope that every Member who voted for the Lowey amendment and who voted in opposition to the Smith amendment to undercut the Lowey amendment would vote for the motion to recommit, which will recommit the bill to conference, with instructions to add back the provision that passed this House.  Now, I want to make it clear that that position was the position shared by the chairman; shared by the ranking member, myself; shared by the chairman of the Senate conference committee; shared by the ranking member of the conference committee; supported by the Senate in a 5-to-2 vote by their conference.  Mr. Speaker, this should not be a controversial issue. I do not mean by that that there are not people who feel strongly in opposition to the suggestion of the full array of contraceptives being available to women. I understand that opposition. But it is to say that there is a clear majority in both Houses for this provision. One cannot say that about any other of these provisions. It is the only provision that fills that bill.  Furthermore, let me perhaps put a caveat to that.                              {time}  1930  The FEC measure may enjoy the majority support in both Houses, but Republicans only, so there is not bipartisan support for that. We make a distinction on that basis. Yes, we felt strongly about it.  I would hope that Members of this House, realizing that this is a good bill that should pass, and will pass in some form within the next 72 hours, I believe, I hope, and I will work towards that objective, but it is also a bill that could and should carry this provision, supported by the overwhelming majority of the Congress, the Senate, the House, and the conference committee.  Why should it pass? Because it is an important provision, as the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Lowey) and so many others have stated, to provide for full health services for women in America.  I would suggest to my friends that if the men of America felt as strongly about a provision, the chances of us dropping it would be zero. Let me repeat that. If the men of America felt as strongly about a provision, the chances of us dropping it would be zero.  I would hope that when we come to the floor, that we vote for the motion to recommit. I would then hope my chairman would take us into conference immediately, and because I know that the Senator from Colorado, the chairman of the Senate conference, and the ranking member, the gentleman from Wisconsin, support this provision, and I know the chairman supports this provision, and obviously I support this provision, that we report this bill back immediately, and I will agree to a unanimous consent request for a limited debate, 5 minutes a side, and that this bill would then pass.  I want to tell the chairman that I would strongly support the Haitian provision as well. I am not sure that will go. I have talked to the administration, and believe that will be a very significant issue in the omnibus bill. But I would hope that the motion to recommit would be approved by this House, and the will of this House would be carried out in this bill.
