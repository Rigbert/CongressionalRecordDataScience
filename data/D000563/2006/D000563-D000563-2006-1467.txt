President, I thank the chairman of the committee, Senator Gregg, as well as Senator Conrad, for yielding this time.  For the last 2 days, I have been asked by many of my colleagues in the Senate and I have received calls and e-mails from across the country about my hometown of Springfield, IL, which was hit by two tornados on Sunday evening. I wanted to take a few minutes to tell the Senate where things stand.  On behalf of the people of Springfield, IL, our State capital, Mr. Lincoln's hometown, we are grateful for the outpouring of support from all across the State and all across the region. We will get through this disaster together, and we will rebuild Mr. Lincoln's hometown. A series of photographs which I have here show homes and businesses blown apart by the tornados. Imagine this image multiplied by hundreds of times, and you have an idea what Springfield looks like.  This morning, I was on the phone early with Mayor Tim Davlin, who had gone through the area, visited some of the neighborhoods, and was speechless to describe what has happened to the homes of so many fine families in Springfield, IL.
