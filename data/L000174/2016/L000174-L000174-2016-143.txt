President, the Freedom of Information Act, our Nation's premier transparency law, is on the eve of its 50th anniversary, July 4, 2016. It is fitting that FOIA shares its birthday with our Republic itself. Our democracy is built upon the principle that a government of, by, and for the people cannot be one that is hidden from them. Today we recommit ourselves to this ideal by sending to the President the FOIA Improvement Act. This bill, which I coauthored with Senator Cornyn, ushers in the most significant reforms to FOIA since its enactment 50years ago. With the House's unanimous passage of our legislation today, we ensure FOIA will remain strong for another 50 years.  First and foremost, the FOIA Improvement Act codifies a ``presumption of openness,'' putting the force of law behind the notion that sunshine, not secrecy, is the default setting of our government. This is the same language President Obama laid out in his historic memorandum in 2009 and which now applies to government agencies. This policy was first put into place by President Bill Clinton, but then it was reversed by President George W. Bush. President Obama reinstated it as one of his first acts in office. However, self-imposed executive orders provide the executive branch overly-broad latitude in adhering to its letter and spirit. We must remember, the executive branch uniquely conducts much of its business behind closed doors, which is why we need strong legislation ensuring accountability and transparency. By codifying the ``presumption of openness,'' we ensure that all future administrations operate under the presumption that government information belongs in the hands of the people.  Furthermore, our bill provides the Office of Government Information Services--OGIS--an office Senator Cornyn and I created in the OPEN Government Act of 2007--additional authority to operate more independently and communicate freely with Congress how FOIA is operating and what improvements can be made. And to bring FOIA into the digital age, our bill creates a singular online portal through which the American public can submit FOIA requests and requires the proactive online disclosure of frequently requested records.  The reforms in our bill enjoy broad bipartisan support. The Senate has unanimously voted for our FOIA Improvement Act twice. Last Congress, the Democratically controlled Senate unanimously passed this bill, but Republican leaders in the House failed to bring it up. Senator Cornyn and I promptly reintroduced our legislation, which passed the Senate earlier this year, and finally, the House has followed suit. The legislative branch has now spoken in one voice, reaffirming its commitment to the American people's right to know what their government is doing. I urge President Obama to swiftly sign our bill into law in time for FOIA's 50th anniversary.  The FOIA Improvement Act is undoubtedly a legislative achievement worth celebrating. However, we must not rest on our laurels. Just as we are about to bring more sunshine into the halls of power with this new law, the National Defense Authorization Act, S. 2943, being considered by the Senate, threatens to cast a shadow over our efforts.  Without ever consulting the Senate Judiciary Committee, which has exclusive jurisdiction over FOIA, the Senate Armed Services Committee included provisions in the NDAA that directly undermine central pillars of FOIA. One particularly egregious provision is so broadly drafted that it could create a wholesale carveout of the Department of Defense from our Nation's transparency and accountability regime. If enacted into law, this could empower the Pentagon to withhold a nearly limitless amount of information from the American public. For example, the Pentagon could withhold the legal justifications for drone strikes against U.S. citizens, preventing the American people from knowing the legal basis upon which their government can employ lethal force against them. It could withhold from disclosure documents memorializing civilian killings by U.S. forces, depriving the American people of knowledge about the human cost of wars fought in their name. And if enacted, the Pentagon could withhold information about sexual assaults in the military, masking the true extent of sexual violence against soldiers who risk their lives defending our country. I will continue to oppose inclusion of this provision in the final NDAA.  Fifty years from now, on FOIA's centennial anniversary, the next generation will look back to this moment. They will gauge our commitment to creating a government that is open to its people. With today's passage of the bipartisan FOIA Improvement Act, we have chosen to let the sunshine in.                          ____________________
