Mr. Speaker, I rise this afternoon to express my solid support for language contained in H.R. 1530, the National Defense Authorization Act, providing for the extradition of indicted war criminals from the United States to the International Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda in the Hague. This legislation provides the legal basis for the surrender of such persons and closes a technical loophole which could undermine efforts to prosecute those responsible for the commission of war crimes. Adoption of this provision should serve as an example to other countries to undertake similar action consistent with our obligations to cooperate fully with the important work of the Tribunal. To date more than 50 individuals from the former Yugoslavia have been indicted, including the Bosnian Serb leaders Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic. Last November, I had an opportunity to meet with Chief Prosecutor Richard Goldstone to discuss his on-going investigations. He stressed that those responsible for war crimes must be held personally accountable, regardless of their relationship to peace negotiations.  As Chairman of the Helsinki Commission, I urge my colleagues to demonstrate their firm commitment to the pursuit of justice in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda by passing this implementing legislation and ensuring that the Tribunal receives the resources it needs to accomplish the vital tasks it has been given. Mr. Speaker, I ask that the text of a letter to the President on this matter be included in the Record.         Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe,                                 Washington, DC, February 8, 1995.     The President,     The White House, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. President: As members of the Commission on      Security and Cooperation in Europe, we have been following      with great      concern all aspects of the former Yugoslavia's violent disintegration.      In this regard, our Commission held a hearing on January 31,      at which we received compelling testimony from the Bosnian      Prime Minister, Haris Silajdzic. Although the Prime Minister      raised a number of issues regarding the crisis, we would like      to focus on one issue in particular: the International      Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia.       After overcoming considerable barriers to its establishment      and staffing, the Tribunal issued its first indictment in      early November, is proceeding with investigations and is      expected to bring cases to trial later this year. We      understand that the Tribunal's UN budget will be under review      during the second half of this month and that officials from      the Tribunal have requested a $28 million budget for the      coming year to proceed with the work they have begun.       Non-governmental experts have already suggested that this      figure may be too low given the costs of gathering testimony      from the thousands of victims of, and witnesses to, war      crimes and in light of the on-site investigations that the      effective prosecution of war criminals will require.      Nevertheless, it appears that securing even these funds may      be an uphill battle with the UN bureaucracy.       We urge you to instruct the U.S. delegation to the United      Nations to press vigorously at these upcoming budget meetings      to ensure adequate funding for the Tribunal. The      establishment of this body, in spite of considerable      political resistance and technical complications, is a credit      to strong U.S. leadership. But, without proper funding, the      Tribunal will never be able to execute the historic tasks      that have been set for it.       We also support an additional voluntary contribution to the      Tribunal by the United States of an amount not less than the      $3 million cash contribution provided last year. Monetary, as      well as personnel or other in-kind donations, enhance the      ability of the United States to foster the effectiveness of      the Tribunal by strengthening specific aspects of its work.      In addition, this would enable the United States to play a      leadership role in urging other UN member states to make      similar contributions. If the United States, at this      juncture, inexplicably reduces the level of financial support      it has provided to the Tribunal, it might send a regrettable      signal of weakening U.S. resolve to see war criminals held      truly accountable.       We would also like to take this opportunity to raise the      issue of implementing legislation. UN member states are      already bound as a matter of international law to deliver to      the Hague persons indicted by the Tribunal. But most      countries--including the United States--will require the      passage of implementing legislation to ensure that a national      legal basis exists for doing so; without such legislation, a      technical loophole would exist in most countries that would      give indicted persons the legal grounds to challenge      jurisdiction and avoid trial.       Convinced of the importance of this issue, a bipartisan      U.S. delegation to the 1994 CSCE Parliamentary Assembly      achieved agreement to review, at future meetings of the      Assembly, steps that the CSCE (now OSCE) participating States      have taken to ensure that they are able to comply with the      orders of the Tribunal. As Members of Congress, we feel a      special responsibility to ensure that the necessary      implementing legislation is passed. It is possible that some      countries--states likely to find themselves with war      criminals in their territories--will need international      prodding if they are to cooperate with the Tribunal. Passage      of U.S. implementing legislation will enable our country to      foster compliance by others.       We understand that the Department of Justice has been      working on draft implementing legislation for over a year. We      urge you to communicate to the Department of Justice the high      degree of urgency that you, as President, attach to the tasks      of bringing war criminals to justice and of taking concrete      legislative measures to that end. To follow up on the      Commission's inquiry of April 1994, we would like to know      when the administration anticipates presenting such      legislation to Congress.       Finally, we again call for the appointment of a CSCE (OSCE)      Special Reapporteur on the War Crimes, Tribunal, a Commission      proposal that was endorsed at the 1994 meeting of the CSCE      Parliamentary Assembly. A Special Rapporteur would be tasked      with monitoring the participating States' required      cooperation with the Tribunal and reporting back to the      decision-making bodies of the OSCE for further action in      cases of willful noncompliance.       We understand that the U.S. delegation to the 1994 CSCE      (OSCE) Budapest Conference included this proposal in a      package of ideas addressing the many urgent crises in the      former Yugoslavia but that, regrettably, this package was not      adopted. We urge the United States to pursue the adoption of      this proposal as a priority matter at the on-going OSCE      meetings in Vienna, where negotiations on Bosnia-related      questions continue.       Mr. President, we cannot sufficiently underscore our      conviction that holding war criminals accountable for the      heinous crimes they have committed in this conflict will be      an essential element for any long-term resolution of this      tragedy. To this end, we look forward to hearing from you on      these matters.           Sincerely,     Christopher H. Smith,                                                         Chairman.     Alfonse D'Amato,                                                      Co-Chairman.     Steny H. Hoyer,     Member of Congress.                          ____________________
