President, I rise today to honor the career of LTC Erin M. McCarter. She has served her country in the Air Force for more than 20 years and will be retiring in June.  Colonel McCarter grew up in Moline, IL, and was commissioned as an officer in the Air Force after earning a bachelor''s degree from the University of Iowa in 1982. She has served in various logistics assignments during her time in the Air Force. She was the officer accountable for nuclear munitions at Ellsworth AFB, SD; she served as wing supply and headquarters staff officer at Spangdahlem and Ramstein Air Bases in Germany and Shaw AFB, SC. In addition, she served as Chief of the Pacific Air Force's weapon system support at Hickam AFB, HI. From 1996-1997, Colonel McCarter commanded the 8th Supply Squadron at Kunsan Air Base, Republic of South Korea. She also served as Congressional Liaison to Capitol Hill. Colonel McCarter assumed her duties managing foreign military sales to the Royal Saudi Air Force in September 1999.  Colonel McCarter plans to return to her home State of Illinois upon her retirement. I know my fellow Senators will join me in thanking LTC Erin McCarter for her distinguished service to her country and wish her well in her future endeavors.                          ____________________
