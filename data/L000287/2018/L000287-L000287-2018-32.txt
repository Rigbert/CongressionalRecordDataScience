Mr. Speaker. I rise in strong support of H.R. 5437.  This bill addresses one of the most popular issues raised during our Subcommittee's comment period.  H.R. 5437 is very simple. It would require the Treasury Secretary to establish a program that would issue identity protection personal identification numbers (IP PINs) to taxpayers.  An IP PIN helps prevent tax-related identity theft and tax refund fraud. The IRS currently makes IP PINs available to a limited group of taxpayers. If an IP PIN is not included for this group, the IRS system will automatically reject an electronically filed tax return. It is an additional layer of protection for these taxpayers.  H.R. 5437 would expand this program. This bipartisan bill would require the IRS to make an IP PIN available to any and all taxpayers. It does not matter where they live or work; every taxpayer will be able to request an IP PIN.  I would like to thank our colleagues--the Gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Paulsen) and the Gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. DelBene) for their good work and support of this bill.  Mr. Speaker, I urge all of our colleagues to support H.R. 5437.
