 For almost a decade I have been engaged in FBI oversight and during that time I have seen numerous scandals and coverups. While Director Mueller is working to address these problems, Congress also has a role to play in the overhaul of the FBI. The FBI reform bill is designed to address the accountability problems that have plagued the FBI for years. The bill expands the Department of Justice Inspector General's jurisdiction, protects FBI whistleblowers, creates an FBI Security Career program and a Counterintelligence Polygraph program, enhances the FBI police force, and mandates various reports by the Attorney General.  I have advocated some of these measures, particularly those dealing with protecting whistleblowers and expanding the jurisdiction of the DOJ Inspector General's Office to include the FBI. Let me provide some more detail about the most important provisions in the bill.  In the past the FBI's own internal Office of Professional Responsibility was tasked with the sole authority to investigate the misconduct of FBI personnel. Clearly this constitutes a conflict of interest. In fact, no other area of the Department of Justice maintains this type of accountability system.  Last summer, Attorney General Ashcroft issued an order which changed that situation by expanding the jurisdiction of the Department of Justice Office of Inspector General to encompass both the FBI and the DEA. Specifically, the order gave the DOJ Inspector General primary jurisdiction over allegations of misconduct against employees of the FBI and DEA. Previously, the Inspector General could not initiate an investigation within the FBI or the DEA, without receiving permission from the Deputy Attorney General. I commended Attorney General Ashcroft's order because I had been saying for many years that the FBI should not be allowed to policeitself. I was encouraged that the establishment of a free and independent oversight entity would have a beneficial impact on the FBI's management culture.  The bill codifies the Attorney General's order making it a permanent fixture in the plan to reform the FBI. Specifically, the bill provides statutory authority for the DOJ Office of Inspector General to investigate all allegations of criminal and administrative misconduct by DOJ employees, including those in the FBI and the DEA. However, it does not abolish the FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility, OPR, but rather gives the DOJ Inspector General discretion to refer certain investigations to the FBI OPR. Because the FBI OPR is particularly good at investigating certain types of low level offenses, it is good that the Inspector General will have this discretion.  The bill also contains much needed protections for FBI whistleblowers. As many of you know, I believe that good government requires that the brave men and women who blow the whistle on wrongdoing be protected. I have been an active champion of the rights of federal whistleblowers since 1983. This is because of my strong belief that disclosures of wrongdoing by whistleblowers are an integral part of our system of checks and balances. Whistleblowers ensure that waste, fraud, and abuse are brought to light. Whistleblowers play a critical role in ensuring that public health and safety problems are exposed.  I truly believe that reform at the FBI will only occur when FBI employees feel free to blow the whistle on wrongdoing. Since the FBI was excluded from the Whistleblower Protection Act I have been concerned about the retaliation that is often perpetrated against whistleblowers at the FBI, such as Dr. Fred Whitehurst, who speak out about abuses and problems with the system.  So, the bill gives FBI whistleblowers the same rights and protections that other Federal employees currently possess. When FBI employees are retaliated against for blowing the whistle, they can avail themselves of all the protections afforded them by the Whistleblower Protection Act.  Since the FBI has made the fight against terrorism its top priority, many would be FBI whistleblowers may blow the whistle on wrongdoing that involves national security issues. Because of the need to keep that information secure, the bill directs the Attorney General to formulate regulations to provide specific protections for these employees consistent with the relevant portions of the WPA and the Administrative Procedures Act.  Our FBI reform bill addresses several other issues that contribute to the FBI's culture of arrogance. I have believed for a long time that one of the biggest contributors to this culture is the cumbersome and unwieldy jurisdiction of the FBI. The Bureau currently investigates over 300 different federal offenses, which are divided between violent crime, white collar crime, organized crime, drugs, national security, and civil rights. Contained within these areas are numerous instances of concurrent or overlapping jurisdiction with other Federal law enforcement agencies.  Despite having what many would describe as an already overburdened array of jurisdiction, the FBI has established a campaign of jurisdictional encroachment. This ``Pacman'' philosophy of the Bureau's past has only served to feed the culture of arrogance. I pointed this problem out to the DOJ and was pleased to hear of the Attorney General and the FBI Director's intention to put a stop to that ``Pacman'' mentality and limit the FBI's investigatory scope.  But, this will be a complex issue. Just as Congress has been complicit in the FBI's expansion, we will need to be involved in the divestiture. The Department of Justice's Strategic Plan states that the FBI will focus on building and maintaining its utmost capacity to detect, deter, counter, and prevent terrorist activity. The plan also encourages the FBI to promote and, when available, use new legislation and authorities to conduct investigations of terrorist incidents.  It is ironic that in light of this, the FBI continues to view many violations that it has traditionally investigated as being of strategic importance. Why are environmental crimes, health care fraud, bank robbery, telemarketing and financial institution fraud, computer intrusions, intellectual property crimes, and credit card fraud still viewed by the FBI as of strategic importance? I understand that terrorism investigations could potentially involve any one, or a number, of the above violations, but there are many other Federal regulatory and investigative agencies that have established historic expertise in these same program areas.  In its reorganization, the FBI needs to scale back on some of its law enforcement activities which are duplicated by other Federal and state agencies. The Bureau needs to completely jettison some of these areas, but in other areas the Bureau could simply take a secondary role, allowing another agency to take the lead. It is my hope that by scaling back on certain FBI investigative activities, the FBI will send a positive signal in dealing with its counterparts in state, local, and federal government.  To assist in cutting back on the FBI's jurisdiction, the bill directs the Attorney General to report to Congress on the legal authority for FBI programs and activities, identifying those that have express statutory authority and those that don't. The bill also requires the Attorney General to recommend what criminal statutes he believes the FBI should have investigative responsibility for. This report will help Congress, as we continue to address the FBI's culture of arrogance.  Another issue that contributes to the FBI's culture of arrogance is the collection, use, and reporting of crime statistics. It is often the case in Federal law enforcement that several agencies will claim credit for a single arrest. This double and triple counting of arrests leads to an inflation of statistics that often misrepresents the actual work load of the various agencies. This is a problem because these statistics are used by federal law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, to justify increases in their funding.  To get a handle on the exact nature and extent of this problem, our bill directs the GAO to conduct a review of how crime and investigation statistics are reported and used by Federal law enforcement agencies. This report will assist us in future legislation on this issue.  There are many more reforms contained in our FBI reform bill, but there is just one more that I want to focus on today. This reform is a change in the way employees of the Senior Executive Service are punished.  Last summer, four exceptional and courageous FBI agents alerted the Judiciary Committee to the fact that there exists a gross inequality in the way Senior Executive Service (SES) employees of the FBI and rank and file agents are disciplined. SES employees are given a slap on the wrist for their infractions, while the rank and file agents are often punished to the letter of the law. This issue was further exposed by a GAO report on the investigation of the Larry Potts Retirement Dinner scandal. That report reemphasized what had been reveled in the FBI Law Enforcement Ethics Unit's position paper, ``FBI SES Accountability, a Higher Standard or a Double Standard.'' These two reports document the existence of a double standard.  I was glad to see that former Director Freeh abolished the SES Review Board, but I'm not sure it was a sufficient change for a culture that has historically treated SES employees with kid gloves.  So our FBI Reform bill attempts to address this problem by providing some flexibility in how SES employees can be punished. The Senate Judiciary Committee has heard repeatedly that this inflexibility is one of the main causes for the inequality in punishment at the FBI. Currently, the minimum suspension that SES employees can receive is 14 days, to the Bureau's management is often left with the choice of an overly harsh penalty or no penalty at all--so often they decide not to impose any meaningful disciplinary action.  Specifically, our bill would lift the 14-day minimum suspension for SES disciplinary cases to provide for additional options in disciplining senior executive employees. Hopefully, this change will help to remedy this double standard.  In conclusion, I urge my colleagues to support this bill to foster reform in the FBI. The Bureau is crucial in the war on terrorism. Let's fix the problems we have helped to create, so that the FBI can again be he best at what it does.                                 ______                                       By
