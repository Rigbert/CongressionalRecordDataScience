Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time.  Again, we could move forward with the liability exemptions absent this language, and the gentleman says that that would then mean that there would be a more dangerous situation prevailing, or is he perhaps saying we would not do the liability at all? Is that what he is saying, we would do nothing? Why not just move forward the liabilities, absent these provisions and these exclusions in the current legislation?
