  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, the President and the Vice President are saying, if only they could get a secret vote on fast track it would pass by a 3-to-1 margin. It is only the power of big labor that is holding Democrats back.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Fast track is still in play only because of the extraordinary pressure from the President and the Vice President, the promises of projects, fund-raisers and fantasies, the arm-twisting of the Republican leaders and the lobby of the dozens of corporate CEO's who jetted into town this week in their private jets with their pockets stuffed with cash. A vote on fast track is a referendum on a failed U.S. trade policy, a policy that exports our jobs, drives down wages and destroys the environment.  The President says it is about a bridge to the 21st century. I have seen that bridge from the colonias in Mexico at the American border, a bridge across sewage and toxic waste canals, from pallet shacks to state-of-the-art, U.S.-owned manufacturing plants where people are paid 80 cents an hour. That is a bridge the American worker should not be forced to cross. Say ``no'' to fast track.                          ____________________
