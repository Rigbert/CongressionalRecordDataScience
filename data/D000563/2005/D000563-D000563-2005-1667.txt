(a) Findings.--Congress finds that--       (1) cruise vessels carry millions of passengers each year,      and in 2001, carried 8,400,000 passengers in North America;       (2) cruise vessels carry passengers to and through the most      beautiful ocean areas in the United States and provide many      people in the United States ample opportunities to relax and      learn about oceans and marine ecosystems;       (3) ocean pollution threatens the beautiful and inspiring      oceans and marine wildlife     that many cruise vessels intend to present to travelers;       (4) cruise vessels generate tremendous quantities of      pollution, including--       (A) sewage (including sewage sludge);       (B) graywater from showers, sinks, laundries, baths, and      galleys;       (C) oily water;       (D) toxic chemicals from photo processing, dry cleaning,      and paints;       (E) ballast water;       (F) solid wastes; and       (G) emissions of air pollutants;       (5) some of the pollution generated by cruise ships,      particularly sewage discharge, can lead to high levels of      nutrients that are known to harm and kill coral reefs and      which can increase the quantity of pathogens in the water and      heighten the susceptibility of many coral species to scarring      and disease;       (6) laws in effect as of the date of enactment of this Act      do not provide adequate controls, monitoring, or enforcement      of certain discharges from cruise vessels into the waters of      the United States; and       (7) to protect coastal and ocean areas of the United States      from pollution generated by cruise vessels, new Federal      legislation is needed to reduce and better regulate      discharges from cruise vessels, and to improve monitoring,      reporting, and enforcement of discharges.       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--       (1) to prevent the discharge of any untreated sewage or      graywater from a cruise vessel entering ports of the United      States into the waters of the United States;       (2) to prevent the discharge of any treated sewage, sewage      sludge, graywater, or bilge water from cruise vessels      entering ports of the United States into the territorial sea;       (3) to establish new national effluent limits and      management standards for the discharge of treated sewage or      graywater from cruise vessels entering ports of the United      States into the exclusive economic zone of the United States      in any case in which the discharge is not within an area in      which discharges are prohibited; and       (4) to ensure that cruise vessels entering ports of the      United States comply with all applicable environmental laws.
