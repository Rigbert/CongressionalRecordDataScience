 President, I am offering the youth summer jobs amendment to build on the extremely successful summer jobs program that made it possible for over 313,000 young people to have a job. I have personally heard amazing stories from these young men and women who got a job. It changed their lives and gave them the experience they needed.  This amendment will provide $1.3 billion to create up to 500,000 temporary jobs this coming summer. It will invest in critical employment and learning programs that will help not only these young people but the businesses that hire them. The underlying bill is going to help millions of families across the country who need a job. This amendment will make sure young people get a start in their professional lives, firmly planted on their feet and moving toward success.  I yield the floor.
