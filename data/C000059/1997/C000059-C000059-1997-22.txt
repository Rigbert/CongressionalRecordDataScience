Chairman, I rise in support of the Quincy Library Group and the manager's amendment. The Quincy Library Group was not created in a vacuum. The national urban environmental organizations have been involved and aware of the Quincy Library Group since its inception in 1993.  National urban organizations have also been involved and endorsed at one time or another each element of the Quincy Library proposal. For example, the 5-year pilot program which is established by this legislation calls for an annual range of between 40,000 and 60,000 acres to be treated with strategic fuel breaks. This acreage was proposed directly by the national urban organizations.  The Quincy Library proposal is a positive bill that is good for the forest, good for the people, good for the environment, and receives a wide range ofsupport. Therefore, I ask Members for their support in passage of H.R. 858 and the manager's amendment.
