 President, I rise today to convey my strong support for the $3,000,000 this bill contains for land acquisition at Lake Tahoe. This funding is crucial if we are to control the erosion problem that is robbing Lake Tahoe of its striking water clarity.  Lake Tahoe is the crown jewel of the Sierra Nevada. The clarity of its blue waters, and the beauty of its surrounding forests and high mountains, inspired Mark Twain to call it ``the fairest view the whole earth affords.''  Mark Twain would still recognize the Lake Tahoe Basin today, but it is no longer a pristine wilderness surrounding a perfectly clear lake. Today Lake Tahoe is a year-round recreational mecca, drawing millions annually to its ski slopes, hiking trails, and crystal clear waters. Lake Tahoe is a major economic force in both California and Nevada, contributing $1.6 billion annually to the economy from tourism alone.  The environment and the economy are inextricably linked at Lake Tahoe. The famous azure lake and its surrounding pristine forests are the primary reasons that people visit the region. Protecting environmental quality at Lake Tahoe is key to preserving the economy of the Sierra region.  Scientists agree that the Lake is in the midst of an environmental crisis. Lake Tahoe is one of the largest, deepest, and clearest lakes in the world, but that remarkable clarity is disappearing at the rate of over a foot a year.  In the 1960s, you could drop a white plate into Lake Tahoe and watch it fall 105 feet before it disappeared. Now you can watch the same plate fall only 70 feet. As the Lake's water clarity decreases, algae is taking over. In 10 years, the effects could be irreversible.  Why the troubling decline? The answers are quite simple: air pollution and erosion. Algae is fed by nitrogen, a key component in car exhaust, and phosphorous, a key component of run-off that flows into Lake Tahoe from streams, paved roads, old logging roads, golf courses, and even private homes.  Lake Tahoe was once ringed by wetlands that filtered out most of this harmful sediment and debris. But most of the wetlands have been filled in to provide more lakefront property. The lake's clarity continues to deteriorate.  For nearly 20 years, the Forest Service has been slowing this deterioration by acquiring environmentally sensitive land at Lake Tahoe--land especially prone to the erosion that is slowly strangling the Lake--and protecting it from development. Since 1980, the Forest Service has purchased 11,000 acres at Lake Tahoe. This acquisition program has the wholehearted support of Lake Tahoe's elected officials, as well as both environmental and business groups.  The $3 million for land acquisition contained in this bill will help buy parcels like the Wells property, an 18.5 acre site adjacent to a County park that includes some of the few remaining wetlands surrounding Lake Tahoe, as well as a stretch of Burke Creek that provides a vital wildlife corridor. If the Forest Service is not able to buy this property, it may end up being developed into 50 condominium units.  Land acquisition funds may also be used for a phased-in purchase of High Meadows, a 2300-acre parcel that remains the largest private inholding in the Lake Tahoe Basin. The meadows include the headwaters for Cold Creek, one of Lake Tahoe's most sensitive watersheds. Protecting the property could dramatically reduce the amount of sediment and debris that flows currently flow into Lake Tahoe from Cold Creek.  I commend the Committee for including these land acquisition funds for Lake Tahoe in this bill. I am disappointed that the House did not include any funds in its version of the bill. I intend to urge the Senate conferees on this legislation to protect the full $3 million in conference.  Unfortunately, this $3 million barely scratches the surface of what is needed to restore the environment at Lake Tahoe. The region's environmental problems extend well beyond its famous azure lake.  Insect infestations have killed over 25 percent of the trees in the forests surrounding Lake Tahoe, creating a severe risk of catastrophic wildfire that could destroy communities and have a devastating impact on water quality at the Lake. The millions of cars that visit the Lake Tahoe Basin each year worsen erosion problems from roads and produce nitrogen that ends up feeding algae in the Lake.  The Federally-chartered Tahoe Regional Planning Agency estimates that preserving the Lake's water quality, restoring its fragile forest ecosystem, and establishing a public transportation system that would reduce air pollution and road run-off could cost $900 million in Federal, State, local, and private funds.  The Federal government, through the United States Forest Service, owns nearly 80 percent of the land in the Lake Tahoe Basin. Therefore, we have a unique responsibility for protecting Lake Tahoe. Two important Federal reports that are currently pending will help determine what steps the Forest Service must take to stop the environmental decline at the Lake.  One report is the Watershed Assessment, a study being conducted by an independent team of scientists, that will create a model of Lake Tahoe's ecosystem to help us determine the impact of proposed environmental restoration projects. Lake Tahoe is so fragile that we need to be sure prescribed burning to reduce the risk ofcatastrophic fire at one end of the lake does not cause too much erosion or air pollution in another part of the Lake. The Watershed Assessment will provide the Forest Service with the tools to make those tough judgment calls.  The other Federal effort underway is an interagency review of the Environmental Improvement Program, a list of more than 500 environmental improvement projects that the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency proposes to implement at Lake Tahoe. The Environmental Improvement Program has the full support of Lake Tahoe's local governments, business leaders, and environmental groups. Now the Federal government is assessing which of the environmental projects on this list should have high priority for Federal funding, and whether new programs are needed to provide that funding.  I plan to act upon the results of these studies as soon as they are complete in December 1998. I am hoping to offer legislation in the next session that would authorize a new Federal initiative, led by the U.S. Forest Service, to address Lake Tahoe's erosion and forest health problems. I am working with a bi-partisan group of Tahoe's business, environmental, and community leaders to develop a proposal, and I hope that the Forest Service will become an active player in the process as well.  In 1997, President Clinton and Vice President Gore visited Lake Tahoe. I attended the Forum they sponsored, as did Senators Boxer, Reid and Bryan. We applauded the President as he announced an ambitious Tahoe initiative that included $50 million over two years for land acquisition, prescribed burning, watershed restoration, public transportation, upgrades to wastewater pipelines, erosion control, and scientific research at the Lake.  Unfortunately, since then, Lake Tahoe seems to have dropped off the Administration's radar screen. The Administration never even fulfilled the $50 million in commitments the President made at Tahoe, let alone extend those commitments to fiscal year 1999.  In his 1999 budget request, President Clinton did not make any specific requests for Tahoe, and the Forest Service will be lucky if they receive $5 million from the Administration next year for forest health and erosion control projects.  Forest Service officials at Lake Tahoe are doing a heroic job of reducing fire risk in the forest while simultaneously protecting Lake Tahoe's water quality. They need more resources if they are going to reverse declining environmental quality at the Lake and its surrounding forests.  Time is running out for Lake Tahoe. If we do not act quickly with a full commitment of Federal resources, the crown jewel of the Sierra could become permanently tarnished. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to join me in preserving this national treasure for generations to come. Let's look at this $3 million for land acquisition as a down payment, not the last word.                          ____________________
